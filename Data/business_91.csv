For starters it's not in the best part of town. I wouldn't recommend walking around outside here in the evening.

The prices were decent and the shops that are on on the R floor were interesting. The maids of the hotel were quick to clean your room if asked.

Ok so let me run down the list of things that warrants the negative rating here: 1. Upon check-in, the girl who checked us in was rude. She asked if we wanted a smoking or non-smoking room and we requested a non-smoking room. She never asked if anyone was handicap either (my husband had spinal surgery so he's considered handicap). We get in the room and it smells like cigarette smoke and the towels also reeked of smoke meaning the towels weren't changed or clean for that matter. The tour of the rooms on the Internet are NOTHING like what we walked into. I was quite shocked to be honest. So we went down to registration to talk to the same rude ass chick and she changed our room. Again, she didn't ask if anyone was handicap but I told her I needed something handicap friendly and what does she do?! Put us in a room that WASN'T handicap friendly. My husband is very anal about hotel cleanliness so he checked the sheets and pillows when we got in. Two of the five pillows were stained so we asked housekeeping to bring us two clean pillows. Upon return that night, we were still two pillows shy. 2. The buffet was down right atrocious! The French toast tasted like it was the frozen crap that was microwaved too long so it was like chewing a piece of leather. The dessert was equally awful; bland, not sweet, and the soda was flat and the water tasted like tap water. 3. Top of the world restaurant..good gracious. The chick who checked us in at the bottom was a snot. We had an hour and a half to eat and somehow didn't eat! We got to the top and were seated quickly but our server seemed to be pre-occupied in serving other tables that came after us. She continued to walk by our table and say ""I'll be right back"". We managed to get a half a glass of wine that tasted like it was straight vodka and a $9 bottle of damn water. Everytime she walked by (about 5 times total) I tried to put in my order and she just kept saying she would be back. Now I really hate to pull the race card because I would like to think that the times have changed and people embrace diversity, but I'm doin it for this one. I also noticed the Asian family seated nearby was starting to get the same treatment. After waiting an hour for our waitress to attempt to take our order, we had to leave for a show in 30 minutes. She said she could have us out in 30 minutes but I wanted to enjoy my food and not inhale it, after all, we were going to drop a substantial amount of money there, I just wanted to enjoy it and our waitress killed it. Needless to say, we spent half of our honeymoon at the stratosphere trying to work out problems that shouldn't be there. I will never come back here.

We checked in around 9p, decided to spring for the ""upgraded"" room so we could be away from the construction (the term upgraded is a joke) and once we got to the room I was highly disappointed! Immediately the smell of smoke hits my nostrils (non-smoking room), the bathtub was disgusting and looked like it hadn't been cleaned since it had been installed, the contertops dirty, there were dust bunnies stuck to the wall behind the entryway door, there were white stains on the carpet everywhere! When we called down to the front desk the agent says ""We aren't allowing anymore room changes tonight""! Oh yeah?! I then stated I would like an immediate checkout and a complete refund, somehow all of a sudden they can accommodate a room change.

I called the front desk and asked for late check out given that I checked in late into the evening.  The response was there would be a $10 fee for a 12:00 PM check out and a $20 fee for a 1 PM check out that would have to be paid at the front desk.  I paid less than that for the room.  The staff basically won't work with the guests!  You're treated like a 3rd world citizen at this hotel.  I could not even get a live person on the hotel room phone it took about 5 tries.

Can't really complain about staying at the Stratosphere. Our 3-night accommodation was free and we were able to ascend to the Tower at a discounted rate. Our room was basic because they roomed us in the Tour Rooms section. Diamond Resorts InternationalÂ®, who sells vacation ownerships, uses the Stratosphere to house their guests while booked for a 2-hr presentation appointment at the Polo Towers.

During our stay here we were able to go up to the Tower and view the city by day and night from the Observation Deck, which is Level 108, 855 feet above the Strip. It has both an indoor and outdoor decks. The air-conditioned indoor deck allows viewing of the city from behind their angled window. We enjoyed a cocktail at AirBar, the highest bar in Las Vegas. We also purchased unlimited all-day pass for the Thrill Rides for a discount of $36 for me and my hubby and rode all three of the rides beginning at Level 109, almost 1000 feet up the ground. We experienced all three: Insanity, XScream, and Big Shot. One can also experience the SkyJump from here for $200 a jump, which we didn't do. The entrance to the Tower is located on the Second level, next to the Theater. The 360-degree panoramic view of Las Vegas from the Observation Deck was awe-inspiring especially at night (separate review of the Thrill Rides http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/stratosphere-thrills-las-vegas hrid=1LCyL9GLA83brlNkybTkLQ&utm_source=oshare )

The staff here were friendly from the Registration and Concierge to the Ticketing Booth to the employees working the elevators of the Tower. We did not watch any of their shows, though, MJ Live (Michael Jackson Tribute Concert), Pin-Up, and L.A. Comedy Club. 

The nice thing about staying at the Stratosphere is wherever we went somewhere away from the Strip we always knew where our landmark was because The Tower is the tallest free-standing observation tower in Vegas... only thing is it is located in the not-so-nice part of the Strip. Overall, not a bad experience for free accommodation. Btw, the Stratosphere has gained a reputation as one of the most haunted casino hotels in Las Vegas.

The hotel rooms are cheap, but the place is so far from everything else to do on the strip I think they have to be cheap to attract any customers at all. The concept of the rides on the top of the tower is cool, but if you go up on a windy or cold day it really is not very fun. The tickets to ride things are pretty overpriced like everything else in Las Vegas. I didn't brave the food at any of the restaurants while I was there. The shops don't have traditional stores, I'd say they are best for finding cheapo souvenirs to take home but that's about it. I don't think this place has put money into marketing or decor since they opened in the 90s. Walking around this hotel gives me horrible late 80s early 90s flash backs. Everything was clean though, I'll give the place that. You'll not only pay a pretty penny for the view but you'll spend a good portion of your day in line. IMHO it isn't worth the trouble...",0,0,1

I thought I was gonna have to call 911 bc I thought he was gonna croak on us at the table. the location is at the very end of the strip. I wouldn't recomment walking to strip at night from there although I have done it myself only bc I lost my 401k playing blackjack at Caesars and didn't have enough for a taxi back.

However, during our time on the observation floor, we got to witness a brave lady throw herself off of the tower (Skyjump controlled free fall; it's $109.99 per jump), after which we did not see her again....I'm sure she's fine....we also got to see the other rides in motion and hear screams of delight, I think...!

The top of the tower view is great and there's a restaurant that slowly rotates so you can view the whole city.  I didn't go on any of the rides ( no death wish yet) but they look really cool.  Maybe next time I will do the bungee jump.

We have friends visiting from the UK so last Wednesday we thought it would be fun to go to this property and head up to the Level 107 Lounge to watch the sun set over the desert.  I turned our car over to the valet and we headed up to the lounge.  And wanting to be fair, we had a great time up there.  our server, Irene, was amazing and the view was indeed spectacular.  

After enjoying ourselves for a few hours, we headed back down to collect our car.  After handing our claim check to the attendant, we waited only a few minutes before he returned, but our car was nowhere in sight.  He approached me and told me there was a problem with the rubber strip on the bottom of the front bumper and it was coming off.  I asked to see my car and he led me to an area  around the corner with no lighting where he had parked it after retrieving from the valet lot.  It was dark and difficult to see, but he was correct, the strip on the right side of the bumper was loose and laying on the ground.  I asked what they were going to do about it (it was not damaged when I delivered it into their care, although they would later claim it was).  He said security would have to be called and a report made and asked if I wanted to do that.  I said of course and so I waited for security... and waited.  

When he finally rolled up on his bicycle, I was treated rudely.  He asked me to fill out a form with a statement as to what had happened.  In the meantime, he took photos of my car (I had already taken mine while I waited for him to arrive).  I handed him my signed statement and then asked if when I would be contacted.  He said I could call Risk Management (which is Straro-speak for, ""We are going to screw you"") tomorrow morning after 8:00 AM but could or would not provide me with a name or a phone number to call.  Not to worry, I speak Google.  

I called Risk Management to following morning well after 8:00 AM giving them plenty of time to review the report I made as well as a report security made and was connected to a young man named Mike who said he didn't refuse to give me his last name but wouldn't in spite of multiple requests for him to do so.  He informed me the hotel was denying the claim because the damage preexisted when I dropped the car off to them.  That's interesting because the valet asked my spouse while I was with security if the car was damaged before and they were told in no uncertain terms that it was not.  Mike also was rude and condescending much like the security  person the previous night.  I think this must be a corporate core value.  

Here's the funny part (at least to me).  The damage is minor and will cost less than $150 to repair, and only that much because the strip that needs replacing is a dealer part.  So they seem intent on chasing away my business and that of my friends who come to visit.  It's really okay with me.  Any business that refuses a $150 claim at the expense of chasing off $800-$1000 worth of business from me and my friends annually deserves exactly what they get.  The High Roller at the Linq will replace the spectacular views.",7,5,0

The free valet parking was awesome.  They were always very quick and friendly.  Check in process went very smooth and the front desk attendant was friendly and welcoming.  When we arrived to our room, we were greeted with an incredible view of the strip from the 20th floor.  I liked the layout and size of the room as well.  The temperature...not so much.  It was 78 degrees and the thermostat had a service icon and wouldn't work.  Maintenance fixed it quickly..but it continued to do this every day of our stay.  

The room was pretty dirty.  There were remnants of goldfish crackers near the table and chairs on the carpet and they remained there the duration of our stay.  There was a candy bar wrapper behind the dresser (found it looking for an outlet).  There were stains on the duvet cover for the bed.  The bathroom was quite unpleasant.  It was outdated, dingy, and grimy.  The showerhead had limescale and calcium deposits on it.  The caulking for the sink was dirty and discolored, and the sink spigot was rusted and gross.

C Bar was decent.  They have all you can drink beer, margaritas, and cosmos for $20 for play card members from 6-10pm on certain nights, heck yes!  Bartenders were great, we enjoyed our time there.  

The central elevators are amazingly fast!  Getting to your high floor room quickly is not a problem.

Dining options on the resort property were below par.  We tried El Nopal, Roxy's Diner, and the buffet.  The diner was the standout.

No safes in the guest rooms!  This was bizarre to me...it's Vegas..everyone is carrying a ton of cash.  We didn't feel comfortable leaving cash in the room nor walking around with it.  It was a catch 22.

This place is too far from the best part of the strip.  It was a four mile walk one way (through a sketch area) just to begin reaching the legendary casinos.  I felt like I missed out on a lot of Vegas fun due to how far away the Stratosphere was from everything else.

It seems like not much has changed at Stratosphere since 1996....decor, rooms, etc.  It just wasn't our style unfortunately.",12,0,2

First of all, prepare to be accosted by time share sharks every time you pass by the lobby.  Second, when we checked in, they offered us a room upgrade for $15 a night per room for two rooms.  They promised mountain views on the 23rd floor, but what they actually gave us were rooms on the 16th floor with a view of the parking lot. We were too exhausted to protest, but we should have just gone back to a standard room and saved $30 a night.  Then, even though we were told on Booking that we would have free access to the tower as hotel guests, the hotel had just changed this policy to make hotel guests pay to go up.  This one we did argue, and they gave us passes.  Next, we were told when we signed up for players cards that we would get 20 percent discounts in the tower bar by flashing our cards, but when we ordered our two drinks (at $15 a pop), we were told that wasn't true.  We ended up going back to the room and getting the paperwork and showing them the deal.  They ended up honoring that deal, too.  Then, we earned enough points for two free buffets, and we had two 25% off coupons for two more.  But when we got to the buffet, they were not going to honor the coupons because they said our kids are between the ages of 12 and 21, so they don't count.  Ugh.  So we tried to give the coupons to the people behind us, but the lady said, ""Fine, then I'll just give it to you"" as though she were doing us a favor. 

Other than the rip-off factor, there were plenty of other annoyances.  Even though they have a pool, the one that allows teenagers closes at 7 p.m., so we never got to use it.  The night concierge was not at all helpful or friendly.  The signage for self-parking is terrible.  There are no water fountains anywhere on the casino floor, and when I asked a manager about it, she rudely dismissed me by telling me to order from a waitress.  We played for a couple of hours and literally never saw a single waitress.  Finally, we always try to hang up our towels to save water in the desert.  The sign in the room said that if we hung our towels, the maids wouldn't wash them.  We stayed three nights, and each night we hung our towels.  Still, every single day, the maids took our towels off the hooks and washed them anyway.  That is frustrating.
Overall, the facility was fine, and we enjoyed Las Vegas, but next time we will probably stay somewhere else.",7,0,0

My biggest gripe with the ""resort fee"" which is academic to most if not all of their peer hotels is that, it's silly to charge it since you don't have an option to accept\/decline it, and to that point, just fold that fee into the room rate and call it what it is at that ""all in"" level since that's what a customer has to pay anyway.  I think the hotel that abolishes the ""resort fee"" although when you go to discount hotel websites and sort by price, that's where the perceived cheap rates are the bait that lures the bookings, I think through reputation management, the forthright hotels who get rid of that and use that marketing to their advantage (much like how SWA advertises they don't charge for carry on bags or check in luggage as opposed to folks like Spirit or American Airlines), will find their customers are more appreciative, since I'm sure there's a lot of negative reactions to these ""resort fees"" when customers hear how much it is VS what the supposed room rate is, feeling there was a bit misrepresentation on the room rate, as they expected one price and have to pay nearly double that if not more after taxes and fees.

The rooms were\/are okay.  It's the type of hotel you go to, as a safe place to sleep and rest.  It's not a resort.  You don't wine and dine a date here, nor spend your dream honeymoon here.  It's very practical.

The hotel is off the strip a bit, and if you think it's walking distance, it takes about 30 mins to walk from the Stratosphere to the Wynn\/Encore which is where the main Vegas strip begins.  If you take a cab, it's going to cost you (so factor that into your budget as you decide what hotels you stay at, since round trip cab rides can be expensive, 'tho you can do Uber\/Lyft as an option) unless you drive and park your own car, which then is convenient.

The food choices here are okay, I had the Buffet - - if you sign up for the ""Players Card"" (gaming tracking plastic card promotion), you get 10% off most if not all restaurants in the hotel.   It's free to sign up and join and you need not gamble either.",3,2,3

I liked that you can go up into the Tower for ""free"" if you're a hotel guest but didn't like having to pay a $15 ""resort fee"". What is a resort fee? Just another way to get some money I suppose.
 
Here's the deal: the hotel is very clean and well kept, despite it's aging status. 

Yet getting to the proper Strip is a big pain. You really have to take a taxi, and I say this as an avid walker. So factor that into your price, it's about $10 per ride in the vicinity. More to the airport.

The view from the Tower is UNBEATABLE but what is UP with them not allowing tri-pods?? Seriously? I took some shots of the sunset and many of them came out lovely but part of me wants to take a monopod up there and cause some trouble.

I might stay here again, but not if I wanted to spend a lot of time on the Strip (I was in town for a wedding this time and didn't gamble).

Oh yeah, the buffet is really not bad and worth the splurge for convenience alone not to mention the MAKE-YOUR-OWN SUNDAE MACHINE!!! I may not drink or gamble but I ate my weight in sundaes.

We eventually went to the C bar and was greeted by an overly occupied bartender talking to two waitresses that seemed like they had nothing better to do. No wonder we couldn't get a drink. My husband attempted to get the bartenders attention (Wednesday morning minutes after 8am, mimosas special). The bartender was seen showing his phone to the waitresses and caught a quick attitude when my husband addressed him.

The rooms were a bit humid, the windows didn't open. They were clean and provided the basics.
The price for the stay is one of the cheapest on the strip and it includes admission to top of the tower and access to the bar and what not. They have some sweet drink specials and cheap deals for whatever show they are promoting at the time.

The few things I didn't like about my stay:
VERY far from the actual fun in vegas strip. The walk to the strip is quite sketchy so we had to buy bus passes to make it less complicated.
Although the rooms were clean, the hallways were musty. 
Buttons on the parking garage elevator were broken, thus confusing people trying to go up or down. 
Only one place to get coffee in the am?
Extra charge for microwave lol
Super annoying sales people on the first floor trying to get us to sign up for random offers.

When we first arrived it took close to 10 minutes for a valet man to come take care of us and an addition 10 minutes for a bellhop to come get our luggage. Then while checking in I asked the lady at the desk where the best club would be and she said ""Do I look like I go clubbing? Go ask someone else"" which I found to be very rude. Then in our room I called the bellhop to have him bring up my luggage and it took him roughly 45 minutes to bring my luggage up 4 floors and wouldn't leave my room until I tipped him. On the way out it took about 20 minutes for the elevator to come to the 4th floor which I find to be weird seeing there were 5 elevators, it almost seemed like they had 4 shut down. And then when I gave the valet booth my ticket to get my car back they told me it will take 1 minute but apparently 1 minute to them is 30 minutes to a normal clock. So they had us waiting in the scorching heat for 30 minutes when there were no other people around picking up their car. Lastly be careful of their bedding.

Oh my gosh. What a piece of junk. The first time I arrived to Vegas was with two friends.

My expectations were not huge;however, they were not low either. When we received our hotel room key from the friendly receptionist, we went straight up to our room. The hotel room looked like a replica of a 1980s motel. The room smelled dingy and the bathroom was small. The bed spread was pretty bad in the sense that it looked old.

Our room was looking out away from the strip, towards the mountains. At 3 am, we noticed a drug transaction going on outside of our window.

Did not stay here, one day we just went to check it out and the second time was for a company party. Cute shops inside the small mall. The casino was kind of boring I thought. 

But on our second visit we had a private party up in a room overlooking Vegas. The view was incredible, the drinks and appetizers were delightful. The elevators were crazy how fast they were. Then our sponsor's said anyone can go on any ride for free, we have paid for all inclusive. After eating and drinking we went up two floors to check out all the rides. 

First thing I noticed was the bar up here. It was so cool, I could have sat there all night. I had no idea how crazy scary these rides were. Yes, I am typically a dare devil and will go on anything once but um yes after seeing people bungee jump off the top, no way in hell. Then I had told hubby I wanted to go on the famous roller coaster at the top of the building. Are you kidding me??? 

Here we go, they strap you in and this coaster goes deep off the top of the building sideways as if you are going to fall straight down. When it stops's, you are dangling off the top of the building for a few seconds, crazy! Yeah, I decided I loved my life to much to go on it. It was fun to watch these crazy people along with another ride of swings circling off the building as well. 

We stayed up on the observatory level for awhile enjoying the view and rides. It does get very windy up there.

We were on the 20th floor. The view was good.
The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The room was pretty spacious for 3 people. I took a panoramic picture of the room.

Casino:
I enjoyed the music in the casino and the casino itself.. Its certainly not the club scene. Less then 10 people were dancing by the bar. You'll have to travel to the strip for that which was unfortuante because like I said the music was good. 
Machines are new. Friendly dealers for the most part. I did pretty well $$
Ugh the cigarette smoke, you just cant escape it, especially not here but its Vegas, really no point in complaining to much...

Location: The hotel isn't very close to the strip however is doable if you don't mind walking. There are reasonable options to get to the action from this hotel.

Transportation:
* Cab when we arrived $24 from the airport to the hotel.
* Bus - tried it for the trip home. $2 (singles-cash) route 108. It is a block away from the hotel. Got us to the airport in 25 mins. If we didnt arrive at close to 1:00am i would have taken this bus instead of the cab. 
* Deuce: This bus rides along the whole strip. It drops you off across the street from the hotel and picks you up near the front of the hotel. We paid $8 for 24 hours. It also took us to the fremont area. Great deal.

You also get a 25% off discount at restaurants in the hotel as well as the rides. Overall i felt the price was reasonable. How much time do you spend in your hotel anyway. Why go all out in a fancy hotel when the money can be spent on the experience, fun and gambling elsewhere. 
Oh and one more thing! Buffet of buffets (google it). It was like $60 and you have 24 hours to go to as many as 5 buffets. 
It sounds over board but if you have some control you can get breakfast, lunch, dinner and the breakfast again for $60. Or lunch, dinner, breakfast, lunch.. Walking from the startosphere to the strip in this case isn't a bad idea.. Burn some of those calories off...",6,0,0

I called to speak to a manager about it & lady in the front desk said she would have her call me right back, an hour later still nothing! Had to keep going back to the lobby, which was very frustrating... Finally they had us move to another room to were the doors would work. Paid for an upgrade to find out the room is so jankyyy!

Regarding the upgrade:: the bathroom sink was NOT draining at all, called it in & they said that they were gonna send in facilities, but never did. We had to leave since we had a busy schedule, came back & the whole bathroom reeked so bad.  Finally a day later facilities came & fixed the problem, but house keeping never came to clean the mess that the facilities made. We had no choice but to cover the sink with towels & just used the bathtub to brush our teeth.

My husband was so fed up with all the hassle this hotel has done to us. We were supposed to come to Vegas for a nice relaxation, but gave us nothing but problems after problems. We tried to talk to managers, & ofcourse there was nothing that they were able to do for us.

My friends and I chose this hotel because it was economical and we're college students on a tight budget. I didn't expect a 5 star hotel experience but I also didn't expect a line to get on the hotel elevator. Yes, you read correctly, a line to get onto the elevator. It was so bizarre, we waited about fifteen minutes before we could take the elevator up to our room. Our room had two queen beds, a TV, but no fridge...Even the most ghetto motels have fridges.  But it wasn't the long line to the elevator, nor the lack of fridge that I hated most about the hotel; the distance from Stratosphere from the actual strip was outrageous. The hotel didn't seem too far away when I first booked it, so I said, what the heck. Once you're there it's literally a $17 taxi ride, one way, to get to the center of the strip. I felt like we weren't even a part of the strip, but rather some forgotten hotel far away from society. The hotel is so far off  from everything that you can't even consider walking under the 100+ degree weather. And if you walk, like we did the first day, you'll be approached by crackheads lurking around the hotel area, and they'll ask if you're going to finish your Fat Tuesday or not...

I should probably mention that our hotel floor went out of power for a good twenty minutes on the second night of our stay. I had to get ready for the club in the dark (it was night time), luckily I wasn't in the shower. I complained to management for this incredible inconvenience and the employee said they were working on the issue. Never did she apologize for the power going off. No hospitality whatsoever. 

The only pro side of this hotel is the 21+ pool, Radius. It's a hidden gem in this lacking hotel. It's on the 24th floor of the hotel so you feel like you're partying in the sky. The DJ was on point with the music, so overall my friends and I did enjoy the pool. Also, shout out to the girl working registration at 3am on 8\/10\/15, she was polite and efficient when we told her we had forgotten our key in our room.",5,1,0

I bought the room from snaptravel and I purchase the room for $89 which wasn't a standard room. After tax it came out to $104 not including the hotel fees which was $34. When I got to the hotel they gave me a standard room in the corner with a small window. The toilet was so loud it was hard to sleep the television would not cut off. I called the front desk they sent someone up it took them 10 minutes to get the television off and when they left it mysteriously came back on. I called and complaint and they caught me refrigerator and told me they would cut me a night stay if I stayed in the loud room. I explain to them that I'm a disabled vet and I had issues sleeping as it is but a free night stay sounds okay to me.
The next morning when I checked out around 6 a.m. I was told instead of a free night stay comp that I would get a hotel fee comp for two nights which only equaled have of what I was supposed to get. But being a third-party purchase I was given the runaround on who responsibility of was to cut me a night stay. I finally spoke to the manager of Stratosphere today and after 20-minute talk she refused to cut me and night. This hotel makes millions of dollars but can't comp a disabled vet who stay was horrible at their Hotel!!!!

She was very friendly and explained everything and answered all of our questions.
Our room was clean and spacious and had a nice view of the mountains in the distance. The bed was actually very comfortable and had more than enough pillows.
Although we were a bit on the far end of the strip the price for the room was worth it. You can catch the bus right out front, catch a cab, or just walk down to the main strip.  This place is cheap in comparison to some of the other hotels on the strip but I thought it was totally worth what we payed to have a clean place to crash",2,0,1

What I love:

The CHEAP rooms - even with the priciest upgrade, like Strip view superior level, the price is really low. The view is wonderful from superior levels, either strip or mountains side, we stayed in both during our visits. Some rooms have a smaller window than others, so try to get a room with a larger window, they offer a much better view. We had flat screen TVs in our rooms.

Stratosphere is one of the few hotels in Las Vegas that won't charge you extra for the children. As I know, only Circus, Circus doesn't charge for kids either (but I would never stay there, the atmosphere it's just like its name, a circus) and Excalibur (well, maybe we'll try this one sometimes in the future, but I think they have higher hotel fees). So, if you come here with your family, and you want to avoid the extra ~$30\/child\/night, Stratosphere is a very good choice.

We LOVE THE FOOD AT THEIR BUFFET, DEFINITELY TRY IT!!!!!! Every single thing that we tried there is exquisite. If you get an ACE player card, you get a nice discount at the buffet.

Love also the pool at the 8th level. Even at Thanksgiving time it was warm enough to have a good time.

Parking is plenty and it's free, never had a problem finding a spot, even late at night.

The hotel is a bit far on the strip, but you can either take your car and park for free at any other hotels on the strip, or you can ride the bus. Walking is not an option, is too far from anything. Maybe one-way, but for the way back you will be too tired.

Also love that they offer to their guests free unlimited entrance to the tower. If you are not a guest there, the entrance can be pricey. Never tried the rides, too scary!!

When I arrived on Aug. 31 to check-in I found out about the hidden fine print of a $50.00\/night deposit which was NOT mentioned anywhere on your website during the reservation process. My husband and I were looking forward to spending our Vegas honeymoon in a lush suite...instead we spent it in a room that was very small, had terrible pillows (I'm still working through the chronic neck pain those gave me), and lacked a refrigerator so whatever leftovers we wanted to save went to waste. We felt especially alienated during our stay because we (fortunately) do not carry credit cards....this prevented us from, well, everything. We wanted to get in-room wi-fi internet access....but alas, a $150.00 deposit ($50\/night) was needed since we didn't have a credit card. We wanted to rent a movie for in-room viewing...again, another silly deposit of $150 ($50\/night). We offered to pay cash upfront....alas, a deposit of $100\/night was required for cash. Ridiculous! These silly policies made us feel unwelcome at the Stratosphere; we felt like our personal well being wasn't important, only our money was what mattered.  In addition to all this, the most annoying thing about our stay was consistently being harassed by people on the casino floor by the Select elevators trying to get us to sign up for promotions and sell us things we had absolutely no interest in. They had a hard time taking a polite ""No thank you"" for an answer.  

All of this guaranteed that when we return to Vegas we will NOT be staying at the Stratosphere.",3,0,0

The hotel rooms and towers seem recently updated but the casino and retail level could use a makeover. Because of this, we only spent one night gambling at the Stratosphere. I had a rental car so we could quickly go to other casinos on the strip. 

The pool area and bar are adequate and it's fun to watch people doing the Skyjump off the tower. A full service Starbucks in the casino lobby was a welcome surprise but there can be a long line around 9 am.

After staying here the past few years I have to say it is a great deal. The staff have always been nice and the rooms are always well kept. I have a good time playing in the casino and the bands they hire are fun to listen to. 

I like this side of the strip and even though I was sorry to see the Stardust go I feel the Stratosphere is a great substitution. I did not like a room they gave me once and they moved me right away. I am not a high roller but they did treat me well. 

My friends and I all came here for my birthday in Jan this year and we all had a great time and enjoyed the hotel for the price and the service.

Still early in the trip with our wide eyed optimism we checked our bags and decided to check out ""the shops.""

We were hungry so we ate at McDonald's only restaurant on the ""shopping level"" besides Mexican food reeking of dirty socks filled with chicken. After we ate we decided to check out the casino floor, and gamble a little. No one looked happy to be there, the bartender at the big circular bar was aloof and disinterested.

Is staff being smiley & helpful a thing around here? Talk about everyone hating their job..

Click... Red .... Click ... Red... DID THEY GIVE US A ROOM KEY THAT IS NOT EVEN ACTIVE?!
Yes, you guessed it, they did. Another 23 levels down to the lobby and another exchange of conversation with THE WORST STAFF ON THE PLANET.

Click.. GREEN. 

The worst green light I have ever seen. Usually, I see green and it means GO! YES! But if I knew what was behind this door, I would have rather it stayed RED.

Short & Sweet and to the point.

#1- Ugliest room ever. Tv from 1980's, sinks and toilets born a year before the Tv.

#2- Housekeeping? Oh, we do apologize but ""housekeeping is not something we voluntarily do. You must request it."" - Says BLANKA MALTEZ, ""Director"" of the Stratosphere who claims she is ""IT"" & reports to nobody higher than her stating she ""Basically owns the stratosphere"" after complaining for the THIRD night about dirty floors, bugs near our beds coming from the A\/C units and lack of shower towels while the old ones grew mold on the top right corner of our room.

 #3- Some help? Compensation? I don't need money, just clean our room so I can SLEEP!!! Hours later, a rude housekeeper comes and throws some sheets as we try to apologize (Why are we apologizing? No Idea it was 4 am) and she says not a single word to us frowning as if it was our fault nobody did this earlier.

#4- It was not a goodbye but more of a ""See you Later"" type check-out as I get escorted by Supervisor of Security Joseph Dickens to file a security report about the whole situation because ""they are trying to figure out why they have so many complaints on Blanka Maltez and their dirty rooms."" Hmm gee, I wonder. I'd like to thank him though for calming the situation and understanding that ""the customer is always right"". I am beginning to think stratosphere truly does not care about their reputation though after the worlds of promises Mr. Dickens claimed (about a week ago). I am still waiting for that phone call from the ""VP"" of the hotel and the phone call of compensation for our horrible stay. 

It all makes sense why this hotel costs $20 a night on average... 


Moral of the story, RUN RUN & RUN as fast as you can to the other side of the strip. If the light turns GREEN, beg for it to turn back to RED because you have just began the worst trip at LAS VEGAS because of your room. Stay as far away as possible from the stratosphere hotel.

When arriving we stopped at the Valet to leave the car, the gentleman who took the car was so helpful and asked us if we needed any directions or help with any bags, or if we were looking for anything specific, he had a super friendly personality. We were just there to see the casino and do a little bit of slot playing so I said no thank you and got my ticket. 
We went inside and I liked how the slot machines where were set up, they weren't too close together like some tend to be, there was enough room to walk around them and pick your lucky slot. We walked around the casino for a little bit and realized we wanted to grab something to eat first, so we went over to the Stratosphere buffet. Everything was yummy and it was reasonably priced for a brunch buffet. The staff was all super nice. 
After way too long at the buffet I was ready to throw a little bit of money away. I found a Penny slot that was calling my name so I sat down and pulled my wallet out. Before I could even open it a very friendly cocktail waitress came by and asked if she could get us anything. My boyfriend and I asked for a drink and she asked to see our ID's. Some people might be upset at this, but if you think I look to young then I'm A OK with that!   She was a little shocked at how hold my boyfriend was since he really doesn't look his age and said she would be right back. She was back before I could even lose my first $10 which was really fast service. She called us young-ins gave us our drinks and wished us luck. A few minutes later I won 10,500 pennies!!!!!!! I was happy as could be! I'm not the greedy kind so I printed out my ticket right away and went to look for the cashier to turn in my ticket and call it a day. 
There was only one person in line ahead of me so this went by really quick. I don't like a lot of crowds and the hustle and bustle of the hotels on the strip, so this was the perfect place for me. Not to mention the great customer service they provide. Shortly later we were ready to leave, we went back to the Valet and gave them our ticket, they said the car would be right around shortly. Less than 5 minutes later there was my car, in the dead heat of the 100+ degree summer and my car was cool and comfortable. I thank and tipped the Valet, he said thank you and asked us if we needed any directions or recommendations for our next destination.  I thanked him and said we knew where we were going, he said to have a great day and drive safe. It's sad but I have not seen this kind of customer service at any of the other strip hotels.

Its 5 min from strip so I recommend to take uber because neigborhood is creepy. Hotel looks so old and specially all destroys cheap fast food and souvenirs shops inside. We hardly found elevator to top because no any signs. We don't stay there for long beside restaurant nothing do there.

Let me first call out manager Christine Davis for atrocious customer service, there was a discrepancy with a non-valid chip I had received from another casino and she was rude and non-helpful in the extreme, in the end resorting to calling security on me for no reason other than not wanting to discuss the issue any further, exemplified by the fact that they had nothing to do but watch me leave as I was neither loud nor violent as I filed my complaint. The casino was run down, dirty and old, the staff was not helpful and downright impolite, and nothing about my visit would ever make me ever want to step foot in that awful, filthy, dingy place again. And because I cannot say it enough, Christine Davis is an AWFUL manager who should be fired.

Does Christine Davis even realize how awful a manager she is or how she failed to do anything to help my situation in the slightest bit tonight? Does she even realize her choice to immediately call security because she could not handle a customer who had been taken advantage of will result in many posts like this, commentating on her failure as a manager in the modern world and need to adapt to a more amenable way to deal with customers and their concerns besides dumpling them on security because she feels they are beneath her. Get off your high horse lady, I deserve the same respect as everybody else, even if you look down on me for being taken advantage of by a charlatan at another casino, that is no reason for you to treat me like an interloper disrupting your night.

We ended up getting matched with The Stratosphere on Priceline for $83\/night. We checked out the reviews and decided for the price and the love\/hate reviews it would be worth a try.

We checked in on a Friday afternoon and we were initially impressed with the service. Everyone was very knowledge and friendly and we were swiftly whisked away to our room. 

On first glance, our room looked comparable to a Best Western or Days Inn. Everything looked fairly clean and was decorated in the generic motif that you expect a midrange hotel to have.  

I wish I could end this review on such a positive note....

We were given a small room with 2 double beds. It was just my boyfriend and I, so we picked the bed farthest from the door in which to take a nap before the nights festivities. We pulled back the blankets and immediately noticed spots of what appeared to be blood on the sheets. Disgusting. We checked out the other bed which was clean and decided to call the front desk to inform them of what we had found. We were put on hold in excess of 20 minutes and the system eventually hung up on us.  Luckily, we had the second bed or I would have flipped out on someone.

Later in the same evening we each went to take a shower and noticed that there was still smears of makeup on one of our towels. Really? We called down to housekeeping to ask for more. Again, it took about 15 minutes to be connected and the woman who answered was very unpleasant. I asked to have towels sent up and informed her of our room number and she literally said ""Fine."" And slammed down the phone. Surprise, surprise....I waited for 45 minutes before giving up on the towels and getting ready to go. The towels never came and we were almost late to our dinner reservations.

The next day our bathroom\/vanity lights went out. I had my boyfriend call this time. Same result. Put on hold forever and hung up on. While showering in the dark may seem like an adventure, it is not. It's incredibly annoying and our experience at this hotel had been ruined.  It was probably something as simple as a blown fuse, but apparently no one was willing to take the time to find out.

The toilet seat was also broken, if you didn't hold it firmly against the tank while sitting down or peeing it would snap closed. 

At this point we decided to spend as little time at this hotel as possible. We spent as much time as we could out on the strip (which is NO WHERE NEAR the hotel....20-30 min. Deuce ride or a $15-$20 cab ride depending on traffic). It was closer to the Fremont Street area, but not by much. 

If you need a place to rest your head and watch the room spin, this may be the place for you. If you don't mind taking long drunken bus rides in the middle of the night, you just might like this place. I, for one, will NEVER go back to this hotel and will tell everyone I know to avoid it at all costs.  Lesson learned: I will fork out the cash for a nice room on the strip next time and spend my money elsewhere.",6,1,1

I checked in expecting to pay a $30 resort fee for two days, and they tried to charge me $92 at checkout.  I complained, and they said they would ""waive"" the fee.

Because the balance was supposed to be zero, they didn't issue me a receipt.  After getting home, what do I see on my credit card?  You guessed it, $92.

Now I have to waste an hour of my life to fight their charges.  

Do not stay here. Save yourself the headache and pick a property that will not try to screw you over.

my highlight of the entire stay at the hotel was while gambling with my friends we were asked if we wanted to be in a commercial and of course we jumped at the idea. we were given about $20 in chips to pump away into slot machines as kari wuhrer walked by each of us and went on about everything the stratosphere has to offer. well i was totally excited about all of this because i actually knew kari from mtv as a vj, the co host on mtv's remote control and she was in anaconda just to name a few. well he hung out with her and i later was lucky enough to go out for drinks with her outside the stratosphere. i'll stop there!! lol

1) Location: it's way south on the Strip and away from all the mayhem & fun.

2) The room: I requested a room with two Queens and got one King with a view of a massive blank wall right outside my only window.

3) Dirty: Once I checked into the room, I found a crusty dirty dried face towel tucked above the shower curtain rod. Don't know what it was but I don't want to know either! Plus there was some dried fluid in one of the drawers which left this stained outline. Yuck! I requested a non-smoking room but there was some funky smell throughout my stay.

4) Plumbing: The bath tub drain got clogged on the second night.  Initially I thought it was a slow drain but when I got up the next morning to check, the tub of water was still there.  None of the water moved.

5) Room amenities: I got the typical cheap no-name shampoo, conditioner, body gel, and a bar of soap.  Nothing extra but when the Kleenex box became empty, it was not replenished.

6) ""Resort fees"": I guess this is the norm with hotel rooms these days (yet I still don't understand) but exactly what the hell am I paying $7.50 per day for?  It certainly wasn't Wi-fi ($12 per day if you must know).  The gal at the counter said it's charged for pool & gym access (who exercises while on vacation anyway?), newspaper (which I never received), and hotel amenities (which I only got one small bar of soap for two nights).  I do get unlimited access to the Tower above but once was enough.  I can't imagine going up more than once.  Tower access was posted as $60...really?  Seriously...?  Going up an elevator costs $60??

I must admit that I got rather a good deal for the room here but that was where it ended.  The room itself wasn't too bad but it wasn't what I requested and I put in my request over a month in advance. Tower access was nice especially during the evening hours.

The room was clean and well-stocked, the check-in staff were friendly and the casino wasn't overly smoky or outdated. The neighborhood it's in (very end of the strip) isn't fabulous - we were cautioned by both the cab driver and random residents not to go out walking after dark, but frankly I've been more nervous in my own city than there.
There are multiple restaurants, two pools (one topless!) and more slot machines than one can fathom. 
We ate at the buffet, mainly - make sure to get the all-day rate if you're going to eat three meals there - you get unlimited access from 7am to 9pm for $30.00. Even if you're just getting one meal there, get the Player Card from the casino and get a discount at the buffet.
Hotel guests receive unlimited access to the tower (non-guests pay a huge amount to get up there) and your room key gets you admission for 4. The view is amazing, but they do try to sell you souvenier photos (which we bought, haha).
I had no negative experiences, but it wasn't a fabulous resort getaway either - it was nice to be slightly off of the main drag, but I kind of wish they hadn't billed it on their website as being ""centrally located on the strip"" because it's not - centrally located, that is.

This week is my 36th birthday; so to celebrate, I decided, on the spur of the moment, to make a trip to Vegas to go to one of my favorite clubs last weekend.  I mean, why not? This past year, I received a kidney transplant. No more dialysis, so now I could travel freely. I had the money.  No reason not to, right?

I originally wanted to just go and book whatever hotel room I could find while I was in Vegas itself, but at the urging of a close friend, I chose to go online and see if I could find a deal.  I used a third party website, and found a room at the Statosphere for $67 per night.  Since I was traveling late, and would not get there until after midnight, I booked it for Saturday, figuring I would stay overnight and come back to LA on Sunday. No problem, right?

Apparently, in Las Vegas, days do not begin at midnight like they do everywhere else in the U.S.  They begin at 3pm, which was naturally not indicated on my confirmation.  So when I got to the Statosphere, and tried to check in at midnight itself, I was told that I would have to buy two days, because this was still considered Friday. No attempt to make good, just to charge me more money, a pattern I would later learn was typical for the Stratosphere.

Across the street was a sleazy motel, so I figured I could just crash there for the night, and check into my room the next day. Since I did not have the much vaunted Statosphere for internet access, I searched for a wireless connection. As luck would have it, the city provides $5 wireless per day through Las Vegas.net. I bought two days, figured I would check in to the Statosphere the next day and all would be well.

When I got to there, I learned why my room had been such a ""bargain"": it came with a glorious view of some storage area where apparently the hotel keeps scrap metal. Two windows worth, no less.  But that wasn't as bad as learning that the Stratosphere BLOCKS wireless providers so you have to buy theirs... at $11 a day.

Flabbergasted that a ritzy (cough!) hotel would be this cheap, I realized that I would have to use the phone to make my plans for the night. Not a big deal, I have a phone card, and their phone's display said local calls were free, except that, well, they're not.  When I just got a rapid dialtone whenever I dialed nine, I tried calling the front desk for a solution. They put me on hold FOREVER.  I tried other numbers - the concierge, the operator, SOMETHING - to find out what was wrong with my phone so I didn;t have to sit on hold, but to no avail.  The Statosphere wanted me to hold on for five minutes, no matter what. So I did, only to learn that local calls are A DOLLAR each. What's on the phone, I guess, was put there by the manufacturer, because no one in their right mind would believe a luxury hotel would charge a buck each for LOCAL calls. But the Statosphere is not like other hotels.  It's far worse.

So I used the cell, got to where I needed to go, and got the Hell out of there, discovering my favorite thing about the Statosphere - check out is easy and fast. I'm sure they had to do that because they get so many.

Bottom line, unless you're part of the 1%, stay at Circus Circus if you're going to Las Vegas on a budget. And stay as far from the Statosphere as you can. The tower, I now believe, was put in to distract you from how horrible this place is. Never again.",1,0,0

On the plus side, they comp drinks like there is no tomorrow, and they had an all you can drink night at the club.

It was inexpensive and awesome.  Some big tower shooting up out of nowhere, it's lovely isn't it?   A little bit away from the main drag of the strip, about a mile and a half from the major stuff, two from TI and so forth. Not bad, so let me tell you how it went.

We land at McCarran and what do we see waiting for the cabs, the needle! Land ho, here we go.  We arrive with jitters and practically fall out of the cab with excitement, grab our luggage and in we go to the magical world of a casino.  Nice.  We probably got into the hotel about midnight and we had to check in and drop our things off before we could explore.  The wait time wasn't long, maybe a little less than 20 minutes and the line was fairly long, there were maybe 5 people working behind the counter so it moved pretty fast.

We headed to the elevators through the casino which wasn't that far away but there was no direct route for us to go and headed up to our rooms.  My issue with this is that right when you walk into the hotel lobby POW there it is, the casino which is great yeah sure but to travel with luggage for actual guests of the hotel with now actual path to hit the elevators bothers me a bit.  I can't pin point a finger on exactly why this is but I feel the lay out should be different.   OH and that C-Bar right smack in the middle, awkward moment right there.  It's like it doesn't want to be there but it is.   Maybe I will and add it to the photos?  Anybody?

So I'll go on about the room, awesome except for no fridge! Uh whattheheck?!  Yeah you want us out of the room we get it but really?!  We had 2 queen room, lots of space, huge bathroom only one sink but plenty of counter space for three young ladies.  Closet space, draw space (which didn't really get utilized but it's available!), lamps and lights and a big ass mirror.  Huge flat screen, unsure of the stations available we didn't really flip through much.  The colors were pretty and there was a pillow that could probably knock someone out on the beds, when it hit the wall I thought someone fell into our door!  That is how thick and large and heavy this thing is.  Yup I sound like I just described something else didn't I? I won't change it, I can't it's what this pillow-majigy was.

I'm adding a business listing for the shops inside the Stratosphere, so check that out (The Shops at the Stratosphere).

The bus stop was right outside a little bit away across from Carls Junior (PS. When I was a kid living in Burbank.. best ever! I didn't return though I wanted to keep the magic alive in my head).  Check out The Deuce listing on Yelp so you can read my review of their transit system and I guess some other peoples too.

The casino itself is in a fight with me, I refused to give up my money but when I did it would just eat it, damn you casino.  Damn you.

There are some okay bars in here like the Back Alley Bar, Roxy has one, Level 107\/108, C-Bar, Level 8, the Italian place we never checked out and the Buffet I'm sure too although we didn't get there either.  The drink service at tables\/machines isn't that steady, I rarely saw someone coming around and when I did, she never stopped at us and yes we were playing. There is Top of the World, I will be reviewing as well separately like I've already done a few other things in the hotel.

Oh the Starbucks in here is a rip off, they're rude too and charge extras up the wazoo for things free at any other Starbucks I've been too. Great service ladies, faaaaaantastic.  Yup! 

The observation deck is something to definitely check out.  It's free with your room key and outsiders have to pay.  I am not sure of all the pricing and we didn't do any rides so I'm sorry I can't be of help to that.

Room service was alright we only had them come once in the four days we were there and it was so we could replenish the towels.   Check out, damn they were banging on the door five minutes of the time we had to bounce so that was a little eek! Relax let us get out the door before storming in.  Check out was flawless though and the bell desk held our bags for a bit till we had to catch our flight out of there.  Great guys, great service overall at the Stratosphere, I would definitely return if I was thinking of going back to Las Vegas again.

For $30\/day it was cheap enough for my lean pockets. We get adjoining rooms on the 19th floor, non-smoking. The rooms were clean enough, although I could still smell the cigarette smoke wafting from the elevators just a few steps away. It's one of my pet peeves of hotels with casinos, you can never get the smell of cigarettes out. Plus you have to go through the casino to get to the hotel anyways so there's really no escaping that. Anyhoo this time we get the room with a view of the mountains and old town Vegas. It was cool too, but last time we were here we had a view of the strip. That was super nice. 

With the room key you get a free pass to the observation deck ($18 value) and with the players card you get 10% off at the buffet and Roxy's diner. I'm not sure if they offer it at the Italian restaurant. They have Top of The World restaurant here (reviewed separate on its business site).

The restrooms are clean and maintained well, frequently stocked with supplies.

If you're considering staying here, make sure you're paying SIGNIFICANTLY less than any other strip hotel (except maybe circus circus... They're on about the same level)  If you can save some money to use somewhere else, it might be worth it. If you're looking for a clean, well-appointed resort hotel to relax at, this isn't it. 

Check in was fairly fast though they did try to pressure us into paying $15 a day more for remodeled rooms. I'm sure they're nicer, as our room needed some TLC, but don't ask me to subsidize your remodel! 

We stayed in the central tower and as others have noted, it's not great. The room was surprisingly large. We were in 23-099 which is right next to the stairs and I think because of that we got a little bonus section comprised of the space behind the stairs. So I'd recommend asking for room 99 on any floor if you can. The view of the mountains was nice! So long as you didn't look down at the air conditioning plant. There were some gross stains on the curtains and the shower head sucks. Also there's no vent fan in the bathroom, and the shower is really dark. 

If you don't mind waking 4 blocks, you can get to the monorail through the SLS casino. It's a pretty convenient way to get down to the rest of the strip. 

The main pool is ok. Not huge like at the newer casinos. Lots of kids. 

The biggest perk of staying here is free tower access. That's worth $20. We liked having it available at all times because we could ride up and read books on the couches, grab a drink, etc. The rides are pretty cool, and reasonably priced.",6,0,1

Basically: The Stratosphere is located at the upper end of the Vegas Strip. It's a bit removed from the main area where most people (tourists) are. This is both a plus and a minus. Plus because it's unique in being on something of an island in an otherwise sketchy surrounding area. If you're OK with being a bit removed from the full Vegas experience, you'll be fine, esp. if you can deal with said surroundings. Negative are those surrounding. Not the greatest. I didn't feel at harm, but it sure wasn't as ""pleasant"" as some place more centrally-located.

But this is a great place. The tower is, of course, it's highlighted feature. You can go up and get great views of the surrounds of Vegas. Def a plus. The hotel-casino environment is a little more subdued...Not quite the glitz, pomp, and circumstance as the other Vegas locales on the Strip. The casino was relatively small and less-populated. But it makes up for this, or is enhanced because it's less congested and overwhelming. A plus. The hotel has two pools, a small mall, convenient parking, and all the requisite things you'll want in a hotel in Vegas. The staff was friendly and the place stylish enough. My room was great (for me). It had a small living area with a wall that separated the sleeping area. The bathroom was small but OK. A full-length mirror was a nice touch and the frig. was a great thing to have. The bed was soft and I liked the plastic signature cups provided. Even the toiletries were nice. This for $34\/night on a weekday in July. Slower time for sure but very much a bargain and worth it and more! 

Even though it's a bit away from things you can still get around, which is huge. You can walk to the monorail, take the Strip bus to the other areas and even get a bus that goes directly to the airport ( The #108...make a note of it !). There's a large souvenir shop down the street and nearby Circle K and Walgreen's for anything you might want (for that frig.)

Overall, I imagine there are nicer, more convenient options, but this place is not bad at all. In fact, because it's a bit removed, it makes being in Vegas a bit less overwhelming....while still being convenient enough to get around and do whatever you want. Plus the Tower...very much a bonus. I'll be back to Vegas and I'm sure I'll probably stay here. I will be happy to do so !

Oh....watching people do the SkyJump is an extra added plus. Listening to them scream and seeing figures drop from the sky, day and night were something interesting and fun to experience...Surely not what someone may have expected when planning the place, but a unique feature to the place.

A couple things that were not-so-great was the long check-in\/check-out line (but you can express check out). I also didn't like having the elevator make so many stops, up and down almost every ride. Don't think there's anything that can be done about the elevator rides but the check in line? Yeah, you need a couple more people working for that...",7,1,0

As it goes with hotels, condition of many is hit or miss. I was displeased with the low income housing directly across the street. (I swear that is what the sign outside their little apartment complex says.) there were quite a few guys kinda hanging out on the streets there, which made me question parking our car in the parking structure which they were hanging around the entrance to. Then as I was reading reviews and overheard someone working here, saying don't go out and walk down the strip after dark from this hotel, I am kinda nervous. So we will Uber for sure. We upgraded to stay in one of the large suites. The room is HUGE. THE DOWN SIDE: The furniture is quite dated, everything from the 90s light wash entertainment stand, to the dark brown industrial wetbar cabinets. The backsplash caulk was sorta gross. The couch and chair looked to be from the 90s as well. Some of the draperies have paint on them, most likely from a touch up to the wall. The doors (around the handles) didn't appear clean. The large dining table was very old and the top of the table was lifting and peeling. The matching end tables on our 'non-smoking' floor had cigarette burns on them. The carpet needs to be stretched or replaced in the hall outside our door. THE UP SIDE: The imported tiles in the entry, vanity room and restroom is beautiful. The size of the room is great. A couple roll aways and it is plenty large for a few people to stay in. There are tons of plugs for chargers and devices. THE MINOR INCONVENIENCE, the hotel had to send someone up to open our safe for us, because it was left locked. Probably something housekeeping should have on their list to check at each checkout cleaning, but not a huge deal. OVERALL, if you need a place to sleep at night, go for it, but in our particular room it would probably not be a place I'd bring friends to entertain etc. I'd also probably not bring young kids. Super (cigarette) smokey downstairs, and the complex directly across the street is questionable at best. If it weren't for $75\/3 nights through a promo, I'd probably not stay.

Obviously given the deal, I wasn't expecting the best of the best, but honestly we had a good experience overall.

The main issue was that they didn't have our reservation, which I think was more of an Expedia issue versus hotel issue. The Strat was very nice about it, put us in the same room type in the same wing. I had to put the first night and the fees in my card and then I was to call the front desk the next day as they would contact Expedia and confirm the reservation and agreed price. They made copies of my paper work as well. So key is to print everything and bring it with!

I did as they asked, the front desk said they found the reservation with Expedia and the price on my card was adjusted accordingly. I checked on the TV (you can look up you bill\/fees on it) and yup, it was all handled. No worries.

The check in process does suck. It is a long wait. I don't think this is unique to the Strat as all the hotels we walked through had the same lines.

The casino itself is older and less happening than the bigger ones down the strip, but honestly I preferred this.  It is a walk if you want to get into the heart of the strip. We loved the monorail that picked up by SLS and bought a pass for that. Way less busy than the bus. The hood around the casino isn't the best - true, but I never once felt threatened or worried. Walk with a buddy and don't be a moron and you are fine. Stay on the main road, which is true for anywhere in Vegas really. 

We renewed our vows at the chapel across the street (the Little Vegas Chapel) which was great. We had a fancy dinner at the top of the Strat in the Top of the World, and overall had a great time staying there.

The only issue with the room was that our sink drain was terrible. Very slow. We weren't in our room enough to give a crap. The room was very clean, updated, and didn't stink of smoke at all. No real issues.

Overall, I'd stay here again. I enjoyed being at the Stratosphere and would recommend.",5,2,4

We should have moved hotels, when we first got here.  Our nice super shuttle driver WARNED us about the ""HOOD' directly behind the hotel.  OK been Police for 35 years and when a local says STAY out of the HOOD, or naked city as he called it STAY out.  We should have moved.  Noticed on the news too, someone got shot near the stratosphere one night during our stay.  

Well the first thing is the atmosphere, the casino and lobby REEKS of smoking.  Now it is a casino, BUT all the other places we visited the smoke smell was not as nearly overwhelming.  We stayed on the 17th floor, a no smoking floor and once on the elevator BAM stench of smoking in the elevator shaft. We waited for a shuttle to be pick us up for a tour and the smoke smell was so bad near the doors we held the door open to get fresh air in the doorway.   

Housekeeping, very slow one day NO housekeeping at all, one day very late nearly 5pm to get our towels.  We did get room service and I assumed that the housekeeper would take the tray out, maybe my bad. The sink was slow in the room and we left a note thinking the housekeeper would be able to help.  NOPE so gotta call maintenance at night.  Took him about 10 mins to unclogged the drain.  He said he would call housekeeping to clean the sink, NO housekeeping ever cleaned that sink, Next time we'll stay somewhere else. 

The one star is earned from the room service food, pretty good breakfasts we had during our stay.  We were later told the Trump Hotel is Non Smoking, politics aside I would look there if smoking is an issue as it was at the Strastophere.  The Trump is a little for central located to the strip if that is important too.

The hotel was nice, we upgraded for an extra $20\/night for the hot tub\/wide screen room (originally we got a standard room).  The room was nice, nothing too different than what I seen before.  The hot tub was in the bathroom which also served as a shower too.  It fits two people comfortable side by side.  It felt nice after a 3 hr car ride the first night.

We only stayed overnight in the Select Tower, and it was booked through Expedia, which had a very low advertised price.

The room that we stayed in was good, the beds looked nice and the furniture\/decor was modern, too.  I read some of the other reviews which said that their room looked outdated and worn.  I'm not sure if this depended upon which tower they stayed in, but I was satisfied with the room I stayed in.

However, I do have to comment on a few things:  1)  the bathroom lighting is dim - there is only one light and it's on the vanity over the sink area.  The rest of the bathroom looked and seemed dark,  2)  The closet is rather tall and narrow, so there wasn't a lot of space to stow stuff if you have more than two people in the room, 3)  my sleep was marred by the presence of unruly and inconsiderate young twentysomethings who seemed to think that it was okay to be noisy and boisterous at 3:00 a.m. in the morning.

It is on this item that I am going to hit upon and expand upon.

The hotel, given its positioning on the strip, seemed to be dominated by the younger crowd, although everybody was represented there.  The casino area seemed to be lacking in energy like the other casinos I'd seen closer to the center of the strip.  However, the young crowd that I encountered probably chose the Stratosphere hotel because it was what they could afford.

If that really was the case, I shouldn't have been surprised that they would act in a way that was consistent with their self-centered personalities.  At 3:00 a.m. in the morning, a small group of people came down the hallway from the elevator bank and were talking very loudly.  So loud that they woke me up - not a wise thing to do.  I actually went to my room's front door, opened it up, and told them to pipe down or I'd call security.  Since they didn't seem to listen or care, I called for security to come up and check out my noise complaint.  Things quieted down shortly after I made the call.

Given that I could clearly hear them through the door, the doors must be hollow-core or made of something else that allows sound to be transmitted through fairly easily.  Regardless, because of the crowd that seemed to be drawn to this hotel, I probably am not going to come again.  I don't want to have to deal with obnoxious, immature people, and they were everywhere!  I encountered them in the elevator, in the halls, at the shops, and on the casino floor.  It was more painfully evident to me when I saw the crowd gathered at the Starbucks Coffee area outside of the elevators to the Select Tower.

The only real draw of this hotel is probably the observation deck in the tower, which paid guests can visit for free by swiping their cardkey.  Otherwise, you'd have to pay a hefty price for the privilege to go up there.

So, I give Stratosphere a low mark because of the clientele it attracts.  Knowing what I know now, I'm not going to subject myself or my family to the boisterous antics of immature adults.

Oh, and the adjacent neighborhood surrounding the hotel?  It seemed very ghettoish.  It felt like East St. Louis - depressed, dark, and run-down.  Even the motel across the street from the taxi drop-off area is closed and dilapidated.  A heavy atmosphere hung over the area as I drove around the hotel property.",0,0,0

we enjoyed Roxys diner, the grill cheese is amazing but consider sharing a plate if you're not very hungry because the portions are huge. also, if you have the ace playing card you get a 10-25% discount in almost all the stores\/restaurants in the hotel. 
the buffet was pretty good. cost about $21 (with the discount) and it had a lot of different choices. for the price it wasn't that bad.
we liked our room had a nice comfortable and clean king size bed. 42 inch plasma TV and great working AC. bathroom was big but it did have a faint unpleasant urine odor. if you really looked you could see where the cheap upgrades were made but you get what you pay for. 
the hotel is far from everything and unless you're wearing super comfy sneakers and even then we strongly suggest you get a deuce deuce pass depending on how long you're going to stay. we purchased two 3 day pass for $20 each.we did however see an advertisement where you could get a 5 day pass at any Albertson for the same amount as the 3 day one.

I explained to her the way my credit union works and the way the card works but i asked if i could speak to a manager to see if he could give her the OK because i also didn't want the girl to get in trouble. he came over and from the beginning gave me attitude as if It was a great inconvenience to have to get up off his a**. I explained to him the situation and he told me that he helped develop the software therefor he knew that my card would not work as a credit card. after about 10 min of arguing and asking him to just try it he did and guess what? it went through as a credit card like i told him it would. I didn't even get an apology from him. the week went on without any other unpleasant incidents. we decided to check out a day early because we had done and experienced everything we wanted to. I was told that we would be charged a late check out fee of $20 and be reimbursed the rest which was about $60 plus tax. when we went to check out  the reservation clerk was the most genuine and friendly person in that hotel. he didn't charge us the late check out fee and refunded the whole extra day which turned out to be $97.

Resort fee was a joke.. 
Cockroaches were literally riding up the elevator with me.. 

Also make sure u avoid self parking at all costs. Because when your tires get slashed they will literally do nothing to help you.. Asking them to file a report is useless because they didn't get pictures of the slashed tires while they were on the car (sorry not trying to have the tires go flat while I wait on the Parking garage ""security"" to come take pics) spent $400 on new tires and the hotel said they can't do anything to reimburse us because it was self park.. Which is understandable... But then they state that they can't even look at the cameras and no one in the hotel has the authority to do so.

We were not provided with a do not disturb sign (apparently just the top floors have those) so the maids walked in on us twice.. Luckily we were dressed.

The happiest person about this whole arrangement was our 14-year old son since he feels that his mom is controlling and I won't let him play his loud music and do whatever he wants so he got to spend the entire trip in a room with his 13-year old cousin.  I guess that was money well spent.  NOT!  Teenagers aren't supposed to be overly happy...not on my watch.  LOL

I've stayed here often enough to know what to expect, but the newest addition is the customer service text messaging.  I love that feature, now that I got my iPhone 5s set up, that is.  It's so nice and convenient.  I sent them a text to ask for a playpen for my daughter and they showed up about 10-15 minutes later.

I even texted them asking if we could move to another room because the high school kids in the room next door, who were there for their hockey league, were playing their music super loud and I couldn't sleep.  However, they didn't have any rooms available and offered to send security up, but I told them that wasn't necessary.

The second day of our stay, I managed to deactivate my key and sent them another text, 10 minutes later the bellman brings up another set of keys.  I couldn't be happier with the convenience and super quick response time.  Love this place!",13,12,13

The Air Bar- is awesome, you get to see the entire city from above--from floor 108 I believe...!

I stayed at the Stratosphere during my very first trip to Vegas a couple of years ago with a group of 5.  I had no idea how the place was laid out, so I was surprised to learn how far down the strip the hotel was.  We'd rented a car so the distance from the action was manageable.  From what I remember the rooms were fairly clean and large.  The restaurant downstairs was okay when you wanted something after staying out late.  And the restaurant at the top was nice as well at least for ambience's sake.  All in all I just think it wasn't bad for the money.  If you are looking for luxury then there are plenty of better choices for that in LV.  But for a clean, reasonably priced hotel room....I'd recommend the Stratosphere.",0,0,0

We flew in from Portland in the late afternoon and took a cab to the hotel where we checked in and were given our room.  We were not offered any assistance with our bags which but I didn't take notice of it at that point but it is strange due to the fact that most most hotels offer that right away.  I would have refused it however it was the start of our glorious stay at the Stratosphere!

We went to our room on the 7th floor and plopped our suitcases and duffle's up on the bed for unpacking when I promptly took my shoes off to walk around the room, scope the place out and get ready to shower.  I came across a 12 inch diameter wet spot on the floor next to the bed and my socks were soaked right away.  

I hopped out of the wet spot and stripped off my socks and looked around the room for more wet spots - nothing.  I wasn't about to put my face down to smell the floor but the first thing that came to mind was someone else was unhappy with the hotel and decided to take a whiz before they left or they were drunk from the nightlife and spilled their stomach contents on the floor prior to checking out - and I just got it all over my socks and feet.  

The front desk was called and informed of the issue, we were told not to do anything, standby and that someone (the manager) would be right up.  30 minutes go by and another call is made to the front desk - ""someone is on the way"" they say.  20 minutes go by and we are wondering where this person might be?  We discuss how quite the casino was and the front desk\/lobby was not busy at all.  Someone should be here any moment.   Give them a bit longer, perhaps another group of planes came in and they got busy - however we want to get this resolved so we can unpack and go see Vegas, it is our first time here.

We waited another 20 minutes and we call again and are told the same thing - someone is on the way.  We tell them to please hurry up as we have been waiting over an hour and we are hungry, want to unpack and shower and go eat as we have been flying all day.  No problem we are told, just a few more minutes.

Total time waited at this point before I call - 1.5 hours and I call the front desk and ask for the manager (who is supposed to be on the way to our room) and they pick up the phone and proclaim ""Service Manager can I help you"".  Hello, do you know which room number I am in?  ""Yes sir"".  Do you know of the complaint we called about previously?  ""Yes sir"".  Are you aware that for the past HOUR AND A HALF you were supposed to have been on the way to our room to get this resolved and we have been sitting here patiently waiting for you?  ""I will be right there sir"".

He knocked on our door within 5 minutes and looked at the spot then told us that they just cleaned the carpets, it is nothing.  I asked him why is this one spot soaking wet and not the entire carpet then if the carpet was cleaned?  if it were cleaned, the entire carpet would be damp.  If he is so sure that the spot is from the carpet cleaning, perhaps smelling the spot wouldn't be out of the question?

The manager said absolutely out of the question, I had a valid point and he would move us to a different room immediately and have someone else come in and ""clean these carpets again"".

We were moved to a new room on the 19th floor I think it was where indeed the entire carpet was damp and smelled of a fragrant soap.  The manager stated that this one was obviously cleaned and apologized and left.  That was it, nothing about leaving us sitting in the piss\/puke room or about putting us in a room with a completely damp carpet.  We called downstairs again and asked them to bring up fans to dry out this carpet and they did.  They offered NOTHING for the hassle and no apologies for the wait.

The entire stay construction was going on throughout the day and night, you could hear hammering through the walls and ceiling in the elevator as you came and went.  The food in this hotel\/casino was pretty crappy.

For 9 bucks more a night you can stay at the Luxor which is a cool place and in a safer location.  This hotel is also at the bad end of town and if you walk down to the strip you have to walk through the ghetto and there are some suspect people standing outside the t-shirt stores and liquor stores begging for money and scoping out the passers by.

Spend your money elsewhere.",4,0,0

We were looking for an inexpensive place to stay in Vegas that was still on the strip. We choose the stratosphere. The hotel itself is really nice (seems a bit old), but in general it is nice. We tried one of the restaurants - Roxy's Diner, just for a quick easy meal after a late flight. The food was really good! We also went to a show which was a lot of fun, and nicely priced. 

And of course the stratosphere has an amazing view of the strip that you don't want to miss. We got some wonderful pictures there. 

Didn't do any rides because they were expensive and we'd rather have spent that money doing other attractions in Vegas. 

If you are looking for something conveniently located on the strip - this is not the place. It is quite a walk from the main part of the strip, and this is coming from a couple who usually walks everywhere on vacation because it is the cheapest way - and we like to save money! But even for us, especially after a night in heels, it was a bit far! However, if you are willing to buy a bus pass for the days you are there, then it would be just fine. Do keep in mind though that riding the bus on the strip can take a decent amount of time. 

That in mind it is nice that is is far enough away from the action on the strip that it doesn't always seem to frantic! It is also a quick and easy getting to Fremont St.",1,0,0

We were asked to participate in a timeshare presentation everytime we walked in the front of the hotel. We felt as though we were being pan handled inside the hotel. We lost count of how many times the same salesperson approached my husband and I. The decor is ancient, housekeeping is sketchy, towels were like sandpaper, and the shower was a deathtrap.

I like how they have rides at the hotel, and an arcade in the hotel.

After hanging up I went to yelp and was saddened by the negative reviews and expected to be disappointed!
It was super easy to get to this hotel, right off the freeway and then one turn and you're there, that's a bonus after a long drive! 
Our check in was fast, and Ron was super nice and efficient! 
Our room was clean and nice, sheets super soft and cozy and we had a good view for a great price! 
Perfect location at the halfway point between stuff on the upper strip and downtown, because it's way more fun to explore the vibe in both places rather than just staying in one location!
We loved that you can go up to the tower free of charge as a hotel guest! We loved the pool on the 24th floor and couldn't believe how small that pool looked from the actual tower, when we were on the 24th floor it looked like the tallest building ever, then from the tower it's a speck, so high!
Casino was fun and we enjoyed video poker at the C bar with Abel as our rad and helpful bartender!
We liked the Buffett here, and Nadia our server was a total sweetheart!
Check out was all of 2 minutes with Glenn helping us with a few jokes and understanding as I was near tears from our vacation ending!
Valet took 10 minutes!

The room itself was an okay size, but the bathroom was tiny - the door barely opened without hitting the toilet and the sink was located in the room. Every time a toilet was flushed in the surrounding area it sounded like an airplane taking off. Woke me up the first night when the room above us used their bathroom. The showers were equally as noisy. The pillows were also small. They looked like postage stamps on the bed and were useless if you wanted to use the to prop up and watch TV. 

The Casino was fine, but the drinks were terrible. We ordered cranberry juice and vodka. The bartender wanted to make sure we saw him over pour the vodka. I'm assuming he did this for a larger tip. We ended up paying $20 for two watered down drinks. Not sure if the cranberry or the vodka was culprit.

We found a hotel we liked early on and never ventured out to staying at another.  Thanks to the Stratosphere, I was reminded why.  I will start with the check in.  Upon arriving I went to the reservation line and waited to be assisted.  I was given my room along with two keys.  Since we were staying for 7 days, I had two pieces of luggage plus what I was carrying in my backpack and purse.  I was offered no help getting the luggage up to my room, but I was reluctant to manage to find my room before my arms gave out.  I tried the key given and it did not work; I tried the other key and had no luck.  Finally, someone came and let me in my room, and about an hour later I was brought two more keys which didn't work.  I accumulated six room keys before having one that worked.  That night, we tried to order room service, no answer.  We called multiple times but never got an answer.  I thought there could be a technical problem so called the bell desk.  Finally, someone answered and I was basically told there was nothing they could do.  The next day I went to workout and when I got back to the room the sheets were being changed by housekeeping. It must have been apparent that I wanted to take a shower so the maid asked if I would like her to come back in a couple hours and I gratefully accepted.  Hours later, the bed was still half way unmade with clean sheets sitting nearby.  I called housekeeping to ask if someone could come up and they assured me that someone would be up to finish changing the sheets shortly.  Two hours went by and no one had came by or called.  I changed my own sheets and made my own bed.  I would also suggest that if you need towels, toiletries, etc., call hours before you run out because that's how long it takes to get them brought to your room.  I am a frequent traveler and I have never had such a horrible experience.  There is a reason that their rates are lower than most in Las Vegas.  You get whatyou pay for- this hotel is a disgrace to Las Vegas.  I wouldn't step foot in this hotel again if I were paid.  Lastly, if you are looking to stay on the Strip, this is not the place.

Okay, first, I would've given this place a 5 if it were closer to either the strip or old las vegas. Unfortunately, since the recent closing of several casinos near stratosphere leading to the strip, the walk is mostly long and very dark - sometimes it feels a little risky (though it isn't).

The room was nice (and the cheapest we could find during xmas season - most places hike up prices during holiday season). We were on the 21st floor, which gave us a beautiful view of the mountains and strip. 

I will say that unfortunately the ""gym"" wasn't worth much, which is mostly the reason why we decided to stay here (most ""gyms"" in hotels\/resorts are not included). It was mostly just a small concrete room with almost no equipment, of which was very worn out and not the best. Something is something though.

There is an RTC stop outside, which is convenient and customer service is great here.

When we arrived to check in we waited no more than two minutes to get checked in. It was very speedy and the people at the check in desks were extremely kind. Our room was exactly how I saw the example online which was WONDERFUL! 

The only flaw we had was the same day we checked in we went and saw some  of the Las Vegas strip. When we returned at 11:30 pm Vegas time to call it a night we discovered that not only did we not have cold water, but our sink didn't drain and the toilet didn't flush. We gave it 15 min. and still nothing worked. So I called the front desk and told them, what was happening. They offered to give us another room with two beds in it, which was equivalent to the price of our room that we were currently in. I didn't think that was fair and asked that they upgrade us for free because we had already unpacked our things, gotten ready for bed, and right before getting ready to call it a night they asked us to move to another room. To me that wasn't fair and the desk worker agreed. She talked to her manager and we were upgraded. It was the easiest conversation I've ever had. There wasn't an argument about upgrading us or anything. They even offered to send someone up to give us the key to the new room. The room they upgraded us to was MASSIVE! It was like two rooms in one. I must say we were very excited!

We left a $2 tip for the room service people and they did an EXCELLENT JOB in cleaning our room the whole time we were there. One lady actually left us a note to thank us. I really appreciated that and I actually put it in the scrapbook. 

The hotels location was really nice. I consider it to be the half way point between downtown Vegas and the strip. If you stay here buy the Monorail pass because the monorail stop is within walking distance from the hotel. It'll get you to MGM within 15 min. It was truly a GREAT investment!

The casino is very nice as well. The machines were nicely spread out and I really enjoyed how often the ladies taking beverage orders came around. It didn't matter where you sat they all always made sure you weren't thirsty. This hotels casino set up was the best I saw on the entire strip. It was so well organized. Not to mention the exits were easy to find. 

Overall the hotel was PHENOMINAL & I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! The service is WONDERFUL! In all honesty I am thrilled that I picked this hotel because it was everything I wanted and so much more! Not only did we get an AMAZING price on it, but we got an AMAZINGLY MEMORABLE STAY! The hotel truly helped build the memories that made our vacation unforgettable!

 THANK YOU STRATOSPHERE! YOU ALL WERE WONDERFUL!",0,0,0

If I was in Vegas for vacay I'd recommend staying at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay but I was ust cruising through and only gambled until 5:30am.  Ha.  Stratosphere wasn't that bad it just had a cheesy Casino and I didn't feel lucky there so we went to gamble at the Mandalay.  Still not very much luck but didn't really lose anything either.  The front desk sai that depening on how busy the rest of the strip is the same hotel room can go from $40\/night to $400\/night.  Glad it was a random Wednesday wit not much going on in town.  

Our room came with free ticket rides and a ride to the top of the tower but we didn't have the time to mess around.  It was back on the road and another 9 hours to CA.  

Oh one nice thing was that there is a parking lot across the street afiliated with the Stratosphere and there is always a security guard on the premises.  Although I couldn't park my car in the parking garage since I had a baby Uhaul (5' by 8') attached to my hip I had to park at the other lot.  Glad they had that option though, otherwise it would have been stuck in a bioch parking situation since they wouldn't let me valet.",3,2,1

He told me too bad I had a Groupon because he was about to give me a cheaper price. I asked how much cheaper, he said $10 each. I told him I would cancel my Groupon to buy his tickets and he told me ""no don't. you'll need a good reason.  You're not even saving that much."" Seriously? Why did you even bring it up if it isn't that much? Um... 20 dollars is a lot when the ticket is 25 dollars. Get real kid. 

So as I'm discussing this with him we heard a huge crash behind me and a man started screaming hysterically for security! Another worker at the booth said she saw someone fall over the edge by the escalators, from the second floor to the first floor. I was so upset and shocked. I was shaking and crying. The man continued screaming, they stared roping off he area... and this kid wanted to continue talking about prices with me! I mean really, people are screaming about a woman possibly falling to her doom and this kid wants to talk to me about Michael Jackson tickets. 

We had to leave the opposite way we came in, as we were not allowed to go back down the escalators where a woman was probably laying on the ground. So we had to walk past all kinds of abandoned and empty stores, sex shops, a smoke shop, a completely empty McDonald's... it was so depressing. When we finally got outside someone was doing a snot rocket into the grass. This place gives me a terrible vibe and I do not like it. My experience was incredibly upsetting.

It is an extra $10 a night and from what I understand, worth the price. The room we had was remodeled and clean. The only issue was a crack in the tub but I think it was more cosmetic. The other larger issue was that the doors needed to be soundproofed! Every time people walked by you heard them. One group was so loud I thought they were in front of our door. I went in the hall and they were six doors away but I could clearly hear their conversation before I opened the door.  Apparently it was a 4:00 am therapy session for cougars.

Check in - took a while but I didn't mind. The lady at the desk offered to upgreade me for $10 more per night or strip view for $20 per night extra.

Paid $7.50 per nigh resort fee for free access for tower tour + rides + coupon book (REMEMBER TO GO OVER IT NOTE IT DON'T TEAR IT BEFORE USING IT) 


Check - out -  a breeze. just give your check in paper work \/ fill out a form.

Ended up on the 8th floor, which is pool level. It's a bad choice if you want to sleep in because you'll hear constant chatter and slamming doors. The room itself was fine, I only had a few quirks. One was that the location for the towels and the towel holders were in really awkward places (not practical). Another problem was the hairdryer short circuited and we didn't another one in time to use that same morning. 

Other than those minor quirks, the hotel was practical. Admission to the Stratosphere tower is free for hotel guests, just bring your room key! The elevator travels at a speed of 35 mph, faster elevator!!!

My wife and I had not been on a trip since the wedding. I had saved up for this two-day vacation on her birthday. I had thought of everything: renting a nice car to make the trip more comfortable, buying tickets to her favorite shows... and booking a nice room in a hotel I had stayed in TWICE before.

Well, it was all ruined THE SECOND we arrived. After calling them the day before to warn them we were going to leave after work and thus arrive late, we drove about 5 hours from LA and arrived at 10:30pm. ""Sorry, we are out of non-smoking rooms, you're gonna have to take a smoking room"". Um, excuse me? We are not talking about the color of the bedsheets here. This is a matter of health & safety. I do not want to spend my weekend breathing someone else's bad habits. We asked for a manager. After all, it was our honeymoon. ROME KING did nothing. Barely even apologizing, he had a stern face, repeating that he cannot do anything. I was speechless. I had stayed at the Stratosphere twice and always talked highly of it. No commercial gesture, no upgrading, nothing. 

So here I was - at 11pm, trying to find another hotel I could stay at, after a 5-hour road trip - btw, I would still have to pay for this room since we couldn't cancel at that point. None. It was slightly after Christmas therefore everything is packed (or too expensive). It was only the beginning of our surprise. Once there, we found (besides the horrible smell) the crappiest room I've ever seen. Paint peeling off the walls, no hand soap, and even CRUMBS on the table from the previous guests! The light was coming from a lamp miserably hung on the wall from a chain, just as if we were in a dungeon. Sorry, but I did not sign up for a BDSM trip. 

You would think that at this point they couldn't lose any more decency. Well, you would be wrong. Even after trying hard to raise the temperature of the room (it was 48 outside), it was still cold. Was I too dumb to understand how the heater works? Maybe. But my wife couldn't find out either. We have to call maintenance who sends out a technician at freaking ONE in the morning. He spends 20mins with tools and noise to find out that it was not working because they had blocked the heater in that room. GREAT!

I will skip on the lack of basic amenities such as providing slippers to guests or toothpaste. They referred us to a gift shop where we could find anything for $$$. On top of that, the only reason I liked to stay there was for the tower privilege which have also become extremely pricy. We ended up having to pay $28 for a wristband to go on the rides where some were not even open and others had over 1h30 wait. 

Oh and by the way, everybody in that hotel is amazingly rude.

My honeymoon turned into a nightmare. Thankfully, everything outside the hotel was still fine. But I swore I was NEVER coming back again and that I would DETER anybody from ever stepping into their nasty-smelling casino. 

Oh and so will my wife with her 50k+ followers on Instagram and Twitter.",15,6,1

I booked 3 rooms in November for my wedding (February) I talked to the staff many times before I flew there, asking if we could have all 3 rooms on the same floor.  Each time they said that is fine and can make it happen. when we checked in I upgraded one to a suite and they said we could still get all 3 on the same floor, but the suite was the only one available at the time. the suite was on floor 16, at 3 they called and said the other rooms were ready. come to find out only one was.. and that was on level 21. then at 530 (an hour and a half after check in time) they said my third room was ready.  when we went down they said it wasn't ready and wouldn't be until 7, and it would be on floor 15.  so paying for a room that wasn't ready until 3 hours after check out.  Then I called the manager about my issue, and he was NO help what so ever. I explained I spoke to the staff many times and they said we would be on the same level. he was completely rude and then said he would move our other 2 rooms to ""upgraded"" rooms for free. the upgraded rooms were the exact same, except they didn't have a strip view. which we paid extra for, so there is lost money there.

Everytime I would drain the tub, the sink in the living room area would fill up and the whole room would smell like sewer. 

The first night there I called for room service and they told me they weren't doing room service that night, but yet the menu said ""room service 24\/7, 7 days a week.

All in all this was a horrible experience. I came to Vegas for my wedding, and this hotel made my stay more stressful than it should have been. 

The wedding chapel is extremely beautiful and the top of the world restaurant was amazing, with a great staff. As for the hotel I will never book at the Stratosphere again, nor ever recommend this hotel.",2,0,0

Thankfully my neighbor this time was very considerate.

I've been here three times, and my main complaint is that they charge $13 per person.  So it was $52 for our family of four.  I don't think that's right as they force you to walk past a whole bunch of little stores, loaded with hot dogs (if hungry), corn syrup laden sodas and about 150 million different varieties of Stratosphere key chains and refrigerator magnets.   I've never found -anything- that I had to have, nor would want to carry around with me after making a purchase.   

So here is my suggestion, I have heard this works but was not told about it until after paying for the elevator ride up each time.  Just tell them you are going to the restaurant and I don't believe you have to buy a ticket to do that.   And just so you are telling the truth, you know, not commiting fraud, do go in the restaurant, order a free glass of water and look at the menu.   I don't think you are at that point obligated to order food..   Hehehe   :)

The view is excellent and can be a little scary if you are scared of heights.   I do have a fear of heights some of the time, not always, not sure what the deciding factor is.   But up here we discovered that my Dad and Brother have a fear of heights as well.   My Dad grabbed the chain link fence and would not let go, and my Brother froze, refusing to go near the edge.   And when the roller coaster went by just above our heads, he refused to look up at it!  Hahah!    

One thing I found quite interesting, something now fixed, is that when on the inside floor (you don't have to go outside, but that's the best with the wind and all) the inside floor had glass windows that looked down.   While there were multiple signs saying ""DO NOT STAND ON GLASS"" (DUH!) surprisingly many people would, and look down.    Now I have no idea how much weight those were designed to handle (or if anyone fell through), they certainly didn't look real thick, as if designed to stand on.   But the last time I was there they had wooden boards covering all of those...   Hmmm.   

When up on top, outside looking out of Las Vegas and the endless deserts and distant mountains, I wondered what it would be like to base jump (skydive) off of here.   That would be a real rush.   

If you never had a chance to go in the World Trade Center, aside from the Sears Tower, this is one of the only places you can get up this high and the view is similar to that from the World Trade Center and Sears Tower as the cars look like ants and people are hard to even make out.   Pretty cool.   They just shouldn't charge so much if anything to go up and look....",3,2,3

The hotel was clean, the casino was fun and the food at the buffet was fine. Roxy's was good, but not great, the wait staff was slow. 

Our room (a 2 queen bed on the 21st floor) was very comfortable, though the pillows were a bit too soft. It was clean, and they changed the linens every day. The decor of the entire hotel is pretty outdated and not pretty, but who goes to Vegas to be wowed by the rooms?

The staff was friendly, helpful, and very accommodating. The observation deck was just about the coolest thing we did while there, and you can go up as many times for free as you'd like when you stay there. The rides looked terrifying, and I'm not sure why anyone would go on them, but those that did seemed to have a great time. The shops in the little mall part were good, the very last gift shop all the way at the top was cheap and fun, and the alcohol was super cheap as well! Some of the pricing was outrageous, but that's to be expected in Vegas. 

Complaints:
- There was little to no pressure from the shower head in the room. It made taking a shower tedious and long. 
- The pool closed at 6pm during the week, 7pm during the weekend. This is just ridiculous in my opinion. 
- Not only did the pool close early, but the hot tub jets didn't work. Kind of pointless. 
- The lifeguards paid no attention, and the little kids running around unsupervised were just awful. 
- Table games had high minimums 
- Far from the rest of the strip, a cab to Treasure island was about $10 (not to mention the $3 fee just to use a cc), and to Mandalay Bay it was $20! To freemont it was about $9.

As the girl was new she had management assisting her which I didn't mind. She got us our keys, gave me the details of the pool, restaurant, and things in the casino. We went upstairs to our room and it was a simple two queen bed room. I was satisfied. All we did in our room was sleep (which wasn't much)!

We had to run to a show, but when we got back later that night we asked to be moved to a different room. When we went back in that first room to grab our bags, the smell was even stronger.

When we asked to be moved to a different room we were given a room with a toilet that barely flushed (sometimes it wouldn't at all), mold on the shower curtain, dust and filth on every surface in the room, and a room view of a wall\/building (so a view of nothing at all). We also found a camera battery charger and phone charging cable with a nice layer of dust on them behind the dresser. The vent of the air conditioning unit was full of dust (we decided to sweat instead of use that), and there was a thick dirty layer of dirt, dust and lint on the fire sprinklers as well. We were too grossed out after that and didn't look any further for fear of what else we would find.

I booked a trip through Expedia, and my round trip cost for three nights and airfare was approximately $270 a person. Seriously, you can't beat that.

It's true, the Strat is on the far end of the Strip and quite the walk to all the true draws of Vegas. But, it has a great many benefits that I think make it a worthwhile hotel stay - not just including the price. The rooms are fairly basic, which might be a drawback to some, but I think it's to be expected considering its cost. Everything was clean, well maintained, and up to snuff. Really, if you're coming to Vegas to spend all your time in the room and you need frills and opulence, you've got different priorities than me. 

While it's true that it is not in the best looking part of town, I never felt unsafe or at risk in any way, even while walking my way to the main part of the Strip. Having said that, I wouldn't recommend making that walk because it's a LOT further than you think it is. Get a bus pass. 

Hotel staff were all friendly, courteous, and seemed to know their stuff. They had plenty of recommendations on restaurants, other non-gambling\/show things to do, and were very willing to accommodate any requests I had. They even watched my bags for the majority of the day on which I left as my flight didn't take off until 10pm and checkout was at 11am. For a small fee of $30, I was able to get a late check out of 3pm, but that still left me 7 hours to burn and I didn't want to lug my small backpack around.

The casino is definitely not as large as those further down the Strip, but the table games can be found with LOW minimums. I'm talking $5 blackjack. As someone who is not a huge gambler, I found this to be awesome and a great way to break yourself in. Plenty of slots too and more than enough eating options right in the hotel (although they may not be everyone's bag... I'll try to do separate reviews for those that I visited).

One additional perk of being a guest of the Stratosphere is being able to get to the top of the tower at no additional cost. The rides are definitely not my kind of thing, I don't even do rollercoaster that are on the ground let alone hundreds of feet off the ground on top of a tower, but the views from the observation deck and atop the tower are killer and can't be beat. Even if you're not staying here, I'd say it's worth the trip to get to the top at night and scope out the Strip from above. It might be even better on mind altering substances... not that I would know anything about that or those.

Yes, there are plenty of nicer, more expensive, more recently updated options in Vegas. But the Stratosphere suits me just fine and I had a great time there. For the cost, it can't be beat and I am sure I'll find myself staying here again in the not so distant future.",3,1,2

The hotel is conveniently located right in between the strip and downtown, so you don't get the traffic and madness of either one. The neighborhood and hotel itself are kind of sketchy. I didn't feel unsafe or anything, but I wouldn't walk around at night either.

I stayed at the ""renovated rooms"" which are much nicer than the regular ones. They are at least updated.

The size of the room was fine, the beds are comfortable but I have a huge issue with housekeeping. I stayed there for 10 nights and even though they came and made my bed and replenish toiletries everyday, they NEVER, not EVEN ONCE changed my sheets or scrubbed the tub, they didn't sweep or mop the tile or anything. 

If I have a choice in the matter I would much rather stayed somewhere else. 
I also ate at all the restaurants in there and all of them are from mediocre to nasty. 

They say that you get what you pay for, this is totally true at this hotel.
If you are on a budget, I recommend the Golden Nugget (downtown)",4,0,0

They have this cool restaurant on top, it's called Top of the World and you can see the panoramic view of Las Vegas..very pretty. The fitness center was a joke here, so please, don't bother working out. I say you make friends with people that are staying in fancier hotels, like Wynn, so you can get in :) I didnt check out the pool, but I heard it was renovated.

I could have spent hours up there just gazing across the valley.  You really get an idea of just how  big the Las Vegas metropolitan area is.  There's much more than just the strip and downtown that most of us are familiar with.

After the trip to the top of the tower, we caught the show ""Bite"".  It's a topless vampire show, and it was actually quite good.  It was much, much better than Crazy Girls as the Rivera.  Had a good time there.

Afterwards, we got something to eat at a 50's themed diner (but don't remember the name).  It was just so=so.  

Grabbed a fun book and played video poker for about an hour and a half.  Then a couple of drinks at the main bar before heading back South.  Not sure I'd want to stay here, but only because of the location.  It's way North on the strip and no monorail stop.

We were under the impression it would be somewhere cheap, but decent like Tropicana or TI.  Apparently he got the cheap part down, but def. bombed on the decent part when he told us it was the stratosphere.  It was too late to book a room somewhere else without putting a dent in our wallets, so thought ok how bad can this place be?  Now I can see why I always see cheap deals as low as 40 bucks for these rooms..

Room smelled like a mixture of stale cigarettes, mold, and funky butt.   The sheets were all pilled and I don't even want to think about if they were clean or not.  The decor is old and outdated, carpet looked nasty.  The hotel and casino in general is really old. Our view sucked, yay the parking garage.

I did not like all of the add on fees. Early check-in, renovated room, boarding pass printout, one hour late checkout. Two bath towels for a 2-person King room. No coffee in the room. 

The hotel's location is terrible.  It is too far removed from the main action of the Strip and also far from Fremont St. That should make them more accommodating not less. We paid $20 for a newer room and immediate check in (on a slow Wednesday in mid-December). There was an electrical problem with the only light in our bathroom and we were told a maintenance person was in their way. 15 minutes tops I was told. We had time to look out at the worst possible view...9th floor staring at heating\/AC\/lighting for a great expanse ahead of us. Called down and the front desk said it had been 5 minutes when I said we had been waiting exactly 12 minutes. After 20 minutes we went back to registration. What's the point of paying to check in early if you cannot use the bathroom?  I was at a different person to change our room and he challenged me that we paid the extra $20 for a newer room until I got out our receipt. The housekeeper should have had the light fixed before it was made available. 

Our our new floor, there were many rooms being remodeled close to the elevator. There was plaster all over the hall carpets during our stay because there was nothing down to protect the floors. 

Our stay was, thankfully, one night only. At 8am there was very loud yelling. I popped my head of of our door and heard a woman across the hall, several rooms down with the doors closed to both her room and our room. The noise traveled as clear as a bell. 

Took the elevator to the top of the tower and waited where the sign said the elevator would come automatically. We waited 15 minutes for the elevator. Dozens of people were waiting and we could hear the elevator chime but had no idea where else we might go as there were no employees anywhere nearby to ask. After 15 minutes our door opened. It was an elevator that opened at both the front and back. The elevator operator did not open both sides. I asked what the delay was about and he just shrugged without a word despite being from the US. 

The service across the board was nonexistent and the practice of charging a la carts for everything is like nothing I have ever experienced.

The room was nice, and the tub was big. You do have to pay a resort fee, but it does not include free wifi, so for that you have to pay extra. The resort fee does include unlimited trips to the tower, but you do have to go through security to get up there, and you cannot take tripods up with you. 

I was unimpressed by the bars and the restaurants in the hotel and casino. There is a Starbucks right by the elevators, which was good. There are some shops on the upper level of the casino, but they looked very empty. The casino itself was not very smoky, which is nice since neither one of us smokes. 

The pool is nice. It wasn't very busy the entire time we were there. It's more of a lounging pool, so I think the deepest it got was 3 1\/2 feet. Unfortunately, it closed at 7pm, which seemed a little early to me. 

I would say the worst part of staying here, were the ladies at the information desk. Every single time you walked by, they hassled you. I'm guessing they were trying to sell the casino members club deal, but I never stopped to find out because they were so pushy and rude. I really think the casino should reconsider having their employees do that.

The Room:  We paid for a room with a strip view. The first room we were given was comparable to Motel 6. The room was old, small, and outdated. The website only shows their newly remodeled rooms even though that is not what you get. Our strip view? Blocked completely by the legs of the stratosphere tower. After complaining we were moved to another room with a ""view"" and we're told we wouldn't be charged the view fee but still needed to pay $20 a day more for the nicer room. This room? View of the SLUMS and freeway and during our first shower, the shower head flew off and hit my husband in the back. Had to complain again. This time I was told we would be upgraded to a king spa room and it would be ready at 2pm the next day. Room #3 wasnt ready until 4:30 and we had to leave all of our belongings at the bell hop desk all day long until we could move. This room finally had a view of the strip. 

General Complaints:  The house keepers and people who work here are EXTREMELY LOUD. This is Vegas. People are trying to sleep around 8 am to 11 am. The maids and maintenance guys stand in the hallways yelling and laughing and doing everything they can to wake up the entire hotel. Want to sleep off that hangover? Hold on. Let me run the vacuum every 15 seconds while kackling like a witch outside of your door right next to your ""Do Not Disturb"" sign. 

The AC only goes down to 68 and the room NEVER reached 68 degrees. Also, the unit is virtually silent so it doesn't even help to block out the sounds from outside of the room. 

The ice machines are located on either end of each floor. The floors are HUGE. If you have a room anywhere in between, be prepared to have to hike for ice. Also, the ice bucket will allow for enough ice to make 4 drinks and it's metal, so your ice will melt within 30 mins. 

The ONLY positive things we can say about the hotel is the about the view from the top of the Stratosphere and the food at their restaurant, McCall's.

I must say the view is amazing and that's as far as I'll go with positive feedback .  My wedding consultant was ASHELY MARSHAL  and here is where it all begins..  At first when I would email her she would never respond but if my fiance did she would respond in less than an hour also When we first went to the stratosphere and she was showing us the reception room of course we like the views but their was this pole right smack in the middle of room and she stated they were going to be doing some remodeling and things would be different and the pole would be moved we kept questioning about it and she kept saying ""they have a way to move things around"" with a hopeful look on her face. Now again she would email my husband so I had to go through him to get what I wanted I should of put a stop that and her condescending ""HONEY"" and let's not even touch the subject of her dam attitude. 

The day of my wedding was an overall good day. the butler was absolutely sweet and on point, things ashley did say would be changed in the ceramony area were not ex: the hideous clown chairs  And the 1950's silk flower arrangement. 

Now ashley never told us that after the reception we would be responsible in cleaning up even though our contract states we paid a clean up fee. 
I had emailed ashley to get my header in order of my color theme never did she respond and i have the emails to prove this, in the contract it states to coordinate with ,the wedding planner .well she decided to surprise me and printed on baby blue paper when my color theme was red, black and gold. Also my 36x36 wooden board guest book with a heart string design it either got thrown in the trash or someone stole it we called numerous time to security to check cameras and to ashley also.. it's going on 5 months and still don't know what happened to it . She also tried last min to rearrange the table seating chart after I had already made seating arrangements and purchased place cards. After the reception while cleaning up I got so upset to find out we could have purchased more time I didn't want the party end, the guest were enjoying themselves. Once again something my coordinator should have given me the option of. 

If ur going to get married at the stratosphere for its view go to dawn not ashley her head is so far up her ass and more focus on her own wedding.  she didn't make my day as wonderful as she told me. Maybe she can take a class in wedding coordinating at the local community college or adult center or  evem the Jennifer Lopez wedding planner movie.

And the video well all I can say is my cell phone could have taken better quality video. it looks like I'm watching a 19 80's  vcr video or a cheap security camera like the local quickie mart located down the street,  also the camera girl was in it the whole time and her camera was in the way of everything. As ASHELY claims all cameras and video cameras that were used for wedding were of quality. Just so happens that the camera company admitted to my husband what camera was used for photos and that the video was not filmed in Hd.. so once again ASHELY doesn't know what she is talking about.

Again. If ur on a budget and want a breathtaking view and okay food yes u can have at stratosphere for $15,000-20,000. But stay away from ASHELY she completely messed up my whole experience I told her back in november I would like to speak to her manager still waiting on that call :\/",0,0,0

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The room - while basic - provided all the necessities (even had a flat screen!).  The floor I stayed on was apparently just remodeled.  The observation deck on top provided an incredible view of the strip at night.  Several economical dining options were also provided (in the mall area, as well as roxy's diner).  The only reason I give it three stars is that cigarette stench permeated the casino floor.  The smoke smell also seemed to travel through the walls into the room we were staying in.  Additionally, the hotel is located at the far end of the strip. This requires guests to either have to take a cab (cost prohibitive), rent a car (annoying), or take the deuce bus (painful).  All in all, I had a pleasant stay and recommend the Stratosphere for the budget traveler.",0,0,0

At first we thought it might just be a what ever hotel we had never been inside of it. I thought that because of the awesome price it must have a down side. Well as soon as we got there there is valet parking very nice and helpful young men always smiling. We walk in to check in hassle free we were there maybe 5 min and had someone take care of us and we upgraded our room to an amazing view! The bathroom was very nice so was the room very cozy and neat and nicely decorated too
 The atmosphere is very loud in the casino but the room was nice and quiet the first night we got married had a great time we went up to the tower. It's free to go up when you stay at the hotel the lounge there is so amazing it has a breath taking view of he whole city and your mouth just drop open in amazement! Although if your not to good with heights your legs will get a tingle in them lol my husband was Afraid bit got over it the next day. The hotel it's self has so many things to keep you occupied. Our second night we were out and about the city and it's very easy to get back and forth from the hotel every thing is close. We came back to the hotel to see the pin up show it's great music dancers and the men love it since the girls get to show a little more but not every thing  as a women I enjoyed it very much the music and dancing is just great!  Today was our check out date and let me tell you it was even faster than the check in! If I could give more stars I would it's great I loved it and will definitely recommend to friends and family .

She did a fantastic job cleaning and I really appreciate it!  Everything was dusted and that made me feel even more comfortable in this room!  

The shower head was a little crappy, but worked so I can't complain.  No standing water which was a plus considering this is an older hotel!    The bed isn't too comfortable but that's probably due to my pregnancy.  There is no microwave or refrigerator in my room but I'm sure there are rooms that offer them...just not this one.  

There was a mix up with Starbucks and room service when I placed an order over the phone.  The operator accidentally sent me to Starbucks and when my order never came I contacted room service (which is who I wanted all along) and a nice young lady, Vanessa (I think that was her name) and the manager took care of me and got my Starbucks order canceled and ordered the correct breakfast.

While waiting, asked Front Desk Supervisor for another room, so we can sleep...refused because hotel is 'sold out' which is, at best, a sad lie. Let's pretend the hotel is sold out...not everyone has checked in yet...and she could have given us a room while this gets fixed so we can go to sleep.

We got the room on their site for 40 a night including resort fee and opted for the upgrade if available. When we arrived the line for check in was a bit long. Check in is rather slow and though not friendly the staff was not unfriendly either We were informed that there was an upgrade and we opted for the 20 dollar more for a room with a Jacuzzi tub. One note on this they neglected to tell us they don't keep the card you book with on file so when we went to use the internet we were told we'd have to come back down to put a card on file. I wish they'd asked if we'd care to put one on file who wants to stand in that long line again. The lady finally took the info over the phone.  The room was nice clean spacious and a huge bathroom with a tub big enough to swim in. I can't say enough wonderful things about the tub LOL. The bed was big and comfy and the room had a modern sleek feel. These rooms are in the new tower so maybe that is why I didn't have the complaints some others did. The only two complaints I have is that there is no fridge and when someone shuts a door anywhere near your room your door will rattle it's odd.  I loved watching the bungee jumping channel very cute. Won some money playing deal or no deal slots not much but hey it was fun The casino still has real roulette tables which I'm glad I hate the slot version. Valet was quick & efficient and we made use of it because tit is a bit away from the strip. The only other problem I had was when we checked out we tried the in room check out and it said it wasn't working then when we went downstairs and stood in line not so long this time we were told we were already checked out so they might want to look into that because it is an inconvenience. All in all it was a great room at a good price so I'd come back,0,0,0

I did a fair amount of research beforehand, so I was expecting a small bathroom, the sink to be outside the bathroom, and just not the most splendid room. Whatever. I was just planning to sleep there. I was also anticipating the possibility of hearing through the walls. Now I learned about this after I had booked the vacation, so I thought, eh we'll see what happens. The first night. Was. Awful. I'm a light sleeper to begin with and I do wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, but I felt like I was woken up 500 times. You can hear everything that goes on around you. Every door slam. I heard a Hispanic lady speaking while playing music, a man flipping out on the phone, a toilet flush that startled me... I can sometimes hear the far away screams of people doing the tower activities way above. 

Deluxe room experience: 1 star.

So after my terrible night I decided to upgrade to a Select room the next day at an additional $25 per night. I suddenly went from a room reminiscent of the two-star Ramada Inn I stayed at to a room that reminded me so much of the four-star Courtyard Marriott I stayed at earlier this year. The room was very nice. Everything about it was significantly better. It was cleaner, bigger, better-looking, had a better view, and was quieter. The switch saved the experience for me, though it was unfortunate I even had to switch.

I'm not saying those are top notch hotels on the strip but I can far better justify paying over $100 for a nice room in one of those than $139 in the Stratosphere.

The novelty of this place truly is its view, which I would only really recommend at night because during the day you see Vegas for the kind of dessert it really is. The night view is amazing, but the restaurant should be skipped because at $$$$ I was expecting my steak to dance for me. It didn't.

The casino is small and smokey, it's kind of old-ish and in need of renovation and the room really transported me back to the Sahara next door which I though the Stratosphere was a bit above. I think if you get this place for very very cheap, it would probably be an ok stay, despite the fact that it is quite further down the strip and you will have to drive.

Otherwise, just come here for the night view and leave it at that.",4,2,2

This place is difenetely far from the strip but you can always get the 24 hour bus pass for $7 so you don't have pay for a taxi.  From the Stratosphere to Circus Circus, it's $8 on a taxi.  If you don't want to wait for the bus, you can always rent a scooter for $30 for 24 hours and drive around wherever you want.

The swimming pool could have been a lot better but atleast you get a nice view of the city since it's on the 8th floor of the hotel. 

There's lots of slots and the tables start at $5 minimum.  I didn't really have much luck with the slots but my boyfriend did win $40 on a slot machine.  Lucky him.  I won $10 on Roulette.  The tables here are kind of harsh, we went through $120 in like an hour.  

If you want to get a great view of the city, go to the tower and you'll have to pay $16 for each person.  I haven't gone myself but i've heard it's def. worth it.

Since my fiancÃ© and I stayed at the newly remodeled rooms, the self-parking garage is easily located near the exit which was very convenient. Like everyone said, the surrounding area is very HOOD...Don't walk around outside when it's dark!!! I like the fact that it was far from the strip and navigating around town made it easy to take the back streets. 

Checking in\/out was easy; there's no lines. The employees at Stratosphere were very helpful and courteous. Regarding the remodeled rooms: the king size bed was okay; it could be better by making it softer. We definitely found the bathroom to be spacious, and the jacuzzi tub was awesome!

As far as appearances go it's nothing to write home about. The most impressive thing is the tower. It's on the northern end of the strip, far away from most of the action. Luckily we rented a car so travel to and from wasn't an issue. In the plus column there was always plenty of self-parking.  There is a small, shady hotel across the street that was pretty old. I wouldnt have been surprised if a crazy person had run out of it and tried to start something. I dont know what people on here are talking about, our check-in was a breeze. We got to the hotel well before our check-in time and were easily able to get a room.  Yeah, about the rooms...

The rooms are pretty basic: dresser with drawers, a nightstand, ironing board, flat-screen television, small table with 2 chairs. It's pretty much like a Motel 6. The decor was pretty ""blah"" and looked like something out of the late 90s\/early 00's. One important thing was missing from our room: an alarm clock! The only way you know what time it is is to turn on the TV or use your phone\/watch. The remote to our TV was wonky, you had to press the buttons several times to get anything to work. The bathroom is small, but it does the job. The tub is unusually tall and I almost slipped when I was stepping out of it.  There's room service available, but the pages were placed inside our book backwards and upside down. Weird.

The service we received was OK. My friend noticed that the sheets on his bed had not been changed on his bed, but was OK with it since we were hardly ever there. Night 2 rolls around and we notice that his sheets STILL hadnt been changed despite a service sign on the door. It's like they just made the bed but never cleaned the sheets. 

It was my first time in Vegas and I take this as a lesson learned. It was just OK, but I'll definitely stay on the southern end at one of the nicer places the next time I visit.",0,0,0

I have traveled all over and stayed at many different hotels from 2 stars to 5 stars and this takes the cake on one of the worst. 

Not only did I find a COCKROACH on the first day on the night stand next to where we sleep at night..!!!!!! Which alone is horrible and appalling, but the tub was completely disgusting with hair left from previous hotel guests and other particles. I can't express how important cleanliness is to me when staying away from home. After I PERSONALLY cleaned the tub to relax before a night out I turned on the jets and two jets FELL right out of the tub! I tried to fix them but they were obviously broken and had been for some time. When I drained the tub after a bath, all the water came straight up into the shower drain (they are completely separate from one another) with such a putrid smell I had to leave the bathroom for a good 30 minutes before I could then WASH the shower floor so I could step in it without getting dirty water\/sewage all over our feet. 

The entire hotel floor stunk of vomit or some sort of stench we could never figure out. Did I mention this was the suite that we HAD to upgrade (and pay for) because the hotel room we were given previously had a view of the parking lot with the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in Vegas? The elevator from our floor to the lobby was sticky and the elevator button was broken from stickiness or some other substance blocking it from working our entire stay.

All we could hear the entire time we were in our hotel room (which we tried to stay out of as much as possible) was the shaking of the elevators going up and down and the doors opening. I will never stay or recommend anyone to ever stay at the Stratosphere. I am appalled and disgusted with the conditions and customer service of this hotel.

The room we got was mediocre and did not really have a view of anything other than a wall. There were some stains inside the drawers and the tissue box was never replenished. And on the last night, the shower\/bathtub drain clogged!

There's a $7.50 per night resort fee in addition to the regular charge that is supposed to cover these amenities, but obviously it wasn't enough! This fee also gives you access to the top of the tower, which is listed as a $60 value. This doesn't include the rollercoaster and so all you can do is look around. That's cool and all, but why would it even cost $60 to ride up an elevator? And once was enough.

Some people fell for it only to later watch these Urchins take their easy cash, walk over to the Circle K to purchase a large can of beer. Be diligent of your surroundings or you could be the next robbery victim. I could say more but hopefully I have painted the picture.

The interior appeared tired and worn-out. I never saw the casino very busy. There were some ""ladies of the evening"" poaching for clients at the bar (Yes, they let it be known who they were).

The rooms (I did get a good room rate for the seminar but you get nailed for everything else) had the same old and tired look supplemented with a musty, dank smell. The folks who stayed there with me but in different rooms also had this issue. The plumbing needs replacing. My shower head was clogged with water minerals, which meant the amount of water and pressure was greatly reduced. Others had issues with their sinks clogging.

This is like the only casino anywhere that still regularly sends me offers. Had zero noise or smoke problems on the last two stays and the rooms are always cleaned well and in good shape. There can be a bit of a wait at check-in but not as bad as central Strip properties and they are always really pleasant, and always get me a room w\/o conjoining door upon request with no problems.

-Snagged this place for $54 on Hotwire for the Friday of Halloween weekend.  There's also an additional $7.50 resort fee.
-We were in the Select tower which has their remodeled rooms.  The rooms were new, nice, clean, and modern.  First impressions of Stratosphere are usually ""ugh, it's the old hotel that's on the far side of the strip"".  If you can get a remodeled room, it's actually quite nice.
-Guests get free admission to the tower which was a nice little bonus.  I wished we got a chance to go up the tower at night, but we arrived too late.  The daytime tour was OK.  

Overall, we were very pleased with the price we paid Halloween weekend and the fact that we got a remodeled room.  Yes, it's a bit far from the lively  center of the strip, but that didn't matter to us.",1,0,0

Why? Since this vacation wasn't exactly planned our bank roll wasn't as big as if we had planned for it and Stratosphere was offering the best rate for our dollar.

When we finally got to Strat we headed to the front desk and waited. It wasn't that long but seemed longer because there wasn't really anything special to look at or distract us. Finally get to the counter fill out our paperwork pay our bill and we are off to our room on the 10th floor. Get too our room open the door and thought we were in a Motel 6. The rooms were very basic and plain. After the first night sleep we all wake up in pain because the beds were terribly uncomfortable. I could of slept on the floor and been more comfortable.

We didn't spend much time here at all. Because we were staying at the hotel we all had free passes to the top of Strat everyday but didn't once use them.

Each day we would leave and walk on over to The Sahara to catch the monorail. It's not that far of a walk but let me tell you its kind of a seedy side of town. I would not recommend making this walk solo unless your packing heat or looking to score something (j\/k).

Even though this place didn't knock my socks off I didn't hate it. It's perfect if your on a budget and dont mind being on that side of town.

I heard they have recently renovated all their rooms and from the pics it actually looks great so maybe one day i'll be back.",2,1,1

The first one was in their older section of the hotel which has not been renovated. This room was spacey, with two flat screen TVs (why?!) and relatively clean. But the bathroom and sink lights stopped working after I switched them on and off once. There was enough light from other parts of the room and since I was gonna stay only one night in that room, I didn't bother complain. There's some sort of train\/light rail running outside and despite being on the 21st floor, I could still hear it quite clearly. 

The next day I moved into the newer part (premier room I think) and it was significantly nicer. Our next door neighbor got into physical fights and was really noisy so we called the front desk and within a few seconds, the noise stopped. I wondered what they did.

If you do pay for internet, pay for the one in your room (I think you get a password from your tv before paying online). Don't pay for the Starbucks network that you can get downstairs because once you come back to your room, it won't work. We made this mistake and double paid. Overall a pleasant experience and affordable. I'll stay somewhere close to the city center next time though.",4,0,1

But if you like a hotel that's clean, simple, comfy, and isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg then I say this place will do the job easy.

Location: It's just off the strip, but you can ride the monorail for $12 all day. It takes you to several hotels on the strip, so you can walk around and get your Vegas exploring in.

Hotel: It's an older hotel, but it's nice enough. The rooms show their age a bit, but they are clean and the beds are comfortable. The tubs could definitely use some TLC, because you can tell they are old but the bathroom was clean. I wish the water pressure was better, and the bathroom had pretty poor ventilation. The AC unit was quiet, though, and the room got the job done when it came to what it was there for - sleeping.

Pool: The rooftop pool was AMAZING and super fun. The only thing I didn't like was that the music was way too loud. I liked the music, but maybe just turn it down a few notches so people can have a decent conversation. Anyway, the view is incredible and the drinks are super tasty. They are 2 for 1 most of the time.

Casino: There was tons of slots to choose from, a section of table for poker players, and tons of table games.

Shops\/restaurants: There was quite a few shops\/restaurants to choose from, and plenty of slots and tables to play. The Top of the World restaurant was pricey, but the food was amazing and the service was great. The view was breathtaking, and the restaurant rotates very slowly so that you can get a 360 view.

The shows: I only saw MJ Live, but it was so fun and the closest you will get to seeing MJ. We got the VIP tickets with a discount for $65, and got a table right up front, just off the stage.

The view: The view from the top of the building is amazing, and I definitely recommend it.

Rides: The rides were super fun! I only did Insanity once because it spun too much for my liking and made my tummy unhappy, but X-Scream and The Big Shot were both amazing! It's crazy to be above the other buildings. If you like thrill rides, then definitely try the rides out.

Staff: The staff was friendly and helpful.

Tip: get the Players card, it gets you special discounts throughout the hotel.

All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with my stay. It was a nice enough hotel, it had a lot to do, and it was super affordable.",2,0,4

I was kind of worried since the mammoth Orleans hotel sold out every single one of their thousands of rooms for Friday night because of the Mr. Olympia contest going on in town.  Amazingly, I was able to get a hotel on the Strip for a mere $68 which was less than half of the rack rate for that night.  

I was leery at first though.  I never bothered visiting the Stratosphere before in all of my other trips to Vegas.  Yes, it's on the Strip, but it is so far away from all of the action.  And aren't they kind of gimmicky with that free-falling, tower views, and everything?  Rest assured though, I had a pleasant stay.  It really all began with the check-in which was so warm and hospitable -- thanks, Nancy!  She hooked me up with a coupon which allowed me either a free bloody mary, a glass of champagne, or ceviche at the Top of the World restaurant which is where I promptly had lunch.  Guests at the hotel have free access to the tower and all of the great views which is definitely a good value.  The room itself was pretty simple though, especially by Vegas standards.  The bed was comfortable, but the bathroom was tiny and there was no hint of luxury to be found.  For a single night and for what little I paid, I couldn't complain though.  The casino didn't seem that big and the scantily clad card dealers weren't really my thing.  I ultimately found myself driving to the MGM Grand for my entertainment.

The price was really cheap, it was at least 40 dollars cheaper then the other hotels we looked at for the same night. 
-When you stay there you also get access to the tower for free
-the pool is beautiful. 
-There is also a lovely restaurant Ruby's with the sweetest waitresses EVER in it.  
-It's also fairly close to bus stops (A bus pass was only 7 dollars for 24 hours so not bad). 
-The rooms were lovely, and the beds were super comfortable. It was extremely clean and the hair dryer worked well. Lot's of space, oh and the curtains do well blocking out the light! 

Things I wasn't impressed with:
-The people working the counters had no idea what was happening. I called for a late check out and asked them to charge me, they then told me I'd be charged, which I responded was the point and I was okay with, and then they reminded me I'd be charged. Right. Then on check out they were also a little confused as well. 
-The Starbucks in the hotel is AWFUL, worst service, worst attitude, worst cup of coffee ever!!!!! (and I love Starbucks, just don't go to this one). 
- The concierge had no idea what was happening around, no deals we could get, or offers we could take advantage of except for some deal for 140 dollars (sorry not a deal).

I knew it was in the ghetto but we were trying to have fun while still saving money. We figured that since we were getting the Luxury Spa Room and they had free valet parking available (free meaning they tack on an extra $8 a day, but that wasn't a big deal on the whole) we wouldn't have to deal with any of those issues.

When we got to the hotel, the room was not much larger than the cheapest motel room we can find here in Long Beach. The ""oversized jetted garden tub"" advertised on their website was a little bit wider than the average tub but much shorter. I'm only 5'4"" and I couldn't lay in the tub, I had to either sit up straight or put my feet out. Not very relaxing. Thanks to the bed and pillows that were so awful I had back pains the entire weekend, I was hoping the ""jacuzzi"" tub would help sooth me. It made things worse because it was so uncomfortable.

When we very politely expressed our disappointment they offered to ""do us a favor"" and upgrade us to the next room up...for $200. What a nice favor.

Even though the room was something like 35% off the normal price, we still feel incredibly ripped off. This was NOT worth the money.

We considered leaving and getting a refund but we were so tired we just decided to make due. We went down to the casino and gambled a little. What a terrible place to gamble. Not only do most of the dealers not speak English, they are not very polite. This was my first time in Vegas as an adult and they made me feel like crap for it. They kept snapping at me in Vietnamenglish and it got to the point that I just couldn't stay there anymore. They had me on the brink of tears just for not knowing how to properly play blackjack.

The first night was just terrible because I was scared to even go outside to get the car. The view of the out-of-business hotel with the broken down fence and the bums walking through traffic asking people in their cars for money made me so nervous that we just stayed at the hotel instead of going somewhere to enjoy ourselves. I live in downtown Long Beach, I'm not afraid of bums, but this place looked so shady that I thought we might be shanked.

The view from the top was alright. I suppose I'd have enjoyed it more if it didn't just accentuate the fact that our room had a view of a parking garage.

The one positive about this place is Roxy's, their 24-hour diner. They had a very nice, very friendly staff. There was a long wait but the atmosphere was nice. The food is expensive but understandably so. And frankly, it was incredibly delicious.

Bottom line: I would not recommend this place to anyone, ever. There are better places you could stay at for the same price.",3,4,1

Once at the top you'll be amazed at the club like scene waiting for you just around the corner.  Its every cheating husbands dream as this spot is surely romantic.   

Now go take your date outside, enjoy the view of Las Vegas.  You'll see over the horizon as the city lights up your soul to achieve big things.

First of all, we booked this hotel through Lasvegas.com thinking that they were advertising a good deal. The deal included a 2 for 1 thrill ride pass which we thought would be really great, but it turns out that the pass is only about $25 so it's not like it was great savings. The price we paid for the hotel was pretty much on par with the nice hotels on the main strip area, so it was definitely not worth it to drive in traffic to get to all the hotter areas. We arrived at about 1:00 PM and had to pay a $10 early check In fee even though you know the room is ready because they were able to check you in. That is very unbecoming considering you are paying an average of $100\/night for the weekend. It just shows that the hotel is struggling when they are unable to waive the $10 fee. Their resort fee of $17\/night is also ridiculous, especially when the pool is not even functioning. Completely not worth the money. 

That covers the money.  Here's the hotel in general. Gross, dingy, old, outdated, paper thin walls, non working TV and phone, pushy sales people upon arrival through the casino side. I had to call for security twice in one night because I could hear my neighbors music and conversations at 4:30 AM due to the walls being so thin. They finally quieted down after security visited which I could also hear every word. So sad that you can't party in your room freely because your neighbors can hear you. I know it's vegas and its party time, but at some point one needs to sleep. The bathroom curtains and tub were dingy, dirty, and old. The toilet had stains, the walls were ugly, the ""strip view"" room was not worth the extra money because you couldn't see anything since it's so far. Unfortunately, if I could give it 0 stars I would, but I guess since there has to be a star, I'll give it to the bacon wrapped jalapeÃ±o and red pepper prawns at McCall's. That stuff was delicious, and $9 for 3 prawns is not terrible. They also have a blackberry and blueberry mojito that is delicious, but not strong at all. Top of the world dining was not good enough for the price paid and the views were better in the evening time but once again, not great.

She did have a trainer with her but she wasn't being much help. I booked this trip 4 months in advance and had a detailed description of what I needed. I needed  two beds in each room with adjoining rooms. Right away she told me  they didn't have  what i requested, and I started getting upset because I told her that I booked the rooms four months ago and I even called to confirm what I had needed. And the person on the phone told me it would not be a problem they had  my reservation exactly as I had requested. So the lady goes and talks to the manager comes back out and says oh we can give you a discount on an upgraded room usually it's $30 a night but will give it to you for 15 and that way you can have your joining rooms and two beds in their new upgraded tower. Which wasn't very well upgraded to say the least. The rooms are kinda small and the maids absolutely sucked. we had put the service sign up on the door so they can clean and they didn't show up til damn near 4 o'clock and all they did was make the bed. they left the trash cans full. And all the trash in the room . The water was shut off for 4-5 hours one day when we were there which was pretty ridiculous. we couldn't even flush the toilet and wash your hands in  our room. The nice part about this is that we found a lot of nice places to gamble in the hotel we met up with a pitboss named Mike, he is absolutely great he told us all kind of secrets and what we can do to get upgrades next time we come. we did a lot of gambling in the casino and drinking in the casino. everything was great except for the whole check in process and the water being out. There's a great little diner called roxys that's open 24 \/7 inside the hotel. Other than that place so there's not really a lot to eat in the casino but it wasn't a big deal because the prices were reasonable. I would probably stay at this casino again if they can get my reservations right. We go to Vegas probably every 6 months for a couple days at least it would be nice to finally have a home days place that we know we can stay in Philadelphia round from hotel to hotel we all enjoyed the stratosphere except for the check in process in the crappy made those things can be overlooked in the the name of having good fun",0,0,0

The only issues I encountered were the obvious ones of the Strat being so far from everything else that we had to cab it everywhere. I also tried to order room service late night after reading in the hotel guide book that it was 24\/7 only for them to be closed until the morning. 

All in all it was very satisfying.

Ps. BEST part of the Strat is the amazing drink specials they have running pretty much all the time. The only spot on the strip you can get so much good alcohol for cheap.",1,0,0

I wouldn't stay there again, but we had never been to Vegas and are not exactly locals, so I didn't know what I was doing.  We got a pretty nice room with a big bathroom.  You're not in the room a lot anyways in Vegas.  We actually had quite a lot of fun at the casino bar and made a whole bunch of random friends.  What I liked about the atmosphere was the non-pretension.  My boyfriend and I have some vague characteristics of east-coast frigid Boston snobs, but honestly we enjoy talking to normal, chain smoking Americans in kind of skanky bars more than going to nightclubs.  So we had tequila shots with some rocker dude who had some connection to motley cru, played blackjack with an arizona mother of 6, and generally had a pretty good time.

In terms of location...it's not central  We walked to a lot of stuff on the strip, but we're walking fiends.  We also found the monorail to be wayyyyy more convenient than the deuce.  If given the choice again, I would have booked a more central location, even if it cost more.  The upstairs area about the casino is insanely sketchy and gross.  It's like a mall in that there's lots of teenagers wandering around, but there's also really skeevy stores and a fat tuesday.  The tower was a big disappointment; the view was ok, but not that special.  All the neon blurs together at that height.  The bar at the top cost us $16 for 2 cans of budlight.  I'm not kidding.  

Overall, I can't really recommend Strat unless you want to do both the strip and downtown Vegas equally.  Then it might be more convenient.  Come here to gamble or drink for a night though if you wanna meet and mingle with cool people who aren't a-holes.  You can hear some good stories.",2,0,2

Since all the hotels in Vegas now starting adding resort fee in your stay, we've decided to book a room at Stratosphere Tower because the resort fee only cost $14 instead of $20 elsewhere and it includes unlimited tower admission, the only downside internet is not included in the resort fee.


We stayed in the Stratosphere SELECT room, which I believe is the nicest room than the deluxe and premier room. The room is very modern with modern tiles lining the restroom and 1\/5 of the room. It has flat screen tv with no HD content at all. Why is it that most hotels in Vegas has flat screen tv but it's not in High Definition. 

Here's a steady HD video of the new select room I shot: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Haq4fcSq-HY

The hallway to our room looks really nice. The only complain I had with the room is that they install water saving shower head. The water pressure wasn't that strong, and I had to spend more time in the shower to get myself clean, so the defeat the purpose of installing water saving shower head. I hate when hotel goes green.

So for those, who planning on staying at Stratosphere Tower, I strongly recommend staying in the SELECT room because it's just as nice as if you were to stay on the center Vegas strip.

A bit annoyed cause I called the front desk and they said it was water heated. Second ROOM SERVICE FOOD WAS AWFUL. I asked for well done and got a rare steak. The pricing was about 50$ for crappy red meat. I wish there was a better amenity such as free shuttle to the strip or even a better discount for the tower rides. Only get like 20$ off the sky jump and the first time I called the representative said they dont even offer a discount for hotel guest. Will not repeat.

This was when the hotel had just opened so it actually wasn't too bad.  Yes, this was almost 15 years ago...

Today, I remember that first stay here like it was yesterday but the hotel is definitely dated.  The rooms are old and need renovations.  The renovated rooms aren't too bad.

I rarely stay at this hotel anymore but it's probably the best deal in town.  You can get a room on the strip (albeit way at the north end of the strip) for probably about 1\/3 the cost of a cheap place on the actual strip (think ti, planet hollywood, etc.).

When I'm in Vegas I rarely spend any time in my hotel room so this place is cool.  The cab line isn't too long and the tables are friendly.  This is sort of like the charm of old school downtown Vegas on the strip.

As long as you know what you're getting yourself into...it's a great place for a great deal.  If you come here expecting the opulence of the Bellagio, Ventian, Wynn, Mandalay, Caesar's, etc...then you will be disappointed.

We found that both Treasure Island and Cosmopolitan had free parking so we would drive to either of these and make it our home base for the day. I do wish we would have stayed in a more central location so we could come in and out of our room throughout the day to grab things, change, or nap. 

When we checked in, we asked for a room with a view and were given the option to upgrade. The reception guy said the room we were going to get without the upgrade was facing a wall\/ac unit and has more outdated furniture. No thank you!

Puh, joa...wo fange ich an.

Wir waren im Mai fÃ¼r 5 NÃ¤chte hier. Das Stratosphere punktet mit Sicherheit durch die relativ gÃ¼nstigen Zimmerpreise, was uns dazu bewegt hat, hier zu buchen.

Die Lage ist natÃ¼rlich eher semi-optimal, am Ende des Strips, aber es gibt regelmÃ¤Ãige Busverbindungen den Strip rauf und runter. (ca. 8 USD)

Beim Check-In gab es einige Unstimmigkeiten, lasst euch da nix vom Pferd erzÃ¤hlen und besteht im Zweifel auf das Zimmer, was ihr gebucht habt, unabhÃ¤ngig davon, was sie euch zu VerfÃ¼gbarkeiten auftischen wollen. Wir haben im Endeffekt jetzt ein Upgrade buchen mÃ¼ssen auf ein Zimmer, welches wir eigentlich regulÃ¤r gebucht hatten.

Unser Zimmer (Raucherzimmer auf Etage 6) war in Ordnung und der Zimmerservice aufmerksam und grÃ¼ndlich. 

GrundsÃ¤tzlich hatten wir laut Rezeption schon eine ""gehobene"" Etage, aber der GerÃ¤uschpegel nachts war schon enorm. Vegas halt...wer hier Ruhe und Entspannung sucht, sollte woanders hin.

So feierten die Leute auf den Fluren ihre Millionengewinne, es roch stÃ¤ndig nach mehr oder weniger legalen Substanzen und hinter jeder TÃ¼r waren andere Rap-Interpreten zu hÃ¶ren. Aber wir hatten uns darauf eingestellt, so dass die EnttÃ¤uschung nicht groÃ war.

Das Casino befindet sich im Erdgeschoss und ist echt riesig. Hier gibt es alles was das Zockerherz begehrt. (Und ja, die Bank gewinnt immer!)

Toll waren die vielen ShoppingmÃ¶glichkeiten, Bars und Restaurants im Hotelkomplex. Das sah von auÃen gar nicht so groÃ aus, aber es ist echt so weitlÃ¤ufig drin, Hut ab. Klamotten, Elektronik, SÃ¼Ãigkeiten, Geschenke, hier war echt alles am Start.

Preislich natÃ¼rlich alles Ã¼berteuert, aber das ist in Vegas nunmal so. 

Der Tower ist definitiv das Highlight! Auf dem ""Observation Deck"" schaut man Ã¼ber ganz Las Vegas und ich kann nicht sagen, was besser war, tagsÃ¼ber oder nachts. Atemberaubend! Da entstehen beeindruckende Selfies. :-D 

Zu den FahrgeschÃ¤ften auf dem Tower kann ich nichts sagen, die haben wir nicht benutzt. 

Klasse war der ""Express-Checkout"", mit dessen Hilfe man die stets Ã¼berfÃ¼llte Rezeption umgehen konnte. Einfach Datum des Eincheckens eintragen, Zimmernummer, Unterschrift, in einen Kasten werfen, fertig. Netter Nebeneffekt: man behÃ¤lt die hÃ¼bschen Zimmerkarten als Souvenir.

Apropos Souvenir, ein weiterer Tipp: ihr bekommt Plastikbecher fÃ¼r das Badezimmer, auf denen der Casinoname steht, sehen echt ganz gut aus. Die werden immer nachgefÃ¼llt, also am besten ein paar in den Koffer, auch dann hat man ein schÃ¶nes, kostenloses Souvenir. ;-)

Fazit: Wer EinschrÃ¤nkungen bei Lage und GerÃ¤uschpegel hinnehmen mÃ¶chte, der ist hier super aufgehoben. Wenn man es luxuriÃ¶ser mag, sollte man auf hÃ¶herpreisige HÃ¤user ausweichen. Alles in allem hatten wir aber spannende 5 NÃ¤chte hier.",2,1,0

Obviously they are going to defend their job...i would too in that situation! All you had to do is have some bottom rung CSR give me a call and smooth it over and I would have been fine...I would have even came back.

Pluses:
Price
Low Traffic to get there
Decent view
Unlimited happy hour
Tower is awesome

Minuses:
Far from strip...like 30 dollar one way cab ride far
Long checkin
Building is dated
Some staff is surly surly",2,0,1

Dirty bathroom, stinky hallways and rooms, clogged sink, stained carpets and couches, leftover food crumbles in the tv stand, filthy bedsheets and ultimately the worst customer service. The only one thing that is good about this place is the roof deck view of the Las Vegas Strip that is free if you are a hotel guest. Guests also get a discount on the sky jump and other rides. But that is definitely not worth the stay here. I could get a good hotel on the strip and just pay to visit the deck.

First of all, Stratosphere is farther down on the strip where it doesn't even feel like you are on the strip anymore. If you are walking on the strip, do not walk till here! It takes around 20 minutes from the Venetian Casino by bus.

Next thing is the long long checkin and checkout lines. There are only 2 or 3 people working at any time no matter how long the line is. And they are very very slow! We had to wait for hours to checkin and checkout. No automation - where are we with the technology?! And from the state of the room we got, I am guessing a lot of people took more time because they had to complain about it.

Two words: Avoid Statosphere!",6,4,1

The hotel here is on the North end of the newer strip of Vegas but is a little isolated.  Location wise, it's between the main Vegas strip and old Vegas which is also known as Freemont street. 

The rooms here are good and the price is hard to beat.  There are plenty of restaurants and gambling tables and slots to keep you entertained.  They have a nice pool as well if sunning is your cup of tea. 

The Valet parking is free so if you have a car you won't have to worry about paying some huge daily fee to park it.  

Overall this is a nice hotel wth lots of benefits at a very modest price.  The bang for the buck is high here.

I will say that if you're looking for an ok hotel for a decent price, this is the place to be.  you will have to take a cab or the bus to the strip or you will be exhausted by the time you get to the beginning of the main part of the strip.

I asked about this and Anthony (at the front desk) said i would have to pay $25 more to upgrade to a room with those. yeah right! Ok so a resort fee now? And, I need to upgrade? He also tried to sell that the view wasn't as great with regular priced rooms and the upgrade would give me a good view. What do we care? We are never in the room and we can always go to the SkyLounge for these views.

The happy hour list was very confusing and the drinks are outrageously priced.

Tried to ask questions about the hotel and she was pissed and was like she will answer them when we come back to check in when a room becomes available before check in. As we was leaving we noticed she had a wonderful attitude with the caucasian guest! What really trouble me is everyone already knew who I was talking about before I even said her name! Why is she still working there?Well when we returned another clerk was there name Ron L. we told him about our bad encounter with Kayla and he apologized and gave a upgrade. He was very nice and answered all our questions he even encouraged us to come back to him anytime if we needed to know anything else. We got to our room which was on the 15th floor tub backed up with something might have been sewage cause the room smelled of shit. Called for assistance each time maintenance took care of it but housekeeping was the worst had to call to have linen changed and to get towels each time I called I had to wait for ever.

I tried to call room service or the front desk to let them know and their phone service was rediculous. First off, I was trying to get ready while I was put on hold, and since their phones are so old and out of date, and broken, I had to sit with the phone for a while because the phones speaker button didn't work. After a LONG time of waiting on hold, they hung up on me. I was so mad and irritated, I called the operater and they transferred me to facilities and when I talked to facilities they said that they would send someone up to my room to try and figure out why the room smelled like mildew. When the guy from facilities came to my room he said it was the drain from the sink he pulled up the drain and drain was so disgusting filled with a bunch of dirty nasty hair and mold and just I don't even know what else. This obviously shows how often the hotel is cleaned.. It made me want to throw up. Then the guy said that he would have to talk to the front desk because they might want to relocate us and that we would get a phone call letting us know if they are going to relocate us or not. We never got the phone call we sat in the room waiting for about an hour wasting our precious time in Vegas. I called the front desk and once again nobody answered. I walked to the elevator went all the way down and had to talk to someone from the front desk myself. I talked to the first person that I saw and he told me that it looked like they were in the middle of trying to relocate me to my new room but they were too busy. I guess they were just too busy for their own hotel guests. I asked to talk to a manager and this guy named Glenn was not trying that hard to get me to speak to a manager he was just following the manager around and never told the manager to talk to me. So then I asked someone else to let me talk to a manager and the manager was right there next to her. His name was Chris and so then she told Chris to talk to me which he did, and he listened to all of my ridiculous problems. He ended up giving me an upgraded room on the eighteenth floor and had a bell hop come help us get our stuff from our room to take to our upgraded room. When the bell hop arrived, he was to help us with our belongings which he did and he was to show us to our new room but when we got to our room our room keys did not work at all so we were locked out of the room with the bellhop and with all of our belongings. The bellhop said he was going to get brand-new keys for us and be back which he did come back but he took a while and I understand it was not his fault but it is frustrating standing outside of our room with all of our stuff when all we wanted was to go to Vegas and spend time in Vegas not figuring out our room situation. Also, the upgraded room had air-conditioning that did not work which is just amazing when it is 110 degrees outside. I am so done with my experience at the stratosphere.

The staff all through the casino were quite courteous and kind and I didn't have a single bad experience with this hotel or casino. From the dealers, the cashiers, sports book and valet, everyone was simply great. In fact, it was hands down my favorite place to play black jack while on my Vegas trip. If you're looking to save some money, I suggest it here. I did hear it's not too safe to walk around outside at night (bad area?) but I didn't personally experience this. We had drove so we had a car so staying at the end of the strip wasn't an issue for us. We didn't ride the rides but the buffet was good (we had breakfast), Top of the World (fine dining restaurant) was amazing and going to the top to observe the crazies brave enough to ride those rides was fun. They have cheap eats and fine dining and lots of tables; we were pleased a few tables with $5 minimums on the weekend. Check in was painless and to checkout I did it on the tv without any problems.

If you are traveling for business reason, it is a nice casino to stay where you can have a nice quiet dinner and have peace to begin the next day. If you like to visit downtown and prefer a cleaner hotel, then this is better than the ones in downtime. It's closer to downtown, and you can either take a short cab drive or the bus.

Also, I was on the pool and exercise floor although I did not use either nor did I get my room serviced (Do Not Disturb sign during entire stay).  I may be different but I like my room messy with the lived in look - as my mother knows :-)

I would stay here again as it is inexpensive, near IHop, Denny's, etc and a cab to center of strip is only about $7. There is a full service\/menu Starbucks right at the elevator entrance.  The Stratosphere is not quite in the center of everything but I find that to be a plus since the central strip can be overwhelming and difficult to find a place to eat at times.  I did not use the several restaurants inside but they look good. I went to iHOP next door instead and ate a 7 pound omelet for $7.99, with toast. If you want to get away from the slot machines, smoke and insanity, go to the iHOP 1\/2 block away or Denny's in the opposite direction.

I've stayed at other places but I like the Strat most by far.

I read some of the other reviews of the Stratosphere before I decided to write mine, so there are a few things that BEG pointing out.

Pretty much every Casino Hotel your going to stay atis LARGE, large means a heck of a walk from the front door to your room, get over it. 

If you feel rushed and your paying talk to a manager after your meal or just take your time, without being a jerk. Its totally possible, and sometimes they will even feel bad because they didn't realize that they were making you feel rushed.

Every staff member I ever interacted with here was amazing, from maintenance to the front desk. 

I am not much of a gambler but we do play slots and a few other games occasionally, I love the bar when you walk in (C Bar) and Yvonne was a great waitress several years running. (hope she is still around actually)

We go for a convention in January yearly and we've gotten so accustomed to staying at the Stratosphere that we've converted atleast a dozen people from other hodge podge hotels to stay with us here. 

Probably the BEST thing about staying here is being able to go to the tower for free. That alone pays for the resort fees. We use it almost daily and you can bring up to 4 people up altogether, so we (as a couple) can bring another couple with us. They have a drink at the Air Bar (I think its called Jetfuel) its amazing, super fun and you get refills at a discount. Thankfully we share and get refills and they don't care.

We've had a few small problems in the dozen or so times we've stayed here, most noteable was the air conditioner making a noise, then dying, we called the front desk and the repair guy came 15 minutes later and replaced it (pulled it out as we were leaving for the day) and ONE oither time we had an issue that I won't even discuss here it was VERY upsetting, but they were SO amazing about it that they upgraded our room and moved us at 1:30am. We were grateful for how well they handled issues and how nice everyone is about any concerns we had.

I also love the diner there, the food is good in the morning or in the evening. The staff there has been nothing if not fun and quirky, fast and entertaining. I will have to review that seperately.

I'm very happy about my experiences here, I like the rooms, the food and the staff.

If you don't like your view, pay to upgrade, if you don't want to pay the resort fees, you should seriously rethink going to Vegas OR you should do some serious research.

I've already made my reservations for January!",6,0,0

I hadn't been to the Stratosphere in years and now I know why.  For starters, my girlfriend booked the room online at stratospherehotel.com.  I don't know where the rooms are that are pictured on their website, but our room looked like a Motel 6 room... NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!  She got suckered in with a buffet package deal with a ""strip view"" room.  Turns out, the ""view"" was of the roof of the casino and the crappy motels next door.  The ""Buffet Package"" was just a 2 for 1 ticket... an INSULT for anyone that is used to getting those in the mail regularly.  The rest of the ""package"" deal?  No cover to a bar that wasn't open on tuesday night, membership to the player's club that wasn't open, a $20 all you can drink deal in the main floor bar when you could get $25 all you can drink deal and free admission for the bar in the top of the Tower.
The room?  Average.  The halls were dec'd out with new cool wallpaper and carpet... but the room was blah.  Not even a picture on the wall above the bed.  The remote didn't work.  Very few towels.  A leaky sink.  They didn't even put a curved shower rod in the shower so it seemed really cramped in there.  The bed was average... and the view sucked.
Gambling?  Good luck finding a server.  My girlfriend and I gambled for over an hour without even a sniff of a cocktail waitress.  We had to go to the bar and play video poker.... which we didn't want to do ... so we could get a free drink.  Even though we had been gambling on the floor for an hour.

The Hotel: The hotel itself is fine and easy to navigate. They don't have much GOOD food options inside... but pro tip: there's a Fat Tuesday here that rarely has a line. The people are nice and helpful.

The rooms: Personally our room as dirty. I was really cautious when touching anything there- gross! The toilet did not flush well- and when you're sharing a room with someone else that can be... well...not the best. Several times we had to use a bucket to get everything flushed (TMI? LOL).

Location: We ubered  A LOT. A taxi will run you aroun $15-$20 dollars, so definitely take uber. Even then in strip traffic it can be pricey. It's probably worth it to put that money towards staying closer.

While my friends from LA stayed at higher end hotels on the more festive part of the strip, I went the cheap route with a $69 dollar rate at this hotel. Don't get me know I've had many adventures at other cheap Vegas hotels but this one takes the cake. 

The best way to get by is to never turn on the lights, or be in your room in daylight. If you manage to see your room you'll be overwhelmed by the stark whiteness of it all, with no decor and a small window at the end with a window A\/C unit. Basically, it looks like a room at the asylum. It also has an amazing funky smell. 

The hotel is pretty far away from other attractions and the main part of the strip where all your smarter friends are. What you saved in your overnight stay you'll be making up for in taxi fees (It's about $12 one way from Treasure Island to the Stratosphere) and I wouldn't recommend walking there at night. 

However there are some pluses. First the hotel has several pools. It's one of the first few pools in Vegas that actually has clear water and look like you may not need a Hepatitis vaccine to enter. The first pool is a large pool meant for families. Basically it's like kids gone wild, and looks to be fun.  There is a smaller pool that is 21+ with a bar and dj, on a high floor so it has a great view. It also has a topless option. Please keep in mind, those who exercise the topless option are not those who should. As a women based on what you'll witness, you'll be praying to the gods of gravity, breast feeding, and plastic surgery to treat you right.

Directions on how to get to amenities within the hotel are also extremely hard to come by. The shops on the retail level of the hotel are boring and mostly uneventful. 

One positive is that going up into the stratosphere tower itself is pretty cool at night (especially if you've found yourself stranded here by the sheer distance from the rest of vegas night life,  or by the fear of leaving the hotel in the shady neighborhood - and you don't want to be poetics gouged by taxi companies and you didn't rent a car.",0,0,0

They told me they wanted maintenance to come check it out so I said fine. Once the guy got to the room, some how the hot water started working.

Picked this hotel on a deal through Priceline. Worst idea ever. Read a couple of reviews, some where good some were bad, so I decided to draw my own conclusion.
The people at the front desk\/concierge were rude and weren't concerned about our questions. Anyways we got a room with 2 queen beds. The room:  even tho was ""non smoking"" smelled like smoke. The bathroom was minuscule. It consisted of a toilet and a shower\/ bathtub and behind the door there was your sink and  mirror. Like you'd have to basically go to the bathroom and open the door to go wash your hands. Germs much?

It was so aggravating, but we didn't go to Vegas to stay in our room.The room was big enough for us and the AC worked so we weren't really complaining since we basically got what we paid for.


 We checked out the
Tower at night and it was AMAZING.  We also went down to the pool and it was fun. The Dj played some good jams and we had a blast. We didn't get a chance to check out the rides. 

The location was not the greatest, so far away from all the action! Luckily there was  the ""Deuce"" bus that ran 24 hours through the whole strip.

DO NOT GO TO THE BUFFET , THE FOOD IS NOT WORTH IT BY ANY MEANS.

ROXY'S DINER WAS VERY YUMMY AND THE PRICES WERE REASONABLE.

The internet was expensive. Went to Starbucks for free internet.

Looking for a cheap hotel, and you are simply looking for a place to rest your head. Then go for it. If you  are looking for a red carpet treatment, then this place is unfortunately not for you :(",10,4,0

The front desk guy was a little snappy, because he assumed we were trying to check in early, until he actually let me explain that we were booked from the night before and checking IN late. (Dork!  Off with your head!)  Then he came to his senses, but still charged us $20 to check out late.  We got to stay until 3p, which was great for catching some Z's, so I guess it was worth the $20.

Anyway, he had found a deal at his travel agent, he booked us two different deals, one was at Treasure Island, that deal included airfare. The other deal was two days and three nights at the Stratosphere, free. When you checked in they gave you 100 dollars in free slot play, 50 bucks cash, and free buffet. All we had to do was check in, go to the room, mess up the beds and go stay in comfort at  Treasure Island. One catch, we had to participate in a slot tourniment one of the days we were there. You had to sign up at the front desk. The tourny was every hour on the hour from 8 am to 8pm. So we signed up for 2 pm the next day to fullfill our requirements to recieve the free room.

The Stratosphere was in some sort of finacial trouble it seems and were giving rooms away to get people to gamble in their hotel. So we got our room keys (NO BELLHOPS?) we took a very old, creeky elevator to our floor and when John opened up his door he noticed people in bed watching TV, it was pretty funny, not to the people in bed though, but I still chuckle about it when he brings it up. They got it straighten out and apologized.

The place was a hole, I mean a real dump. We couldn't wait to get out of there and check in at Treasure Island. We each had fifty bucks cash from the Stratosphere and returned the next day to play in the tourny, I did'nt do very well, there but i did dump the hundred dollers in free slot play in a 5 dollare machine and walked out well ahead.

But seriously, there are so many nice places to stay in Vegas.

this was a pleasant surprise; after touring the casino area, which to me has a bit of an outdated feel (even though the Strat only dates back to 1996), I wasn't too impressed and was ready to give it a ""3"" rating at best; but then found a pretty good place to eat called McCall's Heartland Grill, and a semi-decent shopping level (who knew?); but the clear drawing card here is the tower (duh!); first of all, go outside on the street level and look up at it - very impressive!; then just tell them that you're going up to one of the bars (107 Lounge or AirBar) and you get a fast elevator ride, from which you can even access the outdoor observation deck for free; truly amazing 360 degree views of the valley; and you can watch the lunatics bungee jumping and going on the crazy rides; I easily spent an hour up here; best craft brew bet = few & far between, but McCall's has a few on tap",5,6,1

* Understaffed: rarely answer their phones. When they do, they were unhelpful. Laura at the front desk put me through to the manager, which rang for 3 minutes. Alexandra asked me to hold, but transferred me to a manager that was working and couldn't help me?

* The rooftop pool is a TWO DRINK MINIMUM! Even for hotel guests!!!!!!!!!! The security going up didn't tell us, neither did the door person, and there were no signs posted regarding this either.

* Concierge never returned any of my messages, nor did they ever answer their phones.

* The toilets DO NOT FLUSH everything down. Disgusting for $115\/night.

* The sink didn't drain in the bathroom either...

* Rooms are boring and simple, with limited amenities. We had to pay extra for a refrigerator. The air filter in the hotel is horrible, and doesn't seem to be working at all - as there is smoke everywhere - EVEN IN THE NON-SMOKING part of the hotel. 

* The fitness center was dirty and not cleaned ONCE during our 5 day stay there. There was also a gate, instead of a wall, and the smoke from outside came right into the fitness center; so you are basically working out in smoke?!?!?!

* They also rented out the roof top pool and decided to shut down two elevators for the regular guests, which caused a 15-20 minute wait for an elevator. One of the elevators even stopped working WHILE WE WERE ON IT.

The hotel is roughly 2.5 miles from the top of the strip - so be prepared to break out roughly $15 each way for cabs. There is a bus that you can take that goes up and down the strip, but you stop all over the place and it takes a long time. Taxis are the price of convenience I suppose. 

The hotel itself offers a great view from the top, but that's about where it stops. The rooms are as follows:

HOTEL:
Beds - OK
Linens - OK
TV - Bad; the remote didn't work most of the time (nor did the physical power button somehow). Of course you're not in Vegas to watchTV, but still. 
Bathroom area - Terrible. This was the worst part. You cannot get into the bathroom without almost hitting the toilet with the door. Cramped is an understatement. The lights in the bathroom flicker for about 5 seconds before they turn on - which doesn't sound long, but feels every bit of 10 seconds. 
Housekeeping - They were nice enough.

Major problems happened when they cut the water off at noon. There was no notice on the door, nor did the front desk tell me upon check in (they should have at least mentioned it). I went to ask a house keeper and she handed me a flyer. This should have been placed in my room the day before to warn me though. 

Finally the water did come back on, but it didn't drain properly. I asked for this to be fixed at the front desk. Read below (STAFF) for what happened there....


CASINO:
It's old, and outdated. That's all there is to say. 


STAFF:
I found this to be a mixed bag. When I first checked in, the woman at the desk was nice. However, every other person after was rude. In the middle of talking to one, another guest came up and cut in. She started talking to him, leaving me standing there. Really? 


Overall, I will not stay here again. It's not worth the time, effort, and lack of customer service. I suppose it could have been worse, but it's proximity to the strip coupled with the quality of both facility and care is just too low to get me back.",1,0,0

I feel like staying here is a gamble.. You either have a good or a bad time.. Personally, I had a good time here.

We did one of those flight + hotel package deals and ended up staying at the stratosphere because it was the cheapest. 

Listen... This isn't a Caesar's Palace... You're paying a low price (compared to other hotels) for a standard room. The stratosphere is on the strip but at the very end of it, and it's about a 10 min ride to the main area. 

Everything worked, the drains weren't that good but it was functional. If you plan to spend most of your time outside, then you don't really need a fancy room. 

Honestly, I would give this place a four star if it weren't for the fact that they left our hotel room door open after cleaning. Careless on their part, but this was the only major hiccup there was. 

For those who are wondering how to get around:

Monorail- walk a few blocks to SLS hotel, catch the monorail for $5\/single ride or $12\/ 24 hour pass. Stops at major hotels\/casinos and the ending point is MGM.

Lyft- get picked up from the main entrance and rides are between $7-$12 from the stratosphere to anywhere on the strip.",5,0,1

It rotates at a full spin every half an hour. Sitting near the outer rim can take some acclimation to the movement but it makes the steak house interesting. The Italian restaurant Fellini's has a cool atmosphere. The food has good size portions and was tasty. Warm service, good food, and I left satisfied. McCalls is the newest edition. Large menu and big variety. Usually fast service but I'd imagine it could get busy. Portions are actually small here. Roxy's diner is just that. A fast paced fun diner that actually has a server that sings... And sings good. Old Marlon Brando and Elvis movies play on the screen. Nightly show called pinup features Claire Sinclair who was playmate of the year in 2011. It's a variety show based on the months of the year. A 'calendar girl'. Impressive music performed live and even included in some of the performance. Talented dancers that display their special talents in different ways throughout the two hour show. Top of the world also has rides, a bar, and a carver station. Rooms are fair but depending on your neighbors, can be hard to relax unless that's what you want. Parking is good. Location is set just in between downtown and the strip and the clientele is just that...A mix of locals and tourists.

Shortly after writing this review, I attended a special labor day weekend meet and greet with the cast of pinup after seeing the show. I was actually having a very bad week but that party at the club 107 was ahhhhmazing. I had such a good time that I went to pinup again the very next night.",1,2,2

Pros: Room was clean. Free tower admission with room key. Nice looking pool (but we didn't visit this time). They offer a topless pool (free for ladies, $10 for men) but we didn't visit this time due to weather.

Cons: Terrible web site that is makes it hard to compare choices. 20-minute check-in process. Nothing fancy about this room. Looked like a nicer Super 8 motel than a well-known Vegas hotel. Out-dated, but clean bathroom.

They say you get what you pay for, and in many respects this is true. However, my brother stayed at the Golden Nugget the week before, spent less money, and got a nicer room that's closer to more things to do. On the other hand, I don't think it's worth it to spend $500 a night at the Wynn. What could be worth $500?

I made the mistake of paying for ""Strat Select"" service which includes a turn-down service, a chocolate on your pillow, setting the temp to a comfortable level, and turning on jazz music, and turning the lights low. They visit your room and do this between 6-8 p.m.  Sounds sexy, huh?

When we returned to our room at 9:30, there was a chocolate on the pillow. The lamp was on (it can be either on or off). There was no music. And the temp was the same 70Â° as when we left the room in the first place. So I guess I paid about $6 for two quarter-sized chocolates.

For the price at Stratosphere, you can't expect too much. But I must comment on one serious flaw: a dry bath mat on the vinyl bathroom floor is EXTREMELY SLIPPERY, and I learned the hard way. 

Heading into the shower at night, I stepped on the bath mat and slipped, barely catching myself by quickly grabbing the shower curtain and door which happend to be open. My wife screamed out, Oh Shit! when she heard what happened and needed to know if I was okay. I could not believe how slippery the cotton mat was against the vinyl floor.

The next morning, even being aware of the problem, I slipped again! while trying to be careful! So I called the front desk who put me in touch with a supervisor (who didn't seem to care) who put me in touch with one of the assistant managers who also didn't seem to care. I invited him to come to my room to see what I was talking about. He said it wasn't something he deals with, and instead offered to send the housekeeping floor manager and security. 

The manager continued to tell me that he was aware of the problem and that next month (June 2010) he was remodeling 900 rooms' bathrooms which would help fix the problem. This of course made me realize that they are aware of a slipping problem, yet did nothing to warn me (no signs, no flyers, nothing). So that is obvious negligence. And the Strat should be ashamed of itself.

House keeping and Security came to the room. I invited the house keeper manager to grab a bath mat, throw it on the floor, and see what I was talking about. She agreed it was far too slippery. Security seemed bothered by the whole ordeal, wishing instead they were spending their time on a robbery or murder or something.

Frankly, I was just trying to do the hotel a favor and let them know that eventually someone was going to slip and fall and crack their head open and then sue the pants off the hotel. But nobody seemed to care.

Bottom line: Cheap price. Clean room for the money, but NOTHING fancy. Don't visit with high expectations. Oh, and be extra careful in the bathroom.",2,2,0

My boyfriend and I are an interracial couple so we decided to go up to the tower and check out the bar before we checked out the view. As we went to the bar the blonde Caucasian woman ask what we wanted since I wasn't feeling well I just requested water and my boyfriend requested Grey Goose and Cranberry. This woman gave me the most dirtiest look ever and made a snide comment towards me. Since I didn't order alcohol she ask to see my ID. She didn't ask the 20+ people there for their IDs but I'm okay that's weird. Then she looks at my ID and gives me another dirty look -_- and mad dogging me. My boyfriend ask me if I knew this bartender because she was giving me death stares...I'm like I have never seen this rude woman in my life so I was confused why she was treating a paying customer so rudely. She would smile at other patrons and didn't tend to us anymore after that. I vowed I wouldn't come back to the stratosphere and I haven't for over a year but since I loved this place I decided to give it another shot.

Recently my boyfriend and I went back to check out the view, bands and shows then we headed down to listen to live music and lord and behold it was the same blonde female bartender that was rude to us....however it appeared she managed to get the stick out her but and treat hard paying customers right.

(I know, the Stardust, awww, and I'm only in my 40's)  For our trip in August 2011, we stayed at the Strat, mainly because it was the best deal we could find.  

Here's what I like about the Strat.  It's on the Strip, but less crowded and not as hectic.  You can park in the garage, walk to the the entrance, go down the escalator and around the corner to the elevator and up to your room.  It has all the penny and nickle slots we like to play, and you can usually get on a game and not have to wait.  The Hangover Game is AWESOME, and I won the progressive jackpot (ok, it was $408, but still....) The buffet is quite good,  a nice selection and there is an omelette station.  We like to go and explore, sometimes on the Strip, sometimes downtown at Fremont Street, so the location is central to both.  The pool is also awesome and quite a bit of fun.  The crowd is more laid back and easy going, not pretentious at all.  The tower is free when you stay there.  Go on a windy day and feel it sway and see how fast you want to go back down!

The surrounding area is a bit scary, and has deteriorated.  We paid $7 and took a cab to Circus Circus just to play it safe.  Many of the surrounding buildings are vacant or worn down.  More a factor of how the economy has hit Vegas than anything else.  I must say though that I always felt safe, especially in the parking lot and surrounding  area.  

The accomodations were ok in August.  A bit dated, but clean and comfortable.  And again, we paid about $48 a night.  I didn't notice a smoke smell like others have noted and  I didn't think that the casino was very smoky.  I'm a former smoker and I do notice and it does bother me, so for me it was fine.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The wait staff at the buffet are amazing.  Pedro was attentive and the one morning I wasn't feeling too well (too much time at the bar), and he made sure I had plenty of coffee to get me back to speed.  

We returned in October 2011, to meet with some friends.  I had recieved a couple free nights and was able to get a third free night  from my friend staying with me attached to my two free nights.  They gave us the more expensive weekend nights for free and added two more nights for $39 each.  A great bargain!  I requested the newly remodeled Central Tower and my room was very nice, with a view of the pool and a partial strip view.   The staff at the players club desk and at one of the bars remembered us from August (not sure if that was good or bad), but again very friendly and helpful.     

All in all, I think who you are with matters more than where you stay.  And with the right company, you can have a fun time anywhere.!!  Will definately be going back!",0,0,0

Lovely front desk girl named Maria (pretty hot too) was very helpful and even upgrade our room since it was my boyfriend's birthday! The room was clean and well taken care of. Furniture was a little on the dated side but for the price we got who cares! Clean hotel, great service, even won a little money at the Casino! All in all I will absolutely be staying there my next time in Vegas. Also they have a Starbucks and this AMAZING roof top bar.

* Tower is pretty cool and must have for climbing. Good see on the city from it. Hotel give a $5 coupon for climb on the top. $15-20 cost for sky lounge attractions for one ride. 
* Buffet $17-20 per person. Good food choices: crabs, salads, fruits, deserts.
* Walgreens and cheap souvenir shops are near by the hotel.
* Big TV in the room.

Cons:
* Very small bathroom.
* Good AC but blows right on the bed, so not comfortable for sleep with it.
* Checkout was at 12am. But because of was lot of people on reception and works only 4 receptionist from 12. We've aware to late to the airport. So did checkout via checkout form pun dropped it in dropbox express checkout. Scared that could make some mistakes while filled out form, but seems was all good. Also as we known later we can do express checkout via TV in room.
* 2 swimming pools. But both of them are open and it's not good when over 100 degrees outside. So didn't get it.
* Water bottles in hotel are very expensive. You can buy it in Walgreens more cheaper.
* Internet in the room is not fast. On the 2nd we've got lot of connection troubles with it.",3,1,2

The rate was $15 a night plus tax.  Yes, you read that right, last minute rate of $15! So when we checked in, the sweetie at the counter - very friendly and helpful - was instinctively doing everything in her power to get us a free upgrade for our insanely low price.  We paid an extra $20 for a late check out so we could sleep in.  We had asked for a smoking room but as some sort of Nascar convention had taken all their smoking rooms she put us in a smoking room.  She told us if we smoked in the room nobody would do anything.  We did smoke in the room, and it was fine. We had a very nice room with an amazingly comfortable king size bed and an incredible view of the city.  The bathroom was immaculate with a jetted tub big enough for my husband and I to enjoy a night of romance.  As hotel guests we were able to attend the Stratosphere show ""Bite"" at a two for one price with a discount on drinks.  The drinks were yummy, (the bartender was incredibly friendly and helpful) the show was awesome if you are into vampires, tits, and classic rock (which my husband and I are, very much.) Included in our room were tickets to the top of the tower.  They take your picture before going up and later try to sell you overpriced photos of you in front of a green screen.  We did buy one 8x10 as a souvenier.  My husband isnt into heights, so we didnt stay at the top very long - but I loved it. After the show and a night out on the town, we enjoyed sleeping in, ordering room service, and watching Jerry Springer, and giggling over the ""escort"" section of the yellow pages.  (Affordable Asians, haha!) The room service wasn't the best or worst food, but it was affordable and timely, and allowed us a lesuirely morning in our room.  The stratosphere is affordable, the customer service is stellar, the show room is intimate and the production was surprisingly good for the price. The cons: location.  The hotel is located at the seedy end of the strip that smells like urine, surrounded by suspect people.  When you go anywhere I recommend taking a limo or cab closer to where the action is.

She started waving her hands around in the air and was speaking Spanish to us. We were in utter disbelief! So..if that wasn't bad enough, she picks up our phone, makes a phone call (to who, I don't know), she is speaking Spanish to whoever it is she is speaking to on the phone..She got off of the phone, said something to us in Spanish and LEFT! Me and my husband were really STUNNED.. So, once we got our bearings together, we called the front desk to complain. The girl that I spoke to apologized and said that she'd talk to the maid that came in our room. Ok..so the room...it was minimally clean..the porcelain in the tub was not sparkling..the decor was meh.. the room smelled musty. The price of the room was high IMO compared to other hotels in the area considering the quality of the room. So, to make matters worse..their were teenagers running up and down the halls ALL NIGHT..So, I finally call security (which I've never done in my life while staying at a hotel, I can bare some noise, after all it's Vegas, but this was ridamndiculous) they FINALLY responded to my call and when they did, they knocked on their door. (I can hear them) and they said ""The folks next to you called and complained and said you were too loud. Please keep it quiet"",  so all I could think is GREAT.. This dummy has now told these people who outed them! I would have preferred to be anonymous, especially me knowing nothing about who I am next to.  It truly could have been anyone that complained because they were just that loud...So  I asked if I could switch rooms after this, they told me that I couldn't.. I was like..""WONDERFUL"" .  So we bared with it.. We had also asked for an extra blanket for our bed at one point...I kid you not, it took about 2hrs for them to bring it.. They woke us out of our sleep by the time they finally brought  it up... Also, the area surrounding the casino is SUPER shady..make sure you carry your switchblade with you if you plan to walk the streets in that area!!! The casino floor is nice here and the Level 7 club is classy, the breakfast buffet was decent. (We got free passes)  But I definitely wouldn't stay here again.

My only complaint is that the bartenders at C-Bar are EXTREMELY rude, especially if you take advantage of their ""bottomless"" happy hour. Watch out for the guy from La Puente, especially.

Not only are the bartenders unfriendly with zero social skills (and trust me, we tried every bar at the hotel), the security and managerial staff are completely incompetent.  My friend and I drove 12+ hours for our spring break adventure here after planning for over a month.  After enjoying ourselves at one of the bars, the bartender spilled 2 beers on both of us - soaking our clothes and our purses in the process.  Not a big deal. Accidents happen. But he then handed us a towel and asked us to wipe off the bar for him.  He also still charged us for the beers.  Confused at the level of customer service, we asked a waitress to speak to a bar manager.  In the process of waiting over 20 minutes, a drunk customer old enough to be our grandfather came over to us and began to tell us the the most disgusting and disturbing remarks I have ever heard.  This is happening while he has his arm around my friend, breathing down her neck.  Anyone with eyes, ears, or a brain could undoubtedly tell this was not okay.  But not the stratosphere staff.  Even as my friend made eye contact with the bartender and worded ""help"", he looked the other way.  It took 10+ minutes of this sexual harassment before a security guard finally intervened.  And even then, the security guard never spoke to either of us to make sure we were okay upon asking the man to step away.

After being traumatized to the core, the manager finally made an appearance.  Speaking to him was the biggest waste of time of our trip. As 2 young college girls with money to spend, you would think we are exactly the clientele this hotel would jump at the chance of having. Instead, he made us feel like we were the problem, and we were wasting his time.  He had the audacity to tell us that we should check out a night club, because that's just how it is, and we should get used to it.

At this point, we could not care less about spilled beer.  Accidents happen.  And even employees make mistakes on how to handle situations.  And in this sad world we live in, I acknowledge that disgusting people are undoubtedly going to appear from time to time.  But to have a manager make us feel like we were the problem of something so morbid instead of making our safety and comfort a priority is absolutely unacceptable. As a manager, the most basic of their duties is to at least validate their guest's opinion and experience.  After spending less than 9 hours in Vegas, my friend and I made the decision to jump back in the car and try to salvage the rest of our spring break back home - another 12+ hours away. 

If you have a daughter, sister, mother, or friend and are concerned about their safety at any level, do not allow them to stay at the Stratosphere.  

The only saving grace I can offer to the hotel is Brandon, the night manager.  He is quite literally the only employee that offered us the recognition and validation of what we went through with promises of further action.  He actually understands the role of a manager, and deserves to work at a better location than this nightmare of an establishment.",4,0,0

If it wasn't obvious already, Chong is not only my best friend for life but she is my secret lesbian lover. A secret so well kept even she doesn't know I refer to her as my secret lesbian lover.

We planned a trip to Vegas together as a very, very, VERY late combined birthday, New Years and bachelorette party. Since both of us had bank accounts with numbers that would convince any patron we made up the cast of the sitcom 2 broke girls, we chose to stay at the Stratosphere hotel for $40 a night.

First of all $40 a night my ass. The prices were in constant flux and it ranged from $80 to $125 explained as ""convention rates"". Like the rest of mankind, I for one, hate places that wrongfully advertise with fine print left for interpretation so I was no fucking happy pappi. 

It would have been one thing if the following events didn't transpire. But seeing as I'm writing about them, they did. It would have been another thing if the following events involved Chong and I hooking up, but seeing as I'm not writing about them, there is no saving grace.

We pay for our first night and my heart sank to my toes and out the horny layer (yes that`s a real layer) of my epidermis when she uttered the dreadful words ""Can we get a room with 2 beds""? But hey, the fact that getting a big room with 2 beds for a low price didn't sound so bad so I had but one thing irrelevant to the hotel experience to complain about. 

We got a smoking room. Not just for smoking cigarettes but potato tomato hello ITS CHEECH AND CHONG in Vegas no fucking brainer what we were going to do. Everyone IN LIFE clearly had the same idea because we were only in the hallway and the whole floor smelled like pot. Awesome! 

There is no ventilation. The windows are sealed shut and the rooms are dusty even though I'm sure house keeping does a thorough job cleaning, at least I expect them to but then again, maybe they're just kind enough to replace the sheets and do a quick rundown with an old hoover. I became very ill and actually ruined our whole vacation. This didn't stop us from doing hawaiian smoke outs. 

At one point Chong was too lazy to leave and I was too sick to leave also so we ordered room service almost every night and watched Law and Order. It was heaven for me. The food is surprisingly good and affordable and convenient, but it's the same stuff as the restaurants in the casino of Stratosphere.... so that says something, but je ne sais quois. 

Deciding our room was bad luck we asked to switch rooms. We go downstairs, get new key cards and walk in. There are ruffled sheets and someone else's porn subscription playing on the t.v. still. Part of me wanted to stay in hopes she'd get turned on and jump on me but she did the opposite and screamed ""ew"" about a million times, ran out to the elevators screaming ""come on cheech, we're not staying in a room that might have someone else's JiZz on the bed"" 

=( ""ok"" I muttered and followed her to ANOTHER LONG trip to the lobby. Told em what happened and actually got a brand new amazing room that was part of the newly constructed wing.

So all in all. That newly constructed wing is the only thing keeping this four star review afloat. Oh, that and the room service. OH and also....my memories with Chong *sigh*",12,19,15

1. We checked In at 2 am and since they were already fully booked, seemed like the manager (Brenda) and the reception lady (Courtney) had forgotten their manners and didn't care too much for their guests. Rudest customer service EVER. except for Barry, all both these women left us fuming and frustrated. 
2. We had an advanced booking via Expedia for FOUR people, but were given one Queen bed and were asked to  cancel the reservation if we couldn't adjust by Brenda. So BEWARE when you book a room with them.
3. Because we booked via expedia.. we were treated like some cheapsters who were there begging for a room.. apparently third party booking isn't classy enough. 
3. They (starbucks) in the casino charges for water.

However I will always have a special place in my heart for Stratosphere because they were so accommodating and the rooms were so great. Really the main detraction from the place as most people will tell you is its location. It is so so so so so far away from the main attractions of the strip. Really if you can get anyone even a few blocks closer it's a better experience. To top it off we thought it was a good idea to walk to all the clubs from where we were staying here. 

It's not worth it. Yes we were younger then and you are college students or can deal with walking a mile and half in club attire then go for it. We always see a brave duo or group making that trek from the desolate location of Stratosphere to the strip and we always wish them luck because we never know if we will see them again. And when you are making that walk it just seems like the hotel is getting further and further away. 

The stratosphere is itself is really nice though and they usually have availability all year so if you are in a pinch and need a place to stay in Vegas on short notice it's not bad. Their staff was really nice and they have constant taxis there because they know people are trying to get to the strip. However be prepare for about 20 to 30 dollar taxi ride each way because they won't take the strip for good reason so you are going to be paying for that convenience of getting there. Also since UBER hasn't survived in Vegas you really don't have an option 

The revolving area near the top is also really amazing and breathtaking views so if you are staying there you should make time to go up and see it as well. If you are deciding to stay here you might as well get your moneys worth. 
So really the stratosphere is a great hotel that is located in an unfortunate spot. IF the strip was down there it would be a top option but until that area grows or something miraculous happens it is just too far to be a top choice for anyone coming to Vegas.",0,1,0

I am the first person to be able to find a reason to complain or find a fault in service, quality or just experience overall but I cannot with this place. 

The stratosphere is amazing and I'd come back in a heartbeat 

I spent Friday thru Monday and had the best time ever in Vegas. It's located exactly in the prefect spot. 

Service was amazing, room was everything I expected the price was spectacular and the fun was non stop

Go to the tower, top of the world restaurant, level 107, Radius... Really the Stratosphere has so many hidden gems and amazing attractions it's hard to beat. 

No overpriced trap like strip hotel, but close enough that you can get to the strip in less than 12 minutes even in traffic.

If you stay here eat at El Nopal Mexican restaurant for breakfast and late night, it's a money saver that will satisfy you craving every time, staff is fun and friendly.

We never gamble but had luck at their slots ( we betted $20 and made $50) it was fun and my gf definitely had a rush even though she tried to get me to cash out every time I hit a bonus haha the place across the street had pretty decent Pho if you're into Vietnamese food.

Clean rooms, friendly registration staff, pretty quiet, and not as smokey in comparison to other strip casinos! 
The bad: 
It's frustrating that at the rate  you pay you don't even get free wifi. This could be the only hotel on the strip that doesn't have it! Ridiculous. 
No coffee maker in the room, a lot of vegas hotels are the same, but it would be a nice perk.
Far from the main casinos on the strip, so if you plan on walking, wear comfortable shoes. 
The advertise free entrance to the tower. It is a bit misleading, because everyone thinks that includes the attractions, it does not!!!

I arrived here and before even checking in my girlfriend and I hit the casino floor. We gambled for about 3-4 hours, after we checked in and got our assigned room. They told me rooms were pretty full and over booked so I couldn't have my king size bed which I booked a month in advance and had to be on a low floor far from elevators. I accepted this and figured ok I can live with it. I was wrong!! When we got the the room both of us were exhausted from the flight and the gambling, drinking. We entered the room and the A\/c was on full blast, the room was an icebox, so immediately switched the heater to full because I was freezing. Come to find out the heater blows nothing but more cold air and loud as can be. I went downstairs again to registration and notified them. They said probably nothing could be done until the morning they could see about repairing it and if not switching out to a different room. I said to forget it, I want a different room tomorrow, I'll pay extra. The concierge obliged my request and charged me more money, said to come back at 11am the room should be ready be then. So we hunkered down for the night, used every blanket we could find, which unfortunately all smelled moldy, and the entire non smoking room smelled like smoke, and slept. Next morning work up with a headache and sneezing from the terrible night. Dying of thirst in the night from the mildew, dry freezing air, Hit the vending machine, there was not even one bottle of anything to select, the ice machine output nothing, had to go to a different floor. Next morning wanted to get a workout and power through the sickness, come to find the gym was a joke. Most machines out of order and the one working treadmill had a line out the door, so that was a no go.

Then finally went to the registration again at 2pm and asked to speak to the manager to give feedback, get my new room and hopefully reach some resolution and found none of that. I spoke this whole story to the manager about how they are a Las Vegas resort on the strip and this is my experience, she didn't even have the slightest empathy or not even a sorry. She just looked down on me like I was bothering her and she tells me ""oh well I've refunded you the resort fee for the first night"" that's all I'm going to do. Oh and the room you reserved is not ready yet until 3pm, when I asked why she said the guest staying here asked for a late checkout and we can kick him out. I said well the guy yesterday should have told me it could be until 4-5 pm after cleaning. Whatever. This place is far from a resort, I think the motel next door probably has better accommodations.

+ Quick check in during the afternoon. The agent was very nice, helpful, gave me good advice, and I had a very pleasant experience. 
+ The buffet was surprising good. Not extremely extensive but just the right amount of food for me to feel very satisfied, happy, and full. The man in the front gave me a tip to use a certain coupon and I got All You Can Eat for the entire day for just $20!! (Make sure to look in your coupon book they give you when you check in, its the last coupon in the back of the book).
+ Included fitness center, which was exactly what I needed. Machines were a little old but they worked well. I loved having free weights as well. (At the Wynn, its $30 per day to use their fitness center- go figure!)
+ As a guest, I had unlimited free access to the top of the Stratosphere Tower, while everyone is charged $16 per visit!

- Surprising, what I didn't like the most was that the bathroom products. They are made by a company called ECOFRESH Naturals.

I did some research afterwards and saw mixed reviews so of course I was a little nervous going in. I was pleasantly suprised! Obviously this isn't a fancy, luxurious resort type place. BUT - the employees were all really friendly and welcoming and helpful. We checked in a the front desk after waiting in a line for maybe 10 minutes (not a big deal - to be expected at any big hotel) and the man who helped up was great. I was suprising my friend with balloons and champagne in the room when we walked in and he saw that I had an alert on my account about it, and called room service right away to get them to deliver the goodies to our room. Unfortunately we walked too fast and got to the room before room service did (they showed up 5 minutes after we did - oh well).

We gambled at the slot machines a little bit which was fun. The space is big and slightly confusing but there's multiple bars throughout so that's a good distraction. I won $25 at a machine and we were offered complimentary drinks while we were playing. 

The room itself was simple but clean. The beds were comfortable and clean. The bathroom fan was loud but oh well, it didn't bother me. The shower had amazing pressure and got really hot. It was small but what do you need really? Just a toilet and shower, right? There's a seperate sink\/mirror area where we got ready, brushed teeth, etc. Just enough room for 2 people.

We went to the rooftop pool\/lounge area on Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon. We snagged the round padded lounge beds and enjoyed the people watching. There were all sorts of people there - kids, seniors, dressed up girls, middle aged couples, etc. Fun to watch. The drinks were good - I got a pina colada and mango daquiri and my friend got a vodka tonic with sugar and lime. They offer free towels and the bathrooms are nice.

My only problem is how far away from the other stuff I planned. This may have been my fault since it was my first time to Vegas but everything is at least a 20 minute $20 taxi ride away. I wish it was slightly more central but overall, it was a great experience.",0,0,0

To start off we never get a basic room, we always upgrade to suites since it's so much cheaper than other hotels.

After calling downstairs it took about 3 hours to get another room and that was only after they sent housekeeping in to see if our complains were legit...took 45 minutes for them to show up! So now we lugged all of our luggage back down to the lobby to exchange keys for the new room key. Walking into the second room we were once again greeted by that horribly stained carpet. This time there was no mold in the tub thank god and the toilet worked. The bathroom however didn't seem to be cleaned as there were pubic hairs on the wall of the tub and the floor had gel or something on the floor.

POSITIVES
- Low table minimums
- Easy to get comped (I got a free buffet super-fast betting minimum bets at a $5 table.)
- Nice staff

NEGATIVES
- I got a hot tub suite, which was great, but there was mold underneath the soap dish, and excessive dust in the air vent.  How does housekeeping not clean\/replace these things, especially in a suite?
- The casino floor has a distinctive smell that you may not love.  (It's better than, say, the Riviera, but not as good as the Venetian.)
- No great dining options onsite.

The mix of people at the strat was just that, a mix.  There were straight-up ghetto people, well-off people, and a surprising number of foreigners.  There were also what seemed like roving groups of foreign men hoping to hook up, but no ladies to reciprocate (that I could see).

Alright, that's a little harsh, but let me explain: my first stay here was in 2006 and the changes that I noticed during my recent stay were substantial.  

Yea, I know changes would take place during a 6 year gap, duh, but the hotel rooms are significantly better, much nicer than I expected for the price.  The guest services are also terrific: fast\/friendly check-in and they even helped me get an electric-scooter rental.

The casino is okay, not a bad place to get in some low-to-moderate stakes gaming, but your experience, particularly at tables will be dependent on other guests and customers.  And that's where my ghetto comment comes in, the Stratosphere neighborhood (technically on the strip, but not really) isn't the nicest and you will see a lot of ghetto folks walking around the casino.  BUT you'll never feel unsafe, and that's a big credit to Stratosphere.

The biggest drawback to the Stratosphere is that, again, its not really on the strip and you can't really go other places without taking a cab, which will run you about $15-$20 per ride to the strip hotels.  Doesn't sound like much, but if you take a cab during the day, come back and change and go back out at night, that can be up to $80\/day and cut into the good value of the hotel.",3,0,0

The vending machine on the 12th floor took my money but the machine was replaced the next day and it took a week to get my $$ back. Other than that it was a place to rest my head. It's a good idea to buy public transportation tickets right outside the casino lobby to get anywhere or you'll be walking. A good 30 minute walk to the fashion show mall, the central strip location. Try Roxy's diner, it was good bang for the buck. Enjoyed it. The McDonald's on the ""r"" floor above the casino was very convenient but it's 2 1\/2 times a normal McDonald's prices.

It's out of the way - not close to the downtown or the other strip properties. It's also near a pretty sketchy area though things are being done to try to improve the area. 

The interior isn't too bad considering the age of the property and with the things to do high up in the tower, it's too bad you have to pay to get up otherwise it would probably be busier. The tower that is.

I didn't stay in the rooms so from what I was able to see from the parking structure to the tower, management is doing a decent job of drawing people there. Gaming, lounges and dining - all reasons to go.

The rooms are very basic, there isn't even a coffee maker.. but I guess that's ok since they have a Starbucks downstairs.  The rooms are also pretty small, there is not that much room for much else other than your luggage.  The restrooms are pretty small, and the shower curtain didn't cover the shower fully.
Rooms are clean enough, the carpet isn't that clean, but it's really not that big of a deal since we weren't staying there very long.

The room has nothing but a one star level hotel. Very old and beaten up. Not clean. The bathtub was so gross and still had hair... Carpet smelled terrible with moldy air. Also, don't pay for the view, not worth it. All you could see were bunch of houses.

This has been our go-to hotel\/resort for my family and I ever since I was like....in elementary school.

From years ago until the present time, all our stays here have been nothing but pleasant. From the parking garage to our rooms....everything was quick, easy and hassle free. 

Great rates can always be found here. I mean, what more do you really need in a hotel room? You're in Vegas. I'm sure most of you are out of your rooms during the day (and even night.) As long as the room you're staying in is fully functional and clean...that should be enough. If you're a tourist that's looking for ""oh mai gawd, I want to live the luxurious lifestyle with a fancy check in area"" and blah blah blah...take your ass to the Venetian, Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, or Wynn. 

But seriously...the Strat has everything you can possible need while on a Vegas vaca. You got your casino floor with endless amounts of slot machines and table games. You got your restaurants (affordable ones AND your $$$$$ ones). You got 2+ bars. A small souvneir shopping area. Sportsbook. A pretty decent pool. What more do you really need!?!",4,3,2

But would not probably go there again, simply because of the location. Advertised as north of the Strip, but I think officially speaking it is downtown already. Quoting  a Vegas comedian ""Las Vegas rule number 3 : Depth Perception. Just because you can see the Stratosphere, it does not mean that it is a block away."" It is not. After Sahara closed, Stratosphere became also somewhat isolated as there is practically nothing between it and Circus Circus (which is again, not a block or two). I have uploaded a photo of Las Vegas Blvd. at the Stratosphere. Does this look like the Strip? So, forget enjoying a walk if in no hurry, it is always a cab or a bus.

Went to the tower a couple of times (was in the package). But again, you see the central part of the Strip in the distance, and between it and you there are almost no lights. So the question that comes to mind is ""Why I am here, not there?",1,1,0

Of course, for those who like to play, the casino is relatively large with a few bars spread out within and many new and up to date slots.  For the thrill seekers, there are a few extreme rides at the top of the tower, which look dangerously exciting.  For the show and music lovers, you can catch Michael Jackson Live in the theater and if you stick around after the show, you can even take a selfie with MJ himself.  For the foodies, they have a steakhouse, a pizza joint, and everything in between.  There's also a row of shops if you're looking for the perfect souvenir to take home.

3) Internet is not included and we had to pay another 11$ extra\/day for usage. Unlike , circus circus where it was included.

The casino was not to busy. The cocktail waitresses were very rude. Trying to get a drink from them is like pulling a tooth. I would have tipped better if they did better. 

The Buffett is Meh. Better on a weekend. ""McCalls Grill"" best resteraunt they have here. Best service, best quality of food and a good scenery. Please skip Roxy's in my opinion it is the worst. Service was ok but the food was horrible. 

We booked a king spa. The bathroom itself was so dark. It only had 1 light over the sink. And, the bathroom especially the tub could have been cleaned a lot better. 

The rooftop resteraunt is overpriced. So is the bar but the views are amazing. We were so high up my ears were popping.

Do not walk there, especially at night. The surrounding area is sketchy. I wouldn't stay at the Stratosphere based off the location alone. I prefer to be in the heart of the strip. The view is gorgeous at night. The observation deck is so high and there are so many lights, that it takes some time to locate the Vegas strip.

The rooms were inexpensive and clean. I don't have high expectations given the price. The toilets are scary. Don't do a courtesy flush unless you want to risk having your insides sucked out through your bumhole.

The unlimited tower admission seems like a pretty good perk for staying here.

The pool was adequate but they really should have built this on the ground floor so that the buildings shield you from the wind.

Cleaning staff were excellent. They were careful not to bung up or throw out your stuff and they did an overall good job.

The casino is ok. I wish they opened the tables in the pit near McCall's on more than just the weekends. Younger dealers tend to be more fun to play with. They're also friendlier than some of the old-fogeys running the tables on the other side.

Wifi access wasn't too bad but I disliked having to re-authenticate every 24 hours.

The tower shops are kind of a ghost town. Food, like McDonald's, is about the only thing you go there for.

Like almost every hotel in Vegas, they have the dreaded resort fees. You get charged this whether you use their amenities or not. $15\/day for this one.

Because of the location, you lose most of your savings by taking extra cab rides. If you have a car or don't mind public transportation, then it's not too bad.

The clerk upgraded our room, but I'm not sure what the upgrade was. We were on the 23rd floor in a non-smoking room at the end of the hall with no view.

Key points:
1. The water that came out of the sink and shower smelled and tasted really bad. I don't know if that's just Vegas or if it was the hotel, but I didn't smell that odor anywhere else in the city.
2. The (tiny) window didn't open and there was no ventilation, so the air was oppressive, humid and hot. I'm not sure if the air conditioner made it better or worse.
3. The hotel is on the opposite end of the parking garage\/entrance... But you should expect to walk your ass off in Vegas anyway.
4. The casino is tiny and the machines are a bit older. If you want to gamble at your hotel a lot, this might not be the place for you. They have $5 blackjack tables so I'd play those, but the slots have little variety and are really tight. Max bets were capped at around $2.50 so when you do get a bonus, it's small. 
5. This place is off-strip. There is nothing fun within walking distance and not enough to do at the hotel to keep you occupied for more than a day.

In sum, I would say this: I will not stay here again, ever. I will come back for their top of the world restaurant (5 star good!) and maybe their rides, which I didn't get a chance to go on.

The food inside was very lackluster. But for the price I would recommend this place. However the customer service is really hit and miss, I would agree with previous reviews mentioning about really rude staff. In particular a young gentleman called Anthony was hardly a saint. He had a really bad attitude to both me and the customer before me, and he had my reservation wrong. Thankfully another member of the front desk crew helped me resolved the issue. Overall a pleasant stay. If it weren't for the rude encounter I would gladly give this place a 5 stars.",0,0,0

Cons: Room decor and lighting. Towels and pillows.

It was a very frustrating experience overall. The rooms are old, damp and need a face lift. To begin with check-in --`We had to be queueing up in a long queue for about 1.5hrs after a long long flight from east coast. Despite of having paid extra for rooms on higher floors, we were given a room on just 8th floor. It was only after a lot of argument that the staff agreed to give us a room on higher floor from 2nd day. Rooms are dark and carpets were dirty and damp. The wash basins are outside the bathroom (inside the bedroom)!! Beds were good though the pillows were crumpled and very small size. Towels were rough and smallest by every standards. In-house dining has almost nothing for vegans!! My room was split into two rooms separated by blocked door..and it did nothing to stop the noise coming from the other room!! We opted for this hotel being attracted by the Tower and its rides. Tower is good and the views were spectacular. Overall, I would recommend this hotel only for visit to Tower but not to stay. I would have rather pad a little more and went to a better hotel.",1,0,0

I don't know about the management of this hotel what are they thinking !?
- There is no customer appreciation  at all !  .. They make you feel that u need to punished because you may got a deal on the room rate!
- They try to rip you off as much as they could inside their premises ( For instance :  
 * 12$ for the internet per day per wireless device !!! no way around it !
 * They have starbucks in the hotel, but they asked them not to offer wireless internet to force the gust to buy their subscription ! Even though all starbucks I have been in offers free internet !
 * We asked for beer opener they told us it's 6$ to borrow them as a room service !
 * We needed the internet so we asked them to charge us when we check out, but they refused and asked us to come down to front desk to pay them !

-- Also the area is not very safe if you have family and you want them walk up to the strip.. !

Bf and I got the impression of nickel-and-diming of this place.  We did get a fabulous rate for the two days that we were there (Sunday night and Monday night), and the rooms were clean and well kept.

1.  Reservations of a specific room type are not guaranteed.  Bf and I wanted a non-smoking room with a King size bed.  We checked in at about 11PM on a SUNDAY night, and all they had were Queen non-smoking.  For us at least, room type is non-negotiable.  I didn't request something if I didn't want it.  We stayed one night in a crappy tower in a not as nice room with two queen beds, then we switched.

2.  They charge for internet access.  Lame.  Should be included in the price of the room.

3.  They charged to use the pool and fitness center.  We didn't use either during our stay, but would've been nice.

4.  Their casino floor is small and smells like nasty smoke.  Ventilation here is awful.  

5.  The layout is extremely confusing.  We got lost almost every single time we walked downstairs to either go to the parking garage or the front desk.  Stuff is not laid out here very well, and not labeled appropriately.  They want you to get lost so you gamble, but it's not appealing to either me or my bf.

6.  $10 charge per person for hotel guests to see your view, plus another $12 for each ride?!  We didn't have a chance to utilize either, but seriously, if we're staying in the hotel, you should include that in the price of the room.",3,1,1

The top of the tower is cool, but you don't need the package where it is included, because let's be real, you're only going to go up once. 

I stayed in the ""newly remodeled"" Select Tower. The rooms were pretty small. No bathroom ventilation, and the lighting in the bathroom, where you need good lighting the most, really sucked. The walls are very thin. So unless you are a heavy sleeper, you WILL hear everyone walking by your room at all hours of the day and night. Forget sleeping in, the maids will wake you in the morning regardless of if you have your do not disturb sign up. You can hear them cleaning the other rooms on your floor. You also pay a $7.50\/day resort fee and $12 Internet fee per day while staying at this hotel.

Unfortunately the room wasn't what I thought it would be. When I arrived to check in they offered either 2 queen beds or 1 king bed in a smoking room. I should've just chosen the 2 queen beds because my room reeked of smoke! Just like the whole casino. The room is so outdated and the bed wasn't even as comfortable either. 

To begin their lamps have this string hanging from the ceiling with a switch. Talk about ancient, what is this S%$#! The bathrooms were kind of gross and they limit the amount of towels that they put in the bathrooms.

I reserved through travelocity and paid a deposit and the paid the remaining balance through cash. For some reason they asked for a mastercard to have on their account if anything happens? The only mastercard I had was my debit card and I usually don't like using that one for hotels, but I did anyways since the man who got my information at check-in said there wouldn't be any hold on it. I paid the remaining balance of $230 in cash at the hotel so I don't understand why there's a $116.00 balance charged on my debit card.

It's also one of the hotels the furthest down on the strip. Don't dare try walking the strip from this hotel unless you have really good shoes and a day pack. My sister and I learned our lesson the 1st time we went and stayed at Circus Circus. We had never been to Vegas before and I guess the Strip looks a lot shorter than you think when you're driving down it. So like the naives we were we walked from Circus Circus to the MGM Grand and my sister nearly died. Then we found out there is a trolley that you can get an all day pass for going up and down the strip. Ai ya!

So the 2nd time we went and stayed at the Stratosphere. The Stratosphere is not that bad of a hotel. I didn't feel unsafe walking around outside and the casino is quite nice as well. The first night we got there after 6 hours of travelling we went and bought tickets to the attractions on the top of the Stratosphere. You take the elevator up what seems like 200 floors and step out on a platform. This is not for people afraid of heights at all. The fearless daredevils that we were we jumped on the ride that is like The Superman at Six Flags that shoots you up in the air at like Mach 6000. I admit, my palms were a little sweaty and my heart was palpitating slightly. So the ride shot us up in the air and stops just short of shooting you off the top of the Stratosphere to fall several hundred feet to your death. Everything was fine...then I look over and see my sister's head slumped to the side. I had noticed that she had stopped screaming mid way up. I have never been so scared in my life. I thought she had died. There is no way to get off the ride until they bring you back down. But they shot us up twice....which I guess was good for the money. So after they brought us back down, her little head popped up and I began breathing again. She was screaming so hard that she couldn't catch her breath and just blacked out. HAHA! 

Then we got on the roller coaster that takes you over the edge of the Stratosphere. Again...not for chumps. This one wasn't as fun since they had to put the breaks on like every 3 seconds to prevent you from going too fast and flying off the Stratosphere...again falling several hundred feet to your death. But they really have you locked in up there so I felt really secure. 

After that adventure we went down the elevator, gambled a little and went out in search of some trouble on the Strip (it wasn't that hard to find)

The hotel itself is nice too. It was a place to lay our heads down. They have a pool on one of the higher levels, if not the roof, so it makes you feel all posh that you get to strut around in your 'kinis and flip flops with a dranky drank in your hand...thong & heels and a fur coat if yer classy.

I wanted a nice room for my wedding anniversary.  They gave us a cruddy handicap room on the 6th floor with a view of nothing. I was outraged, bc it was not a premier room that I had paid extra money for and then they told me all the premier rooms are booked and I could have a premier room tomorrow. I was only staying Vegas 2 nights. So half my trip I spent in a subpar room. And how were all the rooms booked even though I booked one. They reimbursed me a resort fee for one of the days. I felt that wasn't enough, but I didn't complain. I wanted to make the best of my trip. My husband and I were both disappointed and will not be staying there anymore. I felt that because we are young they felt that we weren't going to look into it or complain about it. When I first complained all she kept saying  was that I don't think you booked a premier room and there's none available. I have the receipt to prove it.  The other lady tried to say that it says subject to availability on the rooms on the receipt, but once again she was wrong. It said king or queen bed subject to availability. The first thing I did was read the fine print. They should just own up to their mistake or whatever it was instead of trying to make some lame excuse. I did end up getting the premier room on the 23rd floor the next day and it was way better than the level 6 room. It just would have been better if they would have have is the correct room that I paid for in the beginning. Good thing we had good food on the strip to make up for the crappy room.

They need to adjust the oxygen because with all a the smoke you can barely breathe while ingesting 2nd hand smoke 24hrs a day. No mini bar, fridge or even a friggin coffee pot!  The window is the size of a car door and you barely have a view to look at. Oh and don't try to check out on your TV.

Ok so the bathroom sink got clogged and started leaking from the bottom during our night here when my sister was just washing her socks for that she didn't have enough for the following trip. Called the front desk and was told that they'll arrange a service guy right away. We waited for almost an hour and no one showed up. Called the front desk again to see if we can switch a room, as we needed to leave early tomorrow and it has passed 2am already, we really needed to sleep. The front desk said they could do nothing unless the service guy confirmed the situation. Hello? It's 2am already AND I FREAKING NEED TO SLEEP FOR MY NEXT DAY OF DRIVING. I felt like they just didn't want to deal with the situation and they prefer to have their guests waiting tiredly without doing anything to solve the problem. If your guests were just using the sink normally and your defective room was having problems, and you can't schedule a repair, JUST FREAKING LET THEM SWITCH TO ANOTHER ROOM AND REST! What's so difficult of that? It's just a normal Thursday night! Don't tell me you're fully booked cuz you're not. 
Now we've been waiting for more than 2 hours. Nothing was done and no one came to fix the problem. Again the front desk said she can't move us to another room. F*** you. I paid for my stay and I had no sink to use. What a ""great"" hotel with ""awesome"" services!

Yes it is Vegas so you get charged extra for everything like internet and yes they like every other hotel in Vegas have a resort fee that no one really knows what it covers.

They have two pools. The 8th floor is open seasonally and was not open during out stay. The 25th floor beach club has a dj and during the summer months it is adult only and topless. We where the only people there, the lifeguard was friendly and it was really warm!

We are not gamblers but we got a free trip to Vegas for listening to a time share talk so we figured we would go and we had a blast. We did not gamble at their casino which is large and very smokey. 

The top of the tower views are amazing we went up twice. They have thrill rides but I am not brave enough but hey if jumping off a huge tower is your thing you can find it here. On your way to the observation area you walk through a ghetto mall. But many of the major hotels have them.  

Lastly, it is on the strip but it is all the way at the north end. We rented a car so we had no issues getting around but if you are staying here carless you may be in a little trouble. It is not near the monorail and the cab rides to Mirage area where about 12 bucks each way according to people who took cabs.

Overall it was nice but if I return to Vegas I would probably stay in the main strip area so we could walk from casino to casino. If you are looking for a quieter hotel  not in the middle of the action this may be your place.",1,0,1

My husband and I came here to this hotel to celebrate my 60th birthday and we just had one of the worst experiences in all my 60 years of earth.  Even though MOST reviews of this hotel are dismal at best -- everyone warning of terrible hotel manners at best, we decided still to come here because of price.  At checkin, they tried to charge us $10 for an early check-in at Noon, but did not because we took an upgrade of $20 per night - that should have been my first clue to run and not walk away from this hotel.  But sadly I did not listen to my instincts that were telling me to run - we stayed - our mistake.

Here is what happened after deciding to stay.  We went to dinner outside the hotel - and returned after dinner.  My husband played the ponies at the sports bar and I was with him until I decided to play the slots.  He joined me for a while at the slots and then he returned to the sports bar.  I played a few different machines and then saw a machine on an end aisle and decided to go there.  

I sat down and put a twenty into the machine and played a couple of max bets and won a little over $6 when all of a sudden an extremely drunk man came up on my left side with a beer in hand and started screaming at me that was his machine and that was his money.  I explained to him that the machine was vacant and there was no money in the machine when I sat down and that was my money in the machine.  He would not reason in his condition, so I cashed out and got up from the machine.  I was searching for security and there was none!  I walked around with this drunk following me screaming that was his voucher and finally saw a bar and went over to the barmaid and bartender to call security.  I stayed there for ""help"" to arrive.

It was well over 10 minutes before security and they went over to the drunk who was now at my machine.  Security never came over to me and eventually I had to go over to them.

The drunk was Hispanic and the security guard was Hispanic and the security guard started screaming at me that it was the drunk's money and that I had to give him my voucher of $26 and some change.  I told the security guard that it was my money as I put $20 in the machine and won a little - big deal - a little over $6.  But he would not hear any of it and continued to scream at me.  I told him I wanted the hotel manager and instead of helping me, he kept demanding that I give the drunk my voucher.  In front of the drunk, the security guard demanded that I give him my room number and ID.  

I refused and walked away to find the front desk where we checked in to find the hotel manager.  At the reception desk, the woman at the counter asked my room number, which I gave her, and she showed me where to stand to wait for the manager,

When the manager (Julio) came, I explained what was going on and he escorted me to a private room by the front desk.  He said they would review the cameras and he asked me what I did with the voucher.  I told him I ripped it up and threw it in the air and he said he would have done the same thing,

Then the most appalling thing of all happened!!! The Hispanic security officer came to the front room where we were and screamed at me and my husband that we were going to be evicted from the hotel immediately!  It asked him why when I did nothing wrong.  He repeatedly screamed at me that we were going to be escorted to our room to get our belongings and we would be escorted out of the hotel immediately!!!! I kept asking why.  No answer.  Julio the front desk manager heard all of this and said this was now out of his hands with security's decision and he threw his hands in the air and walked away.  I never saw Julio again.  We were shocked!!!!!

Then all of a sudden everything changed.  They apparently took time to review the tapes and Steve the head security officer showed up as well as a woman who determined that this was my money as I told them from the beginning and they reconstructed my voucher and paid me my money $26.00 plus change as they finally determined I was telling the truth as I told them from the beginning.  Steve said his security guard was wrong and had acted inappropriately towards me.  Yeah, you think?  I am a 60 year old woman celebrating my birthday with my husband and I am treated like a criminal.  Security kept saying that what I did was criminal.  I kept asking what did i do wrong?  Picking the Stratosphere for my hotel stay in Vegas was wrong.  They did nothing to help me and they did nothing to the drunk who attacked me!!!

Steve the head security officer found Brandon the head floor manager and offered us some complimentary buffets, which we refused.  The was another slap in our faces!!  I am still in shock.  What happens in Vegas is a warning not to stay here!

As for the area of town - yes, it's on the bad end, yes there are pawn shops and bums around but I never felt unsafe. There's a Denny's right behind it and the service and staff there were TERRIFIC and the food was affordable! 

Too bad the Stratosphere staff never mentioned to us that there is a mall upstairs that includes a McDonalds....but then how would they make their money on their buffet. Oh that brings me to the buffet - we got scolded for not sitting and waiting for the non-existent server to bring us drinks before we ate.

Even with the sink drained the room still smelled of sewage. We both became extremely nauseous and instantly exhausted... skipped dinner and just went to sleep. We left early the next morning.

It is SO hot in vegas in september. Also, if you take a shuttle from the airport to this htoel it is SOOO FAR from EVERYTHING , that you have to pay EXTRA for ""downtown"" and not the ""Strip"" so its about a $3 difference.

The pool isn't on the ground its somewhere in the middle. It was NOT Fun, or NIce. The tropicana has a WAY better pool and is only a little bit more at the other end of the strip.

If you miss the bus, and have to wait in the heat to get back to the stupid stratosphere its miserable. OR if you have the bright idea to WALK, it takes forever.

The food is ok. The views at the top were nice, but at night there was wind and we could feel the tower MOVING. It literally made me sick to my stomach!

SO far, if you are young dont stay here. I would suggest The Flamingo or somewhere closer to the middle of the strip. it's very depressing, the stratosphere isn't close to ANYTHING!  Also, one of the closest hotels the Sahara has shut down (I believe just a few months before we got there), so the monorail doesn't go this far out .

The rooms (though classy looking) are pretty much what you get when you stay in a motel: tiny bathroom, no fridge, no microwave, the ice bucket seemed to be some flimsy bucket a kid would play with in the sand, no ceiling lights, basic tv channels, and a VERY LOUD air conditioner. The room was so hot and stuffy but the air conditioner (even on the lowest setting) was so loud and obnoxious we couldn't sleep with it on. The walls are paper thin and we heard our guests talking, showering, and watching TV all night. 

On the plus side, the casino area was great and we won about $400, and the beds were very comfortable. The drapes also completely blocked the light, so when I woke up at 11am I could have sworn it was still the middle of the night. Room service is also fast and efficient, and not too pricey (unless you're ordering alcohol). You also get to go to the top of the tower for free if you're a guest (I can't imagine paying $15 just to take an elevator to the top).

Things I would change: 
The air conditioner!! Please! Vegas is hot and us out-of-towners need our rooms to be cool.
The wifi should not be $12 a night... that's steep.
A fridge please! I assume they don't want you bringing your own booze because they want you to buy one of their $180 bottles of grey goose (there's even a placard in the room saying 'no outside alcohol'), but I would have liked to save my PF Changs leftovers from last night and reheated them for today :(

I hate having to do ANYTHING first thing in the mornings and having to walk all the way on the other side of the casino for a $5.00 cup of coffee is just ridiculous!! They have a blow dryer in every room, a clothes iron and ironing board in every room - why not add a coffee pot.  This might make you stand out a bit more because I, nor my husband was impressed with anything about this room.  

The bed was hard as a rock, and both nights we stayed I woke up hurting and feeling stiff - so much for a good night's sleep when we are on vacation, huh?  We ended up checking out a day early because of this being one reason for such huge disappointments with the place. 

Places like McDonalds (for those that wanted just a little cheeseburger to eat) was clear on some floor labeled ""R"" (retail) floor, and clear in the back of the floor!  We couldn't figure out how to get to ""R"" because there is only ONE ELEVATOR that takes you there - such inconvenience!!!

In the heat, the tiny window (which offered no view anyway) was closed to keep the room cool the whole time. Even at night. Luckily, the ac worked pretty well, most of the time. 

Someone did mention previously that this casino is situated far enough North of the proper strip so as to be expensive by taxi or Lyft and that's true. So ride the bus. It is air conditioned and frequent and only $8 for 24 hours. No weirdos, super easy to navigate, helpful drivers and very safe.

There is an airport shuttle which requires a reservation, the registration line is bananas. Get yourself a drink and settle in. We walked by each day several times to a very long line. We got in at 730 and waited probably a half hour in line to check in.

We also felt like there should be some literature in the room explaining the local liquor laws that might be of interest to tourists; as long as you are on the strip or Freemont street, you can have an open container. Though this is not the case anywhere else and any others that you could run afoul of in thinking that anything goes.  

The toilets here required multiple flushes, there was no full-length mirror or coffee pot or fridge, and the neighbor's pot smoke came right through our bathroom vent. Also, it would be nice if there were a proper sink and mirror IN the bathroom so that late night trips to the bathroom don't wake your room mate. 

Other than that, the beds were clean, the tv worked and as long as you have earplugs, it's reasonably quiet. There's a discount to go to the top if you are staying there so only $5, which you MUST do, preferably at sunset. No really exciting dining options, but enough. Starbucks.

Just walking to the area in which you have to purchase the ticket to take the ear popping elevator ride to the top is a hike from the valet. The Casino makes sure you have to walk through the Casino for several minutes which means you are probably going to want to gamble. Once you get to the area to purchase ride, elevator or observation deck tickets you will have been walking through a mall, massage tables, video arcades, restaurants etc. 

The Stratosphere Tower tickets (means Elevator ride) charges $16.00 for adult and $10.00 for a child. Seniors and Nevada residents are $12.00.

At the top of the Stratosphere they charge the following to ride their rides: 

Big Shot (sooo much fun) $13.00
X-Scream $12.00
Insanity $12.00
Sky Jump (Controlled jump off the side of the building) $109.00 & UP. 

The Stratosphere now offers unlimited rides and Tower admission for $34.00. I am not sure if you are allowed to go up to the top several times or if you are stuck up there for the entire day.

This place is a lot of fun for riding rides and let's be honest non gambling time which at the end of the day saves us all money. People will stick $20 into a slot and burn threw that it 30-45 seconds but we will complain if we are charged the same to ride an elevator that takes longer than that.",3,2,4

Had a HORRIBLE experience with booking since I was flying in at 6AM, and originally booked through hotels.com and even though I was willing to pay for an extra night, they were still giving me issues saying i had to wait until 3:00PM , when I had the wedding at 5.   Called the hotel directly and they wouldn't help me because I was going through hotels. com.   Nice.  My experience is with the hotel, seems like the don't care if its not booked through them.   Called hotels.com... and they won't let me pay for the day before with an extra late check in... I mean really, no one wants my money?  I finally had to book two days via Hotels.com and then call back to the hotel and book another night with notes that I wouldn't check in until 6AM the next morning and pay them directly.  The second person I talked to at the Hotel directly was much nicer and they linked my two reservations together so that I didn't have to check out and then check back in.

After the above was all settled, upon arrival everything went smoothly.  The rooms were ok, there was a resort fee that I didn't see anywhere in my hotel.com reservation information, but oh well.  Plenty of parking, loved the casino, not too bad shows, yada yada. 

I like that its away from the main strip, as we spent no time there. We did walk down to Circus Circus and the Riveria, but to go further would have been pushing it....  BUt its easy to get in and out of the hotel, and since we had a car we spend most days in Downtown Vegas... 

The rooms are a little outdated, but they fit our need.  We did go up to the observation tower (included in our room) and that was pretty cool.  I had started coming down with the flu, so sadly i didn't get to partake in any of the extreme fun things you can do at the top... like jump :)  You can even see video of other jumpers on the TV.  

We did the buffet one morning... it was amazing.  tons of breakfast foods and even lunch\/dinner stuff too....it was good, and plentiful... and since we just joined the membership in the casino... it was free!!  

I would stay here again unless I found something cheaper.   I'd rather spend my money DOING stuff than needing 3 bathrooms and a tv in my mirror( ahem Bellagio)...",0,0,0

The location is pretty far from the main attractions of the city, and the hotel itself could use significant renovations in its shopping, restaurants, and rooftop locations.

After reading some of the other reviews here I was expecting a pretty yucky place.   I was pleasantly surprised to discover this hotel wasn't that bad.   Don't get me wrong, the MGM and Aladdin still kick butt over the Stratosphere, but it is better than Fitzgerald's.   

If you are staying here, plan on renting a car or taking lots of taxis because it is away from most things.   Eventually, the strip might make it's way toward the Stratosphere, but it's not there yet.   They charge everyone a $5 per night per room ""Resort Fee"" for access to the pool and the tower.   I never made use of it, but I wish they just would have included that in their fee.  
The rooms are decent.   Expect to pay extra for a view of the strip.   The showers all seem to have issues.  Ours made a horrible screeching noise unless you adjusted it just right.   That was just annoying.   Our friend's room had a major leak in their shower head, but they got it replaced within a couple of hours.   Housekeeping was fast and thorough.  

Will I be back?   Yeah, maybe, if there is a major event in town and the other hotels jack up their prices.   In that case, the Stratosphere becomes a bargain.",2,0,1

We booked about 3-4 months in advance and couldn't beat the price. Yeah the stratosphere is an older hotel and north of the strip, but why pay out the ass for a room if you're almost never in it?  When we checked in, our room had been given away to someone else so we were upgraded to a ""suite"" on the 24th floor in the newer building. The room was pretty small for a suite but it was clean and we had a view of the tower and could see people doing the sky jump. Our bathroom had a hot tub which was sweet however the lighting was very poor in the bathroom. There was one fluorescent bar above the mirror. We did get to use the hot tub which was nice and relaxing. Hotel guests get free access to the tower and observatory deck. Also you get coupons for deals on drinks and rides. We unfortunately didn't get a chance to ride the rides since we were out and about.

I played a little downstairs and won money on the OITNB machine which was a nice bday present. We signed up for a player card and you get a free swipe to win free play and other prizes including a voucher for 25% off the buffet. We went for lunch and Sunday brunch. It was ok, nothing fancy. The eggs benedict was a bit disappointing. The muffins were rock hard and difficult to cut. My parents had gone earlier that morning and we were told there was bagels and lox. When we got there, someone had already put them away. My boyfriend asked someone behind the counter if there was still bagels and lox. The lady glared at us, turned around and pulled the salmon and bagels out, plopped the tray down and walked away like we ruined her entire day lol. Whatever.

We checked out Radius which is their adults only rooftop pool\/lounge on the 24th floor. We were on the same floor so it was convienient. It's a small area and you have to pay to use their bigger sized pool chairs\/beds\/whatever they're called. Lame. It wasn't crowded when we went and the DJ was playing all the popular club hits. The pool water was ice cold but you get a few drinks in you and it feels nice lol. 

We picked the Stratosphere because the rooms were cheap and it's close to Fremont street. I personally enjoyed gambling in old vegas as did my boyfriend. I'd recommend staying here if you're looking on the cheap side. Overall, our stay was decent and satisfying.",0,0,0

We settled on the location because the prices were beyond cheap for the rooms, pictured online, portrayed a more than decent room. It was a very long day of traveling and wanted to settle in. We walk in to our room to see a wall lined with outdated, non-matching, broken furniture that looked like you'll catch something just grazing it as you walked by. The lights tinged and flickered for 30 seconds once you flip a switch which will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The shower head was nothing more than as if someone was spitting water on your head. The nicest part of our stay was that room service leaves you layers, nay mounds, of years worth of dust, spit sunflower seeds, and whatever unholy dirtiness the past guests leave behind. We opted out of asking to upgrade and checked out after a sleepless night spent wondering what creepy crawlers were on you and if Norman Bates was going to appear and make you his toy.

Long line to check in, friendly hotel staff, they upgraded us to their jacuzzi suite for $60 which was a pretty good deal, I was ok with paying that however he told me it was normally $400 a night which I find that hard to believe. Our first room was nice until I tried to take a shower & it smelled like seepage from an elephants butt hole. They changed our rooms, same floor, no smelly shower, nice tub.

The adult only clothing optional pool was nice, cheap happy hour, breathtaking views of the mountains and they have floaties so you can relax. The loungers are comfy too..

Roxys diner, good, reasonably priced however my date found a hair in his food, not so great. 

Tower, if you don't easily get seasick or lightheaded, go for it. I've been in that tower twice in the last six years, I don't need to go again any time soon

Mccalls, great late night happy hour with friendly staff


Back to our room.. Went to bed around 12:45.. Woke up between 1:30-7, multiple times because I was itchy.. I woke myself up scratching various areas on my body.. When I woke up for the day, it was like I had been eaten alive by something, I don't know if it's bed bugs or not but holy hell, whatever bit me thought I tasted good, big, itchy, welt like bug bites, swollen and just plain terrible. 

So I go to all the little shops, all of them sold out of benedryl except one.. I didn't buy it simply because it was $12 and I figured I could wait til I got home.. The sales lady at the one shop also told me that for some reason benedryl was very popular lately.. Hmm..'wonder why?

The hotel reimbursed me for my resort fees & upgrade charges and took a security report & pictures of my bites. 

I was thankful to be reimbursed but it still really sucks. I thoroughly checked the mattress & couldn't find any signs of bed bugs so I am not really sure what it is..

Upon arrival seemed about right I was traveling alone and just needed a place to sleep for 1 night. 

Right away upon checking in I was greeted with a smile by Jennifer. I went up to my room and was appalled there was no fridge, a dirty restroom, and it was a two queen instead of the king I had requested (just on a higher floor as a trade off). 

I was literally about to call the front desk when all of a sudden I received a text asking if everything was okay with my room. I explained my situation and both  Jennifer and Maria got me out of that room and upgraded me to a suite no questions asked! 

I had a peaceful nights rest and am extremely satisfied in their level of customer service. Give this hotel a chance as they are making changes and be sure to ask for Jennifer or Maria. I will definitely stay here again.

Before my stay here I had never even set foot on the grounds of the Strat because it is so far from everything else. I was however pleasantly surprised! Our room is really nice, especially for how little we paid! The casino isn't smokey at all, and we received 2 free drinks while playing the penny slots (which never happens!). 

The view from the top of the Strat at night is effin amazing! The bar downstairs has all you can drink 5pm-9pm for 20$! It's also on the Bus line that is 7$ for 24 hours unlimited rides so it's easy to get down to the bigger casinos for shows or poker rooms!

I love the Strat for it's colorful ambiance, and the fact that I was winning at their slots and tables (though I lost it all which was entirely my fault). I also won free tickets to the AMerican Superstars show and I enjoyed that show so much! The Michael Jackson impersonator really touched my heart. I trekked back to Stratosphere in February of this year just to see the show again. It's truly too bad that the Strat got rid of the show the past month because it brought me back everytime. 

I also enjoyed the food options. The buffet (but only for brunch) and the Roxy's Diner (but only the milkshake). There was also a Mcdonalds there that I frequented (hey, good, cheap, reliable, late-night, fast food). The Mcdonalds outside of the Strat and around the corner I also frequented because they had free Wifi (which no Vegas hotel has). There is also a Burger King and IHop near the Strat. I did not appreciate their gym very much because it was small and always packed but I did get to use a treadmill and for paying only about $25 per night, I figured I got a lot more than what I paid for.

The pools are great too. The big pool is rather large with little theming. The hot tub was nice and it was a fun environment. I love the heat of the sun there! The adult pool is also nice with amazing views and nice music. I was not crazy about the tower because it was there I learned about my fear of heights but if not for that fear, that, the thrill rides, the restaurant, and clubs and lounges up there would have been ultimately enjoyable. The clubs and lounges were free for guests always so that made me happy because I at least peak at them (and they were cool) before running to the elevator to make an exit! Entry to the tower was also complimentary because we were guests.

The rooms were definitely functional and pretty with nice red and white tones. It had one of the best room colors I have seen thus far in vegas. The bathroom was not extravagant but simple and nice. 

I feel that the Strat will fall off even more now that the Sahara will be closing and the AMerican Superstars show left. I mean, what will be the point to go all the way out there except for sleeping there or the thrill rides? I'm afraid I might have to say bye bye to the Strat real soon. *tear*",1,1,0

Secondly, we notice there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom so after showers, the bathroom is incredibly humid and stuffy. 
The next night, we noticed it was a bit warm in the room and came to the realization that the AC wasn't working.

The last one was the one that took the cake. My sister saw yellow stains on the sheets so she peeled off the sheets and slept on top of the inside comforter but above the top cover. She and a friend got bug bites probably because of bed mites or other nasty critters. I slept on TOP of the covers so my bf and I were not parasited. Someone I know took hotel management and its a standard that the comforters don't get washed unless a VISIBLE stain was apparant. That is soooo nasty!!!!!!

I'm guessing the reason it has trouble keeping up with the times is because it's surrounded by the grit and sleaze of the Naked City, and it's just so far away from everything. 
The mall is laughable. There's a pretzel place in there which I grabbed a pretzel from in my Journey to Nowhere, and the pretzel kind of saved my life, but the whole Journey to Nowhere is a completely different story. The mall of the Stratosphere is a strange mashup of Beijing and Paris, it fails on both counts, and all of the stores sell overpriced, tourist trap junk. 
You know what else is laughable? The showroom. If you walk past it when a show is going on, you can hear EVERYTHING. There's also a translucent window behind the the theater bar, so if you sit there and look closely, you can see whatever show is playing for free. Both of their shows (American Superstars and Bite) look like crap so it's probably better to try and see it for free anyway rather than waste your money. 

Suggestions: Close down the buffet since it seems to have lost all hope and buy up the surroundings so the neighborhood will be more aesthetically appealing. I'm shocked the Stratosphere hasn't been closed, the only thing it really has going for it are the rides, restaurant and observation deck on top of the tower.",2,1,0

If not for the relief from the crowds, I probably would have given the Stratosphere 1 star. I didn't make our reservations, but if i had, i would have spent the extra bit on a nicer, more centrally located place.

Las Vegas really is all about location, location, location. A outlying hotel on the strip might as well be in another part of town. The stratosphere is no exception.

The casino area is actually really small in comparison to most places, but it's not the best place to gamble anyways. Granted if you are staying here, there are some low minimum Blackjack tables that can be fun. But I'm a craps girl at heart, and the tables here just didn't have the good luck. 

The rooms are okay. You can tell it's an older hotel, the rooms don't look like they've been updated in at least the last 10 years. I've stayed in worse places, but in comparison to all of the other Vegas hotel room's I've stayed in, this place is a dump. 

The restaurant at the top of the world (what they call the place at the top of the tower) has a horrible ridiculous policy where they charge your credit card $50\/person to cancel a reservation.. and I don't mean for a no show, or without reasonable notice, but at all.. Needless to say we didn't bother to make a reservation, let alone eat there. 

The main lobby bar is hit or miss. Some of the bartenders were nice, friendly, and helpful, while others were just downright rude and impatient. To me, this is a major pet peeve. When someone makes the choice to work in a service industry they should be friendly and outgoing. 

All in all, I doubt I would ever come back here again. In all my trips to Vegas this was the first time I've even bothered to visit the hotel\/casino, and now I know why.",1,0,1

I stayed in one of the revamped rooms so it was pretty nice. There were not any issues like bed bugs or random blood stains on the wall. The bathroom was nice and no gross smells anywhere.

I'd recommend staying here if you want to get away from the main strip and want to get a nice view of Las Vegas. The view is definitely worthwhile. I only saw it during the day I am sure it's better at night since you'll be atop the Vegas glow. I think the tower closes at 2:00AM.",1,0,0

We got decent priced rooms (under $100) less than 24 hours before our trip, and it was completely worth it.  The casino isn't very large, and location- wise, it's not in the heart of the strip, but I think there were less drunken crazies because of that, and it was still a quick cab ride to Caesar's.  Stratosphere is also just a couple blocks from the Las Vegas outlets on Charleston.

The rooms looked like they were just remodeled and had flat screen TVs and updated furniture.  Bedding and bathroom were clean, but minus one star for the weird lighting in the bathroom... I felt like I was taking a shower in the dark.

The reason I say the lack of research and proper planning kind of hurt our experience is because of the Stratosphere's location: it's on the north end of the strip, which puts you pretty far away from everything. Thankfully, there's a bus line that runs up and down the strip 24-7(The Deuce) which can get you to the heart of the action within a half hour, but still... definitely made things a bit more stressful\/exhausting.  

Beyond that? The Stratosphere itself was a joy and struck me as a very reasonably priced resort, though a bit stripped down when compared to some of the bigger hotels like Caesar's Palace or the Aria. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, from registration to dining to the concierge desk and attractions. We were able to upgrade our rooms to the 23rd floor for a pittance, which gave us a king size bed, a view of the mountains, and a jacuzzi tub. The concierge was a delight, helped us book two shows and gave us some great advice given, again, that we didn't properly plan. Everyone was just plain fantastic and shared in our excitement for our trip, which honestly went a long way towards us enjoying our time. 

The restaurant\/lounge at the top of the tower was very classy, though the restaurant was a bit overpriced. We spent about 200 dollars for two at Top of the World a la carte. I'm sure that's typical of most Vegas restaurants, but the food itself was just okay and definitely not worth the price tag. The lounge itself was very chill with an amazing view of the city, the staff was (again) a delight, and the drinks\/appetizer specials during happy hour made it worthwhile. There are other shops\/eateries in the mall section of the hotel that are fine, but nothing as fancy or upscale as the stuff you'll find in the bigger resorts. The buffet and the 50s diner on the ground floor were so-so, but not so horribly expensive that I'd discourage anyone from eating there.

I think it almost goes without saying that the Skyjump made the whole Stratosphere experience pretty unforgettable. Being a hotel guest, you can jump from the top of the Tower for less than a hundred bucks. While it's a controlled freefall and feels pretty safe\/secure once you take that first step off, actually mustering up the courage to take the plunge keeps it incredibly thrilling and I confess to grabbing a few drinks before I worked up the grit to give it a whirl. Absolutely worth it and if I ever go back to Vegas, it'll be something I do again. There's also a glass observation deck with an open view of the city, some smaller attractions and thrill rides for those unwilling to check out the Skyjump. 

The only other real downside beyond the hotel's location on the strip was the casino itself. It was dark, outdated, and pretty derelict. I'd recommend gambling elsewhere.

Bottom line? This hotel is great for someone looking for a Vegas experience that isn't too overwhelming\/ritzy. It was affordable, a ton of fun, and the staff was fantastic. The only real downside was how far it was from everything, but it wasn't so far that it ruined our vacation. Would definitely go there again.

Its away from the main part of the strip but, I drove from the bay area and prefer driving around vegas instead of walking or taking the monorail.  We liked the $3 blackjack table they had. The waitress was quick with drinks, they were great, pina coladas, fuzzy navels, kahlua with cream, etc mmm. The view from the tower was pretty good, we got free tikets to the observation deck, but it should be free anyway. I wanted to take a ride at the top but it cost extra and it was cold and drizzly. 

Its a nice hotel and casino for the price. You can't compare it to the Wynn or Venetian. Geez. I'd stay there again next time.

Thinking that not too many people would be there, we walked towards the check in.  ""Hmmm... must be some sort of special event going on; what is that line for?"" we thought to ourselves.  Oh, no, don't worry.  No special event, that is the CHECK IN LINE, roughly 25 people long, at 12:45am.  Patiently we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  I mean how long does it take to swipe a credit card and hand over a set of keys?  Well....fast forward to 2am.  We are walking into our hotel room.  Come on, if there is a line that long put some more people behind the desk.  The whole time we waited there were 2 employees checking in guests.

Now, because we, my girlfriend and I, had work to do on Friday morning, we called in to have breakfast delivered at 6:50am.  The woman took our order, with rocky phone manners, and refused to allow the delivery to occur without first running a credit card.  I offered to give the credit card upon room service delivery, but apparently that just wont work. I also offered to read the number to her over the phone, again no success.  So I told her to send someone to get the card right then and there (roughly 2:15am).  Fine.  So they pick up the card.  No issues.  We crawl in bed and are peacefully going to sleep...until....the phone rings.  She now wants to know if she should bring the card back right away.  I politely ask her to bring the card with the food at 6:50am.  We turn back over to catch a few Zs before the rapidly approaching wake up call.  Just as we're falling asleep, the phone rings again.  This time: an emergency.  They are out of ham and she wants to know if I want bacon or sausage.  MAKE AN EXECUTIVE DECISION!  Or better yet, call me at 6:50 to let me know...don't call me AGAIN at this ungodly hour to ask me asinine questions.

The room itself was completely mediocre, and we had the suite.  The place was clean, and it didn't smell.  For that I will add one star.   That is about all this place has going.  The casino is more so depressing than anything else.  There was construction going on - I think they were installing a new slot machine or something.

The room was OK but the hot water in the shower was not real hot and it took about 10 minutes for the shower water to turn from cold to warm.  That was disappointing considering this hotel is not that old.  The Top of the World restaurant was good but pricey for what you received.  The view was nice and that is really what you are paying for.  The man at security took my selfie stick that attaches to my camera for some reason.  He said I could not take it up front.  It is plastic and could never be considered a weapon by any one with some sense.  This one still puzzels me.  The valet was quick and easy.  The C bar was expensive and I paid 9 dollars for two Miller Lite beers.  I will not return to the hotel part of this place but would go back to the Top of the World Restaurant.",3,0,0

It's located way off the beaten path at the very end of the strip.  The area seems completely unsafe.  The monorail stops nowhere nearby.  If you want to see the American Superstars show be prepared to wait on the same insane line as the tower attractions.  My girlfriend and I showed up 45 minutes before showtime and decided not to go to the show because the line seemed like it would last at least an hour.  The room was every bit as tacky as a run down truckstop motel.  All in all the hotel is very depressing.  I know people are always going to love something if it's cheap but staying at this hotel completely jips you out of having a true Las Vegas experience.  If you're going to be this cheap with yourself why even bother going to Las Vegas in the first place?  This hotel is shit hole and it's way too far from the nice part of the strip to even be remotely worth considering.  Avoid at all costs!,6,2,0

Attempt 1 at check in:

My family's check in time was 3pm. Granted asking to check in at 11am was a long stretch, but please don't try to sell me another room. It'll just make you look bad, save yourself the embarrassment. 

Baggage drop off:

I asked the counter if there was a charge for drop off as I scope the city. There was no charge but I was told to tip. Tip is suppose to be voluntarily based on service, telling me to tip is basically charging me... might as well just charge, no?

Attempt 2 at check in:

I booked two rooms due to being in a party of 6. Both were booked under the same name because it was all under one credit card. During the first attempt at check in, I was given a summary of my bookings (2 non-smoking rooms with double beds). So the computers at the hotel were certainly not going haywire. But can the second hotel desk clerk be anymore... what's a better word... um stupid? She gave us one room and I was a bit confused, thus I asked if the two keys were for two rooms. She spewed out a bunch of yes, dismissed me and moved onto other customers. 

Fine. I was tired, hungry and wanted to shower. I headed to the 24th floor and looked in the room keys' envelope; one room number. Oh fuck my life. I headed back down to the registration desk (mind you, the walk was rather long) and was treated as if it was my fault; maybe 30% since I didn't fight it the first time. Though I specifically asked if the keys were for TWO ROOMS, was I speaking gibberish? 

Front desk lady proceeds to be rude and asks if I am sure, blah blah blah. Curses swirls in my head. I had 6 people! I wasn't even allowed to register more than 4 people in one room during booking! I told her I was sure and that there should be enough rooms if I was given two confirmation numbers. Wait for it... I got an eye roll. She's no longer stupid, she's a bitch. Phone calls were made; 10 minutes wasted and I finally got my room. 

Room summary:

-Sink was mucky.
-Towels were dirty.
-Towels were not replaced.
-Nothing was stolen.

Amenities:

The positive of this hotel is definitely the fact that it is an attraction. Discounts for thrill rides and unlimited access to the Stratosphere tower for hotel guests. Downside to going up was going down (like my pun?). Wait for an elevator is approximately 15 mins, if the elevators you are waiting for malfunctions.

Gym is small and limited.

Shops are limited and awkward. Though I loved the magic shop because of the friendly greeting I received and puns as I walked around the store. My friend and I spoke with Joe (I think that was his name) for a bit afterwards. Joe is the best and was willing to converse about anything and everything. If I wasn't so tight on time, I would have stayed longer.

Check out:

We called and the front desk changed our room to another one that had two beds in it but as soon as we carried all our luggage up a floor, we arrived at our room only for our key not to work. So then my husband had to walk all the way downstairs, wait in line and get a new key.

We finally got into our room about 15 minutes later and the sink is clogged and the walls are paper thin. You can hear everything and everyone who walks by.

Playing in blackjack in the casino was one of the worst experiences I've ever had gambling. The dealers are very disrespectful and won't crack a smile if your not tipping...we did eat lunch at the buffet and it was fairly good. The food we ate at the Mexican restaurant in the mall was much better and a great value.

This place is as far away from the action as possible.  We probably would have had a better time staying at one of the dumpy Travel Lodge's off the strip.  We decided to walk to the center of the strip from the hotel and it took us about an hour at average speed.  During this hour walk we were constantly accosted by homeless people asking for change, at one point even being followed by a homeless guy.  We took a cab back when returning in the evening.  

The hotel itself definitely needs some updates.   The room was nothing spectacular.  You can hear people in the other rooms flushing their toilets and showering.  We were lucky enough to have a bunch of girls staying in 2 rooms across the hall from us who were slamming doors and running around the hallway all night.  Calling security amounted to absolutely nothing.  

The casino was absolutely lifeless, couldn't even find a decent blackjack table.  It is basically packed in with slot machines and cigarette smoke.  Even the non-smoking floors smelled like smoke.

During our visit, the 8th floor pool was not available but we decided to relax and lay out in the sun anyway.  But was unable to because of the drilling that was being done to the unavailable pool.

I called and it took a while for anyone to answer. Finally, someone picked up and they transferred me to catering, but I wasn't sure what catering was going to be able to do for me. It went to voicemail, but I needed to place the order ASAP. I hung up and called back a few hours later. Again, it took a while for a response.

The next person connected me with the concierge, which sounded like a better choice. Laura understood my needs and recommended me to a local florist. She transferred me, but I had to leave a message. I felt uneasy since I needed immediate service. I left a message and figured if I did not get a response that night, I can call in the morning. Robert called me back, luckily, and took my order of chocolate-covered strawberries and a bouquet of flowers. I trusted the florist to put something nice together.

The next day, Laura called me and said she had the order, but couldn't find my parents' reservation, so I confirmed the name. She eventually found it and said they haven't checked in yet, so she will hold it and personally deliver it. I still felt a little uneasy, but she mentioned that the bouquet was beautiful and Robert did a good job. I felt a little relief.

Their arriving flight was delayed several hours, but they eventually checked in. My mother immediately texted me ""Thank You"" and a picture of her with the bouquet and strawberries. I was so happy that she liked them. 

I wanted to commend Laura for the awesome service that she gave. Unfortunately, the difficult time I had getting anyone on the phone was a disappointment. I would have rated 1 star if it wasn't for her. I might try a night or two next time I'm in Vegas, just because of her wonderful service.",0,0,1

Overall we were very happy with what we paid.  After reading the reviews, we were very worried about the booking we had made but we should have not been.  

We were given a room on the top floor (24th), overlooking the Strip, what a wonderful view.  The room itself was very very big, the bed was very comfortable too.  The shower worked great as did the toilet.  Only downside was that there was no in room safe BUT not to worry as the hotel offers a FREE deposit box in the cashiers room on the casino floor.  It's got to be safer that having it in your room.  It is totally free with 24\/7 access to your box.  We thought it was brilliant.
Housekeeping came daily and made the room up.  

We went up the tower about 6 times which is free if you are a resident.  You cannot beat the views from the top.  We say at the bar at the top of the tower and easily spent an hour just chilling out.

We also ate at Roxy's which we actually really enjoyed, I'm not going to spoil it for you but there is a little surprise that happens and it is not for the bad.  It's a great diner, the food looked good and tasted even better.

The casino does smell of smoke but then all the casinos do, I agree that it's a little more here then elsewhere but the others pump a lot of air freshener out so you can in some taste the perfume which is not nice.

I know a lot of people have also commented on how rude the staff are but again, we had no problem with any of them, all were very polite to us.

Valet parking is free and the guys are very friendly and some of them made sure to get to know our names which was very nice when either picking up the car or coming in after a night out.  You can park yourself but for a couple of dollars why would you?

Es war vom Preis, den Leistungen und Lage das beste was wir kurzfristig buchen konnten. Ausschlaggebend war der 350 Meter hohe Stratosphere Tower, der umsonst von uns genutzt werden konnte.

Da man den Aussichtsturm Ã¼berall in der Stadt sieht, hÃ¤tten wir den Weg sicherlich auch ohne unser Navi finden kÃ¶nnen. Das Parkhaus ist kostenfrei. Der Check Inn war problemlos, den Aufpreis fÃ¼r ein Zimmer in einem hÃ¶heren Stockwerk haben wir nicht bezahlt. Wir hatten ja die Option mit dem Aussichtsturm. Wie in vielen Las Vegas Hotels ist beim Einchecken dann noch eine RessortgebÃ¼hr fÃ¤llig.

Wir hatten ein renoviertes Zimmer gebucht, das keine WÃ¼nsche offen lieÃ. Flachbildfernseher, kostenfreies WLAN, hochwertige Pflegeprodukte im Bad, Tresor im Zimmer und Schreibtisch mit Sitzbereich. In der 8 Etage befand sich ein groÃzÃ¼giger Pool, von dem man die GÃ¤ste beobachten konnte, die sich vom Tower in die Tiefe stÃ¼rzten.

Das Hotel befindet sich am Anfang des Strips, so dass man zur Besichtigung der interessanten Hotels auf das Auto oder Ã¶ffentliche Verkehrsmittel angewiesen ist. In weniger als 3 Kilometern ist ein Outlet-Center zu erreichen, das alle gÃ¤ngigen Designer beherbergt.

Der Casinobereich wurde von uns nicht genutzt, ist aber auch nicht anders als in den anderen Casinos. Im Hotel gibt es diverse EssensmÃ¶glichkeiten, ein MC Donalds und Starbucks. Die LÃ¤den in der Einkaufspassage fand ich im Vergleich zu den Top-Hotels eher einfach.

Es gibt auch ein rund um die Uhr geÃ¶ffnetes Fitnesscenter, ein Spa Center, das Restaurant Top Of The World in 240 m HÃ¶he, ein klassisches Las-Vegas-Buffet und vieles mehr. Highlight ist der fÃ¼r HotelgÃ¤ste kostenfreie Tower mit einem herrlichen Panoramablick Ã¼ber Las Vegas. Hier oben kann man auch diverse FahrgeschÃ¤fte buchen oder sich an einem Seil in die Tiefe stÃ¼rzen.

I had booked a room on a higher floor so if I wanted to stay on a higher floor in the remodeled section I would be forced to stay in a room with 2 queen beds, the view and feel that their website offered was what I was most interested so we decided not to argue and just take the 2 beds. Their pictures on the website and descriptions of the rooms are so deceiving. I understand this isn't a 5 star resort but don't lie to me. They put us in a cubby hole with 2 beds that smelled like smoke and had a connecting door where I could hear my neighbors getting it on.

Generous comps
Lucky Blackjack tables
Drinker-friendly pool bar
Reasonably priced rooms
Golf courses nearby (for daytime drinking)

This property values ""moderately"" priced play. In my experience, blackjack play averaging $50\/hand results in 700 sq. ft. comped suites with a jacuzzi tub big enough for me and friends (if I had them). The other strip properties don't even make an effort at that play level.

I have been offered comped tickets, travel, & suite accommodations including the 2007 NASCAR races at Las Vegas Motor Speeway & the 2007 Las Vegas Grand Prix.

I get an awful lot of play without digging too deep into the gambling budget account. For some reason, the dollars don't disappear in a drunken haze like at other properties. Truth be told, though, the $1000 I won for a Royal Flush was gone in five hands of Blackjack.

The pool bar re-opens in early March, probably to coincide with the arrival of all the NASCAR psychos OR because it's warm again, not sure which. Very basic bar with water-misters to keep you chilled out. 

There are two regular bartenders, Dick & Melody, that I've gotten to know over the years. Watch out for these two. Besides really good drinks, they're still on the hunt for a quality photo of the ""moose knuckle"". They already have the framed photo of the ""camel toe"" behind the bar and wish to add to the collection. In other words guys, go to the bar before you go into the cold water.

Years ago when I began visiting this property, rooms were less than $40\/night and as far as I know, still remain in that price range. I don't care who you are, that's cheap in Vegas these days. 

Definitely a good value for the traveler on a budget or who doesn't need the glitz property to have a good time.",9,4,4

I called around 3:45pm on 3\/18\/16. I spoke to a girl I could barely understand that had a heavy accent. She asked a few questions including when I wanted to have my reception and my budget and told me she would get John Fisheddy for me and placed me on hold. Although, I couldn't understand her very well, she was the most pleasant part of the phone call. I was placed on hold for over 5 minutes and she got back on and said he was going to pick up in a second. I waited 10 more minutes until I finally hung up. 

Called back again, got through to John, and asked if he had time to go over a few things with me and he said, ""not really, I've been busy."" To which I politely told him to have a nice day and called Drais next. They were much more polite and helpful. 

Will not recommend this place to anyone I know, even for free. If that is the kind of attention I get for wanting to spend $60k on a private dinner for my family and friends after my wedding at Bellagio next month, I wouldn't recommend anyone spend $100 there.

I can only speak from a customer service standpoint as we did not stay in the hotel, but I was nothing but impressed by way we were treated in this hotel.

We were on a scavenger hunt as part of the Yelp Spring Break weekend, and one of our challenges was to get a picture in the elevator of the Stratosphere.  Belly's full of custard from Luv It, we decided it was worth a shot to ask if we could just get a picture in the elevator without actually going to the top.  What we thought would be a simple yes or no turned into a full blown tour of the upper tower of the Strat, with no stone left unturned.  

The fact that one of their staff would take time out of their day to show us around was totally unexpected and gracious.  I would come and stay here simply because of the phenomenal customer service.  Hats off to you Stratosphere, you've won my heart.

The guy said they were open until 2am and to come back around 1am and the lines would be better. My boyfriend went back at 1am and they had shut down everything except 1 ride. The next morning we go to check out and we were told there was a $70 charge to our room from the 107 lounge. I just paid it so we wouldn't miss our flight and looked into it once I was home. I called and spoke with a manager of the lounge(Jason) and he verified on the phone with me that the ticket authorizing $70 to be charged to our room was signed by a man named Jesus. There was no Jesus in our party nor staying in our room. The manager(Jason) said he would have surveillance look at it just to confirm and call me back. The next day I got a call from a different manager(Anthony) that told me he was working and saw my boyfriend sign it (which my boyfriend said he didn't) and when I asked him to send me proof, all he sent me was a receipt with scribbles all over it. All that was legible on this receipt was the $20 tip that was left. When I emailed the manager(Anthony) back telling him I could provide proof that wasn't my boyfriends signature all he did was pretty much tell me he wasn't going to right this wrong and if I still had issues to take it up with the surveillance manager and hasn't returned my emails since. That was 4 days ago. It was one thing after another after another. The first manager I spoke with told me that they absolutely check IDs before they let someone charge something to a room.

Now, when you pay so little for a place to stay, you should generally understand that a few things will be lacking.  This said, in the case of the Stratosphere, overall, there really wasn't all that much to complain about.  The room was surprisingly spacious and was clean.  We didn't have one of the newly renovated rooms but it was still in good shape; nothing super-memorable, but, nothing *bad* either.

The view from the 15th floor was nice; we had a decent view of the strip and it looked great at sunset.  Mind you, the Stratosphere is definitely on the further end of the strip, so consequently, you have to walk or cab about a half-mile before you start seeing much and don't really hit the thick of it for about two miles, which I really don't mind.

Had fun in the casino and actually came ahead with the slots.  The desk staff, attendants at the tower and rides, and the lounge staff were all really friendly and had a great sense of humor.  The bartender at the bar when you first walk in the front doors was quick, but wasn't much help when I asked if there were any places that had pizza or tacos in the area and quickly left to go talk with other staff members, but the guys at the desk on the graveyard shift were helpful.

Overall, had a nice experience and didn't pay too much for it.  I'm the sort of person who doesn't spend much time in their room when they're out on vacation, and I found the free tower access and 2-for-1 martinis at the tower lounge to be preferable to having a marble countertop in my bathroom (which I have at home anyways).",1,0,2

Upon checking in we were told that we were on the ""un-renovated"" side; the north tower 19th floor. We were told that in order to upgrade, it'd be an additional $30 per night (we were staying 3 days and didn't see the point in spending the additional $90 so we figured we'd give the room a shot) 

Once we actually got to our room, we were not impressed by the dingy linens that were placed on the beds and noticed that they had a few tears in the sheets. 

Like another reviewer on here, we noticed an indescribable foul smell in the room when the air\/heat wasn't on. In addition, the water pressure was very hit or miss; some days it'd be strong and others it'd be so weak you could barely wash your hands properly.

THE POOL! Why is no one talking about the pool? Yeah it's not Rehab, but it's awesome! The cocktails are fabulous and SOOOO good, seriously so good, and there's bikini black jack, tons of giveaways, and CABANADA! Obvs, I appreciated that. Honestly, my boy and I didn't leave this hotel for the first 24 hours or so we were in Vegas and I don't regret it. The casino has awesome drink deals and I still remember our Black Jack dealer Annie who was amazing! We were there during playoff hockey and got to bet on the games, big deal for Torontonians let me tell you. Also I found everyone here really nice. They all wear the locations of where they're from so conversation is a breeze. It's incredible how many people go to Vegas and decide not to leave! We also caught the show Bite - a topless vampire musical set to 80's rock. It was a riot!

THE BAD: The hotel was much farther down the strip than Google maps led me to believe. We decided to walk down the strip to get to the action and it was sketch central. So many people who were really messed up. 

Honestly, everything was good here. Great restaurants and lots to do, plus the view from the top is breathtaking. I regret not dining in the restaurant, which apparently is amazing. We headed to the top one afternoon to do the rides, which was such a rush! It really provides perspective on Vegas as a city. We ventured into other hotels and casinos and they were nicer, granted, but you really can't get better than the Strat on a budget.",3,3,3

We finally get to the counter and even though we were checking in late, they had a room available with our preference. One star for that.

The bed was comfy and there were enough pillows. The premium view wasn't so premium. The bath tub was rather deep. Everything seemed clean.

The casino itself was nice. Stay away from the Wizard of Oz machine if you don't want to get addicted.

The first time in March of 2012 I stayed in a select room and would've given the hotel 4 stars.  This time (Oct. 2012) I would only give them 2 stars.  This time I was put in the north tower and I will never stay there again!  

I can chalk my disappointment up to being spoiled with a free upgrade my first trip but the lack of customer service when I called the desk to complain really got me.  

Select room:  very nice.  There was a safe in the room, modern decor, spacious and a beautiful strip view (18th floor I believe)

North Tower:  room was ok, very simple decor, clean enough and a view of essentially nothing.  The lack of safe was my biggest complaint, I am in Vegas travelling with cash I don't want to bring it ALL with me when I leave my room.  The other complaint I had was the bathroom.  Being that I was by myself it wasn't the biggest deal, but if I was travelling with a companion it would've been a deal breaker.  The bathroom floor was barely big enough for the door to close.  I am a big girl and literally I had to stand between the toilet and tub if I wanted to shut the door (the sink was outside the actual bathroom).  The toilet seemed to sit very low and was not comfortable, it felt like when you get in the car and someone was sitting straight backed only you have no recline lever.  The tub on the other hand was too high.  It was up on a platform of sorts so standing next to it the edge was over my knees.  It was a very deep tub if you wanted to take a bath, but getting out seemed dangerous to me.  I almost slipped each day so I learned to leave the bathroom door open and use it as a handle when getting out.

I will be torn whether or not to stay here again.  The price was right both times, but I don't want to be put in a position that I have to pay for an upgrade.

As for the casino:  I arrived on a Saturday and the stench of cigars was very overwhelming.  The rest of my stay I didn't' notice it nearly as bad and the good part I seemed to do ok in the gambling department.",0,0,0

I always wanted to do the sky jump so when i finally got the nerve, I was almost disgusted with the sight of the hotel. 
First the parking was so filthy that I almost forgot that i was in Vegas. It reaked of urine and was full of trash all it needed was to have homeless drug addicts asking you for money when you stepped out of your cat. 
The inside was if the casino desperately needed a cleaning. The casinos at state line trump in cleanliness compared to this place. 
The room was depressing. Very small and dirty. Also or was like I was transported to the 50's with the out of date furniture. And the bathtub also had a deep tub that you need a step just to get in.
The sky jump, the staff half were very nice the rest RUDE AS FUCK! ! They half-assed answer any questions about the jump pretty much ignore you.

Of course, taking into consideration the location, which seemed like it was almost in a neighboring city, the price of the room goes up when factoring in cab fare.  I spent $25 getting a cab from Stratosphere back to the MGM Grand, where I was staying.  Thus the price of the room increases.

Hidden on the 2nd floor...I bought a ticket online and had to ask where it was (signs need improvement) but very happy overall.  I had emailed saying I was alone Xmas night and they offered me 50% off ticket and $20 open bar.  I WAS IN !!!!!!

Great show, great booze, met some very nice people, got a bit shlooonged....then took uber back to the strip ...great night overall.

The gaming area is large and they have a wide variety of the newest slot machines. The table action includes all the standard games: craps, blackjack, roulette, and different poker games.

 we found the casino to be inviting and energetic with a great mini mall and food establishments with some great shopping opportunities. We didnt get a chance to check out the tower as there were so many other to do.

CONS:
We booked and paid for a non-smoking single king with mini fridge etc. Got to check in, we were downgraded with no discount to a basic two queen smoking room. When we enquired about upgrading to a room similar to what we booked, we were i formed there would be an upcharge yo do so.

We were suppose to stay here next month and I came here to check reviews as I do everywhere that we plan to go. When I read the reviews about the bed bugs I became worried because we will be taking our child with us. And the pictures to back it up! So I decide to call the hotel to ask if the recent reviews are true about the bedbugs and the first response from Jenny the operator was that reviews aren't always true and I informed her that they were all within the last month. She transfers me to a receptionist and I ask the same question. Is it true that you guys are having problems with bedbugs because we are suppose to stay there next month? Her response is that bedbugs are brought to hotels by guest and most hotels have them. WTF!! So that makes it okay???? Then I inform her that in previous reviews it says that the hotel reimbursed resort when they get the complaints, so is that their was of acknowledging the problem? I've NEVER had an issue with bedbugs at a hotel EVER and don't plan to start now! Then she says I'll transfer you to housekeeping but Jenny the operator answers again. I let her know it's me again about the bedbugs and her response is, we try to stay on top of it but every hotel in America has them. I can transfer you to engineering. I said, well since no can tell me, ""No we don't have an issue with bedbugs, then I have my answer, thanks for your help"" We will not be staying here!!! Thanks for the heads up everyone!! I'll spend the extra money somewhere else for peace of mind!",0,0,0

This visit was from Sept 21-25, 2012.  It was coincidental that I stayed here again as my friend had a timeshare with a great deal for this hotel.  

CONS:
What I don't like about the Stratosphere is that you always have to speak up or else you will get stuck with a subpar room.  Last time we paid $20 more a day for an upgrade to a suite (It was indeed sweet!!!).  On our recent visit, there were just so many things wrong with our room, they HAD to move us to the Select rooms.  The Select room was on the 18th floor so it had a nice view of the city.  It was more modern, brightly lit and had a safe.  Even the shower ran better and included a Moen shower head (it's the little things, lol).  I think they offer the worst rooms to customers  first instead of the ones on the more newly renovated part of the hotel.  I don't like that.

Next, even though housekeeping is available until 5pm, our room was only cleaned once (and a horrible job at that) while we were there.  Really ""Molina""?  

As you're passing to and fro, the smoke on the casino floor will take your down...lol

Another thing is it is further down the strip (almost downtown) so cabs can get pricey.  

Also, concerning the area around the hotel: to me all of Vegas is hood so I don't get the ""dangerous"" warnings with the area around this hotel.  As a woman, use common sense and don't travel alone at night (behavior you should practice anywhere).  Many of the people who live in Vegas are on hard times, homeless people everywhere! No surprise there!  

PROS:
I will say that the Stratosphere has some of the best hotel food I have enjoyed in the good ole US of A.  Like...really good food with large portion sizes.  The first time I ordered a lot of room service as I was on a romantic getaway, lol.   This time my girlfriends and I ordered in twice and both times we loved our meals.  Veggie burger and salads are spectacular.

Discount tickets to local shows: we got a good deal on ""sold out"" Cirque du Soleil Zumanity tickets for the same night.

I love that the hotel is a theme park onto itself and has lots of attractions including several restaurants inside (even the ""shi-shi"" Top of the World restaurant).  It is also great that your room key grants you free admission to the tower.  Go to the outside observatory for the best view of the city.  Don't waste your coins on the binoculars, they are poor quality.  Last time I went on one of the rides: X-treme.  It was awesome!",2,0,1

I was a little disappointed in how far the hotel was from the main part of the Strip (it's about $20 for a taxi ride to the opposite end) but the room was pretty good.  We were on the 24th floor which was pretty quiet.  Not much of a view but the bed was big and comfortable.  The bathroom is split (toilet\/shower and sink) and very small.  I wish there was a coffee maker in the room.  The hotel itself is much less crowded then all the other Strip ones we've been to which is fine is you're just planning on sitting at a table or machine to gamble.  We didn't see any of the shows offered there but we did go see the thrill rides which are pretty scary and entertaining to watch.

In a 3 night stay, I found a roach on 2 out of the 3 nights.  While the hotel offered a great rate on hotels.com, there was no notation regarding a renovated room vs a non-renovated room.  We were placed over by the ""tour"" elevators, and in a non-renovated unit.  The stay was mediocre at best and made worse by the roaches.  I killed one of the roaches and took it to the Manager on duty on Sunday am 10\/9.  I took offense at his attempt to make things right by ""waiving""  one night's reservation fee of $30.  After some back and forth, he made an adjustment to the bill for 3 nights amenity fees.  Being that we were checking out and needed to make our flight on time, I reluctantly agreed.  

I was truly disappointed with both the room, the service, and needless to say the roaches.  The minimal attempt to make it right made things worse.

It was already too late since i already booked the hotel so we just went with the flow. I must tell you when we arrived there the hotel looked very nice and clean. My friends main issue was the room so we were worried about the rooms and carpet being dirty but I guess they renovated all the rooms and the rooms were super clean with new furniture and all the good stuff. We loved it. Also booking through groupon I got 4 passes to go upto the Tower which is really nice. Once you head up there you can see the whole vegas. They had a female Dj and she was playing cool hip songs. Over all ill say it is a nice place to stay. You can just stay in the hotel and do so much.

Check in: Check in was rather bland, not much dialogue and very robotic. I did, however, receive my keys and was sent on my way very expeditiously and not a long drawn out process which i like alot.

Room: The room was just fine in my eyes, some might say it is rather basic. The central air worked beautifully, and the first thing you notice when you enter the room is the CLEAN smell all throughout. The room was cozy feeling and it suited the purpose just fine.

Pool: The pool area (Elation) had 2 hot tubs and a large pool. In the Summer season there is a restaurant\/Grill out there. The pool itself here has always been a tad colder than a lot of others in town but its large so enjoy it. The hot tubs are just right.

**Note- the buffet here is now called ""Crafted"" (Used to be called Plate) - i am not sure if the food has been updated or improved but a year ago the food was only so-so and borderline disappointing.

TOWER- Its 108 Floors of pure enjoyment. I love being up there for the view and picture taking. The 107 Lounge has some good food and there is a place that served the BEST FRESH peanut brittle i have ever had and was only $5 for a whole bag of it.

The elevator people were great, you can tell they say the same thing over and over because someone will interupt and they can keep going without missing a beat.

I went around 815PM, so it wasn't that crowded. I walked around the enclosed part and bought a drink at the bar. That was a very expensive pineapple juice! I got a 4oz plastic cup filled with ice, a dash of Malibu and the rest was juice for $10.50. I understand where I was and expected to pay 10 bucks for a drink, but tasting the alcohol would be nice. I have an alcoholic drink maybe once a month, even longer, so I'm sensitive to it. I commented to the bartender and he said it was there. Uh huh. Right.

For $23.00 it got me to the top of the building and one ride. I haven't gone on a ride in 14 years! So I decided, hell, I'm in Vegas, might as well. So I got on the Big Shot. Was it a right choice? Yes and No. When I walked out to the outside platform with just the fence keeping you from toppling off, I kinda freaked. I was okay inside because I was surronded by walls, but just seeing a fence keeping me from the edge...well I turned into a chicken. I wanted to see the very top and ran into the Big Shot ride. When I walked up they were looking at me like are you going to get on, so I handed over my ticket and sat down. No thoughts, just did it. 

Yes it was thrilling, and thankfully only 30 seconds. No because I kinda kept my eyes closed for the most part. LOL

We are in Vegas for our 19th anniversary, decided for a quick get away. So we chose the Stratosphere, Grand Suite.

The room was terrible. the staff except the bell staff were terrible. When we arrived we had to pay $10 to check in early, $5 per night to look at the ghettos of Las Vegas. 

When we got to the room there was trash on the floor outside our door, we told the cleaning lady she picked up the big pieces but left the rest.

That being said the worst was yet to come. We went to bed and all you could here was the elevator going up and down, and up and down, and up and down. So there was no way we could sleep there. We called the front desk and complained. I asked the woman who took the call why this was not on the website, that all the grand suites abut the elevator. She said ""if she had built the website she would have said that"".

This tells me that this is an ongoing problem with complaints. 

So their solution was a much smaller room and did not refund the extra monies we spent.

That's a lie. We like walking a lot, especially after we've had a meal, but it takes you anywhere from 40 to 50 minutes to walk to the actual strip. Thankfully we had a rental car so we drove there every time. There is free parking at the Cosmopolitan, Venetian, and Treasure Island so take advantage of that if you can. The place itself is particularly smelly because people are smoking everywhere. I know what you're thinking, everybody smokes in Vegas casinos. But this place has that totally on point. If you go someplace like the Cosmopolitan or Venetian you don't constantly inhale cigarette smoke and you don't go back to your room wreaking of it either. The upside was that the stuff was pretty friendly, I know because I had to see them several times because our room keys kept not working. No exaggeration, I was down at the front desk every single day getting new room keys. The buffet is exceedingly average. We went there for breakfast and dinner on two separate days. The food is just okay, but I guarantee that whatever they have on the buffet you can definitely make it better at home. We finally ventured outside of the casinos and strip and found an amazing crepe place that we ate at more than once. The buffet cost is $50 and the food was at best average, The Crepe Station cost us $30 and the food was delicious and we left full. Also, in regards to room service, they missed us several times. They actually only cleaned our room once during a four-day stay. And they only give you two towels per room, so you kind of need them to come every day. We ended up having to empty our trash ourselves into the trash can down the hall several times. Bottom line, the place is pretty shabby and rundown.

When we first checked in, I was surprised about the $16 ""mandatory"" resort fee they wanted for each day.  Since my room was already prepaid, I had no choice to accept it.  At the other hotels on the strip, I can opt out paying the resort fee.   At check in they told us that we would be checked in at the lower floors and if we wanted to upgrade it would be $20 a night.

The A\/C vent had so much dust built up that the weak air spewing out  made you breath in dust!!!!!  It's unsanitary.  The rug also needed a much needed shampoo.  After complaining, we eventually were moved to a better room.

 After complaining about dust, you would think the housekeeping would wipe things down better.  After coming back to the hotel at night, I can see the dust build up on the cabinets, which I would wiped down myself.  Also, they should clean the bathrooms better.

Aside from the cleanliness, its far from everything else. I didn't really want to walk the area.  It's better to just use your car if you intend to go some place at night. One last thing, it takes forever to get a drink when gambling.

I call room service and they advice it's a $6 charge and can only take cash. I call the front desk and was advised there's no card on file to my amazement after it was taken care of during check in. Attempted to resolve over the phone and was advised they can't and it's policy. Worst thing you can say...it's policy instead of apologizing or advising that its for my protection or anything, at least show some sympathy. 

At this point it must be a joke it can't be this serious just for some water. What kind of service is this for any guest, business, local resident, visitor or anyone. I then have to go down to get it resolved and ask if they can credit the charge of $6 for troubles. Afterwards I get the same response, no I cant per policy. I ask to speak to the manager, I can care less about the $6 charge it's the principal and service. The front desk goes to talk to the manager and comes back saying they can comp the charge and will call room service and will have it sent to the room within 10 min. 

My experience in Vegas and room service it takes 20-30 min to get anything. I wait 15 min and call room service and they said they canceled the order and never received auhtoization from the front desk. Are you serious?! By this time its midnight , I was trying to go to bed at 10 for my meetings tomorrow. I finally get a knock on the door at 12:26 about 2.5 hours later...Mind you all this is for some water. I was better off getting the blow dryer and heating up my own water. The service man gives me a receipt to sign and of course theres a charge, I refuse to sign but then I can't have the water if I don't sign. I advise that the water was comp by the front desk and was told to call them. I sign the reciept, take my medicine and in frustration warn all future guest of the lack of common sense, communication, and couresty this establishment which is hospitality provides. 

It should not be this hard to get some water. I will be talking to management tomorrow after business and will update with how they handle this lack of respect of time and inconvenience

Update: it's 1am and its uncomfortable in the room, extremely warm. Set the air conditioner when i went to bed 30 min ago and the temperature hasn't changed. Called to have it looked at and will see what happens .

Update: it's 1:30 I called the front desk 3 times and no one picks ups. Called house keeping to ask for assistance and advised it was a different department and will follow up. Lady followed up and is sending someone up, origional request was never made by front desk. Unacceptable

Update: amazing , after 5 min so 1:35 a facilities rep arrives and is doing maintenance while I should be sleeping. States that it's broken and won't be able to be fixed until 11am and will schedule someone to come out then.",1,1,0

When you book the room make sure you choose the Newer Tower as you don't want to be in the old section of the hotel. Next, they have reasonably priced drinks at the bars you won't pay 12-15 a drink as you do in most of the upscale hotels. In addition, they have a great Italian restaurant with good service and easy access never to busy..There is also a mall upstairs which has a large selection of shops.

If you have never been to Vegas I would not recommend this hotel. If you want to be in the heart of the city this hotel is too far away unless you have a car.

Good: it's really cheap and the hotel has nice amenities. There's also a lot of stores inside which is nice. 

Bad: All the ghetto people stay there because it's really cheap. You also have to walk through the deserted ghetto part of the strip to get to it, so I suggest you take a cab. 

Bottom line: with the money you're gonna spend cabbing to the better part of the strip, you may be better off staying closer and paying more. But if you're on a really tight budget and don't mind walking 1-2 miles, it may be worth it.

- the shades did not close all the way so as soon as it was light out, we knew it. Not a good thing for when you're in Vegas.
- It's so far from the main area of the strip. What you save on your room you will spend on cab fare to go out or check out other casinos.
- if you want to be around mostly other adults, this is not the place because there are a TON of kids.

They said the room through Diamond resorts was a standard room with a limited view and I would need to pay the upgrade charge of $15 a night.   With some deliberation we went ahead and upgraded to the strip view and paid the $45.  Already a little irritated we went to our room.  Once we arrived I was absolutely disgusted!!!!!!!  Nothing about our room said well appointed.  No fridge, no coffee maker, the room was tiny.  We were tripping over each other just to walk around the room.  The channel line up was pathetic.

First off they changed the TOP OF THE WORLD's food and it is not as good as it used to be. We used to have our anniversary dinner here every year since before my husband proposed, and every year after! That is till last year. That was 6 years!! We also loved the menu at Roxy's Dinner and had gone there every chance we got, but for the rest of the hotel forget it. I don't understand why they can't keep a record of returning customers preferences!? I had to tell them every time that it was our anniversary. At The SWAN hotel in Orlando we dropped a bottle of wine coming into the hotel in front of a valet and he found out that it was for our birthday celebration and when we got back from our day at the park there was a bottle of wine similar to the one we dropped, with a happy birthday note!!! Now that is customer service!!  

The year before last I booked the sweet heart suite and when we got there that was not what they gave us. I called down and told them the room was the wrong one and they said it was my fault, that I booked it wrog. They did try to make it better (after some arguing) and gave us a different room. Which was great! It was a suite that looked out right onto the Sky Jump. It tickled me to watch the people as they went by my window all day and night!! I laughed every time. I love it so much that I asked to book that same room for when we return, the lady said no problem that we could get that same room. I paid the higher price so I could have the SAME room!! When we came back they didn't give us the same room! They put us way on the other side of the hotel! I told them it was the wrong room and that I wanted the same room we had last time, that the lady I booked with said we could get the same room. They said that that room was rented out but they could put us in a room near it, I said the whole point I wanted that room was so I could watch the people fall past my window! 

The room they gave us you could see the jump unless you pressed your face to the window and only just barely. The room smelled when we walked in, there were stains on the couch, mold all over the bathroom shower, and dirty feet print on the bottom of the tub! I wasn't going to call again because it just seemed like there was no use. Then, they called us and told us that we can't stay our whole stay in that room because they had a VIP coming that was going to be put into that room. Now that really chapped my hide!!! I told them ""So you are saying this person is more important than us??!! They basically told us they were, and we were out of the room. I told them I wouldn't be coming back, and that they might want to rethink putting their ""VIP"" in that room!

Price was great. I got my room online, straight from the Stratosphere website itself. It was a lot easier then the hotel.com travelocity.com type of websites cause you get to pick your room based on pictures. So you know you don't get those nasty multi colored comforters. 

They do charge you about 10dollars a day for amenities. Our room with tax and the surcharge was about 50 a night. Considering the best western down the street from my house is 100 a night, that's pretty good. Plus free entry to the tower.

I agree that the neighborhood is a little gross. Doesn't seem dangerous, at least to me, but there are a lot of bums you have to walk by. There were two young guys that reeked of urine. Gross.

It's a couple good blocks away from the strip, but the Deuce bus is right there and it's cheap. Also one block away at the Sahara is the metrorail. 

They have a McDonalds there too. So cheap food!. And an ihop a couple doors down. 

When we went, it was a bit windy, so the rides on the tower were closed.   Boo!!! :{

The staff was very friendly to us. Our room was clean. 

But the first night we were there (Saturday) there were a couple of girls in the hall talking really loud and woke me up. And a couple of door slams. The second night was good though.

I heard that it was a decent hotel but was still a little weary.  First of all, its located at the end of the strip right before downtown. It starts to get sketchy near Circus Circus.  One of the workers advised us to always take a cab at night because it can get a little dangerous.

Second, I had booked a non smoking room with two queen beds. They didn't have it when I arrived but had a smoking room. I didn't wanna sleep in a smoky room so they gave me a non smoking one bed and said I could switch tomorrow.  The room smelled of smoke.   Did the switch the next day which was annoying but it was fine.  Room was better and didn't smell.

Third, they charge you 11.99 per day for internet and $1 for LOCAL calls. WTF?

Fourth - everytime I called them to the front desk, I either got hung up on or disconnected.  Everything I asked for never came.

Fifth, I asked for late checkout on Sunday and figured it wouldn't be a problem since the conference was over.  Flight wasn't until 4 so I didn't want to have to just hang out in the casino or airport. $30 for a late checkout.

North of the strip and far enough away from the action that you won't be bombarded by the frenetic pace of the strip.  The hotel itself above average.  The rooms were nothing special but clean and nice amenities.  We stayed in a semi-suite style room that had it's own ""living room"" separated from the sleeping area.  The casino itself is small but serviceable though I didn't end up winning too much while I was there.

The buffet here was pretty good, your standard fare for the most part but everything they put out was really tasty and not the same bland blah-ness you would experience at any random buffet.  A little pricey but if you get the ACE card (a frequent players' card that's standard at any casino these days), you get a 10% that makes it a little more worthy.

What makes this hotel special are the rides they have at the top of the tower.  Taking advantage of the height, the rides will literally throw you over the edge and bring you back again.  If you're on a budget and looking to get the most bang for your buck and don't need to be in the middle of the strip, then this is the place to go.",1,0,0

My mom has a medical problem and we were given a complimentary refrigerator for it which they sent up very quickly. The stay was really good everyone that worked in the shops were really nice helpful and respectful. I lost my credit card in the hotel and it was returned my a staff member. I had to wait about an hour at the front desk because the Supervisor was caught up in something but the Security guard that was there was real nice and funny and kept me entertained. We then went to see the show Pin-up which everyone recommended not to see and I now know why. We arrived 25 min early and greeted by a really nice lady and seated. They were going around serving drinks in sections. They went to every section but the 10 of us in our section we waited about an hour into the show before I went up there and asked when we were receiving a server to order drinks they then came over about 6 min later and asked what we wanted but by then the show had 10 more min left. The show was very dry and not very entertaining. The housekeeping who took care of room was really nice. Towards the end of my stay the refrigerator that was given to us froze my moms medication. We figured that the medicine was ruined because it says do not freeze but she still needed to take it till we got home just in case. So we let it defrost and checked the temperature to make sure that it some how wasn't moved to a colder setting which it wasn't. We didn't tell any staff about it that day. The next night she goes to put in her medication for her eyes and it was half way frozen but was able to get out some drops. We then called the room service in the morning because we were going to sleep. In the conversation with the front desk at 10am we were told that housekeeping will be up with a refrigerator. Security came up and did a report who he was really nice and answered everything that he can. And also stated that housekeeping will be up. We waited about half hour and left thinking by the time we come back it will be changed out. We got back into the hotel at 1:53am and it was still the same refrigerator with my moms medication frozen again. We called front desk wondering why one never came up. They stated they didnt know why and they will call housekeeping but we didnt need a new one we were leaving in 5 hours. I then called housekeeping which I waited on hold for 8 min and then received a housekeeper that says that she guesses that she is a little busy and the front desk cancelled the order thats why it never came. And decides to get really rude when I start asking her questions. I called the front desk and spoke with Carol who was really helpful and concerned with the situation and didn't really know what to say and was relaying messages from her Supervisor. I then became very Irate because it seemed like nobody is concerned about my moms well being. I told her that I would be down there shortly to speak with them face to face. At this point in time I no longer wanted to spend money in Stratosphere. I came downstairs very hostile were Julio the supervisor explained that I needed to calm down or I would be escorted off the premises. I did and he was very helpful nice and understanding and Comped our night and Resort fee. I then apologized to him and Carol for anything that I did to offend or disrespect them. The Security officer Mr.Ellis was very helpful and concerned as well. 5 hours later when its time to checkout which we were told we can do on our TV wouldn't let us. When i get down to the front desk there were 3 clerks all busy with a 4 more people ahead of me. When I finally get to the desk I told him that we were checking out and he said that in order for me to get that money I had to wait for him to do the math and paperwork. Because I waited i then missed my shuttle to the airport and had to wait an hour for the next one!,0,0,0

Location: This hotel is not on the strip so it felt really secluded, although it wasn't too far from the strip. Most of the good restaurants and stores were a distance and we could not bare to walk in the heat (115F of dry heat). However, the hotel was closer to the Speedway, so coming back from EDC was about 15-20 min closer than the strip.

The room: the room had some things that could be worked on. The wallpaper was peeling a bit, one of the lights didn't work. The shower head had poor flow\/water pressure. The room also did not include a fridge or microwave so our left over food had bacterial growth within hours and had to throw it away.

The room was dated.  Not what I expected from a hotel on the Vegas strip.  I guess that's why it was so much cheaper than the other hotels on the strip.  The bathroom is so small that you have to step into the open shower in order to close the bathroom door.  The toilet sounds like launching a jet engine with every flush and it will wake up anyone you are sharing the room with and possibly the neighbor.

This is not a super high end hotel and you get what you pay for but I got exactly what I was expecting for the price.  A lot of people complain in their reviews about the distance from the strip.  Technically The Stratosphere IS on the strip.  It is on the very end of the strip which is a little ways away from the center of the strip where a lot of the action is.  That being said the bus that runs the entire length of the strip has a stop right in front of the hotel and it runs 24 hours a day and can be ridden all day as many times as you like for 7 bucks and for three days for like 20 bucks, which is much cheaper than taking cabs back and forth.  Because of this the distance was not an issue for us.  The casino was smaller but also less busy than some of the others and they do have a lot of 5 dollar black jack tables that can be harder to come by farther down the strip.  Yes, the casino does smell of cigarette smoke, they ALL do, it's Vegas SUCK IT UP or don't come to Vegas.  Sorry just had to get that out!

The hotel was completely average. Which would not normally be a problem, but this is Las Vegas we're talking about here. Vegas is the king of over-the-top hotels with above-average luxuries as the norm.

The Stratosphere is in a bad part of town, so walking at night to and from the strip is not only long (about 5 miles), but also dangerous. The staff recommend using the city bus service, which isn't half bad. Except for when the buses fill up and cause you to wait in the Vegas summer heat for 45 minutes (with no shelter at some of the stops). For the 4-star rating that this hotel claims, a shuttle service to and from the strip is sort of expected.

The restaurants (with the one exception of the Tower restaurant\/lounge) were decently priced for Vegas, but completely sub-standard food quality. My friend and I had dinner at the pizza restaurant. I paid pizzaria prices for a (large) slice of pizza. What I received would barely qualify as a slice of pizza my high school served 15 years ago when I attended: cardboard crust, dripping grease pepperoni, tasteless cheese.

And the entire experience felt like the hotel was nickel-and-dimeing us every chance they had. Internet was $12\/day PER DEVICE. Who, in this modern age, has less than a cell phone and laptop (and possibly a tablet) when they business travel? So theoretically, one would pay upwards of $36 a day JUST TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET. Are there alternatives? Yes, but this is the year 2013 people--not 2003. Especially when near every other hotel on the Strip doesn't charge for WiFi access. If you choose to stay at the Stratosphere for their cheap prices, be ready to shell out more for all the ""little stuff"" that comes expected in most hotels.

My friend and I were sharing a hotel room, and we decided that we were too tired to travel back that night and we wanted to extend our stay an extra night. Unless the hotel is completely packed the next night, this usually isn't a problem. Not at the Stratosphere! When we called down to the front desk to make the arrangements (at 4:30 AM, by the way), we were put on hold for 27 minutes (verified by the phone) and then ultimately having to go down to the front desk in the morning when the clerk refused to extend the night until we could come down in person. Even if that is policy, at least do something other than be rude when we ask why.

Given that this hotel is rated at 4-stars on several travel sites, the experience was horrible. 2.5 stars max. 

Avoid unless your other alternative is Circus Circus.",5,1,0

However, this past weekend I stayed here at the stratosphere. From the moment I stepped into the hotel I knew it wasn't going to be great. I got in at about 1:30pm, granted check in was not until 3pm. I have never had any issues with being accommodated when arriving early at a hotel. If there are rooms available, check ins are simple and hassle free. Not the case here, with just 1 1\/2 before check in, they had a $10 charge because I was ""checking in early."" Really?? The $10 weren't the issue, the attitude and tone of the lady ""assisting"" us to check in was extremely rude! Customer service is huge! And the stratosphere employees all seem to hate their jobs! No one greets you, and when you attempt to ask a question, it's as if you're bothering them! 
Sad to say, but I will never be staying here again.

It served its purpose -- a place to sleep. But that's all it is -- a place to sleep. It's so far away from the center of the strip, you're better off finding a place closer to the middle than wasting cabfare.

If we had not been able to upgrade our room for a minimal fee I would have given 1.5 stars. Upon check-in the first person was pretty awful. Charged us an extra fee for checking in 45 minuets early (when most places just let you check in if the room is ready), on top of a resort fee, and then we were told it would be an additional $20.00 a night to upgrade so we passed, headed to our room. I'm not even sure why this was a room they give people. It was dank, old, bathroom rusted in several places, small, and sort of scary. We headed back down to guest registration, found a much friendlier person to work with, who set up with an upgraded room at a much smaller fee. As soon as we even reached the ""Select Elevator"" banks the scene changed This was a million times better, it was a normal hotel room, and not like the 1 star quality one we were originally given. We had  decent views from this room, could see people take the Sky-jump, and had a perfect view of the dessert. Sunrise from this side of the hotel was beautiful. 

We went up to level 107, and the service was horrible. The waitresses were pretty rude, to the point that we left. The Starbucks, and the few things we were happy to have at the hotel were closed.

The room itself was no better than your typical Best Western, Super 8, Travelodge, etc.  Hell even the last Travelodge I stayed at had a refrigerator and coffee maker, which this room lacked.  The view from our room kinda sucked since we were not on the strip side, but hell not every room can have an exciting view.  I was also a bit miffed that the windows did not open, but since the room had decent climate control I didn't mind too much.

The casino was a standard casino... no different, really, from the Indian casinos I've been to here in Northern California.  We went to a lot of the bigger hotels along the main part of the strip in our sightseeing and noticed that all their casinos were very themed and a bit more professional looking than back at the Strat.  Although, the Strat did have the cheapest minimum Blackjack tables we found ($5) other than TI.  So being Blackjack players, we did most our gambling back at our home base for the weekend.

The layout was pretty confusing too.  I usually got pretty turned around, but by the 4th day of our trip we knew generally where things were.  I also appreciated that the shops were on the second floor and we weren't forced to go through them on our way to any attractions, unlike some of the larger hotels.

A brief word on the pool... it's on the 8th floor, which to us was a bit deceiving.  We assumed that it had to be an indoor pool since the hotel has about 24 floors.  Not true... it's out on what I assume is the roof of the casino.  Generally nice, decent bar, lots of family activities.  There's a volleyball net set up with water polo type balls floating around and a few basketball hoops set up along the side.  There was plenty of chairs, but not enough shade.  Wasn't the best pool we saw in our sightseeing at the other hotels, but it was definitely a better pool than your average hotel.

We did decide, however, that despite the price we would not stay there again.  As I mentioned, the room was nothing special and it was so far away from the main part of the strip (like Janelle H said, it was way farther away from everything than we thought it would be) that cab rides to any of the other hotels ranged from $10 to $15.  We didn't do any real calculations, but figured we'd probably spent enough to cab fees to cover the cost of staying at a nicer hotel closer to the heart of the strip.

We walked into all the other hotels and casinos saying ""wow look at that!  this is great"" and I don't remember any ""wows"" or ""look check that out"" going on when we walked into the Strat.",3,0,1

The pool? Freezing cold, making it uncomfortable to lounge there even on the hottest of Las Vegas days.
The service?  Alright.  Nothing great. 

The Stratosphere, or the Strat as we came to call it, was a place we avoided spending our time at.  Every day we took the Deuce bus to the ""real"" Strip (ie where all the action is) and we would stay out as long as possible.  Our hotel room was strictly for sleeping and showering.  The view was kind of crappy even though we were on the 21st floor because we were staring at the back of the giant Stratosphere sign.  

We got a smoke-free room but I guarantee you any where you go in this hotel will smell like the inside of Snoop Dogg's car.  Swisher bud smell!

The power went out while we there for like ten minutes.  We sat there in the dark and then called the hotel to ask what was going on.  The lady snapped at us and said ""they'll get to it when they do.""  What the fuck kind of answer is that?  I mean she could say she doesn't know without being so rude.

Anyway, the pros are: it's on the Strip, it's a huge hotel\/casino in the vicinity of other hotels and casinos.  Although I caution you, if you're depending on the bus or cabs: itlll cost you $16 each\/cab or 1-1 1\/2 hours on the bus to get to major casinos or popular Strip areas.  The bus was always packed last weekend (nothing major was happening that weekend, and the real crowds should only grow bigger during the summer\/during proper long weekends like Memorial Day).

Ah yes, the Stratosphere. The North Star of Las Vegas. I can always find my way around by looking for the largest structure in the land. 

While the casino is away from the active Strip, located in an area that's a bit run down, it also means less street traffic to deal with, you're close to the freeway, and is fairly easy to get to Downtown Fremont Street. Just depends on how you look at things, I guess.

HOTEL
I have had the opportunity to stay here a few times within the past year. Try booking through hotelclub.com. Considered one of the more ""economical"" casino hotels, don't be expecting a lap of luxury so set your expectations as such. Nevertheless, the rooms do look remodeled. Some of the amenities: iron and board, small closet and chest of drawers, a TV with limited channels (at least they have ESPN)... One time I tried to turn on the blowdryer, there was a pop and then smoke. I was able to call the front desk to have a replacement sent over later that day.

Some perks I like: When you book a room, you get access to their impressive gym. Did I mention 24 hour access?! Also free admission up the Stratosphere tower when you show your room key. 

Three more tips before going up the Tower:
1) Pay attention to their operating hours,
2) There is a security check before entering the elevators,
3) A green screen photo is taken before going up the tower, so don't wear green (sadly I made that mistake and my photo came out as a floating head).

You can check-out from the TV menu, as many other casinos implement this as well. Just leave your keys in the room. Checkout time here is 11am.

CASINO
Comparing the casino experience with that of others along the Strip, it's simply average. It's certainly not as glamorous or glitzy. But if you're the type of person just looking for machines to play, then you might be satisfied. It's close enough to Circus Circus too, if you want a place to entertain your child (or inner child).

DINING OPTION
Plate (the buffet) is just average as well. If you decide to dine here though, make sure you have a players card to get their membership discount, as that will cut the costs by 25%. I've also found the service here to be rather sub-par as well, as servers would simply disappear after a while. Our family dined here right as Sunday Brunch ended, so I was able to see the transition into dinner. I must say, the brunch is far better, and I was disappointed to see the iced crab legs taken away.

Other dining options: McDonald's, this sub sandwich place, a Mexican place... Roxy's Diner is 24 hrs. There's even a Fat Tuesday here. *heh*

VERDICT
Consider Stratosphere an inexpensive place, whether to stay or play. If that's your thing, then enjoy! If not, look elsewhere. As for me, as long as the price point remains one of the cheaper room options in Sin City, you might find me here. Not so much to play or eat though.",1,1,1

so off we went to go and try to fix the situation, and they weren't rude or anything [bet they had enough practice about complaints...], but when we checked what kind of a room it was, they said it was a smoking optional room.  we didn't pay all this money to go and have it spent on a room that will permeate our clothes and other belongings with smoke!  they offered to use some sort of air freshener\/ ionizer- but that's not enough, because it'll still totally aggravate boyfriend's allergies, so they then offered to send an ionizer to the room.

the ionizer worked well enough, but i felt like the staff should have been better prepared, especially since we booked this room a few months back and such.  the room was clean but it wasn't anything too spectacular.

ps. one thing that i noticed amongst other things though- we felt like because we were ""younger"" they didn't extend as much courtesy as they could have.  i mean, if we were, say- five to ten years older, i bet they would have given us a room at a much better placing than this one.

free ride to the top of stratosphere and the view is pretty breathtaking, but for the money we spent on the room- i don't think it was really all that worth it- good deal or otherwise.  plus the casino area is kind of dingy.",2,0,0

The main advantage of staying at the Stratosphere is the reasonable price for slightly above basic accommodation. For a single traveller like me, I would rather spend less on the hotel room (where I intend to spend as little time as possible) and put the savings towards a show, meal, etc. The view from the Premier Tower is quite nice but can also be quite rundown from lower rooms on other towers.

Check in has always been slow with a long line. There's also a compulsory $5 per day 'resort charge', which gives free tower admission from 10am-1pm daily and a few other fringe benefits. The check in clerk tried to bully me with the fact that he didn't have any rooms in my class when I had pre-booked and paid for but I stuck to my guns and got an upgrade.

The Stratosphere isn't anywhere as plush as some Strip hotels but I don't think you can expect that for the amount you pay. There are quite a few eating options though not all of them are open everyday. I enjoyed the buffet which fills you up. The overnight diner offers some very cheap meals with coupons readily available.

There's an outdoor pool and spa bath on the 8th floor. Reasonable size with a volleyball net set up and basketball hoops and balls freely available. There's also a table tennis table and a bar in the pool area.

The ride to the top of the tower is compulsory in my opinion, especially at night when the neon really brings the town to life. There are indoor and outdoor observation decks and yes, the thrill rides at the top of the tower do shake it, so don't worry - it's not an earthquake! There are also a lot of laughs to be had from watching the faces of the thrillseekers on the rides. I love roller coasters but even I was a bit worried at the look of X Scream and Insanity. They are certainly unique ride experiences because of the location.

There are a couple of shows on - American Superstars, a tribute show which was entertaining and available cheap with coupons, and Bite which I didn't watch. There's a shopping mall with more down market but cheaper stalls than some of the lavish Strip hotels.

I didn't find travelling along the Strip that bad - it's a 5 minute walk to the Sahara hotel and the monorail which has 7 stops along the Strip and takes 15 minutes to travel to the other end of the line at the MGM. There are Strip trolleys but these aren't as reliable due to the brutal Vegas Strip traffic in my experience.

So I found the Stratosphere a reasonably priced base for exploring the Strip.",1,1,1

When we arrived they insisted I never called, and when I showed them my call log they continued to insist this despite it showing a 5 minute call to their hotel. After 6 hours they didn't have our reservation and refused to call to check it. They insisted we pay again but assured they would ""fix it all"" in the morning once they received their reservation. When we got to the room it was two ""double"" beds, not the king as I was told. The entire hotel floor was covered in garbage, discarded food trays,  and debris. The room floor was also full of trash and dirt. There were public hairs all over the tiny, squalid room, which smelled heavily of sweat and smoke. I couldn't stop sneezing all night. The towels did not look clean and one was even damp and crumpled. The room walls are paper thin and you hear every person in the hall and in the nearby rooms. It was a horrible experience. When I spoke to the supervisor he only made flimsy excuses and platitudes. What a disgusting place. They don't even meet the minimum standards of cleaning or customer services that you would expect from a one-star hotel. Honestly, once you add in the resort fee ($13) and the taxi (about $25 each way, because its ridiculously far from the decent casinos and in a crappy, somewhat unsafe area), you may as well stay at a better place regardless of if you you got a good rate from a third party site.",0,0,0

Beware, there is a hidden fee of $5 (""resort fee"") in addition to prepaid room charge. Also, even if you are guest of the hotel, you still need to pay ($6) to get to the Stratosphere tower. Why isn't this included into the hotel accommodation?

On a positive note, this hotel allows you to pay 20 bucks and check out at 6PM if you so prefer. Isn't this a great option, if you are hung over and wanna sleep the whole day after? :)

Sure, it's not a five star mega-casino a mile down the strip, but it's actually affordable.

Here's my stay experience: 
I stayed here for about 5 nights, checking in having no problems at all, we were hesitant again about doing the $20.00 sandwich ( we didn't do it at all because the lady looked intimidating hahaha). It didn't matter though because we were asked if we wanted an upgrade to a newer room, one for it having a strip view but also it being a smoking room. I of course said NO because the upgrade fee was ridiculous. So NO we didn't upgrade and I definitely didn't want to be on a smoking floor. 
ROOM: So we got to our room on the 11th floor, it was simple, clean, nothing fancy. At first I was kind of upset because our view was the parking lot, but whatever I wasn't going to stay in my room the whole trip and it was just for us to sleep in. We had partial view of mountains which was nice. The bathroom, don't get me started. The tub was hella tall! Me being so short had a hard time getting in and out. Also the toilet flushed weird, and the DOOR! Wth it wouldn't close!!! I should have not forced it because I ended up getting stuck in the bathroom and panicked, my husband had to pull the door his way with all his might. Other then those things the room served its purpose, bed was clean. Air conditioner wasn't loud it was perfect and comfy. 
HOTEL IN GENERAL: 
The elevators hella freaked me out. I know it's old, and I don't know if they even inspect them, but there were a few times where I thought we were about to be stuck in the elevator! It creaked and people don't care they pile on in that thing like nothing lol. Anyway stratosphere y'all need to check your elevators. ALSO! Beef up on the security! One night my husband decided to stay on back in the casino, I ended up getting into the elevator with all my bags from shopping, (with an older lady and 2 drunk men). She pressed her floor I then pressed mine, the men did not press anything. I thought it was a little strange. I got out and the men followed me. I was a little on edge about it so I knew not to enter my room. When I got to the door I then pretended that someone was in my room, my pretend person did not answer the door so I decided to walk back to the elevator, the two men were one door away looking at me and pretending to try to ""OPEN"" that door with a card that looked a lot like another hotel room key. I then got to the casino floor, sat down across the elevators and watched as a bunch of girls went up, 10 min later husband found me and we went up together. SCARY EXPERIENCE, maybe it was my fault for not telling stratosphere security, I won't give less stars because that was on ME. But I do feel beefing up security would be great. 
VALET: Sometimes valet can be good sometimes it's bad. People just don't know how to drive! They don't know what it means to move your damn car up. There was one night where we waited to valet our car for about 20 min until the valet boy came up to us, he was extremely busy. Get more workers valet! Chop chop lol
CASINO: Morning blackjack was bomb. They have a great selection of machines, $1.00 wheel of fortune yes please! Great program as well, if you plan on staying here sign up because you can win stuff!

I called VIP to make a formal complaint on him, and I filled out the survey explaining my horrific experience with him.  In addition, there was another player next to me who saw the whole ordeal unfold from the very beginning to the end.  He told me he was also going to complain about him, and he told me he was surprised that I totally didn't lose my cool with James.  I love the Stratosphere, but James is truly a sad representation of what the Stratosphere is all about.  He is an absolute disgrace to all of the fantastic employees of Stratosphere.  Please file a formal complaint on this fool, James, if he treats you the same way.",2,2,2

Then we went to our very small room, we live in an apartment but our living room was larger than this one, we went back down and asked for a better room I mean that one had the sink outside the bathroom next to the bed. So we pay more for a better room, and it really wasn't much better the only positive during check in was Tom the man who helped us the second time. Sadly not our only issue this stay, we took a shower and found fresh blood on the towels that wasn't ours. And found blood on our sheets and pillow cases and when we told the manager all she did was order changed down service which was already to be done. And that was it! So that night there was blood on sheets again at this point we just gave up. When we were checking out we talked to a different manager and he gave us a refund of two days of hotels resort fees. It did help and that's what earned it a second star. Also no where mentions the shady neighborhood that it is located. We saw people shooting up drugs on the street in front of it. Definitely not a honeymoon spot. Very disappointed.",0,0,0

As I mentioned on other sites; The Stratosphere has some concerning issues regarding people being bit by bed bugs.  I am researching and seeing more and more complaints literally everywhere!!!  And its not just this hotel, there are many others out there!  But since I stayed at this hotel, and it was my first time staying there, I must state my experience.  Me and 2 other work colleagues were staying here for a work convention.  I went to bed around 8:30-9pm and awoke at 7:30am to get ready for work.  Sometime in the night, I got bit.  I know this because I didn't have the bite when I was getting into bed after my shower.  Later that day after working 8 hours, the redness started to become really noticeable, it started to get swollen and it was not feeling pleasant at all!!!  We went down to the front to report it; they had us make a report with Risk Management.  They were very rude and not helpful in anyway. Hours later after making the report, I couldn't take the pain anymore. It was becoming bigger (it felt like my wrist was going to pop open with the pressure) I took a taxi to the ER, and the taxi driver even mentioned that I wasn't the only one that had been transported to the hospital for this same exact issue.  I'm now preparing for small claims court.  I am reaching out to any others that have had the same thing happen to them.  They have denied to being responsible for bed bugs.  So I will just try to ask the judge or try to subpoena in all other records\/complaints from other guests that have also told them about this issue. My other coworker was staying in a different room than us girls.  So it's not just the room I was staying in. It's in more rooms!  I will attach all pictures of my infected bug bite. (just as the doctor diagnosed me at the ER - infected bug bite)  I will also attach (after I redact my personal information from my Medical records regarding this issue, and what prescriptions they had prescribed me to get rid of the infection) 
I'm just really surprised the hotel didn't handle this situation at all.  I spoke with them, wrote them a letter also attached all my medical records with doctors notations within the letter.  And they still are not going to pay anything towards my out of pocket expenses I have endured. This hotel has breached their duty to having and providing a clean and pest free room for their guests.  
I'm researching more on this hotel on how they go about cleaning and exterminating the rooms.  If anyone has questions or anything regarding this Hotel.... I would greatly appreciate if you can message me!  Please... thank you.",10,3,0

The window in our room faced the wall of another building. Disappointing, but okay for what we payed. 

Went to the Top of the World restaurant. It spins, very slowly, while you eat. Doofus here gets motion sickness incredibly easily and couldn't finish my $60+ meal. I had the parsnip soup (pretty amazing), but couldn't eat my salad or entree. Had to leave the restaurant completely before my entree even came. They were nice enough to wrap it up for me, but my experience was truly awful. If you easily get sick, do not eat here. You'll end up throwing up your expensive-ass meal in your mediocre hotel room.

Also, ordered room service and put the table out when we were finished. . . and it stayed there until we checked out the next day. Other guests starting piling their garbage on it. A little ridiculous.",3,0,0

I'd say that if you go to Vegas, you have to ride the totally terrifying rides at the top of the Stratosphere. I couldn't even ride the one that dropped you over the edge because I'm too much of a weeny and afraid of falling. I did ride the one that shoots you upward and drops you down (Stratosphere) and the one that is a larger, scarier version of the carnival swings that spins you over Vegas. The spinning one was my favorite because there was something magical and surreal about it. It was more thrilling than scary. But some of my friends definitely thought that the spinning one was the hardest to stomach. 

They will not let you bring in your purses, shopping bags, or anything else that could fly off on the rides -- for good reason. 

Oh, and while you're waiting for your friends to get themselves together and get over to the rides, there's an arcade on the floor where you buy tickets. If you like arcade games, it's pretty easy to rack up a lot of tickets and win some good prizes. My sister won a giant stuffed pig. We named him Statospig. He rules.",0,0,0

It's on the high north end of the strip.  To get to most places you will need to take a shuttle or bus.  But this didn't stop me from having a good time, you can drink on the bus, and you can treat the ride like a tour!  This place is walking distance to a few other ghetto casino\/hotels like Cirus Circus.  It is also closer to ""old vegas"" than most others more south on the strip. 

The hotel is relatively new, and well looked after.  They have rides that actually look pretty fun.  The roulette tables here have low $5 minumums which i really liked.  

I would recommend this place to anyone going to vegas for the first time on a fixed budget.  The quietness of the hotel will let you gamble in peace.

  Second thing was the pool, more precisely the cabana we rented.  The cabana was fine and the service was good but when the bill comes around they slapped a 20% gratuity charge.  This was not mentioned anywhere nor were we told about it when booking it.  (It ended up being $30 extra). Now our server deserved 20% but the 20 was also charged on the $95 cabana.

Just the right amount of crowded, outstanding service by everyone I encountered, and I didn't feel like I was constantly being ripped off like most other strip places.

Saw the Frankie Moreno show for free, which was one of the best show's I've seen. Lots of bars, restaurants, and stuff to do.

Affordable, clean, and a good time. It has changed quite a bit since then. I booked a non-smoking room in the select tower and upon check in, I was upgraded to a (non smoking) room with a spa tub. I was super excited. When we got off the elevator, you smell the smoke very strongly in the hall. We walked down the hall to our room and along the way, we passed glasses left on the hall, plates left in the hall, room service left in the hall, and empty beer boxes left in the hall. We opened the door to the room. The spa tub was HUGE. The view was okay, partial pool and mostly parking lot, but I could see the mountains so that was a plus. The tub was big and nice, but took forever to fill up with the low water pressure and one of the jets didn't work. They only give you two towels. I like at lease 4 as I use one for my hair as well. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, but the air vents were DISGUSTING and the room reeked of smoke. I mean, it's Vegas, I get it, but at least try. Clean the parts of the vents your guests can see. They were black. And they have the nerve to put a sign on one of the tables saying they will charge you a fine for smoking in the room. How would they even know? The room reeks upon entry. One night it smelled like someone was smoking in our tub. It was that bad. We stayed at an older hotel downtown on the first part of our trip and even that didn't smell as bed. On the second to last night of our trip, we decided to watch a movie, but the TV required a code. My husband called down and asked for the code, to which he was told we would have to come down and put a $50 deposit to watch movies, after we were already in our pajamas. I grabbed my debit card and went downstairs. The girl at the desk told me since I didn't leave my credit card open, that's why it asked for a code. I was never given the option at check in. She told me she could run my debit card, but she didn't know how much it would charge ""because the system does it."" No one knew how much it would charge. Long story short (20 mins later), she got her manager who said it was fine to put a $50 deposit and they would refund whatever we didn't watch. I would not have had a problem leaving my credit card open had I been given the option to begin with. I also would not have had a problem with her blindly running my debit card, there was plenty enough money to cover, but I just found it baffling that they could and would charge someone's card without knowing exactly how much they were charging. We were going to a wedding the last night of our stay. My husband was wearing his military uniform and we brought our own iron. He took out the ironing board and they had an iron bolted down to the board. It was bolted in such a way that he couldn't fit his clothes on to iron the board. Just another frustrating part of the stay. The buffet was horrible. There was very little breakfast selection and what the had was cold. Anyway, the buffet prices went up, the resort fee went up, and the quality went down.",0,0,0

Since 0 or negative stars aren't an option, 1 star is the lowest rating I can give. Check in Wednesday, October 8th: informed our room wasn't available and we were offered a larger room at the same rate, and a later check out time. The ""larger room"" was 2 floors below with a ""view"" of the rooftop generators. When we tried to use the jacuzzi tub, raw sewage started bubbling from the shower drain and bar sink. The smell was nauseating as you can imagine, and when we reported this to the hotel maintenance they didn't arrive for 2 HOURS! After our flight we just wanted to relax in our room. Unfortunately, our room smelled like a cesspool and the rattle and hum of the generators was constant and annoying. Also the carpet by the sink, was saturated which we believed was from the shower drain, but was assured it was a leak from the fridge. When maintenance arrived they were unable to fix the sewage leak, so we were relocated AGAIN to another room. Although the plumbing worked, we were on a lower floor and directly across from the rooftop generators. (Stratosphere was aware of a plumbing issue between the 3-13 floors because we were advised that the plumbing would be turned off for 3 hours on Thursday for ""maintenance."") After speaking to ""hotel management"" we were assured that we would be comped our first night's stay, since we had to change our rooms twice due to their mistakes. The generator's rumblings were louder due to them being directly outside our window, but at least our room didn't wreak of sewage. When we checked out Friday, we were under the impression that we would be comped the first night due to the phone call we received, but were advised they weren't aware of any issue despite the fact our hotel resort fee was refunded. Why would the resort fee be refunded unless there was an issue? You weren't AWARE of it and it wasn't NOTED anywhere? That sounds pretty suspicious to me. After explaining our situation to the supervisor, she said they don't do room comps, but could offer a later check out time. I again mentioned the raw sewage and she retorted that they don't comp out rooms. Since our flight wasn't until 8pm, we decided to take the late check out and drop our luggage off in the room. We were assured that our old key cards would work. Surprise, surprise, the keys were deactivated and we had to fall back in line to reactivate our keys. While we were in our room changing into our street clothes, maintenance knocked on our door because our check in was still noted at 1pm and not 5pm. We had to inform him that our check out time was changed recently, but they didn't bother to inform him. In conclusion, don't book at Stratosphere. You will NOT get the room you book, just whatever room is available.  If a sewage leak is found, you'll be downgraded to an even crappier room. If they claim to comp anything get it in writing because they don't honor their word. If they offer you a later check out time, make sure they re-key your cards and maintenance is informed.

We could also walk around outside with our drinks or buy tix for one of the rides.  Stratosphere's location on the strip is a tad isolated, but if you have a car or don't mind a short walk to the monorail at Sahara then it's no problem.  I made hotel reservations online thru i4Vegas.com for $124 for two nights.  Then we had relatives fly into town who wanted to go to LV so I made a second room reservation for Stratopshere two days later thru Priceline.com thinking it was cheaper.  Not so much.  Priceline charged our card for the first night stay without tax so when the relatives checked in, they had to pay the balance of $85 for their second night stay so they paid $199 to our $124 which was allot more than I anticipated.

I have never stayed in a room here but I've been enough times to tell you it's gross. The place is just cheap, dingy, and dated. Everyone there is just some haggard career slot machine crypt keeper and the place smells like cigarettes so bad you can't even breathe.

The observation deck costs money and it's a rip off. It's boring and the view is nothing special. (same view you get from any high rise casino) You get a really nice view of the Stratosphere's shitty pool though. The rides are also really expensive and the lines are too long.

We booked the package online and got free breakfast buffets for the both of us as well as some other coupons.  One of which allowed us to access the tower and observation deck at no extra cost (normally $15.95 per adult).

Check in was a breeze, although the nice lady at the counter didn't offer to ask if i wanted 2 double beds or a king bed. So she went on and booked me for the king bed. i was surprised to find that i was getting a king bed only. i dropped all my stuff inside the room and went back down to the check in counter. i was helped by another gentleman who was more than happy to give me a room with double beds on the same floor. 

Although this hotel is on the north end of the strip, every other hotel is accessible if you have a vehicle on hand. otherwise, you will be expected to take a taxi everywhere you go. personally, i would have liked to stay at another hotel somewhere in the middle of the strip but whateva it was still the best deal we got. 

a plus at this hotel is that there is a mickey d's open on the second floor and a fat tuesday's. mickey d's worked out well for us cuz they close at 4am and we was just getting back from checking out different clubs in the area. oh boy did i ever take a hit from drinking those ever famous drinks at fat tuesday's. i nearly passed out from drinking 3 different drinks at the same time, plus my strawberry w\/151. 

overall, i'd say this was a nice hotel to stay at. i like to try different hotels to see what they have to offer.",0,0,0

For $20 a person, you can get a great view of Vegas. It's extra, if you dare to ride on the many hair raising attractions available. We came here early in the day and the wait wasn't too long. We went up over a hundred stories high and were let out at the indoor observation area. There, you can watch brave and adventurous people jump out onto the target. Very cool, but not my cup of tea. We climbed up another story and there's a roller coaster that plummets off the edge and hangs. There's also another coaster in which you just shoot straight up into the air.

The view from the top is phenomenal, something I will never forget! If you are really crazy you can even bungee jump off the top! 

The ""club"" was again underwhelming... First of all its one tiny bar, no one was there and it wasn't blocked off from the general public. The fact that it is at the top of the Stratoshpere is cool but they need to not rely on the view and add some more appeal to the place.

The bartender was very dismissive and claimed to not know what we were talking about.

We had brunch at the buffet and it was decent.  No complaints at all.  We also ate at the Chicago hot dog joint, tho we didn't have hot dogs, it was OK.

This was my 9th trip to Vegas, and had never stayed in the North Strip area. The Stratosphere met all of our needs and exceeded our group's expectations in just about every way.

The pool and the fitness center along with free wi-fi and unlimited access up to the observation deck tower is included.

We stayed mid-week for 2 nights, Wednesday\/Thursday and it didn't feel too crowded. There are food options and drink options for every budget...just do some research online.

The CBAR has a 24\/7 happy hour. $3-5 per drink. There is a convenient McDonalds with good prices upstairs in the food court. Overall, the room was great, updated and clean.

People complain about the location, but honestly with Uber or Lyft, you can get where you need to go for cheap. We rode to fremont st 2x and it was only $7 each way for four people. Cant beat that!

We took advantage of the free valet and the bellhop. Service was excellent. We received a text from Vic, the front desk attendant, who wanted to make sure everything was up to standard for our stay.

Decent room, but too much for what the average metrics of what we saw other friends pay at places like The Luxor and The Golden Gate.

Rooms not as big, a bit difficult to get the inhouse maid service to answer calls and switch out linen from prior guests.

I was very disappointed with this hotel.  It was icky from the moment we arrived and called the front desk to ask about parking and got major attitude and smart mouth from the front desk chick.  No bueno.  

On the upside - we were upgraded to a ""Select"" room for 6 bucks extra each night.  This actually meant a shabby chic toilet seat.  Hooray for us!  Seriously - it just meant that it wasn't a total S-H-I-T hole...but almost.  

We were informed that we had access to the ""Select"" elevators.  Warning: do not feel special.  You aren't and they aren't!  On the upside to this - they were close to the parking garage entrance\/exit, which was imperative to avoid smelling like an ash tray the walk from our room to the outside. 

The bed wasn't exactly a cloud and the pillows SUCKED.  The towels are WIMPY, to say the least, and the water pressure reminded me of a drizzling rain.  The shopping center inside of the hotel would be better titled the White Trash Mall. 

The positives: The room appeared clean and had an iPod\/iPhone ready alarm clock.

I got my things settled and then took my shoes and socks off and then walked over to my bed when I stepped on.... something. No clue what it was. It was very brown and very sticky. Okay- note to self, don't walk by the left side of the bed without shoes on.
My friend and I started to change and get dressed for a night out. I walked over to grab my bag when, a large, metal, panel for the electrical unit in the room fell on me.

I decided to call front desk to make sure we don't get charged for this and to be honest, I was kind of expecting an apology. Nothing.

The pool on the 8th floor is beautiful but too many kids running around. I preferred the adult topless pool on the 25th floor. I went with my gf and it was a very relaxing place. Its kind of small but pretty darn good for a place where you pay about 30 bucks a night. The staff was super friendly. My only gripe is the bathtubs are so darn small but like i said if i wanted a huge bathtub I could have paid much more for another hotel.,0,0,0

Unfortunately I read reviews on yelp after we came back, I should do it before we reserved hotel. But well, let think I paid for my mistake.

It was first time in my life I saw hotel aplomb of five star place and amenities worse than in motel in the middle of nowhere. OK, I saw hotels with paid Internet in rooms, but not for $12\/day. And all of them have free WiFi in public area, like cafe, business center, lobby, etc. But I forgot last time when I saw hotel without coffee machine and fridge in room.

Since I didn't go up the tower the first time I came here, I decided to check out the top.  I can't believe they actually charge people to go up.  There's nothing really there but a high view with magnified view finders.  You still have to pay extra to ride the rides that they have.  They got this new controlled bungie jumping ride that looks pretty intense especially since it's 110 degrees outside right now.

It's on the completely opposite end of the strip from all of the major hotels (MGM, Caesars, etc), which made it really nice because we spent all day on the strip and it was nice to get away from the crowds and relax at the end of the day. It's one of the cheaper hotels that is actually on the strip, so it's a pretty good deal. It is in NO way within walking distance to the other sites, but we grabbed some monorail tickets ($30 for a three day pass) which took us pretty close to where we were heading. The view from the tower is amazing, especially at night. It was also nice that it had it's own small shopping mall so you could buy whatever you needed, or grab a quick lunch before heading to the strip. The room was pretty plain, nothing elaborate. Nice comfy king bed. You're (hopefully) not going to spend much time in your room anyway, so it's really not that big of a deal. They've got a decent sized casino, a few decent bars (I really like C Bar in the middle of the casino, except for their uneccessarily loud music), a burger joint, a buffet, an italian restaurant, AND A MCDONALDS! They also have a pizza place that is pretty good. Also, there is a Fat Tuesday in the shopping area so you can get your giant margarita before heading out for the day. Also, by staying here you get 2 for 1 passes to their amusement rides on top of the tower, and the their vampire burlesque show 'Bite'. All in all I'd say that if you're not concerned about having a fancy schmancy room and are looking for a great deal, the stratosphere is the way to go. I would definately stay here again.",0,0,0

The entire room had only 3 electrical outlets, and the shower head felt like it was jet-powered with no way to change spray patterns or pressure.  It literally threw out this piercing mist.  We requested a new room and were transferred to a 'renovated' room in the select side...for a small increase in price.  This renovated room was the exact same as the previous room except that it had some updated furniture and fresh paint.  No refrigerators in any rooms outside of suites, but they'll rent you one for $10\/night.  A cooler at Wal Mart is $3, and the ice is free.

She insisted our reservation had been mysteriously canceled & made no attempts to offer solutions and was a total grouch. This was completely untrue, we had a current reservation indeed. I was showing her confirmation emails, a tab in my apple wallet for the booking that was in fact current and then finally called booking.com to square it away-i requested that the manager take over because her bad attitude was killing me. Manager sorted out the problem, quickly getting us into the room we had booked 4 months prior. It had not been canceled, Lori was just incompetent. This next complaint might be just coincidence, but the air conditioner & TV were both busted & the nice man from engineering had to come up 3x to fix things. They also tried putting us into a lesser room than we had booked. I argued for 20 minutes before finally getting settled in the room we pre-booked. So that was the first day. On the second night we noticed security clocking us as we went out to walk my assistance dog. My husband went to buy cigarettes & i took his key card to go back upstairs. 10 minutes later he arrives at the door accompanied by hotel security. They insisted he couldn't possibly be a guest of hotel because his key was on the 20th floor, in our room with me. I was shocked when I opened the door to the inquisition. I strongly believe this was due to how we look. We do not dress like the basic crackers that mostly fill the Stratosphere's fast food scented halls. My husband has long hair & a beard, so he must be a criminal right. The security guys did go away quickly after I called them out for their faulty profiling, but it was VERY upsetting for my man to have been harassed like that for NO reason. They had seen us going in & out together several times already & wanted to mess with someone, it was weird. Harassment was not warranted. What it comes down to is this. Everything about this hotel casino sucks. The prices are so inflated. When u check in, they give u a stack of unredeemable discount cards. Not a single bar in the place would honor the ""show your room key & get a 2 for 1"" deal, not one. I would never recommend this hotel. I will never stay here again.

Before we booked here we were debating on Luxor. This is really a big disappointment considering how much we spent. Then on 2nd day here, no housekeeping came by.

She said they were short staffed. And will send someone soon. My dad called shortly to make sure they were coming but we were too mad already cus we were trying to go to bed. They said to him that this isn't their responsibility. No clean towels no toilet tissue! I went down to talk to the manager and she just gave us a $20 refund for the resort fee.

Unfortunately it is located in a very seedy, ghetto area of Las Vegas, but hey! you won't notice it if you don't care. I go to Vegas to have fun and that's what I had. Will I stay here again, definitely. I'm a fan!
Is it fun and safe for kids?, honestly I don't know because IMO Vegas is not for children, you people who bring your 5 year olds to run around in smoky casinos need to see a psychiatrist.

The elevator to the garage can be accessed by exiting the hotel near the Starbucks and walk to the garage if not the bridegway in the on the third floor and you have to either take the stairs or the escalator to the casino level of the hotel.  As with most Vegas hotels, smoking is allowed and even in non-smoking rooms, people smoke in the hallways or near the elevator so it's not like you can be smoke free totally in the hotel.  Despite the reviews that I've read about the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased about the Stratosphere.  Yes, it is a good hike to the rest of Vegas but it's certainly not as congested as the other hotels either.",0,0,0

Changed my room 3 times.... non smoking but it still stank to high heavens of smoke in each room. The rooms are awfully small for a Strip Casino (and I've been to other ones before.) The front desk people hardly smile, and are quiet rude to their guests, especially any of the foreign guests. What would have been nice is if they asked ""How is your day going"" or something similar. This didn't happen, and they just seemed to want to get rid of me as soon as I came up. The bathtub in my first and third room were disgusting, it didn't seem to be washed at all. It had calcium deposited all over and black spots all over. The furniture looks like its ready to fall apart, really. The Stratosphere itself is located in a particularly shady part of the city, lots of homeless and dangerous people loitering around.

I remind you that I have been to other Hotels on the strip that are MUCH better and fairly equal in price. I recommend going to the Tropicana, Luxor, or Mandalay Bay instead. You'll be waisting your time and money's worth at the stratosphere.",0,0,0

Our room also had a 42 LCD TV and MP3 alarm clock.

Nice use of colors and fabrics in the room. The bathroom had granite counters and custom tile on the floor. 

Bed was comfy and air conditioner \/ heater worked fine.

My only complaint about staying here was that despite the heavy-duty doors, hallway noise could be heard VERY easily while sitting on the bed. 

Check-in took 5 minutes, and check out was similar.  Parking was sometimes a chore to find, but we went during the Christmas holiday so the hotel was very packed.

I've been to Vegas numerous times before and never stayed at the Stratosphere. Me and my girlfriend arrived on 12\/30\/2016 and we immediately went to go shower and iron our clothes so we can go out. The iron was literally attached to the iron board and couldn't come off which made it very awkward to iron. The water didn't event flow properly from the shower. We got a non smoking room on a non smoking floor. The next day we woke up to our bathroom smelling of smoke, we thought maybe someone was smoking outside or maybe someone was sneaking a smoke in the next room. We left in the morning and came back around 4pm and around room still hasn't been cleaned or bathroom restocked. So I happen to see a housekeeping woman on my floor and ask for some new towels so we can shower to get ready to go out for NYE she gives them to me says a housekeeper should be coming to the room. I went to get ice and see another housekeeper on the floor and I asked her for toilet tissue and she said shed come to my room after she does 2 rooms mine will be next. An hour goes by that housekeeper never came. I had track down someone else to be sure someone will come and clean the room. The very next day both my girlfriend wake up to our whole room filled with a strong smoke smell and our allergies were going crazy. So we had to go down to the desk speak to the manager and he said the only thing he can do is have air filtering process that takes 2hrs so we left so they can do so. When we returned it was better but not completely out. We also asked the manager for a new remote control because it wasn't working and a do not disturb sign which we never got either. We got the remote but not the sign. Later in that evening when we came back (of course again the room isnt done) my gf had gotten out of the shower and was drying off in the room when she hears someone unlock the door with a key which freaked her out because she wasn't dressed. The person opens the door first then knocks. My gf runs to the back of the room I'm standing there in my boxers and the housekeeping woman walks in and asks me if I need towels as if it was normal to walk in on man in his boxers. I said yes we need towels. So she puts towels in our bathroom and proceeds to leave I ask her if she was coming back to finish the room it was after 5 by then and said okay. I told her we were leaving for the night. So the next day housekeeping just never even came at all.

Even though we made reservations a week in advance, walk in's were given a window table in front of us and we were told the wait would be an hour. The dining staff was very good and the food was okay... Not worth our $300.00 bill including tip. 
     After dinner, we went to the observation deck at the suggestion of the staff. After waiting almost 20 minutes for the elevator on the observation deck floor to leave the floor, we entered the elevator car that finally stopped and were told by the operator to exit as she was only allowed to pick up people from the restaurant even after showing her our receipt, she refused to close the doors to take us down to the lobby and demanded we all exit. We refused stating we just wanted to leave and she offered no solutions to meet our desire to leave just we had to leave and that she was calling security. 
    After some time and an elevator full of paying customers and who knows how many other paying customers stranded on other floors, the elevator maintenance people came and told her to just take us down.

Cons:

4. In the shady part of town
5. TV was faulty, no luggage stand

Full disclosure: before coming over to this hotel for a little family reunion I was in a suite at the Cosmopolitan. This Stratosphere place can't possibly compete with that--no way (can't hold a candle to it).

Pros- The hotel is very quiet. Its not like most hotels on the strip where theres a lot going on. Its a good hotel for people who want to go to Vegas and want a good experience but are also watching their budget. The stratosphere is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip but yet is good quality. I appreciated the chinese theme going on when I went there. The buffet was nice.The room was above average, though next time, if I do book with stratosphere, I would get a room where you can see the strip. Our view was just the desert and mountains and the back of buildings. The lookout was the best and I think families would really enjoy it,especially at night seeing all the lights on the strip. There is also two roller coasters and sky diving for the thrill seekers. A nightclub at the very top by the lookout with a bar. Great for taking pictures.
Cons- Although this was also a pro. its very quiet. Theres really nothing going on if youre looking for hotel life. Its quiet and that can be bad for people who want that excited vegas experience when it comes to hotel stays. The location is also a con, it is on the strip but a good walking distance from all the big events.

The tower is so tall you can see it from just about anywhere, and the journey to the top works just about  all of your anticipation muscles. 
 
Allow plenty of time for the whole excursion, especially if you are walking, because once you arrive at the tower, the entry is also long and involved. You have to decipher the directional graphics to find your way upstairs to pay, and then wind your way through the mall-like maze upwards to drop your possessions into a locker, and then finally get in line for the disclaimer part. Then you wait in a line to ride the elevator to the actual top, where you wait in a ride-specific line. This wait is relatively long, and you get to hear all the details of your fellow thrill seekers anxieties. People are trying to be cool and psyched and\/or talk themselves into or out of actually going on the rides. It's all good, and sets the stage for experiencing this truly creative use of outdoor public space. 

You need to be wearing shoes, (no flip-flops or bare feet) and there are cages to leave the little stuff in your pockets that you forgot about when you got that locker to store all the geegaws you bought in the mall on your way up.

I really enjoyed the thoroughness and imagination of the ride design details. They have all the blinking lights and comforting features of classic well-made carnival rides, yet the context is sooo strange and unique. A normal view out of a very tall building is at least panoramic and static, if not also breathtaking and dizzying ...add to that the dynamics of motion, and eXtreme changes in direction, and let's just say this one goes to 11. Or 12. Or 15.",3,1,3

It was on this trip to Vegas that I made a crucial discovery. I have been cheating myself by not making the most of this city when I'm not staying at this resort.

When I stayed at the D hotel on Fremont Street, I never left the downtown area. The Strip is enormously long with its grandiose resorts. When I stayed at a resort on the Strip, that hotel dictated what I'd see and do because we didn't want to venture out too far from our room. The years I reserved a room at the Palm, Mandalay Bay and Hard Rock, I felt isolated from the city. In short, I compartmentalized my visits; but, it kept me coming back year after year in different seasons for various reasons.

This year was the second time my boyfriend and I spent 4 nights\/5days at the Stratosphere for Mr Olympia in Sept. This year, our room was upgraded to a higher floor which offered a better view and bathtub. 

Because the hotel is smack in the middle of the Strip and Downtown, we always say 5 days isn't enough. We go to pool parties, clubs on and off the Strip... attend the Olympia expo and pre-judging... loiter, do the zipline and celebrate Halloween (it looks like it every night of the week) on Fremont Street... we don't think about it, it just so happens we spend time at both ends of the city; but, it only happens when we stay here, no where else. For that reason, there isn't a better reason not to!",2,3,2

It looks like they never updated anything here so the casino and all the furnishings appear kinda old.

I got one of the newer rooms, and it was neat and cozy, the only inconvenience is that there is no small fridge.

Location: It was a little far to walk to the more popular places on the strip, but great if you are going to Fremont Street. So if you don't have a car, you either have to spend a lot of time walking or a lot of money taking the cab, of course you can also consider taking the bus.

To me the best thing here was still the view, and guest here can go up to the top of the tower free.

Upon arriving in our room, we quickly noticed a strong odor of cigarette smoke in the room. We had specifically requested a non-smoking room when booking and confirmed this with the front desk while we were checking in. The bathroom also scored failing points as the toilet seat wouldn't stay up. This might sound like a minor thing, but it's not. As a man, I had to hold the seat up with one hand so it wouldn't fall down on me as I was going #1. Additionally, the walls of our room were paper thin, so we could hear our neighbor's conversation word for word (they also were disappointed with the room).

Shortly after checking in, we headed up to their Top of the World rotating restaurant where we had made reservations and were meeting another couple. From the moment we sat down, we felt that the server (Rebecca H. according to my receipt) was in a rush to get us out the door. We came for fine dining and I wasn't even asked if I wanted a drink before dinner. Truly astonishing! When it came time to receive the check, we asked Rebecca if she would split it by couple. She didn't even try to hide how frustrated this made her. She was able to split it, but not after making a production about how she had to go ""look into whether or not this could be done."" Give me a break. Our table had spent nearly $400 in total on this dinner. A real restaurant would have asked us if we wanted the check split before printing it out.

As for the food, my wife and I both ordered the filet. I thought it was average and she thought it was slightly below average. My advice: check out the observation deck (free for hotel guests) but skip dinner here. It's nothing special.

After dinner, we headed over to the Bellagio to gamble and drink for the remainder of the evening and early morning. We returned to the Stratosphere at approximately 4am. From the front door, we had to walk the length of the casino to get to the north elevators. We had dressed up for the night. I was in a suit and my wife was wearing a classy, shorter cut dress. As we passed through the poker room, there was only one game going on which wasn't surprising given the hour. As we passed this table, I immediately began hearing heckling aimed at my wife coming from the approximately seven men playing at this table. The phrase that sticks out in mind is ""she's gonna take it tonight."" Of course, it's also hard to forget the sexual grunting and moaning sounds that we were also treated to. As I looked back at the table, they began to actually mock me with chants of ""oh look, he's getting mad now!"" What upsets me more than these comments themselves was that neither the dealer or the poker floor manager who was standing nearby said a word to the players. I doubt that this heckling technically broke any hotel or casino rules, but they certainly broke the rules of common decency. I own a business and if I learned that two of my employees sat idly and let this go on without saying a word, I would have been furious and the employees would have been reprimanded and\/or fired on the spot. It was so disrespectful to us as customers and to my wife as a woman that neither employee had the guts to say ""calm down guys"" or ""those type of comments aren't appreciated here"".

When we got back to the room, I called the front desk and they transferred me over to the poker floor manager who we had previously walked by. After telling him what we had happened, he told me there were two poker games going on and that I would have to give him a description of the dealer so he could determine which was the problem table. This was an outright lie. There was only one game going on. I decided that was enough on the phone and walked down to the front desk. Here I was, a paying hotel guest who had also spent over $200 at dinner in the hotel earlier in the night, standing at the front desk at 4:30am. I spent about 20 minutes talking with the night manager who ""would be just as upset"" if he was in my position but ""men will be men especially in Vegas"". In the end, I wound up with free breakfast and a late checkout.

For what it's worth, the breakfast sucked. My stomach didn't feel right for the entire rest of our trip. The moral of the story: you get what you pay for! We'll never step foot in this place again.",4,1,0

There's a reason why its valet, right?  I might not come back here to stay for awhile just because of that.  Especially when you are battling over 100 degree temperature outside even in the evening... I was not a happy camper having to walk that far everytime I leave and come back:\/",3,3,2

Cool, old school feel walking around the Stratosphere. Lot of cheap minimum bet gambling tables which was perfect for a first time gambler. Their dealers at the blackjack table so so funny and inviting. Not like those foreign, grumpy ones at the higher class hotels. 
Would have been 5 stars if they didn't charge to go up to the tower. I can't complain, the view was phenomenal. I ain't afraid of heights but would have been cooler at night to see all the lights on the Strip.

We had never stayed at Stratosphere before, but we were already on that end of the Strip, so we decided to chance it for a night for $30.  We wanted to check in before noon, but that wasn't happening unless we paid $20 extra.  No thanks.  I was able to pay and do all of the paperwork, but they were not going to give us the key to our room unless we paid that $20.  We checked our bags and off we went to grab lunch.

After 3pm (normal check in time), I had to stand in line again, just to get my room key and officially check in (even though at noon, I had done all the paperwork and paid).  Seemed a little silly to me, but whatever.  The line was long and not moving very fast.  I noticed while in line that there were a lot of families at this hotel.

Got checked in, got a basic room w\/ a king sized bed.  Definitely nothing fancy.  

Check out was just as bad as check in (at 730 in the morning!).  Long line, one worker.  It took FOREVER.  

The casino was fine, it kept me busy for a while.  The shops seemed empty and the workers seemed bored.  Not a lot of foot traffic for a Monday.

With our room reservation, we were able to visit the observation deck for free. That was nice.  Standing in another LONG line to get up to the observation deck was not so nice.  But once we got up there, it was cool.  Enough room to roam around, great views, and rides if you dared (we didn't).  We did notice a lot of kids.

We arrived later in the evening and were told our reservation for a king room would not happen and they only had queen\/double rooms, nothing with a view and nothing could be done.

The room itself had a failed air conditioner which did not work even after maintenance was there, 2 outlets that are not secured all the way in the wall, a vent in the bathroom falling off and a bathroom door that we could not close or we would be stuck in there because the handle just spun. When we did shower, the towels smelled as if the dryer had caught fire while drying them.

...and no smoking floors SHOULD NOT STINK OF SMOKE. Heck, maybe get rid of the ashtray by the elevator, people may get the hint.

As for the appearance of the room, I was dumbstruck how this makes a 3 star rating. I can only think of one hotel in my adult life I was more disturbed by the cleanliness and the 'happy nap' feel to it... and the other hotel offered 'happy nap' rates.

Can somebody tell me WTF is up with the ironing board? The damn iron was attached to the board by a cable and the base was mounted ON TOP of the board, making 1\/2 the board useless. I am pretty sure prisons have irons that aren't chained to anything, but Stratosphere does. I guess when you are down on your luck and pissed you are staying in a room like this you will try to pawn anything including their irons.

After this first hour in Vegas, we decided to head out of the hotel and spend any money that weekend elsewhere. This hotel is 4 blocks away from anything you would want to give a crap about in Vegas. Seriously, Sahara was closed and nothing for blocks. If it wasn't prepaid, we would have taken our stuff and left. Instead, we had fun elsewhere.

Tip for those at the Stratosphere, we don't need the signs every 30 FT telling us abou the brand new rooms you have... if we can't stay in them, that only makes the experience less appealing.",5,0,0

For the bartender to hear me over the din of noise and ruckus, I had to lean up and over the bar a bit.  That's when she made her move.  She was an attractive and curvaceous woman, maybe 5-6 years my senior at most, a half-drank Cosmo(?) in one hand... the other hand... firmly posited upon my derriere.

""Oh, hi... ""  I squeak, a bit taken aback.
""Hey there... "" she singsongs.
""... eh, you having a good time?"" I query.
""mmmmmHmmmmm... I always do... you?""
""..oh yeah, yeah...""

After some conversation and flirty banter, the bartender, either oblivious or desensitized to such comedy, brings my drinks over and gives me the tab.

""Let me get those for you, Hon..."" she offered, gesturing to the bartender to put it on her tab.
""Oh, no, thank you I'll...""
""My treat"" she protests. 
Pressed against me she says, ""Come find me in a little bit, okay?"" as she takes one last chance to let her hand wander.

I never did see her again that night.  Perhaps she had caught some new prey...
She treated me like so much meat.
I felt cheap.
I felt dirty.

I kinda really sorta liked it... =)

Oh, the actual hotel and casino?  For the SUPER CHEAP RATES you can get on southwestvacations.com, its really not that bad, if you don't mind staying way off at the end of the strip.  Don't let the fact that you can SEE it fool you, its friggin' far!  Cab fares will eat your budget up...

The 7th floor saltwater pool is really awesome though.  I highly recommend laying out up there, if you stay at this hotel.  Nevermind the topless pool on the 21st(?) floor, its kinda *meh*.

Poly Esther's Nightclub here APPEARS to be a jumpin place, if a bit gimmicky and un-Vegas-y in regards to chic and hype.

There are at least two really good cover bands that play at the casino\/stage\/bar towards the back that kept me entertained as SE tore through a Hold'em tourney (never underestimate the pretty girl, she's a shark...!)

Our stay was $99\/night and included 2 show tickets.  Granted, the show (American Superstars) was retarded... but a show is a show.

It's on the strip, but isolated on one side - so if you are going to Vegas for action, you'll have to cab it around to get where you need to go.  Cabbing it kind of sucks, and you'll probably spend just as much on cab rides as you saved on the room.

Excellent value for the price $39\/night plus $24\/night resort fee. Our room was spacious, clean, and we were up high enough for a moderately nice view. 

The Negatives:
Parking garage is adequate but not great. Parking in the garage is free. They do offer valet for those who can afford it. In terms of safety with children, I felt much better having brought both my tazer and my mace. We were able to get to our car and back as needed without incident, but be careful with kids: it's not well lit and people drive scary in there. It's located in a pretty sketchy part north of the strip, but I like a good value, sometimes to the point of absurdity.

The casino is nice, but the people who frequent the casino are ""characters."" Keep your kids close to you. Hold hands. I don't play in the casino, but in order to get to the reservation desk, or to your room, you gotta walk through parts of it. My kids are pretty sheltered, so just walking to the reservation desk was an adventure for them. They LOVED that. Like sitting too close to a bonfire. *sigh*

The Positives:
Here's what made me very happy about the Stratosphere. First, as a hotel guest, you get free admission to the observation deck (with 3 kids along, this saves me a fortune). Also as a hotel guest, 2-for-1 day passes for the thrill rides. My kids had a blast! In terms of thrill, it's an 11 on a 1-10 scale those rides are beyond scary. My two teenagers rode until midnight, and my little one (aged 7) stayed with me (we are afraid of heights) and just took in breathtaking views of Las Vegas. It's very high up. 104 floors up; you get the same kind of views of all of Vegas as you do views of Chicago from the 94th floor observation deck of John Hancock Center. Incredible! There is also a very talented caricature artist who drew us at a reasonable price (I found a coupon online cartoonvegas.com). See my photos for the caricature of us. In it, the artist makes fun of my high cheekbones, but did it in a way that didn't piss me off. She also gave me long eyelashes, which I appreciate, because I am mostly Asian and I probably have none.

Anyhow, one thing that was a pleasant surprise is the amount of yummy food you can get at the observation deck snack bar. I fed four of us dinner for $20! We had a $5 baked potato the size of a minivan (now that I think about it, it was probably slightly bigger) with ALL the fixings imaginable! They have a loaded bar of toppings (bacon bits, cheese, chives, dressings, etc. think generous salad bar without the lettuce). Not all you can eat, but all you can fit on your potato. We also got a giant clam chowder bowl ($5) and all the toppings you can fit on that. The cashier took care of us and gave 4 free clear water cups. Plus tax, the bill was less than $13, so we paid with a $20 and tipped the remainder. I feel like they lost money on us. That's always a good feeling.

The staff is helpful and friendly, and the customer service is very good. We will book here again.",3,0,0

One of my favorite things about this place is that the Premiere rooms and better have flat screen tvs which I can hook up my laptop to. We enjoy the gambling, fat tuesday, and fellinis, however after a couple trips we got a little tired of the same routine. We now stay closer to the middle of the strip(usually monte carlo) but still visit the stratosphere for fellini's. I've been to Top of the World twice, I would not recommend it at all. The prices are inflated and even if you put that aside, the experience isn't that great. It feels a little snobby and stuffy when there with other diners who come off as trashy. This may just be from the dumb lady who kept walking over to stand right in front of us so that we could see her fat ass while she was snapping pictures of the view. UH-hello we paid for the view too, not to see your ass! Otherwise the rooms are good and there are some decent attractions. They have a nude vampire show, Bite, which was pretty boring. Basically just paying to see a bunch of acrobatic people get topless. The back alley bar also seemed like it had potential but every time we walked by it was completely empty.

So we took the cab right all the way to the end of the Strip, and hoped for the best.

While it definitely isn't as fancy as most of the Strip, it was definitely worth what you paid for.  The rooms were reasonably sized and reasonably clean.  We weren't aware that nonsmoking rooms cost more, so we got stuck in a smoking room, which sucks because my husband is allergic, but when we got up there, it didn't smell like smoke, which was a pleasant surprise, because our hallway was disgustingly cigarette-smelling.

I stood in line at about 1:05AM & was checked in by 1:20AM. I was helped by Rachel Anne and she was exceptional. She was very informative and accommodating. I requested a room with 2 beds if possible, and she informed me that all the king bed rooms were taken anyway, so the only option was a room with 2 beds. She offered me a complimentary upgrade to one of the newly renovated rooms. I was grateful, but skeptical at the same time because I had read recent reviews that stated the newly renovated rooms were not good, smaller, and the smell of paint was very fresh and too strong. Regardless, I accepted her offer. I inquired about the observation deck. Even though it was 1:20am and the deck closes at 2am, Rachel Anne ensured that we would make it in time. She informed us about the location of our hotel room elevator as well as the escalator leading to the observation deck. The cost for hotel guests to go up to the observation deck is $5 per person, and up to 2 people per room key. Rachel Anne made the start of our stay very enjoyable, especially since we were tired from being stuck in traffic & arriving so late. She goes above and beyond.

When I arrived at the room, there was a light smell of paint, but not too bad. Everything else was good. The room does seem to have been renovated. Our view was of the parking structure so we always kept our curtains closed as we don't want peeping Toms from across the way. The only complaint I have is bad lighting. There is no light in the center of the room, only 2 lamps, one on the nightstand and one on the working desk. Aside from that, our overall stay was better than I expected.

With all the bad reviews I've read, I wasn't expecting much besides a decent room to stay in since it was only going to be for a couple of hours. I was only passing through on a road trip, so I didn't feel the need to stay somewhere closer to the center strip. I also wanted to stay here because of the discount to the observation deck. If you stay here, going to the deck is worth it! A month ago, I would have never given Stratosphere a second thought; I would avoid it at all costs. Now, I'm glad I gave it a chance because it was a great stay!",7,2,3

Just a tip, it's highly recommended you take a cab or car with you. It's all free parking at all the parking garages anyways, the only downside is the traffic you'll get at night (thanks to your local drunkies, bad drivers, and pedestrians). Unless you want to be in total pain the next day cause you're walking in heels from one side of the Strip to the other, don't try walking, cause you'll be limping the next day.

The shower water smells like bleach and I had to make an effort to get into the shower cause they thought it would be funny to raise the tub a couple inches above the ground. Short Asian girl + raised tub = lulz for boyfriend. Bring your own toiletries, the ones they supply are not to great, something about being eco-friendly, so I guess you have to give them some credit for that.

The room itself was awesome, sporting a hot tub, a spacious bathroom will all the amenities I needed, a king size bed, a couch, and a good view of the strip. It was a comfortable room, and provided possibilities for whatever can happen in Vegas.
The one thing I didn't like about this place is that they didn't allow a checkout extension. So I got back to the room at 5am, and had to sacrifice sleep to be out in time. I was willing to pay more for a few extra hours, but the front desk denied this request. Ultimately, I got 1 hour of sleep because my crew wanted to eat at a good breakfast place that got busy fast. So I'm not docking any stars because I was going to be sleep-deprived anyway. Fellow yelpers, this paragraph is just an FYI.

The first time I stayed here with 5 friends and we booked a suite, which did not look like a suite with me. It was just a little bit bigger than standard room and had a sofa bed in addition to the 2 queen beds. Plus, the room looked really old. 
The second time, I stayed at the select room which was newly renovated. It was pretty standard and clean. Good size. Bathroom is not updated but acceptable. 
The other times I stayed here for free or almost free, because I got a player card here and I gambled. They started sending me room offers after one month I got a players card. Most of the offers are pay 1st night for $20 and get the second night free. Even though the rooms here are not fancy like Venetian, which I absolutely love and miss. But come on!! How I can resist the $20 for 2 nights deal and pay $300+ for Venetian. I would rather save the difference for food or gambling. 
The casino here is actually not bad at all. Lots of slots like other hotels. Decent amount of blackjack table. For poker players, they do have a poker room, even though it can't compare to Venetian and Caesars,but my friend who play poker said it does not matter where you play. It depends on the fellow players. 
For people who are planning on staying here and come to vegas all the time, I would recommend to get a players card, and play some slots. Then you will start receiving offer in mail or online for cheaper room. By the way, the managers told me the room offers have no blackout date, which I can also use it on holidays or new year eve, and that's not other hotels would offer.

It's not bad if you have a car but not a good option if you're without a vehicle during your Vegas stay. This part of town is a little run down. Lots of construction and lots of empty lots. All of this is no bother if you're driving here so it wasn't a consideration for me when I booked the room.

I got the room at a steal for a two night stay in the North tower, in one of the older rooms. The front desk gave me the option of upgrading to a newly renovated room for $15 but I didn't see the point as I didn't plan on spending much time in the room anyway.

Cesar at the front desk was a delight during the check-in process, which made the 15-minute wait seem much more bearable. 

Unfortunately, that's when the good times stop rolling. Upon entering the room (11142) I was confronted with an overpoweringly unpleasant odour, akin to a bag of sweaty gym gear left to simmer in a hot car. I rang the front desk right away to ask for a room change. The lady on the line didn't seem apologetic or understanding. She asked me to describe the smell to her (as if I was lying about it). When she was satisfied with my answer, she said that I could go down to the information desk to pick up the keys for the new room. When I got there, she told me that she needed to see ID in order to give me the keys. I asked her why she didn't just tell me this on the phone, to which she replied that this was hotel policy without offering an apology or acknowledgment of a mistake.

After switching to the new room, I discovered that the bathroom sink had a small blockage. I called housekeeping a total of 3 times within 10 minutes to no avail, even after being transferred to the front desk, the call went unanswered. The switch hook on the phone was broken, so even calling those 3 times was a frustrating endeavour. The next morning, when housesekeeping happened to be in the hallway, I asked if they could get some draino for the sink. The lady didn't seem to understand what I was saying so I showed her the blockage. She told me to call housekeeping on the phone. I literally didn't know what to say after that. The shower also drainly slowly, which meant taking a shower involved standing ankle deep in soapy water. I didn't bother trying to get them to fix it. It seemed more trouble than it was worth after my previous interaction with housekeeping. 

It goes without saying that this hotel is a little rough around the edges. It's not meant to be in competition with the main attractions on the Strip and I didn't expect (or want) a luxury experience but the service left a lot to be desired even in this price range. 

Rooms also do not have a kettle, a safe, coffee machine (the first American hotel I've ever stayed at that doesn't have a coffee machine) or a fridge. I mean seriously. I've stayed at $40 a night motels that have a coffee machine, safe, fridge and microwave. What is this? 1951?

Wifi is free but capped at 1Mbps. Just like dial-up days. You can pay to upgrade it to 5Mbps but, either way, don't expect to be streaming anything or getting any work done if i relies on a decent internet connection. 

Finally, I observed that the 2 dirty glasses that had been left in the hallway outside room 11135 since the afternoon I checked in were still there when I checked out two nights later. Presumably housekeeping felt they needed to be dialled on the phone for that too.

I'd give it a 1 star but I enjoyed the rooftop pool and bar which has happy hour from 4pm-7pm. It's a little crowded sometimes but still worth visiting for the view alone. Beyond that, there's free parking at this hotel, a luxury most of the resorts along the strip have rescinded in recent years.",5,3,0

We checked-in to our surprise, there was a ""resort"" fee of $23.something. 
This hotel was in no way a ""resort.""

Two queen beds. 
I guess I got my hopes up. 
We were one floor short from the penthouse suite (if they have one) or the very top floor, 23\/24 floors. 
Being on the 23rd floor excited me until I got to our room. 

One star for the view at the top of the stratosphere, being the highest observation point in Las Vegas & the ride attractions. And yes. That's all worth just one star. 

Rides:
If you purchase or receive your unlimited wristband, 
Make sure you use it all on the same day. 
If you're still checked into the hotel for a few days, they're not going to let you ride the next few days. 
DESPITE the unlimited rides you get. 
And NOBODY told us that. 
We were embarrassed and held up one ride because they had to call management to see if they could let us ride after purchasing our unlimited rides the previous night. 
And we ended up getting kicked off the ride. 
On top of that, your pictures are gone from the night before. 
So if you like them, buy it that day. Not the next. 
Because they delete everything from the day before. 
And again. Nobody told us that. 
Very upset. 

Room:
I hated being in the room. 
For starters, you would think being on the 23rd floor out of 24, you would have a great view.
Wrong. Our window is short of half the size of the wall. 
So smaller than half. 
And not to mention, turning the AC on in the room made the window foggy. 
So not much of a view to enjoy.

I'm definitely not one to complain about anything being clean. 
But our room reeked of some sort of cleaning chemical. 
Not as strong as bleach but close enough. 
Every time we came back into our room, the stench was so strong.
I mean eventually we accustomed to it but it gave me a headache.
We took our shoes off and one of us noticed the floor was very damp. 
I thought it was wet before anyone mentioned anything but I tried to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and assume that he AC just made the carpet cold. 
But WRONG again.
So we finally just assumed that the cleaning chemical smell was probably from a recent carpet cleaning. 
So I made sure I was only in the room to sleep. 

Few more issues about the room.
The bathroom was so small. 
Usually, bathrooms in any hotel I go to have room to change. 
But here, one you open the door and the toilet and bathtub were in reach. 
This room didn't have a fridge. 
So any drinks we took back to the room, had to be finished. 
No coffee machine, no safe, no ice bucket, no hairdryer. 
It was worse than your regular motel. 

I'll never ever recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas. 
I'll only recommend checking out the view at the top. 
As far as the restaurant and bar, I hear good things, but a 5-star restaurant at a 2-3 star hotel seems ridiculous. 
Never had I made it a mission to post my review everywhere possible, until this hotel experience.",5,2,1

The Stratosphere casino is a fairly large area that meanders from the self park garage around to Las Vegas Boulevard.  There are little tricks to remember where you want to go and which set of stairs\/escalators are the best for getting to the theatre.

The casino itself has a good selection of various slots and denominations.  They seem to target the lower rollers like me.  The casino seems to be a lot cleaner than it was when I've been there in the past.  The cocktail waitresses were around often last night and were very pleasant women.  I did notice the large percent of people who were smoking but unless you were right near them, smoke was not a problem.  They've installed a good ventilation system.

I'll always have fond thoughts about the Strat even though I'm not there very often.  It was here when I was invited to a free slot tournament that through some twist of fate, I came in first and won the grand prize of $10,000.  That still doesn't buy the place an extra star but it brings warm fuzzy thoughts!",3,0,2

Of course they offered to move us out of that room so they can fix it, but I actually had to ASK to be upgraded to a better suite. That should have been offered. No one at the front desk seemed apologetic, or even surprised, which was concerning.

Considering they run deals regularly on room process, you can get in here pretty cheap. The biggest issue is the distance from the ""main"" strip. If you don't mind a bit of a hike, or paying for the monorail, you'll be fine.

If you're really adventurous, try they Stratosphere bungee. They hook you up to a bungee cord and hang you out over the edge of the highest point, which is pretty freaking high. I'm adventurous, but that was too much for me, so if you do it, let me know your thoughts.

Staying here for the weekend for my birthday... Got hit with a ""resort"" fee upon arrival of $55. Got to our room and it was below a Motel 6... Furniture was old, stained... And dirtyyyyy... Dusty. Seriously? 

We went back downstairs, asked for a supervisor and were told we could pay $30 more a night & be upgraded to a room in the new tower. Asked if we could have a late check out on Sunday for the inconvience & was told there was a $75 charge for that... Really? Wow.

I was in Vegas for three days and had a better night at the starts than Luxor.

Granted I spent less at this hotel but got a better room than in Luxor: 

Pros: 

All renovated rooms (except for the old tower) if you pay a little more you can get a suit for half the price the other strip hotels charge. Stratosphere did not have the room I ordered available so they gave me a suit instead. It was incredible! 800 sq feet of luxury. 

Close to Fremont street and pawn stars shop.

Unlimited tower visitations.

Unlimited bar from  4-10 for 20 bucks at the bar.

Much cheaper prices than strip:

Cons:

Far from the strip: however it's closer to circus, encore, and treasure island.

This whole place just reeks of quiet desperation and looming bankruptcy. Tired, old and sad.

My best friend, her husband and two of our other friends were coming to Vegas and were not in a position to be high rollers so when my friend booked the rooms, we got the cheapest place available pretty much. It WAS ridiculously cheap (I think less than $40 a night for our room) but I really wish we had spent ten or fifteen bucks more a night and stayed somewhere nicer and closer to the nicer part of the strip. We would have ended up spending the same amount of money anyways, since a cab is a minimum of $15 each way to the Bellagio or Aria etc and can be as much as $25 if you leave a 20% tip and pay by credit card, for which there is a $3 fee) and we would have been so much happier. After reading through all the other shitty reviews of the place, I have to say our experience seems pretty typical. We didn't notice the neighborhood feeling particularly ghetto or feel unsafe walking to the car at night, but maybe that's because most of us grew up in East or West Oakland? I have stayed in a lot of really posh hotels, a lot of really cheap motels and plenty of shitty hostels and this was truly the worst spot I have stayed at overall. I would have much preferred to stay at a Motel 6 or Howard Johnsons, etc. 

CONS

- When we arrived we had to stand around for fifteen minutes and then go hunt down a bellhop who would take our bags up to our room.

- Our room was fucking gross in addition to not being updated since the early 80's I'm guessing. The bathroom was dirty and the size of a broom closet. The lights flickered forever before turning on and were not very bright. It was pretty smoky smelling. The window (singular) is only 2.5 feet wide and has a gorgeous view of the parking garage. The TV remote was out of batteries and the sound was off from the picture. There was no refrigerator. The toilet took multiple flushes to flush any toilet paper. I found a small cockroach in the bathroom. On the second night our tub wouldn't drain (like ten inches of water to stand in while showering and then couldn't shower because it would overflow). We complained about each of the problems that were fixable and they did eventually send someone up to clean\/give a new remote\/look at the toilet\/fix the tub draining problem, but they never once offered to switch our room or comp us anything for our inconvenience.

- Super far from everything, as I mentioned previously. We probably spend more than $100 on cabs in three days.

- They charge $12 a day for internet PER COMPUTER!!! Not only this, but on the third day, they charged me twice for internet for my laptop and it wouldn't even work. I called the service number where I was then disconnected twice before finally hearing that the charge had been removed and they fixed whatever the problem was with the internet.

- The service was shitty almost everywhere in the hotel and casino. I don't gamble but the whole casino just looked so tired and sad and desperate. The other casino's we walked through looked much more lively and with much more attractive people. 

- The food is gross (especially if you're a 'foodie', but lets be honest, even the fine dining establishments in Vegas are at least something of a tacky copy of their namesake's better restaurants in New York or The Bay Area). We ate at Roxy's diner and it was like a subpar Mel's diner with the same tacky 50's theme. I had the caprese eggs benedict which was ok but the eggs were really overcooked (totally opaque yellow and hard in the yolks). I had eaten one half and asked the manager to either remake it or refund me 50%. He agreed. Then when the check came he had only taken off 25%. I complained and he rolled his eyes and took off another 25%.

-We heard other people staying at the hotel complain about having their room robbed (I can't confirm this obviously, but they seemed believable). We chose not to have our rooms cleaned during the three days we were here because we were worried that valuable or medication might disappear. 

- Weak drinks. A pitcher of daquiris a person at the pool bar brought on nary a buzz. Boo. Even when we supplemented them with one or two 'alcohol infused popsicles'. These things were kind of hilarious. They had to put some kind of gelatin in them to solidify the alcohol so consuming them really was like blowing a guy with a frostbitten semi. 

PROS
+ When we finally did get a bellhop to bring our luggage up, he was a really sweet old guy who rapped west coast shit for us. A little Snoop and Pac.

+ At the pool we went to, the bartender was really nice. I dropped my $22 pitcher (its a SMALL pitcher) of strawberry daiquiri and he replaced it for free. 

+ The bed was actually pretty comfy. I slept well and had no back problems, which is rare for me",1,9,1

We were able to check in easy enough I waited about 20 minutes on a friday at about 5 pm.  Room that we got was decent and up on a high floor so we had a pretty nice view of the mountains.  The room was clean to the naked eye but since I clean for a living I noticed a lot of areas that have been neglected for at least a few months.  I mean dust and crust in corners that should easily be vacuumed or wiped by housekeeping at least occasionally.  We had 2 flat screen tvs which was very nice and the shower was very large and good water pressure.  The machines in the casino seemed pretty tight because I did not witness any big winners usually at least a couple when I come to vegas.  The employees at the bar seem really pissed off like they do not want to be there.  One bartender told some guy this is not the land of the free drinks you need to play more.  I was like ok maybe he does but don't say it like that.  He flat out said you have to lose more money than you drink.  Bad service in my opinion.  Buffet food was hometown buffet at best and not worth the money but if it is free.  Still not sure...  The pool was not heated and the hot tub was completely full the whole time.  They need to pay some serious attention to some small details and they will be back in business.

""Yeah, go get a refund."" 

The lack of communication between staff created a bottleneck downstairs in the ticket booth. There was only one cashier issuing refunds, which made the situation even more stressful. Once I was at the counter, the cashier was yelling into a phone for help. All I could say was, ""It's going to get better.""  She was nice to me and issued a full refund. Perhaps this is one of the things that the Stratosphere needs to work on. The Starbucks downstairs was overpriced and the live music was the only thing that was memorable.",5,3,0

I just came home from spending 4 days at the Stratosphere and I loved the place. Had none of the problems the other reviewers talked about. No constant cigarette smell, good food and multiple choices to eat, clean room with a nice view.

Of course you cant beat the view from the 109th floor which is the observation deck. It is all in one thrilling and romantic. The best seat in the house.

My only real complaint was that the wifi was non existent. They charge for faster service but it should be included in the resort fee.

I reached the inner observation deck area, with the slanted windows.  They had nice seating areas right next to the windows.  They also have a sandwich shop, souvenir store and bar.

I consider it a mid-range hotel: better than a motel or off-strip hotel, but nowhere near as good as the other more well known hotels on the strip. 

The first thing I will mention is that the front desk agent Maria was very helpful, and even upgraded my room to a suite for free. I booked the room through Verizon Rewards, and apparently you just get whatever is available. I was going to get a room with two beds, which was excessive since I was alone, but Maria fixed it and gave me the free upgrade. She was also very friendly, and I can tell she will go far in her hospitality career. Someone give her a raise or a promotion, because she deserves it. 

The suite included a bedroom, living room area and a bathroom. The room was spotless and it came with two large flatscreen televisions, a refrigerator and free cable. Definitely not bad at all for the price I paid, and they put me up on the 21st floor (the view wasn't great, but it was still neat being up that high). The air conditioning worked perfectly, and the shower was always hot. The water pressure wasn't the greatest, but it did the job. 

The location wasn't the greatest, and I found myself using cabs a lot since it takes forever to walk anywhere from here. I'm used to New York City blocks, which are much shorter and crammed with businesses. When I heard something was two blocks away, I got excited that it was close...only to walk and have it take almost twenty minutes to get there. Vegas definitely isn't a walking town unless you are in the heart of the Strip. The oppressive heat didn't help things either, but that's not the hotel's fault at all. 

I honestly didn't spend very much time on the gaming floor since I'm not a big gambler, but it did seem to be a tad bit outdated. There wasn't really anything impressive about it or anything that stuck out in my mind. It just looked like a generic casino.

The stratosphere is definitely showing it's age, the carpets are worn, the decor is dated, it just looked kind of dirty. 
I played a couple slot machines trying to score free drinks, and bought a sweet fanny pack in the gift shop, but the whole hotel was just kind of dead. I would definitely not stay here",1,1,0

Had to move because the first room was dirty. Even though second room was not much better.  The shower had an issue where it automatically came on when you turn the water on for the bath.  

For a hotel with a cool night life, you would expect much better rooms. I was very disappointed. The casino was pretty empty and I hardly saw anyone gambling.

The location is a nice walk from the monorail, so I would suggest driving or catching a cab to any other casinos.",2,3,0

I booked the room online on Sunday Morning during brunch, after we had already checked out of Treasure Island.  Considering it was Sunday we decided to switch it up and get a little closer to Downtown (Fremont) so we could check it out since we'd already spent most of our weekend on the strip.

The check-in line was super mega long.  I was like ""what the heck is going on?"".  When I say super mega long, I mean the wait time at a hotel in Vegas has averaged about 5-10 minutes at the most.  The wait time here was over 30 minutes.  It was Sunday afternoon folks?!?!  It felt like we were in line at LAX or we were like cattle waiting to be herded somewhere.  If we would have waited any longer I think I would have started mooing. 

The hotel room was decent, clean but a little worn. The patrons seem to be a little rough on the place.  I noticed a do not hang stuff here sign next to the fire sprinkler in the ceiling of the bathroom.  Who the heck would think to hang something on a sprinkler?  I can only gather they've had enough guests who have done so, prompting the hotel to put signs up.  Not classy at all folks.
So our room was shaped like boomerang with the bed on one and the TV at the other end, around the corner.  Good think we don't watch too much TV is all I can say here.
I will say the bed was comfortable which is something I think is very important.  The overall hotel room was similar to staying an a median Marriott.  I was kind of expecting something a little more considering it was the Stratosphere.  I may have possibly set my expectations a little too high.  I can complain really though, considering the room price was pretty good especially considering the last minute reservation.

I know this isn't related to the hotel but I'll add it in here anyway for those deciding on a means of transportation around town. We decided to use the Bus Transit to get us over to downtown (Fremont).  Getting our tickets was pretty straight forward.  The bus stop we needed was out of service. It only took us about 20-30 minutes of trying to sort it out because there was really no indication of this outside of a small 8.5X11 piece of paper with some scribbles on it which wasn't very clearly written.  Someone, skipped writing in elementary school and got a job in the transit system. I think maybe at the very least, turning off the lights at the bus stop would have been a decent indicator.  Bus transit needs clear direction for visitors when the decide to make a bus stop out of service so people aren't blowing their time wait for a bus never to arrive to pick you up.

Now for something related to the hotel was when we were asking about where to find the ticket machine for the bus transit.  It pretty much turned into Sales pitch for timeshares.  The hotel has plenty of staff awaiting your arrival and departure prepared to sell you an amazing time share for a next visit back to Vegas or to some other location you never thought you'd like to go. Very persistent. Only wish they were as persistent at helping you with the transit system. Always room for improvement and there's plenty of opportunity here.

Ok so now for the amenities of the hotel.  We went to the top of the Stratosphere to check it out and see what its all about.  We were informed there was no fee to go to the observation deck if we purchased 2 drinks per person in the lounge at the top, so we proceeded to follow this option.  We got to the lounge to get our beverages and we walk around for a bit.  There were several couches and lounge chairs, all of which were pretty much taken. Then we sat and ordered a small appetizer.  Our server was super cool and helpful.  She was keeping an eye out for folks standing around who were looking for a place to sit and would then coordinate a place for them to sit.

When we finished, we headed for the deck.  It was good timing because it was just before sunset.  The sky was clear which made for a great view.  We hung out from sunset to about when the city lit up.  All things considered, it was a good experience.

Stratosphere... you gotta check it out at least once.  We'll be heading back for sure to try out the rides at the top next time.",0,0,0

We got one weekend night for like $40, but they charged an additional $17 for a resort fee when we got there, plus a $30 late checkout fee (since we decided to go hiking and wanted enough time to shower when we came back). Late checkout is at 3pm, but standard checkout I believe is at 11. 

The room itself was old; definitely outdated and doesn't belong on the Strip! I would imagine this kind of hotel would be on the outskirts of the Strip, but if they want people to return, they need to do room updates, stat. The room wasn't dirty per-se, but it was definitely old and used, so it gave the feeling of being dirty anyway. 

The staff at check in was pretty friendly and helpful with the check in and check out process. 

The only good thing I would say is that your hotel card key lets you go up to the top, which I think costs $18\/each if you're not staying at the hotel. If you're traveling with multiple people, consider it a discount on what you paid for your stay. So in total, we paid about $87 for the hotel room, but we got $54 worth of credit to be able to go to the top, which makes it worth it... right?",5,0,0

Stayed there again a few months later and it now costs $5 per person to go up, even if going to restaurant or bar. We didn't go up even though I would have liked to.

In a 15 min wait I saw so many food wrappers and bottles left in line by guests, where is the clean staff? The elevator ride was fast, and there was a fairly old operator but barely spoke any English and nobody could understand the speech he was attempting to give. The view was nice enough, but trying to get down we waited in a room of clustered elevators and literally the first 3 we tried we couldn't go to the ground on, they only served the restaurants and club up there. However there was no sign as to which one would take us down and the operators there seemed peterbed the more people asked them which one. The lady on the way down was better but was kind of boring. None of them smiled or seemed to like being there. Now in reality, I'm an elevator operator at the Space Needle in Seattle, and was quite surprised at the lack of enthusiasm and service from the staff compared to the level of service I personally am used to giving. I was excited to meet operators from the stratosphere and talk shop but they seemed so bored and blah I didn't bother. The Eiffel Tower on the strip is a WAY better view.",0,0,0

2. Taxis are expensive, you're going to pay $10 one way and using your own car is nearly impossible. 
3. You're in the ghetto!

Some of the best things about this hotel are:

1. The Top Of The World restaurant - Be prepared to shell out some $$
2. Clean rooms for less than $100 a night
3. Free valet parking

Party at the pool...NOT! I'm pretty sure that I saw penguins due to the frigid temperature of the water and some other things that I can never un-see.

We didn't have any trouble checking in. I do have to say that before you even get inside the hotel lobby, there is an unusal smell mixed in with cigarettes. That cheap ass shady motel room smell. Then as soon as you walk in, the cigarette smell is intense but that is how all Vegas hotels are. 

Our room was 8-119. And it was an okay room. The walls are so thin that you can hear what the other person is saying. The view was awful. If you like staring at the parking structure, be my guest. It was awful. The window cleaning guy starts very early in the morning. If you ever stay here and hear something banging against your window, it is him. 

The bathroom was sooooo  small. It doesn't fit two people. My fiance and I tried. The sink is outside the bathroom and the toilet is with the shower. Overall everything was clean. They should really put shower caps for us sistas' with weaves on. They were lacking. 

The shops upstairs are swapmeet style. If you want to buy cheap jewelry, cheap purses, cheap leather jackets, etc, this is joint for you. It is not like The Bellagio that has Gucci and Chanel stores. We only came up here to buy t shirts and thats it.

This place screams OLD VEGAS. The room smelled and didn't even have a closet (just a pole to hang your clothes on). The furniture was old, and the room needed new carpets and paint. Despite the fact that Rock in Rio (over 120k people attended), this place was absolutely dead and the hallways reeked of Marijuana. It's definitely not a place you would want to hang out in. The only convenience factor was that it was right across the street from the Rock in Rio venue which helped us save on parking. Overall, you could pay the same price for something much nicer that's actually located on the strip. 

Pros: 
Friendly staff
Stratosphere tower (beautiful views)

Our second experience of this hotel  in 2012 was the worst experience I have ever had in my life.

 We checked into our hotel and came to find out that the shower had little to no water pressure at all and the water temperature did not warm up. I wanted to make sure I wasn't just being crazy so I had my husband check it out as well. Low and behold it was not just me. 

We called maintenance and it took them several hours to come to our room and look at it. Finally they said they could see the issue but he could not fix it and would need to call for an additional repair man. It took them an additional call and seven hours for them  to come up to our room and we had a show to attend that evening. 

When the second maintenace man came up he said that the entire side of this hotel had the same issue. Our question at that point was, if the entire side of this hotel had an ongoing water issue why did they book us in this room. 

We decided to go to our nine pm show and returned later that evening. I decided to go to the front desk and speak with the night manager. She kept apologizing and saying the hotel is ""old."" I told her that the hotel definately might be aged but this water issue was not acceptable. I do not mind if the pressure isn't all that hard in the shower, but to have one drop coming out of the shower head is just ridiculous. 

The manager said I can credit you the resort fee of $7.50 only. I just got back from Las Vegas and the hotel charged me the full amount for my stay 220.00. They did not even credit me the little $15.00 fee that they said they would. I will be calling my bank to disupte this and I will also be contacting them to fight for a credit for my one night of a non functional bathroom. 

We will never be returning to this hotel ever again! Is it to much to ask that we are able to take an actual shower?",3,0,0

The pool was saltwater and ok, but it reminded me of a Disney resort (ie lots of kids). The bar poolside was okay. 
There's a shopping area here but everything is low class and cheesy tourist trap. The arcade just plain sucks. 
I was too cheap to pay $6 to go up the tower; but if you're staying at the hotel and happen to not be asleep from 10-2 you can go for free.

- Weird annoying sounds (like carts rolling and high-pitched pressure from pipes during the day and night);

- Furthest from airport and thus most expensive;

We arrived at 12:30pm and opted to choose early check-in to pay extra. We were assigned a room in the North Tower and as we entered the elevator to go up to the 24th floor, a guy jumps into the elevator totally drunk, does not select a floor and then follows us when we hop out. We wait in the hallway and pretend to use our phone as we do not want him to follow us to our room and he is flustered, mumbles something and then jumps back into the elevator. We were freaked out!!

We get to our room and are so disappointed. It is tiny and there is hardly room for 3 of us to move and there is barely any sunlight in the room from a small window. We call security and inform then of what happened and they promise to send someone to checkout but never do. And to add insult to injury, the water is cutoff from 1-2pm. Why did they offer us early checkin if we cannot even shower or use the bathroom!

We went back to the registration desk and complained loudly and were ushered away from the guests into the managers office. He offered us a free upgrade to a better room as we insisted on a room which had more guests and traffic so we would not have the same experience. They reluctantly agreed.

- Greedy, unethical and bad customer service by the management. The employees and workers themselves are nicer though.
- Nothing special in the resort for which you're charged 18-35 per night. 
- Even their remodeled premium rooms are at par with a Holiday Inn at best. 
- Poorly ventilated lobby and casino.
- Be sure to check your bill on checkout!

I'm writing this after giving Stratosphere a second chance. The first time was last year when I came to visit Vegas with my friends. We were rarely in the hotel so a lot of things went unnoticed or we didn't care for them. But on checkout we were charged ~50 bucks evidently for some paid programming. I didn't make sense coz firstly, we didn't watch any paid TV and secondly, we had gone to the Grand Canyons that day! When I requested them to recheck and give us a refund, the front desk person went back to talk to their manager. While she offered to revert the charge, she was very disgruntled about it and even said ""we'll let it go this time but next time you will have to pay for it"". It was the total opposite of what good customer service is about. One would expect an apology or ""we'll look into it for you"" at the least. I wonder if it was one of their housekeeping folks taking the liberty in our room since we were gone all day, but it surely wasn't us and that wasn't the way to handle the situation for sure!

In any case, this year I gave them a second chance when I decided to go with my family (wife and a 2 year old). BIG MISTAKE. For families considering the Stratosphere Hotel, especially with younger kids\/babies, this is NOT the place to stay. You will be better off staying a little off the strip if you don't want to pay for a higher end hotel on the strip. And here are the reasons I say this:

1. Our kid is a very picky eater. We prepared his meals from home and figured any hotel would have a microwave and refrigerator. Not this one. The refrigerator was 10 bucks extra per night. I don't know if that's the standard offering on Vegas strip hotels now, but I'm pretty sure a Holiday Inn could've offered better. As for the microwave, they said it was a health and safety hazard, so they don't even offer them for a fee anymore. I had to ask around and a nice lady working at the Starbucks told me that the Circle K gas station across the street had a microwave I could use. So that saved the trip for us. 

2. I get the sense that Stratosphere's employees are nice, but their management is greedy and has the wrong idea of good customer service. One of the housekeeping people even said they can find us a microwave, but never came back. So at least she offered. One of the fast food places in their retail shops area had two nice employees who even offered to warm up my kid's food once I explained them the situation. By the time I came back with the food to warm it up, the owner of the fast food place was present. And he would not let me warm up my kid's food! I assured him there was no health hazard since the food was in a sealed microwave safe container. His explanation: the baby could burn his mouth and it would be an insurance issue on him. Again - I was appalled at how their management was concerned about their own ass and didn't care for a customer's child who was hungry. 

3. It's not all about the kid's food or the lack of a micro or fridge. They pitch their newly remodeled ""premier"" rooms as if they're the hottest thing out. Forget about offering a free upgrade. It's all about squeezing the extra bucks for them. Said rooms were only up to par with other retail chain hotel rooms. Not terrible to be fair, but nothing special either.

4. Also be prepared for a resort fee between 18-35 dollars per night. Mandatory. That would be acceptable except that there really isn't much they offer as a resort. The pool on the 8th floor is boring compared to those at other places. It was messy, dull and poorly organized. I used the pool only once on each trip and both times felt no need to revisit. The tower access is free for anyone and so is access to the observation deck.

5. The entrance lobby is dull, gloomy and smokey. Very uninviting and again, not well ventilated for children.",2,3,0

The beds looks like they haven't been changed\/washed in ages... but I suppose that goes a long with the 'you get what you pay for' theory. The bathrooms are small and the casino isn't plush whatsoever. 

However, there is a good Italian restaurant on the 1st floor which is pretty decent, worth checking out.",1,2,2

Where do I begin. The shuttle from the airport forgot we were there so he dropped us off last but at least we got a tour I guess. After a long, hot ride we figured paying for early check in was worth it. We booked a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor...the room reeked of cigs. Went to the front desk to ask for a diff room. The ""manager"" didn't even look up at me while i was talking or apologize for it. He handed me a different key and walked away. Really??? I was livid when I got upstairs and the key didn't work. Room service was nice enough to let us in since we had a baby with us. As we were settling in a woman walked in with a key that worked. They gave her the same room. OMG. It was just a mess! 
By that time we were starving but still had to get a room with a key that worked. We waited for a long time at the front desk and finally they let us stay in the room we were already in. Had to ask them to refund the early check in fee. They did not offer us any compensation for our troubles. Horrible customer service. Actually everyone that worked there was rude and unwelcoming. 
After that whole mix up we went to eat in the hotel because we were too hungry to go anywhere else and Roxy's diner was pretty bad.....we waited a long time to order and the food was bland...fries were old...service was dead. We were ready to leave Vegas at that point. Our trip got a little better later but this hotel is horrible. Our bathroom light went out twice and they took really long to address it. It was 11pm they finally showed up. The casino is really smokey. The only good thing was starbucks in the hotel.

I constantly kept in contact with them to stress about how I did not want my mom to pay for any of the fees associated with her stay and that this was a birthday gift. They assured me that all she needed to do was show her ID. The check in process is where the nightmare began. I had called my mom to see if she checked in and she told me that they had charged her for the resort fee and security deposit. I immediately asked her to give the representative the phone so I can speak with the lady. The lady then began to explain how the charge every stay a deposit and resort fee like a script and I had to cut her off to tell her I know and understand but I have submitted paperwork for a 3rd party authorization for payment. She then said she would refund my mom and would charge me. I agreed, however, when I got off the phone I went through all my paper work and realized they had already charged me for the resort fees and deposit. So I spent over a hour with the 3rd party company I booked the package from. They got the hotel to realize their mistake and I am suppose to receive a refund soon. However, my story does not stop there. My mom had spent over 30 mins trying to get into her room. She went to the front desk 3 times to change her key and the last time they sent security to help her in. So her check in process was horrible. I am also disappointed at the location. My mom said that the hotel was off the strip. Websites made it seem like the hotel was in a central location.She also complained about the atmosphere. She said at night there were definitely a lot "" women of the night"" walking around in the hotel.I feel like you should only go to this hotel as a place to rest your head. Do not book this hotel if your are looking for great service and a romantic and intimate stay. I have stayed at large hotels who make it their priority to go above and beyond during your stay. This was certainly not. There was not even a mention of my mom`s birthday at all. I would not personally stay there and I will certainly not recommend this place to anyone. I am so disappointed.

The cons are for more numerous:  the place is in a ghetto area of the Strip where I saw vagrants yelling at themselves on the way back to the hotel.

Taking the monorail at night back to the hotel is an adventure all its own, since the monorail station closest to the stratosphere is a closed down casino with little lighting on the street  to get back.  It is also very far to walk to the big casinos on the southern end of the Strip.  Gambling was mostly the usual dreck of white trash and old people blowing their retirement accounts on slots.  There were quite a number of women who were dressed as hookers, but since this is Vegas real sex workers and women coming from clubs look identical since the level of class in the city is so high.

New room had 1 king bed hooray.... But unfortunately there was no tv remote so i went to call front desk... Phone is dead. Also the fridge was not working. I had to walk down to front desk to tell them. Fridge abd phone never got fixed. Never received a phone call or apology.

(+) You have to go up to the top of the tower at least once. It's totally a tourist trap, but still very cool and offers up some great views at all hours, especially at night.

(-) This place is in a terrible neighborhood. Hourly hotels, liquor stores, and probably drug dealers and prostitutes can be found within a tenth of a mile of this place.
(-) Hit or miss with the staff. Some are ok, but a lot of snippy attitudes with some of them (especially at the cage. *cat hiss*)
(-) Despite what I have read on here, they will NOT let you go upstairs to Carvery 108 or Lounge 107 unless you are either a hotel guest or pay the admission for the tower tour. Epic Fail. Should be able to avoid this fee with a proof of purchase of some sort. Just another place that seems to believe that locals money isn't valued.
(-) my experience is that the machines have been pretty tight for me. I dont play table games at all, but those slots are tighter than a frogs ass!


I dont come here all too often lately, and every time I do I am usually quickly reminded as to why that is. With the sole exception of the tower, there is nothing the Stratosphere can provide that even a locals casino can't do better.

I understand you can smoke inside but other hotels we visited had very good ventilation and you could barely smell the smoke. The big deal about the Stratosphere is the tower which we could only visit once because they line to get it and up the elevators was an hour. They should have V.I.P for people who are staying at the hotel but no instead we waited an hour in line to get to the elevators and another 25 minutes to get up. We never got our room cleaned, and when I called to get it cleaned when I was leaving the room for the day no one came to clean it until 6pm when I already came back to the room.

Which is the whole point of this place.  But there is construction so there is no escalator that goes down and no stairs, of course.  God forbid a casino provides non-emergency stairs.

We found a lot of funky places within walking distance.  Although I caution you not too walk to far too the left because that's the bad part of town (no seriously).

 Unfortunately there is only one word for their customer service, and that is TERRIBLE!  But the room was okay and the bed was comfortable, and we even had a ""premium view"" of a concrete wall!  But we weren't too worried about that because when you're in Vegas how often are you really in your room.  The Hotel also has a Mickey D's, a couple of cool shops, Ben & Jerry's and a Starbucks on the very top.  Their Buffet is excellent for breakfast, but I was a little disappointed came dinner time.

We really did enjoy their pools.  The 8th floor pool can get a little crowded and loud but the adult pool places good music, and a nice relaxing atmosphere...not to mention a HOT pool boy!

So, if you're looking for a five star hotel...THIS IS NOT IT!  But it's a great bang for your buck!  I would stay there again.",1,0,0

The casino was ok except for this lady that stoped me and talked to me for over a hr like I didn't have anything else to do trying to sell some vacations, and I was tired just listening to her. 
The restaurant at the top floor of the tower is amazing, the waiter took great care of me and my husband. The food and the wine recommendation was perfect!

The carpet smelled like piss. They either let dogs stay in the hotel and didn't clean it properly or it was a baby, and still didn't clean it well. The bathroom is ridiculously small. The sheets were still damp when we first arrived. They do not provide water like the other hotels we've stayed at and the fan in the bathroom looks disgusting.

As for the casino, this is the creepiest hotel resort I have EVER been to on The Strip! Like the Circus Circus, it caters primarily to the hillbilly and redneck tourists. Anyone who is not missing all but their front two incisors are either passing by or headed to the rides and bungee jumps at the very top of the casino.

Often you can gauge the quality of a hotel's clientele by the looks of the cocktail waitresses. If they look fucking old or octogenerian, and still wears the company-standard uniforms that shows WAY TOO MUCH (cover your fucking eyes!), then they probably cater to a group of gamblers that are mainly homeless on the penny slots.

Rooms are not very nice.  I had the upgrade room and shudder to think about what the non-upgrade was.  In house restaurants are not so good either and the tower bar is a hassle to get to.  You must clear TSA type security just to get up.  I gave up after 20 minutes of waiting.

First, they charge a resort fee ON TOP of what you thought you had locked in and prepaid on Priceline (a site that does virtually nothing alert you to this abuse, never mind do the right thing: negotiate it into the price you think you're paying upon acceptance).

Second: no coffee in the rooms.  They say: ""there's a Starbucks in the lobby,"" which is a hike from the north tower.

Third: the condition of the room is mediocre, and it looks like they skimp on cleaning and maintaining the common elevator area.

Fourth: they lay one of those housekeeping envelopes in the rooms, which is pretty dangerous.  It creates the incentive to retaliate against guests if there is no tip.  There is no such custom of tipping hotel housekeepers.  Are they being paid enough?

Fifth: the overall character and vibe of the place and the guests they mostly attract is pretty ghetto.  This place is a slum compared to most places on the Strip.

One way to avoid this place on Priceline is to not book at the three star level (even though this place probably classifies as about 2.5 stars), but a more direct way is to attempt direct negotiation with the hotels that do not charge ""resort fees,"" which is what I will now do in Vegas until they disappear.",0,0,0

In hindsight, seeing the view we had, should have taken them up on that offer. On to the room itself. Basic, ordinary, nothing to write home about accommodations. Except, wait, what's that? No in room coffee, no exhaust fan and no extra blankets. All of which, Super 8, Motel 6 and any other cut rate hotel chains offer. The pillows were like sleeping on bags of rolled up t-shirts, and under the blankets, as soon as we turned them back the first night; a 8"" black hair. My boyfriend is bald and I have blonde hair. EWWW. On to the bathroom, a rusty moldy HOLE IN THE SHOWER, mold and mildew on the shower wall, shower rings and curtain, as well as mildew on the counter top. There was a hole under the sink in the corner of the wall, and did I mention, no exhaust fan? Also, our toilet only flushed one out of three attempts. FUN! Plus, when turning on the sink, the water sprayed all over the place at such a high volume that my silk dress was soaked immediately and had to be hung up to dry before I could wear it to a wedding rehearsal. The hallways were dingy and there was a lovely build up of balled up trash and paper in ours on the way to our room. Check out - we go to the express kiosk and the pen is dead, I ask the bearded man (on his personal cell phone) at the end of the counter if I may borrow a pen that works and he snaps at me, ""you don't need a pen, just drop your key in the slot"". Oh, ok, because that's what it says on the express check out form, I mean, why have a form at all when that's all  you have to do? I snapped back that his help was less than tolerant and we left. Again, leaving to the beautiful sound of construction. I wish I could upload the pictures we took of all the nasty that our room had to offer. I travel all over for work, and the Stratosphere is the last place I would ever recommend. It was such a disappointment and clouded our experience, if you want to stay at a low end hotel for a high end price, then the Strat is for you - personally, I would have been happier at the Super 8.",1,0,0

When I was served, I wanted to put the charge on my room and needed to walk all the way across the hotel to get my ID. When I got back to the pool to get my drink he served me the original beverage that had been sitting on the counter with the ice melting in it (yum, watered down vodka). For God sake, don't serve someone a $9 watered down beverage.  

There aren't any employees capable of providing guests with the consistant hotel information. With regards to the events taking place upstairs on levels 107\/108. I had asked the following questions to numerous staff members including the concierge and front desk. What time does the top floor open? Is there a cover? Is there a dress code? Is there is there a club or only fine dinning? What time do they close? What nights are busiest? Do you need a reservation? About 6 hotel staff members gave me different information. No one was on the same page. So, during my 2 week stay I said screw it and went up there to find out for myself. (read tower review for the rest of this story).

One night I ate at the hotel's Italian concept Fellini's. WOW, this is by far the best food the entire hotel has to offer. I was seated right away and served hot bread with a carafe of Chianti with in 3 minutes. I looked over the menu for about 5 minutes before ordering the fettuccini and vodka sauce with shrimp and mushrooms. Not only did this entrÃ©e come out the door in 4.36 minutes (yes I timed it) but it was a marvelous dish. Extremely well put together and it made me want dessert. Just as wonderful was the red velvet cake. Everything here was spot on!

On the flip side of wonderful is Roxy's diner and it is in dire need of culinary help. This is one song and dance that's on verge of becoming the next episode of restaurant rehab. If you ever served Chef Irvin the middle melt burger which is what my server said was ""the best thing on the menu"" you would probably be about 5 seconds from a boot in the ass. I ate half of this soggy mess and most of it fell apart when I cut it in half. Trying to eat this thing was a chore. The shoe string onion rings should only be served on the sandwich not served as a side. I expected rings and got a ball of deep fried onion that was stuck together. No way was I going for dessert here. This was the best thing on the menu??? What a hot mess!

On the floor I stuck mostly to table games like Craps, Pai gow and wheel of fortune. All of the dealers were extremely friendly and really cool including the guests that took down $650 on Pai gow and the two guys that won $911 on the wheel of fortune slots. I had a good time gamming here but really wish there was more eye candy. The servers are really old and scary looking. They all carry with them this face that says I used to do drugs but now I just smoke a lot. Generally, the more one drinks the better the women look. Well, not so much at the Stratosphere. The more I drank the more scared I became. By the end of week one I remained completely sober and documented all the exits in pen on the back of my hand. Get with the times! Have you seen the gaming floor at the Cosmo? Even the Golden Nugget has a really nice pool going on...

Here is another real kicker... When I received the email asking me to complete the survey and respond to my experience online. I was told to be specific so I thought I would do them a favor and take 30mins out of my day to review them. I was willing to type out this entire post later to find out I couldn't submit it to them b\/c they only accept 1024 characters in the survey. Really? A hotel that is obviously behind the times and becoming the next shit hole on the strip is going to not allow me to give them a thorough review? Tell ya what then. I'll post this all over the web and just submit to you the links of where you can find it.

I really mean that because I didn't. I didn't have high expectations either though because I read all these horrific reviews, but regardless of that, I had a fine time at the Stratosphere.

I did not have any problems with the Stratosphere. My room was immaculately clean, I had a relatively nice view and passes to the top of the Stratosphere. Don't expect the Bellagio or Cesar's Palace when you go though, it's a modest one bedroom, a bathroom normal hotel room. It's like the Marriott of Oakland, Santa Rosa, and Napa. Nothing big and all that fancy, but clean and livable.

I've stayed in The Hotel at the Mandalay Bay and can absolutely see why people could be mortified that such a room existed in Las Vegas, but it was more than a $100 difference in price per night.

My only complaint is it is all the way at the end of the strip. Any further and you'd be in downtown, but me being able-bodied bought a bus ticket and just took it up and down the strip. Not the greatest way to see a city, but not too bad either. Sure beats the Oakland\/SF busses.

One of the things I do like a lot because they are in the nar corner of the strip, it's an amazing view up on top of the Stratosphere. Nothing even comparable especially by Paris' cold metal chamber Eiffel Tower look-alike top. I did enjoy that a lot. The casino part of it also gives you great rewards for little play.

So drive here or buy a bus pass for the duration of your stay. It's not so bad. Take a taxi if you can't tell if that was your girlfriend you just kissed or the guy trying to hand you stripper passes.",2,2,1

From what I had heard from Yelp and from friends I was a little worried about a) the location away from everything b) the service and c) that it would be kind of crappy.  

I was pleasantly surprised by the experience.  We didn't have to wait long to check in, we got two doubles instead of the king we reserved (not a problem), the employees were helpful.  The room was standard hotel fare: simple and clean.  

Also, the actual casino was nice as well.  It wasn't as fancy as some of the other casinos but there was nothing to complain about.  Also, we enjoyed going to the top of the Stratosphere to ride.  Hooray!  We went before breakfast so we wouldn't feel sick.  We did the Big Shot and I felt better after the ride then when I took that shot of Patron later in the week.  

There was quiet a bit of walking.  We would walk to the monorail each day and buy all day passes.  I think this is a great deal if you get a good price on the room and don't mind a little walking.  We stayed at the Luxor later in the week and that was convenient because it was closer to the bigger casinos.",3,0,1

This hotel is a little older, and pretty ""ghetto"" in comparison to those actually on the strip (Caesar's Palace, Mirage, MGM Grand, etc.).  Nothing fancy, the decor is pretty standard, and the shopping floor consisted mostly of Las Vegas gift shops.  

The room was just a standard hotel room, with one small sink.  A big disappointment was the lack of a mini fridge.  We had to buy a Styrofoam cooler at a nearby 7-11 to keep our beverages cold.  But the beds were big and very comfy.

Most of our days were spent at the pool, which they actually have 2.  The one on the 8th floor is all ages, and the one on the 25th floor is over 21.  Both pools were very lackluster, with no vegetation, slides, diving boards, or anything.  We spent the first day at the 8th floor one...tried to bring in our own vodka beverages, only to be denied and had to chug them before entering.  This was the bigger of the two pools, with lots of lawn chairs for laying out.  

The adult pool allows outside beverages in, but is much smaller with significantly less chairs.  However, it was never crowded, so finding a spot was pretty easy.  The downside of this pool (for me) was the 'bathing suit top optional' situation.  It just seemed to be a magnet for creepy older guys, who would just sit there and stare at all the boobs (even though most of them were not stare-worthy).  The bartender at the poolside bar would make little daiquiris and margaritas to pass out several times throughout the day, which was very nice.  

The one advantage of staying in a comparatively ""ghetto"" hotel, was that the food options were pretty cheap.  We had breakfast at Lucky's Cafe every morning.  The service was great, and the food reasonably priced.  They had a $5.99 breakfast deal available 24-hours a day, and lunch special for $6.99 available 11am-6pm.  They also have a 50's style diner that we ate lunch at twice.  The diner also had a special for people staying at the hotel: $7.99 for a cheeseburger, fries, and drink.  

The casino floor was pretty standard, although I did have good luck with the blackjack tables there (with the help of my fellow gamblers and the dealers).  We didn't gamble too much there, but when we did I rarely saw a cocktail waitress.  

Overall, I felt we definitely got what we paid for.  If you're wanting to save some money on the hotel, and don't mind cabbing it to the strip (about a $10 ride) then this would be a good fit for you.  Next time, I'll probably shell out some more money to stay somewhere a bit nicer.",7,2,1

I like the indoor also because it's quieter and you can sit down and spend as much time as you want, no one will kick you out.

This review is only for the room.
I shouldv'e known what to expect for the lowest priced hotel on the strip.  But then again is it really on the strip?  I would call it 'the end'.

Pros:  It was cheaper than most.
It was clean.
If you are on a budget this will be the best deal for your dollars.

Cons:  It took forever to check in, and when I requested one bed, they apologized for not being able to accommodate and I had to settle with two beds.  WOW I reserved the room in advance and can't even get the bed I want?  Ok no problem.

The walls were paper thin, so I heard everyone in the hall coming and going and all of the conversations from the people in the next room. 

The shower curtain and rings were a dingy white.  I couldn't tell if it was just really old or if it was just really cheap stuff.  The napkin holder fixture attached to the bathroom counter was loose and looked like it was about to fall off.

The casino is not very ventilated, so the cigarette smoke was pretty dominating as I walk through to get to and from my room.

Would I stay here again?  YES.  
NO it is not preferred as compared to other luxury hotels on the strip.

TIPS:
- For a budget this is the best place to be!
- Priceline may get you a better hotel room for the price.
- If you are trying to get it on in your room, remember that EVERYONE around you can hear you.
- The surrounding area isn't so nice, so just be careful if you are exploring after dark.  Its okay to get lost on the strip, but getting lost in this neighborhood might make you wish you lost your money and dignity gambling.
- You might just want a car if you are staying here.  It will make it more convenient to get around.

So I plan to save up and get the most expensive room they have and would like to see how it turns out in my next stay.",1,0,0

It's a huge hotel,and we were kinda lost to which elevator to take. When we went to our room, we were amazed how big it was. We had a little living room and a wall separating our bedroom which was ok. I was satisfied with the view, but wish we had the view of the strip. There's many restaurants there and Fat Tuesdays! Oh, and a lot of stores to shop at. Since it's like 5-10 minutes away from the strip, I understand why there's a lot of things to do there.

When we arrived the bellman greeted us and directed us to check in. We waited maybe 5 minutes (this was at 4pm), the front desk agent was super professional and knowledgeable. We had a letter waiting at concierge and she was very friendly too. Total check in time was around 10 minutes and we were off to our room. My husband secretly booked us their newly remodeled ""spa king"" suite. So when we entered the room I nearly passed out because there was a HUGE tub in the bathroom!! Yay!!! On the 22nd floor you get an excellent view of the north part of the strip and from this particular suite we could watch people riding the ""sky jump"". The room was very clean, and the bed was comfortable. Room service is excellent here too! Yummy breakfast and friendly staff. 

The stratosphere tower is expensive if your not staying here and I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. However, we went to their Level 107 lounge and had the happy hour special. Buy 1 get 1 free martini's!!!! OMG these are good! And after awhile I forgot about the height and didn't mind the slight building movements I felt. So definitely go there if your staying here!

The pool isn't heated but there were a few brave souls in there anyway. And we needed a few minutes of respite so we hung out for 20 minutes or so in the spa. The staff are friendly and offered us towels. It was really nice to just relax from a busy day!

The casino isn't as busy as some of the other casino's so we were able to enjoy all of our favorite games easily. It's not smoky as some other yelpers metioned. Our blackjack dealers were awesome! And the drink girls came around often. Actually, they came around so often I was a little worried that security wouldn't let us on our flight home!!! 

The spa was good for our pedicures, not what I expected for a resort though. We got right in and the lady was really nice. Can't remember her name but she had really short blonde spiky hair. 

Our only issue was valentine's day as we had reserved a rental car from Budget to drive to our couples massage. The lady was rude and since I don't have excellent credit she denied us! We had to literally scramble to make other arrangements! They could have warned us upon reservation. But they are not part of stratosphere so it's not their fault!

The views from the top if the tower are breathtaking. I have always wanted to have dinner up there but haven't had the opportunity. Hopefully soon. 

The food situation kinda sucks. The buffet has been described as downright disgusting and often leaves its victims sick. I didn't experience any illness but it wasn't a very good meal. 

It's located at the strips farthest most point  in a pretty shady neighborhood but its a good jump-off location for downtown and the rest of The Strip. Cheap cab fares either direction. It's within walking distance of the Monorail(at the Saraha) and Dino's Lounge. Very awesome. 

I will stay again.

Just as Treasure Island branded themselves as ""ti,"" they should call themselves ""The Strat.",3,2,1

1) day 1, they did not have a room for us. I made the reservations back in April.  So we got a different room with the promise that the room I reserved would be ready in the morning.  IT WASN'T!  So we stayed in the other room the remainder of our stay. 
2)housekeeping is a joke. Day 2, a trash can , sheets, and towels were left on the floor next to the door...I was confused, so I found a housekeeper and asked why they just left it, she just looked at me like I was crazy.  I finally said ""do you want me to make the bed myself?""  Her reply was ""could you?""  Uh no, that's what I paid you for.  Of course, I didn't say that.  I just said ""if you don't mind, we'll leave it there for you."" 
3) first 2 nights, we literally sweated to death, it was 80 degrees in the room.  We finally called and they fixed it....but then we froze to death.  And couldn't get it turn off.  It was either feast or famine.  
4) customer service was the worst I've ever had.  Rude housekeeping, rude front desk, rude concierge. 
5) the day of my wedding...at 1:45 our room still hadn't been cleaned.  I had a lady coming to do my hair and makeup at 2:00, so my fiancÃ© went to very nicely ask when our room was going to be cleaned.  The lady very rudely told him she had no idea. 
6) still the day of my wedding...at 2:45 housekeeping shows up as I'm getting my hair done. Which was fine, we tried staying out of her way.  She spilled water all over the floor and did not clean it up.  I stepped out of the room, the housekeeper turned off all the lights WITH MY HAIR LADY STILL IN THERE, after turning out all the lights, she walked out and shut the door... WITH MY HAIR LADY STILL IN THERE,  so I was locked out of my room with my hair lady still inside!  Uh.....okay?!  So I had to knock on my own door to have my hair lady open it back up for me!
7) day 4....at noon, we decided we had had enough!  So I went to the front desk and said we were leaving a day early!  I demanded a refund for the last night and resort fees and the ridiculous charge we'd already paid on a refrigerator for 4 nights.  She knew I wasn't moving until I got a refund so she gave it to me.  
I will never stay there again, nor will I recommend it to anyone!
We would've left earlier but with the wedding and all,  we decided to try to stick it out.

The draw is the big old saucer sitting at the top. Yup!
I was here for the Stair Climb that takes place inside one of the struts and supports the American Lung Association.

I booked on line and it was extremely cheap and affordable. What was a bummer, was that the ""deal"" price that American Lung Assoc got, was more than the on line price. Boo.

I did not choose to upgrade my room to have a re-ferbed room and to have a view. There is a whole saucer up there to enjoy the view from, duh. And i was really only coming in to do the race and head back home. So i did not upgrade. My room was directly in front of the elevators. ugh. There was a limited power plugs, furnishings were dated, but i'm assuming once the full refurb gets done this will be updated.

We were in a handicapped accessible room, which is fine, but there was no place in the bathroom to put your stuff. Barely room to stick your tooth brush. And the towels were across the room. I pity the handicapped person attempting to dry off after their shower or bath.

Elevators were pretty speedy. Shops were ok. Restaurant on site had a great menu, we enjoyed some wonderful appetizers. 

I'm not a gambler, but the casino seemed small and meh. The smoke smell wasn't too terrible, but certainly noticeable since i was there to do a race for American Lung Association.

First and foremost, the employees are really fantastic. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I also did the SkyJump which was awesome, although a little pricey -- $120 since I wanted the GoPro camera strapped to my wrist for my jump.

I have to say my biggest disappointment was the room itself. While it was a decent size, and the bathroom was too, it really lacked basic amenities. There was no refrigerator and no robes. No minibar for snacks. Probably the most spartan room I've seen in a while. My biggest complaint, which I didn't address since I was there only one night, was the bathroom ceiling. The paint in the tub area was peeling, and there was visible mold. There's no way that could be missed if management inspected the room. Also, the fixtures in the bathroom were old and the toilet didn't flush correctly.

The rooms are very adequate. Everything works fine. However there are no flat screens not when I was there. This place is on the strip but away from the action.

It definitely gets marked down for being so far away from the main stuff on the strip, it's about a 1.5 mile walk to get down to the other hotels and attractions on the strip... the walk is through a bit of a scary area so girls definitely don't want to walk alone (I'd suggest at least a group of 3 if you're going to make the trek).

Booked Stratosphere through hotel tonight app. If you haven't heard of Hotel Tonight it's a great app. Basically every day at 12:00pm they list hotels in a variety of cities at a huge discounted rate. Make sure to check every 30 minutes because prices can go down and they add new hotels during the night. 

Ended up getting Stratosphere for only $26.00 a night, which is a steal. 

The hotel room itself was pretty clean. We got upgraded to the newly renovated area for no extra charge. Beds were comfortable and bathroom was pretty typical. Since we were on the 7th floor we didnt' have a view of anything except for a parking structure. 

Service: It wasn't the hotel's fault that when we checked in they couldn't give us keys. Hence that whole night if you wanted to leave the room and come back you had to wait for security to open the door, which we waited about 15 minutes for each time. 

The nice thing about staying at the hotel is that you can go up to the top of the stratosphere for free. This is an $18.00 value per person. It's pretty romantic at the night and they have lots of couches and seats to sit on. There's even a bar on the top.

They are sneaky and have two sheets sandwiched around the comforter, but when you pull the top sheet down, I saw STAINS on it.  It looked like chocolate (or at least I was hoping it was just chocolate) on the comforter, which they clearly had not washed recently.  The shower curtain looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months and I didn't even want to look too closely at anything else.  

We were on the 7th floor and could hear people coming in and out from our room, and for some reason they have the cleaning crew vacuum outside at 9am. I guess they really want you to check out on time. The staff was nice enough at check in (despite the line) and check out went smoothly. 

We had to pay the ""resort"" fee, so we made use of it and went to the top of the stratosphere twice - once during the day and once at night.  It's a bunch of high school kids who work there and are completely lax.  They let their friends jump the line and talk with them in the elevator.

Part I
While the Stratosphere is just a 3 star hotel, it comes at 2 star prices, so that earns it a bonus star for us budget minded visitors.

Part II
The Stratosphere is not really ""on the Strip"".  Friends that we stayed with were able to walk down to the strip, but that kind of exercise isn't for me.  I would rather spend my day doing things like gambling, eating, and drinking.  All that walking would cut into my gambling losses, burn those buffet calories, and sober me up.  :P

We always rent a car in Vegas anyway, so the extra distance isn't really an issue for me.

Part III
Hooray for Adult only pools!  It's not that I hate kids, but as a D.I.N.K. (dual income no kids) I don't want to spend my vacation around the noisy little egocentric monsters.  

The topless pool at the Stratosphere is as basic as it gets.  A limited shaded area, bar service that does not come to you (you gotta go to it), and a volley ball net across the pool.

I'm actually very surprised at how professional the staff was for the price of this hotel. The only down side to this hotel is the location. This hotel is northbound which is far from most of the nightlife and entertainment on the strip. I suggest getting a bus pass because of the far location of the hotel and the bus is pretty much the cheapest form of transportation.,1,0,0

They would not cancel our current t reservation with a fee so we just kept our current room.  

When we got to our room we were very disappointed. The room was very dirty!  The bathroom looked like it was not cleaned well.  There was dirt on the floor and in the tub. The room was very plain and did not look like it was recently remodeled.  For what we paid we expected more.  

When we checked in we had to pay $20 extra for WiFi, gym, and a few other things even though we did not use them and no one ever even told us how to use it or where they were.

The casino is somewhat cheesy and smaller than those mega resorts like the MGM Grand or the Venetian, which I liked because I didn't had to walk forever to our hotel room.

We came here for a bachelorette party very early in the morning and our rooms weren't ready. We asked for 2 adjoining rooms, which is why it may of taken so long. Didn't get our rooms until 3pm. So we just went to the buffet and lounged by the pool. My friend said that their pool is very salty. She found out when this kid kept splashing water onto her. We managed to score some shade and the sun was very intense that day. I had to go back and forth between the shade and sun. The rooms were clean and enough space for everyone. Although our view sucked - parking garage and pipes. I didn't really care though.

This place isn't packed with young people, so we definitely turned heads in our sexy dresses on our way out for a night of partying. The only downside to this place is that its location. You definitely need a cab if you want to the Venetian or Mirage.",4,2,1

Anytime we'd come back we'd find that the room was cleaned in a half-ass attempt but since we're mostly out and came only to sleep we didn't mind too much. The hotel is at the end of strip but is fairly reachable by both walk and cab from the main part of the strip. Check in and out was hassle free.

The hotel rooms are clean and recently updated.  Prices are slightly cheaper than most places on the Strip since this isn't exactly on the Strip and it's at the beginning of the slightly seedy area of Vegas. Around $100\/night is typical.

I enjoy gambling here because you can find plenty of table games where it's $5-$10 minimum during the weekend, unlike most of the Strip casinos where $15 if you are lucky is the minimum.

I'm conflicted about this place.  On the one hand, it was really, really cheap to stay here for a week, on the Strip, in Vegas, in a room with two queen beds.  Check in and check out were painless.  They upgraded me from a 6th floor to a 23rd floor room on Sunday.

However, if you go to other hotels on the strip you're going to get major location, fanciness, and smell envy.  Yes, smell envy.  Let me start there.

The casino in the Strat smells like disgusting stale smoke.  While there are signs when you get off the elevator saying ""Non smoking floor.""  Why they bother to say that when they clearly don't enforce it is a source of consternation for me.  There were even cigarette marks on the toilet seat in my room on the 23rd floor.  When patrons come up the elevators to your floor, they also bring an elevator full of gross smoke smell.  There are also ashtrays at the entrance to the elevators.  ON A NON SMOKING FLOOR.  HELLO.

The room itself also had terrible air quality.  I could smell smoke strongly in the first room I had, not so much in the second.  But the second's air conditioner had some sort of janky filter rigged to the AC which was full of dust.  Our noses were running the entire time.

Also, there seemed to be construction going on above our room.  At 7 in the morning.  On a Sunday.  It sounded like people banging on wood and dropping things.

The only caution I can give is the Chilean sea bass which is priced at $49. Unfortunately I ordered it with a co-diner  and it was obvious it was not Chilean sea bass and in fact it was nowhere near what one would expect to be Chilean Seabass. We did let our waiter no and he brought over the manager of the restaurant who let us know the Chilean Seabass is an endangered species.

I wanted a non smoking room (which I paid for before I got there) and I received a smoking room because the others were taken.  Yuck.  The room indeed smelled like smoke and it was gross.

Trust me on this.....there is a IHOP within a block of this place and I spent LESS there and had a better breakfast.

Area\/Location: The Stratosphere doesn't feel as if it's even on the strip. One night when I was coming back from a El Nopal, people that were homeless and what seemed to be were drugs, approached me in a hostile manner. This occurred not once, but twice. Once going to El Nopal, and the second coming back. When heading to the restaurant, the first person got so close to me with alcohol on his breath and seemed began to yell at me to ""Want me to tap that a** girl?"". The second time coming back, another person came at me and grabbed my arm and asked me to, ""Help me him out?"". This is unacceptable, due to it being less than half a block away from the hotel. Added security should be a main concern to let guests feel as if they are safe.

Front Desk Personnel - I did NOT feel welcome AT ALL when I checked in. The attendant did not ask how I was doing\/how my day was. The vibe to begin with did not start my trip well. When I ended up leaving two days earlier, the attendant didn't even ask me how my stay was or care to even ask as to why I was checking out early. 

Room - Did not provide a Vegas atmosphere. Everything seemed bland and basic. The bathtubs in the bathrooms are so high, that the two times that I had to take a shower I almost tripped and fell onto the floor.

Shops - Were empty, no one seemed to be actually doing their jobs, people in middle booths were texting and playing video games. There was a male at the henna tattoo booth who tried being flirtatious with me when I had not even acknowledged him. Other people actually doing their jobs in the shops had a depressed demeanor.",0,2,0

1. It's at the end of the strip. If you plan on going clubbing (besides the cool club at the top of the Tower) or sightseeing at the other hotels, don't expect that they're in super close walking distance. It's not a horrible distance, my friends and I walked pretty much the whole strip one night as long as you're not on a tight schedule and want to see everything, but the transit (which I have yet to have a negative experience with in my 7+ times using it) is super cheap and convenient. Plus, there's a stop right outside the hotel. $20 for a three day unlimited use pass!

2. If you're going to get in significantly later than check-in time, you need to call to let them know. My boyfriend and I didn't get there until 4am after a super long road trip, but we called them at midnight and they were still super accomodating. Not to mention there wasn't a check-in line that early in the morning!

3. The Stratosphere was one of the first places on the Strip. It's older, it's been remodeled, and it's not as ritzy glitzy as other Las Vegas hotels may be. My first time staying there, I called and made a reservation and got a free upgrade to a higher floor and a tower view!

Ever since I signed up for my AcePlay card, I constantly receive deals and offers for rooms there. I went last month and paid under $50 (including the resort fees) for two nights! Plus, if you lose or forget to take your card out of the slot machines (whoops), they'll give you a couple extra for free.

The first time we went we stayed in the Oasis Suite, and it was phenomenal. The jacuzzi tub was clean (and there's a bath and body store with bath bombs and soaps on the little mall thing inside the casino) and the bathroom was huge, plus the bed was comfy! 

And don't even get me started on the Tower itself... the staff there was so nice! My boyfriend is terrified of heights and I dragged him on the rides that hang off the sides. We were the only ones in line for the ride but the staff said they would wait for more people to get on if it made him feel more comfortable. On our second stay we checked out and forgot to go up to the tower, but the woman controlling the line said we could just show our receipt and say that we just checked out and they'd let us up there... and they did! 

Overall: great atmosphere, great staff, and a very comfortable stay. As long as you keep those three things in mind when you book a room here, you should be happy!",7,4,4

A month before turning 21 I obsessively looked up hotel websites and I knew it was the one as soon as I saw thrill rides! I honestly didn't know what to really expect, I live in Alaska and my only real basis was from watching Vegas Vacation way too many times, I really expected to win multiple cars at the slot machines just like Nick Papageorgio. 

No, its not smack dab in the middle of the strip but its so fun and laid back that I didn't care if I had to walk a little once I decided to actually leave the hotel (although you don't really need to). Rides, casino, shopping, 5 star dining, fast food, and actually very fast free drink service. 

You can eat up in the sky or grab some McDonalds for a late night snack or go to the casino in PJ's when it's 4 am and you cant sleep. I remember the first time I was there at the Blackjack table and every time you got a ""21"" they would give you a voucher for a free taco at their Mexican restaurant, so after winning money and numerous free drinks we ended up with 7 free shrimp tacos! It may not be the Wynn but it was a nice and fun added bonus. 

Also, you can tell that the demographic didn't take themselves too seriously, at the time I had never played Blackjack and had no idea what was going on but other players at the table were not only patient and friendly but they helped me and one lady even gave me her vouchers for ""free match play"" and handed me one of her chips before she left. 

So I may be a seasoned Vegas Vacationer now and have since stayed at more than 7 different strip hotels that have a higher star rating, but The Stratosphere  was my first and it obviously made a good impression because I  keep going back.",1,0,0

Bought a room for 45 bucks a night off Priceline They charge you $20 resort fee a night.  That is stupid since it isn't a resort.  Other Hotels on the strip don't charge resort fees.  Their resort fee is why they have cheap room prices.  Free Parking.  When I first walked into the casino is was what I expected from the end of the strip.  I see face tattoos and junkies.  The smoke build up is bad but that is to be expected from the old casino.  It was like walking through the Four Queens.  I didn't do anything at the hotel, I just went to the rest of the strip to the other casinos.  
  I get there and they gave me a smoking room, I said hell no, and the room is of course on the 14th floor and the room looked old and nasty.  I went to the desk and they told me I can have a newly renovated room for $20 more a night.  I thought they should have done it for free but I ended up paying.  The renovated room was much better and did not smell like smoke.  So the Hotel was fine and I have no problems at all with the stay.  Next time I am in Vegas I will be staying at a nicer Hotel though on the strip.  It's not worth walking through the Ghetto and the tweakers to get to the SLS to ride the Monorail.",0,0,0

I would consider this a budget hotel. So 3 stars for being them, but would probably be a 2 star comparatively to other places on the strip. I chose to stay here to be closer to Rock in Rio, otherwise I wouldn't have considered it. I really wish I found a better deal for SLS though. I think that would have been a better option for Rock in Rio.

Aside from our fancy view of the parking lot\/ac generator, the room itself was a little cramped. We were able to stay in one of the select ""remodeled"" rooms. It didn't wow me, so I'd be a little worried if I just got a normal room. I think putting 4 people in there is pushing it a little bit. Oh, and another thing I couldn't stand was the water pressure... UGH!!!

Room service was decent... since it was my first time staying on this end of the strip, I wasn't familiar with the surrounding food places.. plus everything seemed so far.. so room service came in handy, until I found the food court on level R w\/ Mickey D's that is. Yay! I think it's open 24 hours too so that's a score. Also, if you're trying to get a fat tuesday it's there too!

Overall, I don't know if I would stay here again unless it's in proximity of desired destination.",2,0,1

after i was done with my wind therapy, i walked around and ran into a couple of the sales guys i work with.  i was like, ""oh my god!  this is amazing!  the view is incredible!  how are you guys doing?  having fun?  it's so windy up here!  i'm sorry about my windblown hair!""

I had a night alone in LV, and my friend told me I had to check out the Stratosphere. It's on the Boulevard but away from the Strip, so you're unlikely just to find yourself there. I appreciated seeing another part of LV, though, that wasn't just the Strip. The area is a little less plastic, maybe a little rough around the edges.

There was about a 15 minute wait on a Sunday night to get to the top of the Tower. There are great views of LV unlike what you'd see elsewhere. There are places to sit so you can admire the view for a while.

Of course, there are also the rides at the top of the Tower, which can hang people off the side of the Tower. If you like that kind of thing, the views and exhilaration must be top notch.

At the top, you'll also find a store and a bar.

The Good - One of the best views of Las Vegas hands down. If you are staying in the hotel, entrance to the observation deck is free. If not I think its $20. The hotel rooms are newly remodeled and are just your basic hotel rooms anywhere. My friends only complaint was the smell of pot being smoked like it was a ""HempFest"" (They dont smoke, I do and while I did smell it, it didnt bother me) and the room keys not working and having to call Security to let them in each time they left. 
The Bad - The Stratosphere is located in what I say ""Where the Good Crap meets The Bad Crap"". The neighborhood surrounding the area is full of drug dealers and all sorts of undesirable elements and they will be making themselves known to you in the Casino coming up to you asking for money, cigarettes and offering drugs and sex (nasty)
The Ugly - While we were in the Casino playing slots we were all approached numerous times by these panhandlers who asked us for money and cigarettes. Security walks around and seem to ignore them. My friend had to get the Security to get this really aggressive old drunk hobo guy away from us and then a couple hours later we were approached by the same guy again. They are all over this place to the point that while eating at the Steakhouse there, we made the big mistake of taking a table in an area still in the casino, but outside the Steakhouse and while we were eating we were solicited by 2 panhandlers and one even took a handful of french fries off one of our plates. We told the waiter who only said ""Yeah, it happens all the time"". As you can imagine, my friends said they wont be staying there on their return to Vegas AND I certainly have no reason to go back unless I have out of town guest who want to go to the Observation deck.

Rooms are descent, but I'm fed up with the dealers who play blackjack and the slots. There is no character or even false friendship when it comes to the stratusphere hotel and casino. I've been here for 4 days and I can not count how many times I was dealt a split hand and could not hit on a card more than once or double down on a split of 10 or 11, with no ace dealt to me, once split. They offered me one card like a double down and not a split. It's my understanding that if you match the bet on a double down you receive 1 card, but if you split you can hit that card as much as you'd like until you stand or bust. As long as your original cards were not ACES! Finally last night I won on a slot machine with max bet of $1.25 (5 max bet) on a spin wheel much like wheel of fortune. I pressed the spin button and as it spun it came to rest on 200 credits, but then froze the machine. The wheel didn't continue to spin but the ball did, with 200 lit up. I called for service and they stated that this is what happens when the machine is tilted. They restarted it and it came to 200 once again, then again they restarted it and it came upon 50. Once again same scenario 50 , and once again , but then it landed on 20. They said the machine needs to reset to give you you're accurate payout, which was 20.....Really how did you get from 200 to 20 with 4 restarts of a machine....? They argued with me so I stated I'm cashing out and I'd never come back. I hit the payout and it only paid me for my credits that I deposited. Long story short. I wouldn't stay at this place. Customer service is terrible on the floor of the casino. They're cheats and all they care about is there $, which I understand but C'mon this was a couple hundred dollars and not thousands.

Guaranteed view, right. The select rooms are all updated\/new. The room itself was very clean, the mattress was awesome. I don't normally sleep well in hotels, but I slept very well here. The walls are paper thin and you can pretty much here every word and cough of your neighbor, but luckily we had pretty quiet neighbors. 

So we checked in at night, and I had been guaranteed a view of the Vegas strip. When I looked out the window, I was totally disappointed. No strip. Because of the way the Stratosphere is situated in relation to the strip, there would be very few rooms that actually have a view of the strip. Most of them are more like partial view because the strip curves around, and the buildings in front of the Stratosphere block the view of the rest of the strip. So I was like...really?? That's it? HOWEVER, when we woke up in the morning, and opened the curtains, we were very pleased with the view because you could see the mountains, and it was quite lovely. Just not a spectacular lit-up night view, but mountain view--nice!

We ate at the buffet while we were there. It was just okay. Not spectacular. They do have a carving station that offers prime rib, and that was good. Also had some nice salmon and sushi. But they stopped serving the sushi well before closing, so we only got a few pieces, and it was just okay sushi anyway. 

We had breakfast at Roxy's, and it was nice good diner style food. Plenty of it! We rolled out of there stuffed and satisfied. The server was super nice. 

The best points of the Stratosphere:
1. If you are a guest at the hotel, you get free access to the top of the Stratosphere for the spectacular 360 view of Las Vegas. So fab!

Oh. I guess I didn't have to number that list. Because that's basically it.

The worst and the reason I'm only giving it three stars:
1. No coffee maker in the room. ARE THEY KIDDING? I am guessing it's because there is a Starbuck's on the casino level and they are steering people there. That Starbuck's SUCKS by the way. LONG line all the time. I just wanted a cup filled with hot water and they charged me 75 cents. I took the cup back the next morning for a refill of hot water and they claimed they couldn't do it because of ""health regulations."" Really? Putting hot water in a cup is a health hazard??? Charged me another 75 cents. And I had to throw out a perfectly good cup from the previous day. Waste makes me sick. 

2. The pool and hot tub (outdoor and not fancy or impressive at all) closes at FIVE. Because it ""gets cold out there when the sun goes down."" NO KIDDING. That's why I want to sit in the hot tub! Der

3. No mini fridge in the room.

4. No free wifi. Seriously? Even Motel 6 gives you free wifi! You can have highspeed internet while there FOR A PRICE. 

This hotel is at the far north of the strip, which is fine if you aren't into being at the center of action. But you will either have to walk a lot (which is probably a good idea because you are in Vegas and most likely pigging out and eating way too much), or drive. Driving down the strip is so nuts.

I booked through HotelClub for a really cheap price, which didn't go through at first which got me stressed out, but then that situation resolved. The hotel itself was pretty massive and had tons of games and restaurants. I was happy they had a Fat Tuesday there! It was really nice that our package included free admission to the top of the tower! The view was beautiful especially at night. Unfortunately I didn't get to go to the bars or restaurant up there to really experience the hotel. I did get to see someone free fall from the 108th floor though, crazy!

We got the most standard room, which wasn't too bad. The ventilation wasn't the best though, it kinda made our room smell bad. It was nice having the sink separate from the bathroom, but that made the bathroom itself a bit too small. The bathtub was pretty high for some reason so I had to watch out every time I got in and out of it. Beds were comfy for the most part. The walls and doors seem pretty thin though because you can pretty much hear what's going on outside of your room. I wish our room had a fridge though.

The hotel is still located in the strip but at the very far end of it so we still had to take the freeway to go where we wanted to go. We only wanted to stay here because it was cheap and only needed a place to sleep and get ready so not too much to complain about. The tower access was definitely a bonus!

If you've been browsing hotels, you've seen they average $150 - $300 a night on weekends.  The Stratosphere is usually much cheaper than this, and there's a reason.  This is not 5 star, the furniture is not made of mahogany, and there won't be a butler to powder your bunghole.

However, for the cheap price, this is a great place to stay if you're on a budget.  The remodeled select rooms are a MUST!!  The cheaper deluxe rooms are outdated and quite ugly, but the select rooms are very, very nice in comparison.  Pay the extra few dollars a night and stay in the select room, you won't regret it.

Be aware that this hotel is at the end of the strip, away from all the action.  A cab ride is necessary, unless you're up for a bit of a hike (roughly 1.5 miles to where the action begins).  I prefer this location.  Vegas is VERY crowded on the center of the strip, and I hate trying to navigate through crowds all day and night.  The Stratosphere is much more mellow, with quick bar\/restaurant service as a result.  If you WANT to be immersed in the chaos non-stop, don't stay at the Strat.  If you want to return to your hotel and have it be less chaotic, consider the Strat.

If on a budget, the casino is perfect.  $5 minimums on table games and endless slots.  Keep in mind that while places like The Bellagio and Aria are much nicer, you will be forced to place much higher bets ($25 minimums on many tables).

All in all, I hope this all paints an accurate picture of what you should expect.  I recommend this hotel.",6,2,2

They were giggling, talking and being very unprofessional. The hotel room is very basic, be mindful that it doesn't include any coffee makers or fridge. So be prepared. And lastly the view is terrible and it is far from the strip. Long story short, if you are just looking for a cheap place to sleep in with poor customer service then this is the hotel for you.

The first room we booked was awful, and looked like it hadn't been remodeled since the hotel opened.  Thus, we ended up having to pay an upgrade, which was better but still not great.  While we paid a reasonable amount, we still paid too much (almost $100\/night) for what we got.  Also, the Stratosphere is so far north on the strip, so you pay more with uber and cabs anyway.  Definitely a learning for this time around, and will look to book other options more centralized on the strip next time.

THE HOTEL
As a guest in the hotel its a good bet if your super value conscious. Hotel rooms are a steal especially if your willing to stay in the oldest little tower. I much prefer the small price upgrade to the newer tower. Ceilings appear taller and they seem bigger overall. There is a rooftop pool that is small but somehow pleasant. I like how you can look out since your at an elevation. There is some wind - which you don't get on a courtyard type pool and you get to look at the Stratospehere Tower up above. Its a fun place to be.

THE CASINO
Strato has been known to have single zero roulette. Those are some better odds and it becomes more crucial if you plan to sit at the table for any length of time. Blackjack has lower table limits than center Strip. Machines are hit and miss.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Well, you've got the old Saharah across the street, (I can never remember the new name of that place) Circus Circus next door and the unfinished Hilton Time shares nearby too. The foundation of the unfinished FountainBeu across the ways too. If you've got kids who like the midway this is an outstanding location. If you like Downtown it also has a small advantage.... nowadays it takes 30 minutes to drive down the strip with nonstop traffic and gridlock around the clock. Was I the only guy who enjoyed Vegas during the recession when it was less hyped up?

THE TOWER
Have to mention this - I try to force myself up the tower at least once every few visits to Vegas. It never get old the breathtaking view. I love the speeeeedy elevator up. Its incredibly fast and there is an elevator person there who has a cool elevator speech of fun facts. Dinner at Top of the World is expensive but lunch is a steal. Observation deck is a must. With the altitude the weather feels different way up there. Its a 110 or 100 stories up - something like that... the next closest thing is the kidney bean new Rio tower but that is only a small fraction. Paris is about the same but it is directly across from Bellagio Fountains which adds a certain something.

CONCLUSION
I like to spend 2 days center strip and 2 days downtown on my visits to Vegas. Kinda crazy checking in and checking out for a short 4 day visit but that is my preference. Keep things fresh. If you want to get the best of both worlds and are very price conscious just stay here for the duration of your stay.",3,1,2

I wasn't aware it was closer to the Fremont Experience than it is the Strip which, we learned further into the trip, wasn't ideal because the Uber service didn't work so we were forced to take the $25 cab rides everywhere we went, every time we went somewhere, which was multiple times a day. First Impressions were not welcoming or comfortable, the surrounding neighborhood the hotel is in looks very unsafe. The people walking around looked like drug dealers or drug addicts, the houses, the blocks, etc. all looked like ran down. I felt very unsafe driving nearby the hotel leaving or returning. It also seem as though these people in the neighborhood were able to just walk into the casinos & the hotel lobbies, made me very uneasy.

Besides the appearance, Check In took longer than desired. Being that it was Saturday Evening, there should've been more receptionists to check in guests quickly and efficiently but that wasn't the case. After checking in, we walked our way to our designated room which was revealed to be a totally different room from the photo'd one through Orbitz. The room looked like belong to a motel instead of the Stratosphere. I was outraged with a Dinner Reservation in 2 hours. My Wife tried to fix the situation going downstairs to stand on that long ""Check-In"" again to get a ridiculous quote to change rooms & how we'd be better off staying overnight & changing rooms the next day. Well, the night we checked in was the night that mattered the most (My Birthday) so we decided to stay as we wouldn't be staying in there most of the trip anyway. Everything about the room was outdated and I couldn't stand it. The hotel's amenities were great, the restaurants and late check-out fees were reasonable. The best parts of our hotel stay was the Hotel Rooftop Pool, the WiFi, the convenient Text Messaging directly to Guest Services & the many Food Options. Unfortunately, I probably wouldn't stay here again.",3,0,0

Hotel is on the seedy side of the strip and the neighborhood that surrounds the hotel on adjacent side of the strip emphasizes the word HOOD as we could see police activity pretty much any time of the day or night from our room window. 

Rooms were just ok, and walls are super super thin. My buddy and I went back to the room to take a nap because we were super drunk and then we started to hear the couple next door going at it, headboard banging against our wall and lots of moaning and yelling from the female involved. Well at least she was enjoying herself, for how long? not sure as my friend and I started to bang on the wall yelling stuff like ride her like sea biscuit, hey cmon it's vegas. 

Now for the night club Polyesthers, the plus side to it was we had bottle service and VIP section due to our hook up and the club itself is pretty cool in the sense of the whole retro flashback thing with different rooms like for music of today, 70's and eighties. The downside to this club was that we were there in July and that weekend we were there the air conditioning in that club was literally broken and was a sweat box. I mean they brought in big fans but all did it was blow hot air with all the body heat in the room. To me I just think you should be on top of you A\/C in Vegas and if it breaks you better have someone on call 24-7, just my opinion people.

This has always been an out of the way hike from the main strip, but it used to be a cheap and fun place to stay.  Sadly I've seen a steady decline at this place.  The closing of the Sahara down the street seems to have hit this place hard.  Five years ago this was a cheap place to stay with a lot of entertainment right in the building.  Now it's only good for a cheap place to stay if you plan to spend your days elsewhere, especially if you have already seen the view from the tower.  The current owners bought this place about five years ago at the height of the real estate bubble.  Since that time they've lost money almost every month and have engaged in some serious cost cutting to try and ride out the recession.  In the last five years they've closed Polyester's nightclub, Lucky's Diner, the celebrity impersonator show, the topless pool on the roof, their steakhouse restaurant and bar,  and most of the live bands that play in the casino.  The impersonator show used to be fun for kids and adults alike.  Now they've got very little in the way of entertainment or dining going on.  

The slot machines used to be among the loosest in Vegas, on my most recent visit I noticed the average payout for a bonus round was about $20.  Yawn.  OK, this is the same story at most of the casinos since the recession hit, but they used to have decent rules blackjack tables with $5 minimums.  On my most recent visit last weekend I was appalled to learn that they now pay 6:5 blackjack on most of their  tables.  They still have a few 3:2 tables, but they have $10 minimums, so of course all the clueless morons flock to the $5 minimum tables with the 6:5 payout.  If you want the 3:2 payout, you'll probably be sitting alone at a table, which I don't like.

Brand new rooms for less that the Stratosphere, the Freemont Street experience and all the entertainment there nightly right outside the front door, and the Golden Nugget right down the street with some of the best blackjack rules in Vegas.

I probably should have done a little more research before booking; the Stratosphere is at the far end of the strip, so girls if you plan on walking to the Vegas club scene, either plan on wearing a pair of flats for the trek or putting some mileage on those high heels.

The pool closes at 7 pm, and the adults-only pool on the 25th floor is closed even though the website and front desk told me in February it would be open in march. The Stratosphere is at the very very end of the strip in a terrible neighborhood so it takes an hour just to get to the middle of the strip. Then there is that pesky 8 dollar resort fee that you must pay for, what's that 8 dollars for the pool closes at 7, there is no continental breakfast, no coin laundry, no comps and only like 4 English speaking non-hotel channels not to mention that you don't even get a damn coffee pot. i hate this place and i'm stuck here until Tuesday.

I paid $29 bucks for a room there, know that I would get the standard room, which cant get any better for a good hotel in Vegas. When I got there, the front desk guy upgraded me to a tower room, which was two upgrades, which was awesome. The 2nd and 3rd time I booked there the same guy upgraded me to a suite. The suite was big, had a living room, dining room, king size bed, walk in closet and a great big bathroom, it had a shower and a jet tub. So after staying there for a few time and only paying $29 for each night, Im totally booking there again.

The hotel has 2 shows, which was great to see, One was Bite(vamps) and the other one was superstar(singing).

2 pool area, level 8 was for anyone that is 21 under\/over and level 25 is an adult pool which clothing was optional and you must be 21 & up.

The tower was amazing, you can see the whole strip at night which was beautiful. There are a couple of rides up there, but they are very scary. You must make reservation to go to the tower restaurant and must try out the stratosphere desert, which was to die for.

1 starbucks, and the lines are crazy long in the mornings.

Valet is free, super awesome

They have a buffet where you pay $25 for all day dining and $19.99 for drinks all day.

Atmosphere was great, everyone is very nice and welcoming.

I don't remember how much the rooms were, but it was cheap so I wasn't expecting anything from The Palazzo or anything. But dang this place irritated me. My cousin checked into our room and we're fine with it until we realized how small the counter space was (two girls with that small of a counter just doesn't work). It took about 45 minutes for us to get extra blankets and because we had awful neighbors ( one who almost walked into our room because he was so messed up) we complained and they sent security, but all they did was tell them to keep it down. They were so awful that the hallway reeked of weed the entire time. 

We got ""an upgrade"" the next day. It was the exact same room with the exact same counter space. We almost fell out of the bath because it was so tall, the vent in there was hanging off, and the room just wouldn't cool down.

A computer monitor was forgotten on the room (we had a whole system with multiple monitors and computers), we called about 4:30 and they told us our room wasn't clean and to call in an hour. Iker called before the hour and that office was already closed (close at 5) they told us to call in an hour knowing they would be close. We left a message and receive a call 2 days later (I guess that departments isn't open during the weekend).

After staying there for six days I can say that it was a lovely experience. We stayed in a Grand Luxory Suite so maybe that had something to do with it but I saw the regular rooms and they were quite spacious and accomidating as well. 

The view is amazing... especially from the tower. You get free enterance when you're a guest at the hotel. 

The staff was efficient and diligent, we ordered room service a couple of times and they came right up. Vallet never had .us waiting (even on the weekend) for more then 6 or 7 minutes. Truly outstanding service on their end. 

The casino is cool... I'm not too much of a gambler but I played the slots a little (how can you come to Vegas and not gamble??) and won a little bit of money, so that was a plus. I didnt eat at the 'Top of the World' restaurant so I cant say how the food\/pricing is but it looked beautiful and the view must be breathtaking at night. 

There is a Fat Tuesdays in the hotel so there are always people walking around with those huge purple tube cups.. its pretty funny. 

All in all I had a great stay here at the Stratosphere. I'd reccomend it to anyone because not only is it a great time but its right between downtown Vegas and the strip. Everything we wanted was a mere 5 minutes away. 

The pool was relaxing and they had a cool D.J. playing party music. I really wanted to go to the topless pool on the 24th floor but with all the sightseeing I never got back in time to go (It closes at 6:00)

Up on the stratosphere top there are rides and these rides are pretty scary and crazy. there is the bungie jump one as well as the elevator ones and one that goes back and forth as if you are going straight down the stratosphere. Very scary.

They also sells food and drinks up on the stratosphere. Its a pretty good atmosphere to eat up there.

I can't complain. The rooms are at reasonable rates. If you want a better view, you just have to plan on paying more. The location is great, being right in the middle of everything you can visit the other hotels on the Strip, head out west to the Red Rocks Canyon area for hiking, or southeast to Boulder City. It is also easy to access from the I15 yet far enough north that the traffic that plagues the Strip at all hours usually isn't an issue. 

Given the location, one has to remember that the free stuff (like WiFi) that may go with a Motel 6 elsewhere isn't going to be included. I use my cell phone to tether my iPad. That has always worked well. 

Another thing that I like is the casino level bar will comp drinks with a very low buy in. They are also pretty generous with the comps. Other casinos along the Strip will require a higher buy in, and the drinks are slow in coming.",1,0,0

SELF-PARKING is BEST; drive ur car to hotel side (turn 1st LEFT after passing  IHOP), park on 3rd floor where access to the casino is thru a bridge walkway. Once downstairs inside the casino the check-in is located not 4mins from the entrance to the casino. Very stuck-up clerk informed us hotel room rates fluctuate daily (each day) and that the cost for the room I was getting during MY three day stay was over $100. Don't see why as room was NOT very luxurious! After reading a few of the reviews here, expected the worst....  but unfortunately not all was lost. Room was very spacious w\/view fm tower fifth floor of parking garage & roof a\/c units. Particular rooms with a ""better view"" are offered for extra fee, but spoke to one guest in elevator, and though he paid extra for the view, stated he sees the garage also. Very good water pressure BUT tub wall are very high, and one can slip\/fall getting into the tub\/shower. Thick plastic shower curtain is type seen in hotels decades previous. Be careful! The queen-size beds were very comfortable BUT smoke - even in non-smoking rooms as I had reserved - is still slightly apparent due to the casino below and hotel\/casino guests still smoking though there are areas where smoking is not allowed. Confusing hotel layout puts elevators far from the parking garage entry, but doable though NOT not one luggage cart for hotel guests was seen, nor did I see any hotel employee helping w\/suitcases inside. Also didn't see one room cleaning maid during my 3-day stay, but of course I was gone from dawn to dusk sight-seeing (staying at number of hotels around the world and throughout USA, I have *always* seen cleaners) but not here!! In every hotel I have stayed in, many ""luxury"" hotels the beds will be turned down at night, and at the very least, the toilet paper in the bathroom will be a fresh room, with a cute fold starting the roll ~ not here! Nice flat-panel tele e BUT ONLY limited channels included 3 hotel channels! Dresser served its purpose better as a support for the television than for clothing: drilled holes on dresser top in my room, plus several of the drawers had loose knobs and dirt inside; looked to be of very thin construction and very old & ill-maintained. Though hair dryer was available in bathroom, several shampoos and soap in the bathroom + iron\/ironing board in ""closet"" area, there was no security safe nor coffee maker or teas\/coffee available. There was nothing I have had previously in hotels\/motels of less or similar ""luxury"" status - I've had better service\/room quality in European hostels!! One note of interest is that ALL calls (even local calls) are charged access use ""fee"", even using a calling card to call home will incur charges! Could easily hear guests next door opening\/closing doors & talking in the hall, but did not hear anything from any rooms at all. Bicycle security guards patrol the various floors of the parking garage, but security for rooms itself seem to be non-existent; nobody checks to ensure ONLY registered guests enter the elevators as on the last two days of my stay, there were external Vegas advertising handouts that were slid into the rooms under the door!! Most of all, I hate the smoking allowed throughout the casino, and as the elevators are located far from the parking garage entry, one must WALK many minutes through the casino to get to the elevators, thus exposing everyone to the tobacco smell.

I bought a ""deluxe"" room opposed a regular room because of a sale going on.  Paid about $85 a night for a room worth over $200, so it said online.  What a deal - right?  No.  

This room had far less amenities than a $50 a night Days Inn, which I prefer.  Small room, view of parking lot, on the floor of the pool, in which my room must be passed by anyone going there, kicking and screaming as they do all day, starting at 8AM.  No fan in the bathroom to rid it of humidity, disgusting shower curtain that belongs in a prison, shower head that is little better than what you might expect in a prison, the scratchiest TP and tissues in existence, and nothing more than the cheapest hotel soap.    Also - no coffee maker, terrible hair dryer, no microwave, $12 charge for internet for a day, and no mini fridge: these aren't vitals, but adding it all together makes me wonder.

They kept telling me (when I checked in and on the posters hanging around everywhere) that I now have hundreds of dollars in savings because of a coupon book I received.  This is quite  a joke as all the many coupons are 10% off ridiculously expensive purchases.

The noise is terrible.  My first morning I was awoken before sunrise because a woman across the hallway was pounding on the door, repeatedly whisper-shouting, ""Danny!  Danny!""  After 10 minutes it stopped.  Ten minutes later it began again with a security guy announcing himself before opening the door for the woman.  Thank God it was over.  New noises began with banging from upstairs and car alarms going off non stop.  Needless to say, I did not sleep well.

Big deal, weather is weather, guests and employees DO NOT CONTROL THE WEATHER. I wonder if anybody who complains about the weather & rides realizes how ridiculous they sound. Complaining about something you have no control over, give me a break.

The view
- the view is spectacular, I've gotten many panoramas and shots of different parts of the city from above, as stated above I've ridden the thrill rides, one includes big shot which is the highest point of the tower, very nice pictures from up there if I do say so myself, and they do have ride workers who explain where the designated viewing areas are. 

The elevators
- haha ok so I'm not the biggest fan of the elevator myself, but hello, the only other way you're going to get down stairs is the sky jump and god knows I won't mess with that one. Don't complain if the elevator takes too long, it's an ELEVATOR not a mail chute!! It only can go so fast! And yes, it has a capacity! Oh and did I mention there are staff that run the elevators to help MAINTAIN THAT CAPACITY? 10 guests per elevator, that doesn't mean 50+ jam into one, it doesn't work that way, I don't know about anybody else but I would hate to be stuck in an elevator in a tall building all because some idiot customers decided it would be okay so smush 50+ people in to one tiny elevator. 

I always have a great experience when I go to the stratosphere, I always tip when I see an employee struggling, even if they didn't do any service for me, if I see another asshole being rude to them because things didn't go their way, I'll tip just to help them have a better day. Also using kind words instead of cussing and demeaning helps. 

Thank you stratosphere for always providing me with great service, as for others who are more on the rude side, we can only pray for them. Good luck and take care!",1,0,0

We payed $45 for one night therefore I was not expecting it to be super luxurious. The room was under my husband's name but he was at a conference therefore I asked if I could check in without him. I was expecting them to say no but surprisingly the guy at the front desk was very nice and accommodating and managed to check me in and give me a key to the room without my husband present. It helped that I had the same last name along with the confirmation email for the room. As hotel guests we got unlimited access to the tower which is normally $18 per person. You can have unlimited access for up to four people plus we got 2 for one coupons for the rides. I felt like it was a pretty good value.,0,0,0

I was really unhappy because when I had booked our room, the description said there was an oversized tub in it. There was no tub at all just a shower. Which made me question whether or not I was just in a premier view room(which said no tub).  The door on the bathroom was awful. It was a slider door but poor design.

But being that an issue we had at check out (which was caused by them) was resolved, i went with three. Where to start? We the rooms themselves are ok. We had the newly renovated and higer floor room. The view of course is great (21st floor). No amenities whatsoever. No refrigerator, no drinks, no water, no wifi even though we were supposed to have it and it was included. It's there, but doesnt work and only frustrates you. We couldnt get it on the laptop, on 2 mobile phones (worked on one for a day), or on thr camera to transfer photos. Just aggregating and don't expect much help. Anything and everything is an extra charge. Almost anything decent on tv requires more money (whats included overall does not compare to other hotels, borgata in atlantic city for example blows this place away without contest). Water\/tea\/coffee, have to purchase. Room service is expensive. Small breakfast for two with a pitcher of tea ran upwards of $50 for not much at all. Maid doesnt take the food away, you will come back to it unless you take it out of the room and leave it outside on the hallway. The bed sheets, although the bed was made every day, were actually changed only once during a 6 night stay. Other than a place to stay and sleep, this aspect of the stratosphere leaves much to be desired. Before we could even check in they jump on you whem they see you are walking in with luggage and try to solicit packages and services which seemed annoying and not very professional to do in such a manner.

The casino is relatively small and relatively empty. Some places at times get busy but it is more of a walk through and play while waiting for someone than an actual casine. Though there are a few bars with music and tvs there. The breakfast diner is average at best and the buffet is pretty good. Location is the northernmost part of the strip and you liekly wont walk from there to the main parts (mgm grand, mandalay bay, billagio, etc), but honestly everything on the strip is cabs, cabs, cabs. Each place has a constantly moving taxi line and you almost never wait. 

The top of the world restaurant is amazing. It should and will get its own review and its calculation is what raises this to 3 stars. The food is good, not grrat like in SW Steakhouse for example, but very good nonetheless. A respectable fillet mignon, tasty everything else, and (unlike elsewhere at the stratosphere) great service. But the atmosphere and the view make this a must visit. Especially at night time when the restaurant and the outside are dark, the view of the city lights below is amazing. The top slowly  rotates and you get to observe the full 360 degree view of the bright lights. Especially beautiful are the south and north parts as you pass them. Prices are what you would expect such a steakhouse to have and not at all bad in comparison. From time to time you will witness a bungee jumper unexpectedly fly by outside the window. This place gets 5 stars. 

There is a shopping area for those who like that, though we just walked through it once and cant really comment much on it. There were a couple of shows playing there but we did not attend. Their attractions are one of a kind with the roller coasters and all that at the very top, but we didn't get a chance to go there so i cannot comment on that as well. But for those into such things i would inagine it's quiet an experience and view. 

Checking out didnt happen wihtout issues and them trying to,  you guessed it, charge you more for something unexpected via a way of their error. Wanting an express checkout we couldn't get it due to some balance we supposedly had. Standing in line downstairs to deal with it, the guy asking people on line if he can be of quick help was surprisingly rude. And the person at the desk was hesitant to fix the issie though eventually she did. 

There are two pools both of which are on roof tops. Neither have deep ends, both serve drinks and at least one serves food. No complaints as far as those go.

In summary, from people who are low maintenance and do not complain much, this is only good if you're on a budget but still want to stay at a big hotel and casino. It is no ""luxury"" hotel that's for sure. As mentioned it leaves much to be desired and caused more aggrevation than it should have. It is very unlikely that we would stay there again even if they beat the price of the others.",1,0,0

Pros:

Rates are very reasonable, even after adding the resort fees.  Expect around $100+ for weekends and half of that on weekdays.

They did a good job with the renovated select rooms, be sure to pick this out, well worth the upgrade.

Although it's off on the far north side of the Strip, you have very easy access to the I-15 via Sahara, close to Downtown and Chinatown.

Cons:

If you are a light sleeper, be warned!!!  If you get placed in the rooms facing the I-15, you will hear the the railroad horns late at night.  After playing poker all day, I was too tired to notice but that's me.

The neighborhood is let's say, least to be desired.

The select room was good, I would guess that the older rooms would not meet your expectations.

The lines are long at the front desk and moves slowly.  Have to give credit at least the staff was friendly.

Be sure to review your bill, they tried to pull a quick one on me by doubling the resort fee.  I had to call the Accounting Dept and get it cleared.  They didn't believe me until they had to look at the bill one more time and had to explain what I'm seeing.  Looking at the other reviews, this seems to be a distributing pattern.",4,2,2

No text , so after the hour and half passed I went to desk and was told would not be available until 3 at the normal check in time.

It was my first time in Vegas, and I wanted to stay somewhere affordable for a couple nights while waiting for my friends to fly in. I chose Stratosphere based on the price and supposed ""3-star"" rating. This hotel is definitely 2-stars. 

ROOM:
I was not expecting much when I walked in, but I was floored by the drabbiness of the room and bathrooms. There was not even any hand soap in the bathroom. Also, there was no fresh air in the room. It was completely stagnant, so much so that by the second night I had some minor congestion problems, and this has never happened to me before. 

I spent a great deal of time in the hotel room working. Wi-Fi was alright, but there is no office set-up per se. There is a dirty round table and a chair which I re-purposed to be my office. I had to wipe the table down and I moved it in front of the tiny window which was the size of a cruise ship port hole window.  Surprisingly, it offered a somewhat decent view of the Red Rock Canyon. 

LOCATION:
As for location, this hotel is located at the total north end of the strip away from all of the action. You would definitely need to cab or bus down to the central part of the strip during mid-day due to hot temperatures. More significantly, this area is very poor. I had no idea since I was new, but it did not take me long to find out. I would walk along the street during broad daylight and was honked at. While I feel it is safe enough during the day, I would not recommend anyone to be out on the streets in the evening.

The only redeeming feature of this hotel is that it is located near some very cheap, local eateries within walking distance such as Viva Las Arepas (highly recommend!!), so you are not held hostage to the horribly over-priced food in the casino. It is also located near the world's largest gift shop, so that was interesting to browse, though nothing special.

CASINO:
This casino was dark and smokey just like the others. There is no decor to speak of. The view at the top of the Stratosphere is nothing great - I walked up there simply because it was included as part of the booking, but would never pay the outrageous fee they asked. I also ate at the Carvery sandwich shop at the top and it was very disappointing. I will write a separate review on that.

I did not check out the pool, show, Top of the World restaurant, or rides, but that might be worthwhile if you're staying here.

Overall, I was happy when I checked out 2 days later and moved to Treasure Island. It's much more pricey, but was a hundred times better than this hotel.  Good luck if you are staying at Stratosphere. I would recommend paying a little extra and upgrading to a nicer hotel.",2,0,0

When I first moved here, Vegas World casino stood there with Bob Stupak as the owner. The sign fell off when there was high winds (just like the Hilton's did too). Everyone thought Bob Stupak was crazy when he brought up the project, but the tower was slated to be much taller and failed; it would've been a flight pathway obstruction- so they settled on a height of half of the original plans.

Small casino on floor level (cafe & gift shop), shops on second level (more variety, Ben & Jerry's, McDonald's, etc.), and observation deck\/rides\/restaurant at the top.

I stayed at the Stratosphere from 12\/21\/16 to 12\/23\/16. If the Stratosphere was attempting to be a waterpark type themed venue, then it would be a splashing SUCCESS. 

On the night of 12\/22\/16, this weird stuff called rain fell from the sky. Apparently, rain falls from the sky all night in some US cities. The room I upgraded too had an APPRECIABLE leak. When my girlfriend and I returned to the room at approx. 2AM, rain soaked through the window area, the carpet, much of my luggage, and was on its way to the bed. 

The Stratosphere is the only hotel I have ever stayed in where the room was not waterproof or water tight. Several of the security staff members agreed that my palpable disappointment was understandable.

However, the mgmt. of the hotel has not been as helpful. I await their reply to the complaint I left with security about the room.

I would recommend picking another hotel in the desert that has a better record of staying dry.",4,0,0

He called downstairs and we paid an upgrade fee for a bigger room, a better view, and a refrigerator. (I never knew hotel rooms didn't come with refrigerators until staying here, they charge an additional $10 per day) He took a shower and the tub didn't drain well so we called to have it fixed. We asked them to come in about an hour so we'd have time to leave the room before they came in.. 10 minutes later.. knock, knock on our door.. they can't get anything right. Later that day, I realized there was a strong sewage smell coming from the sink\/vanity area.. once again, we called and asked them to fix it after we left the room. The next morning we were woken up to banging and power tool noises. That was the last straw.. I made a mental note to talk to a manager\/supervisor when I passed the check-in area. She was not nice.. didn't smile, and never apologized; however, she did remove one night of upgrade fees, and changed us to the other side of the hotel where there wasn't any construction going on. I would NEVER stay here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone I liked. On their website, they advertise that they've remodeled recently.. I think they define recent as, within the past 10 years.

Let me start by saying I wish I could give it zero stars and then explain why.

First off, the hotel is north of the majority of the rest of the strip, so you won't be walking to the rest of the strip from here. If you try you will find that you are walking past very run down ghetto-like part of Vegas filled with ghetto people. Not fun.

Next the hotel itself while it looks nice from the outside, and the lobby looks decent, when you get to your room the fun will begin.

My friends had one room and I stayed in another room with a friend. Between our two rooms: toilets did not flush very well, ours got clogged. My friend's room key did not work and was never properly fixed. We stayed there 2 nights. Our room did not get cleaned on the only full day we were there even tho when we left our room the cleaning staff was cleaning other rooms close to ours in the same hallway.

The table in the room, the only table you could put a computer on or anything else was horribly unstable and I would not trust putting anything on it at all, not even my elbow let alone a computer.

Towels would make Motel 6 embarrassed they were so tiny and rough and not worthy of any decent hotel.

The overprice $20 buffet was atrocious.

I did not go on the main attraction some ride you can go on if you are not afraid of heights, so I can't comment on that. But if the only reason you plan to stay at this hotel is for that, then just stay at another hotel and go on the ride, skip the lodging.

In short, the hotel was not just bad it was terrible. Food bad. Skip this hotel. Las Vegas has many world class Casinos and Hotels. This is not one of them.

I am not sure I would stay here again even if it was free. Life is too short.",5,3,0

We had a pretty decent view and although we were on a non smoking floor there were a few times when I could smell some ones smoke, and having an astry @ the elevators didn't really help. The walls of the room we were in were kind of raunchy looking (I will include pictures of the walls) and we had to have to someone come and repalce the shower head because when we go there it was broken. The comforters on the bed are kind of thin ( I had to ask for an additional blanket & took the other comforter from the second bed). Once we were checked in, everything went pretty well.

Our room was HUGE! The pool area was decent. The casino sucked ass, but we weren't planning on staying there long anyways.

Located at the end of the strip....  way too far from anything so expect to either drive or pay for a taxi. Payed $15 for a taxi ride to Rio, which is located at the other end of the strip, just to give you an idea of how much you'll need for a cab.

Great place to pass out after a night of boozing it up at different hotels. lol (Seriously... make sure you hang out at other hotels... cause other than your own hotel room... this place SUX)

The club at Stratosphere is called Polly Esthers and they also have an IHOP walking distance from the hotel.",12,9,11

Personally, I was not interested in walking to the larger more luxurious casinos while I was in Vegas, because I was just passing through and have been to Vegas before.
The room was large and clean, though a bit dated. The view was onto a sub-level roof (my friends literally had a wall in front of their window) so don't expect much if you're paying basement prices.
Also, the next morning was unbearably loud. I was unable to sleep in longer than 8:30. Not recommended if you need a good nights sleep.",2,1,1

The front desk has long lines and understaffed when you check in.  Once you get into your room you realize you could have stayed at best Western or an older holiday inn and received a better room.  Stark white drywall dingy bathrooms small rooms is what you get.  The price at $150 a night does not warrant the room that you receive.  There are a lot of additional fees on your bill as well including resort fees resort fee taxes.   You can find better places to stay at better rates.

The observation deck is high above the casino and hotel below and allow you to see the entire city.  The outdoor deck give you an  up close look at the rides that nearly defy logic.  It seems strange to install an amusement park on top of a tower as they did but it works.  People get their thrills up there every day (weather permitting).  I've only ever done the Sky Jump myself.  The other rides just aren't my style.  When I go up in the Stratospher Tower it is almost solely for the view.  There are a few problems with it though.  Admission is $18.  $12 for locals.  All you get for that is a ride in an elevator.  Sure, it runs at 21 MPH and takes you up the core in less than a minute but the simple fact remains that it is nothing more than an elevator.  Second problem, trying to figure out where to purchase admission.  I was there on Friday taking advantage of the January special for locals (free admission Fri, Sat, Sun all January long).  I stood in one line near the entrance to the elevators.  They told me to go to the box office.  I went to the box office and it was dark.  Security told me to go down stairs to the other box office on the casino level.  Then I had to go all the way back to where I started and stand in line for a while as each elevator can only take 10 people.  When you have a long line 10 people at a time makes for slow progress.  Neverthless, the wait is worth it when you reach the top and see the magnificence of the Las Vegas Valley.

As for the casino, not bad.  It is big and mostly modern looking.  Its fairly clean and doesn't seem to smell too strongly of smoke like some casinos do.  My favorite part though is near the casino level box office mentioned above.  There is a nice Dale Earnhardt Sr. Chevrolet Camaro and the Stratosphere Pole Award given to the pole sitter of the Kobalt Tools 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway every March.  As a NASCAR fan, this is pretty cool.",4,3,3

We'd booked and paid in full for the hotel via a third party booking site for two rooms, received confirmation emails etc. 

When we arrived at the checkin desk we were met by a very rude staff member who could only find one booking. They refused to accept the additional booking even with confirmation emails in front of them and blamed the third party booking agency.  

I asked to speak to the management but were told that they were too busy on the phone, and was told to contact the booking site myself.  I had to escalate the situation and eventually got to the manager (after the staff member tried sell us the rooms we'd already paid for for an additional $170+ per night). 

Once in a separate room with the hotel manager we were given the keys to both rooms (something the staff member at the counter was completely unwilling to do)  but told us that we would be charged extra if there were any issues with the booking.  At this stage it was less than an hour to go to our wedding and we still hadn't had a chance to get into our rooms and have a shower.  The manager promised to call us in the morning to discuss the outcome but never did. 

The rooms we got were ok, nothing special, but nothing wrong with them either, though not at the same level as the rooms we had at the Flamingo a few weeks earlier. 

Luckily we got in just in time to have the wedding, but we were cutting it incredibly close. 

Thankfully the rest of the staff are considerably more professional than the checkin staff. We had a meal at the 50s themed diner and had some wonderful servers who sung to us, and also at the revolving restaurant which had some of the best customer service we've ever experienced.  

If we were not staying at the hotel I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars, but the horrible experience on checkin ruined what could have been a great experience with them. A simple apology from the staff for the checkin mishaps would have potentially solved everything. Sadly we won't be using this hotel in the future.",1,2,0

After being drinking for a while i went to the bar and asked for a cup of water and the bartender gave me a very nasty look, so i guess you should not drink water while you stay in there. When we checked in we were told that check out time was 12. so the day we were leaving we went out to have breakfast and called around 11:30 to ask if there were any late fees for late check out, we were told that check out time was 11, so we had to pay a $10 fee and after 2 pm was $30 so when we argued that we were told it was at 12 the person on the phone said ""ok it's at 12"" with a very bad attitude. So i assumed that if after 2 we have to pay $30 it means that from 12 to 1:59 you pay 10, well do not assume that, because when we were checking out around 12:50 we were told we had to pay $30, obviously we argued that so they called a manager who came in with a nasty attitude and said: you have to pay that, ""that's our policy"". Then after a while of back and forward he said ""our policies change everyday"". Then he asked us who told us check out time was at 12 we said the person who checked us in, and we encouraged him to find the name of that person, he then said he would leave it at $20. I guess if we would have insisted more they would have brought it down more but i lost my patience with these people and paid the money.

Here's my sum-up:

Bad things:
1) Internet is $12\/24 hours, and when I tried to get it, it wouldn't work (and this was not user error)
2) When we checked in, the room we got had NOT been serviced (empty beer bottles, unmade beds, etc.)
3) Getting around the building is kind of cumbersome
4) $8\/night 'resort fee'
5) Middle-class patrons
6) At the very very end of the Strip

Good things:
1) INEXPENSIVE!  We paid $55\/night (+$8\/night ""resort fee"") for a weekend recently (a.k.a., pretty prime time for Vegas visiting, in my opinion)
2) Adequate food available in-building -- sit-down restaurants, McDonald's, taco shop, pizza
3) Fat Tuesday's -- they have one upstairs and I love it - basically alcoholic slushees
4) Two pools (though we used neither)
5) But it's still on the strip
6) Cool rides at the top if you're an adrenaline junkie - or just nice views


All in all, we used our room for sleeping\/resting\/showering\/etc, spent time in the casino for gambling (we're quarter-slots-type people), and drove our car or walked to any other place on the Strip that we wanted to go.

Bottom line: good value for what we paid.  Recommended if you want inexpensive but want to be in a casino and ON the Strip.",1,0,0

The Service:
Check-in was nice and friendly. Check-out was a smidge longer than I thought. There was an extra charge in the room and I didn't even use any extra service. It took the dude awhile just to figure it out and fix.

I always liked the buffet but I'm pretty sure there were more choices in the past, the tower is fun but the Air Bar was a disappointment, and the 8th floor pool closed at 6pm. After two full days and nights in Vegas I sure could have used the hot tub. Who closes a pool at 6?

Unless you want to travel 20-30 on the strip by bus or pay an expensive taxi fee....or walk about an hour, you are looking at a tight casino, limited drink servers and very little entertainment besides the tower and thrill rides.

We stayed on floor 18 (which we had to pay a little extra to get this room with large enough windows to enjoy the room for four days). Great view of the north side of the strip (through dirty windows, but this may just be a product of a desert climate). We could see and hear the screams of the Skyjumpers free falling 108 floors about every 5 minutes throughout the day and night, which was terrifying and entertaining. Room was clean(ish) but dated. Nothing fancy at all. TV was great though. No coffee pot, mini fridge or safe could be found in my room, but I am guessing for an additional charge they would bring one up.

Food:
*Roxy's - Ate here once for breakfast, once for lunch and once for dinner. All three times were okay. Nothing to write home about, but reasonably priced from what we saw everywhere else. All tabs (with tip) were between $30-35 for two people with no alcohol.
*Buffet - For the cost, I would pass. We paid $20 per person but had a coupon that saved us $10, so $30 total, but food was not great. Bland to say the least and when we visited, it was dead, maybe 20 people in the whole place.
*Mexican Restaurant on 2nd Floor (don't remember name) - Grabbed nachos and quesadilla and took it downstairs to watch the football game. Husband said the beers here are cheaper than the bar, so look here first if you are paying for beer. Food was great, I would eat again.

Drink service while gambling - Unless you are sitting in the dead middle of the casino or at a table, good luck getting regular drink service and make sure you tip or you definitely won't see the back. There were two times we stayed in the same area for 30-45 minutes and never saw drink service at all.

Entertainment - So other than the casino (which has a ton of older machines), you are looking at not much else to do besides thrill rides and tower which will cost you unless you are staying in a room. You can see their musical Pin-Up, which we didn't see or visit their very creepy arcade where most machines are out of order, or limited shopping places on 2nd floor. Sports bar is okay, but we saw much better. They need MORE TV's throughout the casino so people can watch the games and gamble at the same time. We only found a few machines close enough to a TV, and they were pretty old and were just sucking money, so we opted to stop gambling.

All in all, it wasn't horrible, but if I visited again, I would find a casino closer to the middle of the strip so it is easier to get around and have more options for entertainment. For what we paid for our rooms, additional money for the view, money to travel to the strip...might as well pay a little more for a different casino.",0,2,0

At the very least, head up to the tower for the view since it's free with your stay -- there are metal detectors but it's not as painful as airport security.

Here's my overall take:

- Room:  eh. Clean, nothing fancy overlooking the parking structure.
- Casino: we don't gamble but amusing to watch people as we walk through.
- Buffet: I would give it four stars. Good service, delicious and everything tasted fresh.
- Parking: free. Connected to hotel.
- Drinks: head up to Level 107 Lounge to enjoy the view, drinks + food. 

We didn't spend every waking moment here (saw a show\/met friends elsewhere) so heading out to the more active areas on the strip and coming back for a nice view and a few drinks before a short night's sleep worked well for us. And it only worked because I promised to be the designated driver so we could drive back and forth (I don't recommend walking to the action, it's farther than it looks and chances are you will be too tired or tipsy to walk back).

I don't really have anything negative to say about the Stratosphere but with so much competition from the other hotels\/casinos, three stars is pretty fair. It's not spectacular, it's not horrible and we enjoyed ending our stay at the tasty buffet. If you want to be dazzled, wowed and close to the action then stay elsewhere. If you have a car, a designated driver, and a good room rate then stay here.",3,1,0

We had previously stayed with you 3 years ago when we were married in Vegas and had a wonderful experience then, so we decided to stay with you again. Unfortunately our stay this time left much to be desired. The room we booked online looked nothing like the room we were given upon check in. When we asked about the difference we were told if we wanted the nicer room we had thought we booked it would be an additional $30 per night. I felt it was misleading. The room we stayed in was very bland, the bathroom needed some improvements including a toilet that didn't flush completely, a rusting towel holder and a shower desperate for an upgrade. There were no pictures on the walls, the window was tiny and it was all in all very disappointing. The casino smelled very heavily of smoke which I did not remember our last visit, maybe the air cleaning system needs an upgrade? And most importantly the hot tub was closed for remodel, which was not disclosed on the website. I was really looking forward to a weekend of relaxation in a hot tub and there was no hot tub but we still had to pay the $23 a day resort fee to use things that were not open. I'm not sure if I would stay at your hotel again. I hope you can take my recommendations and use them to help your guests have a positive customer experience in the future.",1,0,0

For $35\/night (around $60 on weekends), the accommodations were spectacular. Don't expect anything too lavish - it's a simple hotel, but mostly clean, spacious and modern. If I was staying in this level of hotel in Boston, I'd be paying around $150-$200, not $35. This hotel is value, value, value.

Although cabs to the Strip were a bit costly, everything else was great. Unlimited access to the top of the tower (resort fee of $7.50 per day, well worth it), good pool scene (with cornhole boards and waitresses in bikinis), a built-in shopping mall and cheap food options were all convenient. We played table blackjack for $5, big wheel spins for $2 and roulette for $5 in the casino. For the mornings where I had too much Vegas the night before, room service was pricey but solid. Buffet was kind of gross, if you're going to do the buffets do it a higher-tier hotel.

He personally took us to exactly where we needed to be. Once we were there, our server Victoria took great care of us. The drinks were great. The food was great. The show was great.

Bar-
The bar is right when you walk in the door.  Every night from 6pm to 10 pm you get all you can drink for $19.99.  This might be the best deal in Vegas if you are looking to tie one on.   If you order doubles the drinks are really strong, to the point you can see the layer of booze and the layer of mixer and see through the mixer.  I am not complaining one bit.. just warning you all.   There is only one waitress in there, but she did a pretty good job of keeping up.  I did walk up to the bar once and got a refill.

The casino is alright.  Nothing specail.  I basically is the same as ever other big casino on the strip.   It is kind of dark in there though.

It was great that admission to the Stratosphere viewing tower was free for hotel guests, but three things really got on my nerves about this place:

1. We requested a smoking room but ended up in a supposedly non-smoking room.  Although I wasn't there when my friend checked in at the front desk, he later told me that the check-in counter person told him he was getting a smoking room.  However, when we entered the room for the first time - despite the obvious smell of smoke (from a previous guest) - I couldn't locate any ashtrays.  So I called the front desk, but was told it wasn't a smoking room at all - what???

2. Self-serve ice machines aren't available on every floor in the hotel.  There wasn't one on our floor, and there definitely wasn't one on the floor below us, either.  So much frustration over a simple thing.

3.  As a result of #2 (and due to the unhelpful phone service in #1), my friend and I walked down to the lobby to find out where exactly those ice machines are located.  After looking around for someone, anyone to ask, we ended up approaching a female employee (it was obvious to us she worked on the actual hotel side instead of the casino part).  She pretty much made it apparent from the start that we were bothering her.  I suppose it's okay if she really doesn't know where the ice machines are located, but what I don't appreciate was the attitude - at least direct us to someone who *does* know the hotel's layout instead of just declaring ""that's not part of my job"" and walking away.

All in all, I really don't recommend this place, even at a discount.  Stay at the Strat only if you have absolutely no preferences whatsoever at the hotels you frequent during your vacations.",2,0,0

Not in like the ""oh, hey look at that roller-coaster over there I'd sure like to ride it"" sort of way. More like an obsessive, all-consuming, contantly-looking-for-that-thrill kind of way. 

So when I heard that the Stratosphere hotel housed some of the tallest roller-coaster rides in the world, I had to go. 

When we walked up to the hotel, I was dubious- should I trust a hotel with my life that hasn't had a makeover in a 30 years? Seriously, this hotel is dingy, dirty, old, and all around decrepit. I would NEVER stay here. It was laughable. I should have listened to my gut, and turned away then, but my need to conquer the world tallest roller coaster ride prevailed. 

On the way up to the rooftop, we took the worlds fastest elevator. It took seconds to shoot the hundreds of floors to the top. I started to feel dizzy, and things started spinning around me. I felt nauseous. Spencer grabbed me and told me there was no way I was getting on the ride. WHAT! I immediately straightened up, smiled, and told him I was just fine. I had to get on this ride. I wasn't leaving Vegas until I did. 

We rode the X-Scream, which according to the Stratosphere's website is ""a giant teeter-totter that propels you 27 feet over the edge of the Tower, 866 feet above the ground"". Basically it is a flimsy 8-person bobsled that juts you out over the edge of the building and maniacally slides you back and forth. Did I mention it is controlled by a gum-snapping 18 year old? 

This ride was not fun. It was terrifying in every sense of the word. Everyone on the ride was silent...just holding on for dear life, praying for it to be over. Luckily for me, I didn't have to experience the whole ride. One moment, I am having horrifying thoughts of tumbling to my death, and the next moment, I wake up to people screaming ""PLEASE! We need help! Someone help her!"" 

Halfway through the ride, my eyes rolled in the back of my head and my whole body convulsed violently. A seizure? A panic attack? I don't know what it was, but I do know it was my mind and body telling me I had pushed it too far this time, and it needed to check out. 

Call me crazy, but after that experience, I rode Big Shot (hey I prepaid for the ticket) which shoots passengers straight up 160 feet at 45 mph (over 4 Gs) until they are 1,081 feet above the Strip. It was seriously fun, and I would recommend that ride to other thrill seekers. 

Yelp's one star rating sums this up perfectly for me: Eek! Methinks not.",20,20,16

We got a smoking room because we requested a room with a mini fridge but they didn't charge us to upgrade. The hotdog place here is realllly good, also ate breakfast at Roxy's diner & it was very tasty and FAST, our food came only about 5 min after ordering! You get free tower access which is cool, and the 8 bar at the pool makes a variety of amazing mojitos. It is at the far end of the strip so you can't walk many places, but a 24 hr bus pass is only $8 or $20 for 3 day pass so it's really no big deal.  The neighborhood between here and Fremont street is pretty shady but I'm not a pretentious snob so I don't care, it's really no different than any other major city. And yes there are (wait for it) bums, it's Vegas dumb dumb, there are homeless people EVERYWHERE you go in Vegas, not just around stratosphere. We did meet 2 ladies who claimed they found bedbugs in their room & got switched so we promptly tore our bed apart when we got back but we found no sign of bedbugs and our mattress and sheets all look pretty brand new... Maybe higher levels are less likely to get infested? But there are reports of bedbugs even at the nicer hotels like Bellagio so I suggest checking your bed at ALL hotels you stay in.

This will be our last stay--place is not what it used to be.  Management has changed hands and service\/quality has gone downhill.  They used to waive the $7.50\/per day resort fee for us, but not anymore. Your resort fee gets you unlimited access to the tower which means absolutely nothing unless that is going to be your main entertainment during your stay.   

Their ""upgraded"" rooms really aren't all that upgraded.   Room became stuffy and hot each night even with the air conditioning blowing full blast and down as far as it would go to 69.  A\/C blows across the window toward the opposing wall and not into the room.  You could definitely smell smoke in the room and hallways even though it was a non-smoking room and portion of the floor.    We had a  jacuzzi tub--not worth the added expense.  Took 45 minutes to fill above the jets, and when you could turn the jets on, only 2 of the 6 really worked.  Shower head was terrible.  Towels were newer than in previous years, and housekeeping services were to be commended, at least for our room each day.

C-bar and casino are smokey and noisy.  You cannot get service from the bartenders unless you are sitting at the bar playing the machines.  Waitresses will come over and ask you if you would like to order, but when we ordered from one, she never brought our order.  She came back 45 minutes later and remembered we had ordered and were still waiting, placed the order a second time, put it on her tray, but never brought that order either.   My advice is to go upstairs to the retail floor store and buy your beer there--its a dollar and a half cheaper than the bar, and you get it quicker.  

Area outside the hotel is less than desire able--you are located in a severely depressed location on the strip, however, the first couple years we stayed here we were able to walk outside the hotel in a group.  Now that the Sahara hotel has closed, the undesireables who live outside on the street are more prevalent.  We were warned by a cab driver not to walk around the outlying area to get anywhere so we always took a cab.  Be warned--those who live on the outside easily make their way inside the hotel lobby, casino, restaurants and bar, and have incredibly easy access to all the elevators and any floor in the hotel.  They will follow you around and panhandle relentlessly.  Bartenders do nothing to get them to leave the bar area.  Do not leave your personal belongings laying by a slot machine--we heard of many peoples cell phone being stolen, while they were distracted by some ""incident"" around them  It used to be security was posted at each elevator entrance at night and you had to show your room key to get into the elevators but no more.  For the most part, security in this hotel is non-existent and when we tracked them down and approached them about our concerns, they seemed uninterested at most.  

Eating options are extremely limited around this hotel.  The Mexican restaurant has good food, and in the past we have eaten at Fellini's Italian restaurant.  Other than that your options are Roxy's Cafe which is noisy and pricey for the amount, McDonalds, Tower Pizza and the Buffet.  Many of the stores on the Retail floor will give you a 10% discount if you use your ACE\/PLAY card--25% at the buffet.",2,0,0

Since turning 21, I've only gone to Vegas with my friends so we tend to stay closer to whatever club we intended on going to. As I was with my parents and kids my brothers age (aka 16-18), clubs were definitely not what we were concerned about. 

The Good: 
The stratosphere itself is free to hotel guests. The lines aren't that long, guess it depends on when you go. You can get to the top pretty easily - 10 people to an elevator. Getting to the top was great. Stop off on floor 108 for the inside observatory and floor 109 for the outside. The inside was pretty cool. That's also where they have the bungee jumping - there was someone doing it when we were up there. Pretty awesome. The outside observation deck is cold in the winter, but the views are gorgeous up there! 

The bar at the 107 floor is pretty cool too. Definitely a cheap way to get to the top and see the views without having to pay all that money for the stratosphere. 

The bad: 
Honestly, the location is just far from everything. Maybe except the SLS, which is still far from all the other hotels on the strip. It's just north, much more north than I thought. Since they're building resort world, it just seems so much further from everything right now. At any time, it's just about a $20 cab ride to the strip (even more if there's a ton of traffic). Then again, you could just drive yourself, but if you plan on drinking, it's not fun. 

The Ugly:
My mom ordered the deluxe room for the stay, but the other people ordered the premier room so my mom called the hotel to see how big of a difference it would be. They told her $15 per room per day. Not a big deal. Then, when we arrived, the price changed to $30 per room per day to upgrade and that was not what the hotel told my mom when she called. Anyways, after an hour wait and discussions with the manager (and some angry words from my dad), we got the hotel rooms as we thought. However, no strip view which is what was promised with the $30 extra dollars paid by our friends. Also, our rooms were not next to each other but close enough. Regardless, not happy by the time we made it into our rooms. 

Overall bad experience and probably never going to stay here again. it's not a bad hotel persay, but I like staying closer to all the fun and the amazing food!",4,5,2

My cousin received 3 free nights and we decided to all fly in for the weekend. Of course, I yelped first and saw all of the reviews, but I thought since the rooms were comped, I wouldn't complain. Oh. But, I did. I will just highlight the main complaints:

1. The rooms were old and smelly. When I walked in, it reminded me of when my family used to travel to those old Howard Johnson motels in the south. The joints that had actual metal keys and only 5 channels on the TV. I can see they tried to modernize a little, but the rooms are just depressing, ugh.

2. The bathroom sink smelled like the sewer. After the water ran for a bit, the smell coming from the drain was gross. I could barely make it through brushing my teeth. I had to hold my breath so I wouldn't breathe whatever toxicity was coming out of there. We called down to have someone ""fix"" it and I am not sure what he pretended to do, but the smell still came back. 

3. They do not clean the rooms during your stay. Be careful. We had to request to get our room cleaned and we were there for four days! We had to flag them down in the hallway for towels and to empty our trashcans. And when they did come, the woman claimed she cleaned the bathroom, but she folded the towels and simply folded the toilet paper. I do hope that they do a much better and thorough job in between guests. 

4. We needed an additional ice bucket, so we called down to request one. They wanted to charge us $6 for an ice bucket. Not a deposit, but an actual $6 for an ice bucket that we would be returning to them. Seriously? And it wasn't even a nice bucket, it looked like it was at least 15 years old. So, I went and talked to the front desk and they sent one up. Did you really think I was going to pay to rent an ice bucket, not at all.

I will end here, but there were other issues. Considering we did not spend much time in the actual hotel, and still had a horrible stay, speaks to the quality of the hotel and the service. They charge for just about everything which is not unusual in Vegas, but it's certainly not worth it for this place. I gave a second star, because staff were usually friendly and responsive when we had requests, but they never followed through or did a good job. Listen to the rest, and do not stay here unless you have to. Outside of the attractions such as the observation deck and Top of the World restaurant, I do not recommend you come here.",18,8,0

When we pulled in the valet greeted us and I asked if they had luggage carts. I was told they only had a few and the bell service would not lets us borrow one. Nice! The check in was pretty quick with the amount of people in line. I think it took 20mins to get checked in. As we all headed up to our room with kids dragging the luggage and myself sore from the 800 miles driven I was looking forward to crashing on the bed. We opened the door to find that the floors where not vacuumed and trash under the bathroom sink against the wall was still there. Trash cans where empty but floors where missed. The kids and I decided to head up and enjoy the pool and I'm happy to say the pool attendant was very professional and polite. The pool was clean and hot tub felt great. After the swim we headed down to the 50s diner. The food was good and the kids loved that the waitstaff would sing throwback songs. If the room was in better shape and clean I would have rated it higher. Spend the time and have rooms checked before turn over you will get better ratings.,0,0,0

There were hidden costs and a misrepresentation of what I would be getting even though I called in advance to confirm. I stayed at the ""Strat"" because they were having incredible winter deals...I should've known why. The hotel is FAR north of the strip and in the ghetto. Yes, its two blocks from the Sahara Tram but that's $12.00. If I had chosen a better hotel, I would've saved several things including my feet...as I opted to hold onto the $12. The staff was unfriendly and seemed a little confrontational, wanting to fight over my questions rather than answer them. The 50s themed diner had great food but the revolving restaurant was WAY overpriced. I was VERY disappointed. The one good thing I can say about the hotel is that they gave my boyfriend a GREAT impression of how you can get screwed in Vegas (later that day was the Sahara buffet - but thats a different review in itself). In short, AVOID the Stratosphere. Spend the extra $30 a night on a place that appreciates your business",1,2,0

There are many great things about the Stratosphere. The rides were quite the rush if you are a thrill seeker. The view of Vegas is unlike anything else. It's a beautiful view if you go at night and take some time to look and enjoy it all. 

I will say that everything once you get up there is incredibly overpriced. I have been to the space needle in Seattle so I kind of expected that since it's very similar to that. 

We paid a little bit more than I would have liked just for the ""Tower + 1 ride"" package. I know it's a famous place and it's pretty unique but I probably will only go there maybe once more because of that. Definitely a must if you are in Vegas and haven't tried this out yet.

There's rides on top of the tower to test your fear of heights to a whole new level, cheap rooms, and they have an awesome 1950's themed restaurant. But as my friends and I checked in, my first impression was slowly turning downhill.

First time we got there we already started having problems with our rooms. My friend ordered the rooms online for about $200, but when we got there they charged us an additional $150 for ""spending another night"", even though we were just staying there for 2 nights and checking out in the morning. I mean really? It said on paper that it was already paid, why do we have to pay more?

In my job, Marriott, I've learned that a lot of Marriotts have included free wifi and many other hotels are following just so they can keep up with the compitition and whatnot. When I tried to get into the Stratosphere wifi, I found out that it was an additional $11.90. Thanks, but no thanks.

Since my friends and I flew over to Vegas from San Jose, we pretty much had to call the taxi or walk to whatever destination we had to go to (mostly towards the strip...which was also very far...which also took a chunk out of our spending expenses). So location-wise, the Stratosphere sucked.

And lastly, when my friends and I checked out of the hotel we checked in our bags in the valet so we can go out and do some last minute gambling and sight seeing before we go back home. When my friend accidentally lost his ticket, one guy at the Valet was giving us the ""Oh well"" shrug and his sarcastic remark ""How am I gonna help you find your bags if you don't have your ticket?"" Great customer service *insert sarcasm*

However, this hotel didn't leave a bad impression on me-despite the review. While my friends and I were gambling, the cocktail waitress kept coming back to us so we can order more drinks. I was so impressed with her, I tried to give her a $10 tip, but she refused and only accepted $2. I insisted, but she still refused. She was so humble, I can't believe that there are people like her that are here in Vegas. And as my friends and I were trying to find our ticket to claim our bags, the Valet who took our bags went out of his way to help us find it.

All in all, it was a nice hotel, but it didn't quite leave the impression of ""Welcome to Las Vegas!"" I was looking for. Oh yea, and here's 2 stars for that cocktail waitress and the guy in valet-2 of your BEST employees!",0,0,0

Only saving grace is they do have a newly remodeled Sports Book and, since you are seriously on an island, you will have plenty of space to watch sports. Food prices were excellent and it was easy to place a bet and I would seriously recommend this Sports book to everyone if you didn't have to travel miles to get there. 

If you do decide to save cash and stay here, make sure you get a bus pass ($8 for 24 hours and there are deals out there) and make sure you eat at Roxy's Diner. The Diner's food was excellent and pretty reasonably priced for Vegas.

My friends and I came over to the Stratosphere in order to try the thrill rides at the top of the tower. About half of us would be riding, making the $16 elevator ride to the top a pretty steep wager for those who were just waiting for us to ride. They came up anyway.

Once at the top, there is a restaurant that serves burgers and other self-creation sandwiches along with a 360 degree view of the rest of the strip. The 108th floor is indoor viewing, while the 109th is outdoor.

It cost $31 to get a tower entrance and a ride on all three rides, which alone may seem expensive, but was pretty trivial in comparison to the tower entrance fee. As for the the thrill rides:

X-Scream: A must ride in the FRONT seat. The effect of being propelled off the side of the tower is effective, and you will feel something. Though the literal ride itself is not incredibly intense, it's design makes it pretty thrilling.

Insanity: Perhaps the most intense of the three for those who have a fear of heights. You are spun at 40 miles per hour with a 70 degree tilt toward the ground off of the Stratosphere tower. While I don't think this ride would make too many people dizzy, I would suggest concentrating your eyes to one spot on the ground to avoid a milkshake explosion.

Big Shot: DEFINITELY the best ride of the three. The ride is your typical space shot tower, except its 1100 feet off the ground. Usually, I find this kind of ride semi-intense, over-relying on the initial shot then fizzling out afterward. This one, being high off the ground gave a terrifying view! And at the top, they stop the ride sufficiently as to give a STRONG negative-G pop that makes you feel like you're literally floating over the entire Las Vegas strip. If my group wasn't in a rush to the next event, I would have definitely ridden this puppy again!

Overall, the property isn't bad, but is a bit expensive for what it's offering, even by Vegas standards. I'm glad to see that this hotel hasn't become a complete victim of the newer Vegas fanfare.

In the future, I hope to try the SkyJump, which also seemed really popular (1000 foot jump off the tower), and I'll likely give that a try also on a future visit (the ambulances are always standing by right on the ground... CRAZY!).",0,0,1

Second, on the first night my husband could not stop tossing in turning in bed so he finally got up in middle of night just to realize he had been bitten on the top of his head four times. Once I awoke I realized I had been bitten five times on my arm. We looked around the bed and found evidence of bed bugs. We went downstairs to front desk and was helped by an older gentlemen who directed us to his superior. They took a report and pictures of our bites and then accommodated us to an upgrade. Definitely upset about the bites and appreciated the upgrade, however, we don't think we will ever go back. We originally booked for three nights but because the party we came with wanted to stay an extra night we had to stay and pay for extra night but were disappointed to find out we all had to relocate. The hotel happened to put the whole floor ""out of service"" so we were all moved to different floors. As far as their restaurant choices, shops, and casino were somewhat disappointing. El Nopal restaurant was delicious. Their gift shop on casino floor are very expensive. I over paid compared to other gift shops i found after. Try the gift shop next to select elevators on Restaurant floor at Stratosphere or the Big Souvenir Store or the $10 or less souvenir next to Tacos El Gordo. Same souvenirs just cheaper.  I would not recommend this hotel to others and I will not return due to their bug infestation.",2,0,0

This place is the absolute worst in the entire planet, and I mean this in every sense of the word. Let us begin, and I hope you take this review, and the others into consideration.

1-We were offered an ""upgrade"" for $10 more a day, which we opted for. We're smokers and originally booked a smoking room. Our upgrade? Nope, non-smoking. I know you non smokers are thinking ""so what, screw smokers"", but here's where our issues come into play for you. We called the front desk and were told that the hotel had no smoking rooms available. I went down to the front desk and spoke to a manager who told us that she would give us a smoking room but it would be a down grade and we would have to continue to pay the upgraded price. Hell no! I questioned her logic with her decision\/offer, and all of a sudden they magically had a room commensurate with what they are charging. Shouldn't be this hard.

2- the rooms are filthy, old, and smell. And I'm talking about the non-smoking rooms! 

3- the front desk is not at all helpful.

4- calling housekeeping, the front desk, or room service will get you no answer majority of the time.

5- The pools are so-so. The 24th floor pool is not at all worth it. Two drink minimum to stay, bring your room key and id.

6- if you want to charge anything to your room, make sure they swipe your credit card twice for this purpose. Your initial credit card swipe doesn't count for this. Yet another inconvenience.

7- I'm a poker player, and the room here is BAAAAADDDD!!!! No games, no promotions.

Bottom line- stay somewhere else. For what we paid, we could've stayed in a far nicer place with a staff that actually cared about their jobs.

I did not include Top of the World because I left a separate review for that.",3,1,0

The check in staff was very nice and accommodating.  The rooms was ok but getting it to cool down was virtually impossible.  The thermostat would only go down to 68 but it felt like it was in the 70's.  

Restaurants were just ok, shops were expensive but expected, pool was nice, but the hotel location is a bit far from the strip.  A car or cab ride is a must to hit the strip.

The clincher was on my second night.....after leaving my room at 0930am and returning 12 hours later 930pm I walked in to discover my room had not been cleaned yet.  I immediately called housekeeping and spoke to a women that said she was the housekeeping supervisor.  I explained my situation to her and she told me ""we didn't have time to clean it"" she continued and said she can send someone up to my room shortly to clean it as they have 24 hour service.  I informed her my family has returned to the room after a long day traveling and the last thing I want them to do is wait in the hallway while they clean the room.  She then said ""I can make sure we clean it tomorrow after you leave the room"".  I was appalled to say the least.  I told her I have been traveling to Las Vegas for the past 30+ years and I have never been told that housekeeping didn't have time to clean my room.  She then asked me if I wanted my room clean tomorrow.....I said of course I expected my room to be cleaned every day....is that too much to ask.  She said she will make sure it gets cleaned tomorrow and hung up.   

Not happy on how that conversation went, I walked down to the front desk and spoke to the hotel manager.  Even though he was sorry about how I was treated he made no real effort to make me feel any better....bottom line my mind was made up that I will be staying at another hotel next time visiting Las Vegas.  What happens in Vegas will NOT stay in Vegas as I am sharing this terrible experience with all my Yelp friends.....Recommendation.....try another hotel.",2,0,0

We had a very nice room on the top floor - standard Vegas room, no need to expound. The hotel had a typical, grand pool with waterfalls, but a little unknown secret is that on the roof there is an adults-only pool with a cabana and a bar and topless sunbathing is allowed. Best of all - NO screaming, splashing kids. So, if you're a woman you get a nice, peaceful poolside experience. If you're a guy, you get a nice, peaceful poolside experience plus free boobies! If you are straight and have an XY chromosome then you are probably not reading the rest of this review and are already on Expedia. Hey, you may not con your girlfriend or wife into the topless revue but you can con her into the ""adults-only"" pool.

There are also rides on the top of the casino which nearly made me chuck my cookies, i couldn't tell if it was the fear of heights that I have or the fact that 70% of my dietary intake was alcohol over the last 3 days. A new ride had just opened that spun you over the edge of the skyscraping hotel only a week ago, I (ethanol-soaked but still clearly lucid as to impending death) decided that a ride like that must be open a year at least before even the consideration of 'giving-it-ago'.

The downside is that this casino is way off the Strip and it's farther in taxi fare and more of a hasssle getting around. I'd much rather stay somewhere directly on the Strip.",0,0,1

We selected the Stratosphere because it was reasonably priced; the Tower fee is waived for guests of the hotel; and the resort fee was included with our Expedia package (WATCH as most hotels charge additional ""resort fee"" but Expedia will include in some package prices).

The room was on the 14th floor with a view of the parking deck...ugh. So maybe it wasn't so bad that the only window in the room was small. And behind the curtain on the window sill was our first Vegas souvenior - a can of SKOAL left by the previous guest and forgotten by the maids.

The bathroom was so small that the door practically hit the toilet seat. And why is the bathroom sink and countertop NOT in the bathroom but in our living area? And lacking such amenities as a soap dish? 

You do get an iron and ironing board - but it makes it difficult to press clothes when the iron is secured tightly to the ironing board like a short leash on a dog. 

The first morning we also realized NO coffee maker in the room!

We thought we could handle the walking, but this was just too much. We did our best and cabbed it when we got tired. I should have brought my sneakers! But you don't go to Vegas packing Rockport walking shoes. You go for the glitz of it all. 

And because this hotel was so far away, cabbing was a necessity and more than often and adventure. We are from Chicago and cab it quite often, but this crew of cabbies are miserable, sneaky and down right violent. You should be armed with a basic sense of direction, map, cash (because unlike Chicago, they do NOT have to take credit or debit cards) and the phone number of the Taxi Authority. Here is a hint: ALWAYS tell the cab driver you are late for your dinner reservation, show or plane. This will give them a sense of urgency with no questions asked. It worked for us when we needed to get to the RIO and we decided to continue to use that line.

We went to Planet Hollywood hotel to check out the casino and were floored by the difference in amenities, decor, guests, location. We felt like THAT should be our Vegas experience next time. Even if we have to spend a few more dollars. It will be worth it.",1,1,1

This hotel is technically on the strip, but very far away from the other casinos and all of the action. My friend and I walked to the Bellagio, it took us two hours and a lot of water. So if you are going to Vegas and want to be totally away from crowds and people, then stay here. If you want to be in the thick of it, stay somewhere more central.

Of course, it is all my fault that I hadn't planned in advance: booking a room in Las Vegas for New Year's Eve on December 25th - ba-a-a-a-ad idea! Because what you are left with is a very overpriced and inconveniently-located room in a Motel 6-type hotel practically on the outskirts of the main strip. 

Bathroom was so small that I, being 5'5"", could barely turn around in it - everything was in the way; and the sink was in the main room! The TV had only about 10 normal channels, all the other ones were pay-per-jerk porn channels. 

Another low point: at the check-in, I was given a ""Fun Book"" with coupons to various stores and restaurants in or in the vicinity of the hotel. Well, what do you say! 95% of them had the expiration date of 12\/24\/09. Lame-o! Why even give it to me?

Your jacuzzi room offered no fresh air (a trend in Vegas, I noticed), and though it was rumored we were on a non-smoking floor, we dubbed the room to be Liggett-alicious from every angle.  Even the remote smelled like an ashtray.

   Worst.  Conditioning. Shampoo. Ever.  Don't put it in your hair.  You'll be sad you did the moment it hits the follicle!  It's better off dirty\/mildly greezy.  Yes, greasy with a ""z"".  

   I had to make a midnight trudge to the front desk when we wanted to rent a movie, since they would not use the credit card we had already booked the room with.  The only bonus of this stroll was seeing that yes, there are others who can look more haggard, more spent, more wretched at this time of night than I, a fact strangely comforting to my non-movie-viewing soul.  After a nice chat and some parlaying with the GM, he offered a complimentary late check-out and the privilege of keeping my room keys as a souvenir.  Buddy, I want your MILLIONS as a souvenir, and no strip of lucite is going to one-up that.

  Food places in there were not tasty, overpriced, and had weird hours.  Starbucks on-premise is completely out-of-control and understaffed in the mornings, so prepare to go without or eat lots of sedatives before embarking on its' trail.   In-house shows, Bite and American Superstars, smelled like such weak sauce, we couldn't bring ourselves to take one little taste.  But maybe they're good.  And maybe I have a third breast\/eyes in the back of my head\/crapper made out of gold.

   On the interesting side, we did get to watch an entire structure go up during our stay.  There's always new building in this city!  On a sizeable empty sandlot adjacent to the Stratosphere parking structure, we were intrigued to witness a bum build a whole shelter out of old mattresses and box springs.  The first day, he only had one mattress, leaned up against a tree at a slant, creating a lean-to of sorts.  By Day 2, a second mattress materialized, resulting in a tent-shaped domicile.  Random accessories began to appear, like a satellite dish and several chairs.

   By Day 3, (the morning during which we had no running water in our suite) a box spring was laid atop the mattresses for a full-on condo.  A nondo, if we're going to be honest about it.  That was about the time I started to envy his fresh air a tad... which meant it was time to come home!

This ""suite""  has no coffee pot, no refrigerator nor a microwave not sure this is even a suite. This is my first and very last time coming here. I find this insulting and a misrepresentation of services. I will definitely go somewhere else in the future. Never using bookit.com again either.",0,0,0

Everytime they opened and closed thier front door the connecting door rattled. Unfortunately the door did nothing to muffle the sounds coming out the next room. I was up all night because of this.

Then the next morning I went the buffet and was forced to pay for the champagne brunch. There are postings at the buffet and online for the a non alcoholic option. 

I am 7 months pregnant and do not wish to drink. I told the lady at the buffet this and she gave attitude and said it was the only one they had.",0,1,0

Pros:

Valet parking is FREE.

Hotel offers a $19.95 eat all day pass.  Dine anytime and as many times as you want.

2 for 1 coupon for their show.

Beds were very comfortable.

Rooms were clean.

Free entrance to the Tower.  Regular price is $13 - $15 for non-guests.

Cons:

Paid $60+ for an upgraded view of the Strip.  Not worth it.  Should have saved on the upgrade and booked a standard room.

Staff was very indifferent.  Not very friendly.

Don't even bother to try to check-in early.  They will only tell you to come back after 12pm.  They said they did not have any rooms clean.  Hard to believe considering that the hotel was not sold out.

Slots - not much luck.  Everyone I talked to said to go Downtown where the slots are looser.

Overall, not too bad a place to stay.  Location is far from the action, but with free valet and being able to drive to the other casinos, it was not too bad.

If rates continue the way they are, I would stay again.",1,0,0

They have a line at least 50 deep and only 3 people working the registration desk!!! So now I get to spend the first hour or two of my 48 hour trip in line due to the incompetence of management and their lack of employees!!!

Now the rooms (at least the one I stayed at) looked rundown and dirty. Just like a motel and as bad as the circus circus extended hotel rooms. The casino charges a resort which includes wifi. I could not get a stable connection in my room. It was probably a about ten minutes total I actually used it. I could not do any work. It was a work trip. The toilet could not flush correctly. It needed to be flushed twice. At check out I informed the front desk agent. Her excuse for the wifi was that once the spied if the wifi gets to 5 gbs a customer would only have limited to no connection. She did not even acknowledge the toilet issue. And did not thank me for staying there. I noticed that she was very courteous, friendly, and polite the customer before and after me. Even though she was of a different ethnicity I felt discriminated by her. Maybe it was because I wasn't dressed nice or of higher status. This should be no stars.",0,0,0

If you go for happy hour which is 4-7pm you don't have to pay for the elevator ride up to the lounge. Which is $16 normally if I remember right. The lounge itself large and nice with a romantic type of ambience. It's kind of dimly lit with killer views of the Las Vegas strip. The drink special is 2 for 1 martini's which has to be the same flavor. It's cool if you go with someone cause then you both can order a flavor and switch one. Our favorite when we went was the ""Red Velvet"" martini. We also got their sliders and some type of calamari and shrimp dish. Both were really good. The sliders were pretty big, not like normal tiny sliders. So we got the elevator ride up for the both of us, 4 martini's, and 2 entrees for $41 plus a tip. Can't beat that. Definitely a cool spot to go to with a date. The only bad part is it's located at the end of the strip but hey that's what taxis are for...",0,0,0
