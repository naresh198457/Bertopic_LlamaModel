The wait staff is very impatient, they kept cleaning the table before we even got our bill.  I can understand if I told them I wanted dessert, and this is why they are cleaning my table.

I had the shrimp tempera and salmon and avocado roll. Both were great - they tasted very fresh. The prices couldn't be better - $14 for lunch. The decor is cool - I know this sounds odd - but if you visit you have to check out the bathrooms - they are super cool.

The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't have that many signature\/special rolls. They probably had about 5\/6 different options when it came to special rolls and they seemed a little to far out there. Not what I would want included in my sushi. But then again, I am just a beginner, so maybe I am not open minded enough when it comes to sushi. Guess you will have to go visit and decide for yourself. Don't worry, it's worth the visit.",0,0,0

The menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. He came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. 

Here's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), rock shrimp tempura in a spicy mayo sauce, beef gyoza, and crispy scallop lettuce wraps. The peppers were a good surprise of the night because I didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but I definitely appreciated the greens in Vegas! The rock shrimp tempura was really tasty, but I wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. They tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. The beef gyoza was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. The crispy scallop lettuce wrap was phenomenal. Our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. 

We followed up the first round with the robata - we got the pork belly, rib eye, sea bass, and duck. All of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! The duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of unique flavors.

We finished off dessert with their 4th of July special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. I think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. Either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.

What really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which I really appreciated! The service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!",2,0,0

This place is fantastic! The decor if fun and funky and so are their drinks. Don't get me wrong, we clearly did not go here for the drinks, but they were a definite added bonus. Try the one with the Guava it will blow your mind. Right when you enter there is a bar that you can sit and drink at or you can get seated and the tables are classy and comfortable. There's a little private party section and a massive alcohol selection. The wait staff were on top of their game and not at all pretentious.

I loved that this place is open incredibly late, getting fresh sushi at midnight on a Tuesday was not a problem. Everything we ate was really simple and tasty. The shi-take mushroom skewers were pleasantly surprising and the salmon fell apart in my mouth before I had the chance to chew.  They had a few basic rolls that were normal priced, but overall it was a little pricey. However, it's expected in Vegas and worth every penny.",1,0,1

Our server was totally sweet. She explained the menu really well and helped me order something I would actually like since I'm not normally a sushi lover. I think the roll I got was the Neo Tokyo. And it was sooo good! Very satisfying flavor, savory and sweet at the same time. A little expensive I thought, but alas.

Considering there were like 15 of us on a busy night, the service was pretty fast. We got our food and drinks in a really timely manner and I didn't feel like we were sitting around waiting that much.

Anyway, I know everything on the strip is pretty expensive and I definitely should have Yelped this place before going in... My mistake, I know. However, I had just arrived in LV, checked into the Venetian and my hotel room key had SUSHISAMBA on it. I figured, 'I've been craving sushi the whole drive over here and this must be a sign! Let's go get sushi!' I went against my better judgment and immediately walked over to have dinner with my family. Ahhhh, I definitely have regrets about that now.... Mannnnn, marketing and convenience just gets ya. -_-

Don't get me wrong; the food wasn't terrible and the ambiance had cool vibes.. I just can't justify spending that much money on 2 oz. of food. I didn't realize it was tapas style but once I found out, I just went with it and though we could order a bunch of stuff and simply share.. 

We ordered a couple of sushi rolls, one order of sea bass, a scallop appetizer, and steak. Our favorite was the sea bass-super fresh and amazzzzzing taste (but we all had one piece each because there were maybe 5 pieces?-in all honesty, that wouldn't fill me up if that was for one person). Everything else was okay but I think we would have been a lot happier, richer and fuller if we had just gotten burgers. 

I would recommend this place as a romantic date for an anniversary or birthday-for intimate occasions, not anything dealing with a group(3 or more lol).",2,0,2

Conveniently located in the Palazzo shops, its great for a quick bite if you're staying at the Wynn or Venetian and don't want to walk too far.

The prices are reasonable and the quality of the food is very good. I was particularly impressed with the huge portion of grilled yellowtail cheek I got for what I paid.

The sauces that accompany their sushi rolls are quite interesting - mustard, ponzu and soy-based. 

My one complaint, and it's a major one, is that I had to order sake THREE TIMES before I actually got a glass. My first and second choices were sold out, and it took the waitress 15 minutes between orders just to tell me this. Finally, when I picked a sake they hadn't run out of, there was not enough left in the bottle to constitute a full serving. I wasn't charged for it, but it was too little, too late. What I ended up drinking was far from what I was in the mood for.

If you sell sake by the glass, running out during the peak dinner hour in Vegas is unacceptable.",1,0,0

From the menu I tried the Gyoza wagyu beef dumplings. OMG so delicious. Though maybe now I need to try wagyu on it's own. The Kanpachi was simple, well presented and delicious. And the Neo Tokyo (tuna) roll was great as well. A little shochu to go along with it made for an excellent meal.

I knew as soon as I read the description for SushiSamba that the fusion thing would provide the party atmosphere I wanted for my birthday dinner and I was right!

We started with the cocktail tower at the suggestion of our server (whose name I can't remember because I suck and she was AWESOME) who also provided an additional taste on the house. AMAZING. 

So I'm sure you've heard of fish tacos. But have you heard of yellowtail taquitos?! These were freaking amazing. Mini tacos filled with insanely flavorful yellowtail sashimi and a bunch of other yummy stuff. GET THEM. Besides, baby tacos? Cute. We ordered a bunch of other small plates and a ton of sushi, the names of which I cannot remember. The shrimp ceviche and crab gyoza were also amaaaaazzzzinnnnggg! 

Because it was my birthday, I was surprised with a sparkling (literally, there was a sparkler sticking out of it) dessert that I was nice enough to share.

Everything about SushiSamba was on-point, from the food to the service to the atmosphere. It was so much fun and the best way to celebrate a birthday.

Not sure if it was co side ted busy when we arrived but it felt like a busy night. Our server seemed to be a little over stretched in his section. He greeted us right after his wing man ask what kind of water we would like. It took a long while for our drinks (alcoholic, of course). When I say a long while, I thought maybe they were going to Peru to get the Pisco for my Pisco Sour (which I ended up sending back anyway because it was too tart and unexpected). This pretty much went on throughout the night. Our food however, came out in a timely fashion due to the cooks and food runners being fabulous. What's not so fabulous, is that for every question I asked three different runners, their answer was always, ""excellent question, let me get your server"". Although it was polite and I appreciate them not giving me a wrong answer, I wish the entire staff was also well informed about the bar. 

Hm... The bar! I'm in the industry and I have a vast knowledge of spirits. I am baffled of their selection, or lack there of. I realize bit all bars will have some of what I request, but they should all keep up with the joneses and have in demand and popular spirits. I asked for three spirits that they did not have. Server also told me that they just recently put Titos Vodka on their shelf!!!! Huge list of sake but no Bulliet Burbon, or Rum Chatta.

Green Bean Tempura and Rock Shrimp- both delightful, we ordered a second helping

Though the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that I ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  I would recommend everything I ordered for those that are going there.  
Here's what I ordered for 2 people:
1) sea bass and miso antichucos....the Peruvian corn that comes with it was quite tasty
2) agedashi tofu....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good.
3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll.
4)  some sort of spicy tuna roll.  the tuna was high quality...VERY FRESH!
5) Peruvian hot chocolate....this was DAMN good!  The drink was thick and very creamy.
6) Mango honey crisp taquito.  

thinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.  
the service there was EXCELLENT!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.

BE AWARE though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.

Located inside the Palazzo, this restaurant seems like a small bar and restaurant at first glance.  The gourmet cuisine served here is a fusion of Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian.  The menu offers an assortment of sushi bar offerings, noodle soups, kobe beef, seviche, robata, churrasco, and a raw bar.  Most items are tapas style and served on small plates.  Large plates are available but we didn't try any entrees this time around.

The restaurant itself has a bar right in the front.  Toward the back of the first dining room is the sushi bar.  The dining room is dimly lit with recessed lighting directly over the dining tables.  They play some electronica music, but not the heavy stuff that leaves you with a headache.  On the very back wall they have a screen and some random videos are projected onto it.  Behind the screen is another larger dining room.

We were seated promptly.  The servers are very friendly and make very good suggestions on what to try.  The server's assistance are extra attentive, as soon as you are done with a dish, they come and clear the plate off the table.  If your beverage glass is half empty, they are sure to come and refill your water or soft drink.  We decided to try an assortment of small plates to get an idea of the styles and varieties of the chef.  Here's a breakdown of what we ordered and my opinions on the dish.

Small Plates
Seared Kobe Beef - thin slices of real Japanese Kobe beef.  Topped with Japanese mushrooms, a ponzu gelee, and a truffled tofu cream sauce, this was an excellent dish to start the meal off with.  The beef is very tender and the mushrooms and ponzu gelee added a nice savory taste to it.  The truffled tofu cream sauce, drizzled on top, balanced out the saltiness of the ponzu.  This was my favorite red meat dish we ordered.

Mushroom Toban-Yaki
This consisted of several varieties of wild mushrooms in a savory light cream sauce.  Give me a bowl of rice and I could eat this entire thing to myself.

Samba Rolls
Rainbow Dragon Roll - unagi inside with red bell pepper and mango with avocado on the top.  The ingredients were very fresh.  This was one of the safer items we ordered in case we had difficulties with the other dishes.

Robata
Duck Breast, cooked medium, drizzled with a pepper sauce.  The duck was very tender and moist.  It didn't have a gamey taste nor was it greasy.  One of the best duck dishes I've ever tasted.

Seabass & Miso
Two skewers of tender seabass glazed with a miso sauce.  The miso sauce really brought out the flavor of the fish.  The sweetness compliments the fish flavor.  This was also served with Peruvian corn.  The corn kernels were huge, about the size of jumbo peanuts and had a mild sweet flavor to it.

Seviche
Lobester seviche.  One of the best seviches I've ever had in my entire life.  They take a lobster tale, cut it into pieces and mix it with a mango, red peppers, hearts of palm with a hint of spiciness.  If you can't handle spicy, don't try it.  What I liked about this dish was the spiciness and the combo of the mango sauce.  The spicy balanced out the sweet, and vice versa.  Not only does the dish contain a lobster tail, it also included a lobster claw.  This dish is a market price dish; it wasn't more expensive than any other dish we ordered.

Over all, I loved this restaurant.  I enjoyed the creative menu and the service was the best I've had in a long time.  I can honestly say I have found a new favorite restaurant in Vegas.  If you're reading this, you better go and try it if you get a chance.",0,0,0

It was amazingly good.  In fact I think they should make that by itself  main dish. The pacific roll was also very very good, the sushi was high quality and a good size.  

Not only was the food fantastic but the customer service was GREAT.  The server accidentally spilled sauce on me (just on my leg and thankfully it didn't get on my clothes).  He profusely apologized and I told them not to worry about it.  Next thing I know, the girls and are were bought out an extra dish of scallops with a creamy pesto sauce on the house.  Apparently it was a chef special and not even offered on the menu, and it was fantastic.  The scallop was cooked to perfection...succulent and juicy and the pesto sauce on it was equally as amazing.  It was SO good in fact we went back the next day, and when we asked about that dish again since it was off menu, they were soo happy we came back and liked it, they gave it again to us free!

First of all I have to say that I love fusion food if it's done right. There is definitely something alluring about mixing flavors from different cultures. When I heard that Sushi Samba fuses Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian, I dropped everything and made a reservation.

Inside, Sushi Samba will have you in awe before you even taste the food. The interior décor is modern but definitely has a South American flare.  We need more places like this in Vegas!

Service is unfortunately hit or miss. This place often gets very busy and servers sometimes struggle to handle the crowd.

My husband and I just moved back from the East Coast and we were really looking forward to some AWESOME West Coast sushi! We arrived around 9pm and were promptly greeted and seated by the  hostess. We didn't like the original seat she tried to give us so I asked her to sit one table in and also because it was a four top instead of a two top (you need room when you order sushi.....you either get tons of little plates or a huge plate that doesn't fit on a two top table). Well that must have frustrated her because she threw the menus down on the table I wanted and basically ran back to the hostess stand. ( yes she threw the menus!) we then proceeded to wait a good 15 minutes before anyone would come over and talk to us....not even give us water. Finally our waitress came over and apologized and we were ready to order drinks and edamame. Our drinks came quickly and we ordered the rest of our dinner with some suggestions from our waitress. Our first to appetizers came pretty fast as well but the waitress for got we wanted edamame so that came later in the meal. The oysters were awesome...the yellowtail with jalapeño was AMAZING.....sushi rolls were good but the rock shrimp tempura was off....taste just wasn't there ( taste not spice.....it was basically no flavor but spicy). Our waitress talked up the mini doughnuts for dessert so we ordered them...only to find out they were out.
Our bill was over 200$ and I left disappointed at that price.
On a side note the hostess tried to seat 3 other couples at the original table she wanted to give us and all 3 couple asked for different tables.....it wasn't a busy night.....she may want to take a step back and remember she is the first person people see....she needs to represent this restaurant better.",0,0,0

The menu offered an intriguing variety but when I began reading the reviews I knew I had to try it. I would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! The server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. There are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if Kobe Beef if something that interests you. As it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than I have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.

Course #1 consisted of Berkshire Pork Gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and Yellowtail Ceviche Taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something I would have ordered on my own.

Course #2 was Yellowtail Sashimi in a spicy Peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and Octopus Sashimi in a Japanese citrus sauce which again were both to DIE for!

Course #3 had an array of filet mignon, sea bass, king crab and Peruvian corn. All were moist and tender but the sea bass absolutely melted in your mouth! Peruvian corn was a yummy alternative to traditional corn as well.

Finally, Course #4 was the main sushi dinner. Shrimp tempura rolls were delicious, but the spicy tuna with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! There was also Maine lobster and another roll which I believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that I was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!

Another great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! As our server said, ""Its like a money back guarantee!""

Anyways this is definitely a place I would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. DO IT! It will not disappoint!

Only part I would complain about is the fact that there is NOT one in California!!!",5,3,4

5 stars for Happy Hour. My last visit in vegas I visited there HH twice, on the same day. A must order on the HH menu would be the waygu potstickers and the cocktails on the HH menu. Definitely a fun and great place to come for a nice meal. They offer a variety of food from sushi to steak. Definitely a fushion of Japanese and Peruvian. Drinks, food and service are great.

We asked the bartender for happy hour menus and then we ordered a mojito and a caipirinha. My friend loves mojitos, I don't care for them. He said these were the worse he's ever had. The mojito was slightly better than the caipirinha, but not by much. It practically tasted the same. We also ordered the Berry Smash and the Samba Juice which actually looked and tasted quite similar except that the Berry Smash has no alcohol! None of these drinks were very strong, nor tasted good. For around $12-$15 a drink, it really should've be made by a professional. We went to Craftsteak the night before and the drinks there were fantastic. The bartenders @ Sushi Samba are pretty, but they don't know how to make a decent cocktail. However, it's not all their fault since they were using mostly mixers and not premium alcohol\/fresh ingredients unlike other upscale bars\/restaurants. 

We also had some apps with our drinks. 
Apps: Spicy Tuna Roll, Yellowtail Seviche and Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos. 

For a Friday night, their sushi was clearly not very fresh. The spicy tuna was okay, the spicy sauce that was placed on top instead of mixed with the tuna hid whatever flavor the tuna had. I didn't like the yellowtail seviche, but my friend thought it was okay. I thought it was too bitter from the lime. The worse thing out of this whole experience were the yellowtail taquitos. The fish tasted spoiled. My friend was sick all night. It could've been the ridiculous amount of alcohol we consumed that night since we went to Dos Caminos later that night, but my friend says it was definitely the yellowtail taquitos... The drinks at Dos Caminos are so much better than Sushi Samba's... the mojitos are strong and freshly made and the glasses are 2x the size :P",1,0,1

The atmosphere resembles a club more than a high class restaurant.  It's filled with fast-paced dance music and most of the guests are dressed like they are ready for the club after dinner. 

The defining feature of the restaurant comes from its mixture of Japanese and Brazilian cuisine. Our server recommended the seviches and tiraditos; since we couldn't decide which one to get we ordered both! Seviches are sashimi served in a fruit\/salsa. We had tiger shrimp in a mango salsa and tuna with grapefruit and jalapenos. The sashimi was super fresh and I loved the fruit\/salsa combo.  It was sweet and refreshing. Tiraditos are sashimi immersed in a tangy sauce, probability the only dish I wasn't too fond of though.  The sauce was too sour and it overwhelmed the fish. 

If eating an endangered animal does not affect your conscience I would highly recommend the Chilean sea bass skewers. The fish was amazing, the meat practically flakes off on its own and the unagi sauce was so Umami! 

I saved the best for last. imagine eating all of the finest food: foie gras, caviar and gold?!?! all in one bite. Hurry to Sushisamba and order the Yamato roll.  At first the combination of those above ingredient wrapped in a tuna roll may seem excessive, but it absolutely worked.  It is the best roll I ever had.  The caviar and gold were subtle, but the foie gras, infused its smoky buttery flavor to an otherwise ordinary but fresh tuna roll, made it special. I would like to add, the foie gras was one of the finest I have ever eaten and it came from a SUSHI restaurant.

Try Sushisamba if you are in Vegas to get a delectable and unique sushi experience.",3,1,1

The waitress was a nightmare.  I've met used car salesmen who are less pushy.  She raved about the chef's special menu, which was $50 per person.  When we blanched at the price, she hinted that *maybe* she could ""work with us"" on a ""tasting"" menu at $30 per person.  For $30 I want more than a frickin ""taste"", I was an awesome meal that will fill me up.  We had to ask her three times, point-blank, if we could see a menu and order just from the menu.  She grudgingly brought ONE menu for the two vegetarians (of a bachelorette party of 12).  I had to ask the busboy for menus for the rest of us.  
When we ordered from the menu, she gave us a dire warning that the food came from 3 different kitchens and wouldn't arrive all at the same time.  She gave one last push for the tasting menu.  I would have walked out and complained to the manager if I hadn't been in a large party.  
I ended up paying $15 for edamame and rice.  It tasted good, and all the other dishes looked great - but definitely not worth the hassle and abuse. 
SushiSamba seriously needs to retrain their staff.  Focus on improving the customer's experience, not on cramming your own agenda down their throats.
UPDATE:  The General Manager contacted me to apologize, and has promised to discipline\/retrain the servers who have been the cause of the numerous bad reviews on Yelp.  Even with improved service, I still wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking to fill their bellies or get good value for their money.

After we browsed the extensive menu, the waiter recommended that we do a tasting menu, an easy option considering it was all of our first time here and we would get to try all of their most popular dishes, in a very balanced way -- so, appetizers, raw dishes, meats, etc. He said that he'd calculate it so that it would end up being about $50 per person. He also asked if anyone has dietary restrictions, which two ppl in our party of 7 did. Very considerate, accommodating and reasonable.

We started off with tempura string beans with truffle dip...wow that dip is a standout amongst all the dips I've had over the course of my life so far...haha. Not too heavy and very satisfying. I could smell the lovely whiffs of it before even dipping the tempura. The bachelorette who doesn't even normally like truffle really enjoyed this. It went so well with the tempura, which could not have been fried to more perfection. It wasn't oily or mushy or overly flaky. Light and crispy.

From there, we had dish after dish (tapas\/sharing style) that were just sometimes mindblowlingly good. The sea bass skewers is their most popular dish and yes, they're even better than I imagined. Perfectly seasoned and melt in your mouth texture. Just make sure you have space in your tummy for them because they were toward the latter end of our tasting menu, and by then, a couple of people were already really full!!

Even the two people who had modifications had dishes that looked and tasted just as great. One of them had a large dish of seafood coconut curry. Wow, filled with large mussels and clams and jumbo shrimp and squid. Superb. 

The end of the tasting menu was an entire large plate of sushi rolls. Some of them might look like your usual rolls, but try them and you'll immediately get that these are not your usual rolls when it comes to the taste and quality. So, so fresh. I really didn't think it would so immediately hit me how fresh the fish were, but wow it sure did! It makes such a difference, and this is beyond your usual fresh sushi at a nice Japanese restaurant. Sometimes I feel a bit squeamish after -- or even while -- eating raw fish, but not here. Even a simple salmon avocado roll, which I really did not expect much from (and was my last choice on the plate) was surprisingly so good -- that salmon really comes through. It's also notable that they don't put too much rice on the rolls, it makes such a difference. Again though, try to pace yourself through the meal or leave plenty of space beforehand, because we ended up having like, five pieces of rolls left on the table...which was really sad!!

Each of us also got a small complimentary lychee cocktail because of the special occasion. They came out on a gorgeous tree rack of sorts. Really lovely. I saw on Yelp that another bachelorette party had gotten complimentary ice cream mochi, but I'm thinking we got the drinks because the majority of us didn't order alcohol. Either way, a thoughtful gesture that was appreciated amongst the table.

I'll note that there were just a couple of moments of confusion about what our table was getting for the tasting menu, particularly when other servers (not our waiter) came over with dishes, but this was thankfully sorted out when he reappeared in time. We did end up with a bowl of edamame which was not part of the menu, but which he let us keep haha

The crowd is a mix of people, from large groups of friends to family gathering to bachelorette parties. The large party behind us was very rowdy, like heavy pounding on the table and shouting, and security had to eventually come over. The service staff handled the situation well, and it was impressive to see.

This meal was one of the highlights of my trip, and one of the best meals I've ever had. The fact that it averaged out to just under $50\/person (not counting drinks) was pretty unbelievable!",1,0,0

We had the Kobe beef, oysters, uni shoots, oyster shooters, albacore tacos, and some sushi. I usually eat more but sake really filled my stomach. Everything was scrumptious and I'm extremely picky when it comes to sushi. So far this is my go to sushi place when in Vegas :)",3,2,4

I'll have to admit that I was nervous when our knowledgeable and friendly server began talking about the three different kitchens, the different ways to order...it all sounded way too complicated. (To be honest, I just wanted to fill my stomach so that I'd be able to drink later!) Luckily, one of our friends is a Sushi Samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. 

I pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:
1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...
2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.
3) fresh oysters and jumbo shrimp: no explanations needed.
4) El Topo roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onions

I also would recommend getting a side of Peruvian corn (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how HUGE those kernels are! It's kind of ridiculous.

How would Brazilian food work well with Japanese food? I only love authentic Japanese food. I sure can have the typical combination, but I only see that as American Japanese food. 

Sometimes I feel like a restaurant that does fusion because it does not have a firm grip to do the real deal. 

But this place changed my mind. It earned my respect. I ordered some grill items, some sushi rolls, and some nigiri. The nigiri was done properly. The portion of rice and fish was proper. I enjoyed two of the sushi rolls: Yamato (tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar, gold leaf) and Rainbow Dragon (freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado). I know, the rainbow dragon roll sounds like a stable nowadays (like chicken teriyaki). But I was surprised by the use of mango in the roll. The mango gave that interesting bite to it. The Yamato roll was a surprise - I didn't expect foie gras would go so well with ahi tuna. But the gold leave was pointless (in my opinion) other than giving a bling bling (and charge extra expensive) for the roll. 

The seviches was just ok (i.e. within expectation). But the robata was good - we had fillet Mignon and lamb. We also had Japanese Kobe Beef (well, we were travelling at Vegas - so we just splurged on our food instead of spending it at the outlet). It was good. But I think it's overpriced. If you haven't had Japanese Kobe beef before, you don't have to try it at this place unless you are ready to spend some money or to celebrate your win at the casino. 

The decor has those typical hip restaurant vibe. The harajuku graffiti was a bit awkward to me but I guess most customers will think that's cool. But I wasn't impressed by the video that was played by the restaurant when I was there. We were there for an early dinner (to catch a show at the hotel). So we were there around 5:45. And the restaurant was playing some party video was not that respectful in my opinion. Pretty much you only see a brunch of people partying and dancing and showing their skins. (only a few step away from girls gone wild japanese party version). There were some close up of girls' legs and cleavage that kinda bothered me. 

Luckily, some customers requested to watch something else. It was the time about the bailout plan and eventually the large screen was showing news. 

So the party video took that star away. 

Although it's kinda dark in the restaurant, I saw a couple with two young kids having dinner as well. It's not necessary kids friendly but kids are welcome. 

But the food at this place was surprisingly good. So, it's worth to give a try. And if you are catching a show, the restaurant will make sure you will be able to make it. :)",0,0,0

If the food is any good this place is paradise! Anyway, I had to go exotic, so I ordered two appetizers (Carnaval= shrimp, avocado, yellowtail tartar, crispy rice paper and the Samba Strip = Maine lobster, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry) and a ""half"" main dish (Moqueca Mista = shrimp, squid, sea bass and crayfish with coconut milk, roasted cashew, dendê oil, chimichurri rice ... this is a very typical Brazilian dish)

The moment I started savoring the spices, the seafood, the dende oil... I was taken back to Bahia, incredible beaches, sea-breeze, mulatas in tiny bikinis... I had to snap back in order to continue my sensory trip to food nirvana.

Before they rate my review XXX and ban it from Yelp, I will summarize: just go, order without fear, enjoy the smells and tastes (and the view), go exotic, try ""positions"" you never dared before.

They take their sake way to seriously, all served cold unless you make them warm it up.  Honestly, sake is just not that good to begin with, cheap and warm is just fine.  Tried a $60 bottle that was highly recommended and found it mediocre at best.

Still, surrounded by a lot of sparkly skinny girls on a night out and men projecting their moneymaking abilities (or at least their fashion sense) we weren't unwelcome. 

We went twice, first on a Wednesday and then on Friday.  The Wednesday had a fairly respectable crowd while the Friday was pretty packed.  Wednesday had people mostly eating.  Friday had lots of people drinking, being seen, and eating.   The mall it's in was pretty quiet at night so these people walked away from the casino just to come here.  Must be pretty popular in Vegas right now, eh?

Anyway, service was fine for such a packed place.  We had a table on the curving banquette which places you pretty damn close to whoever's got the table next to you.  (People were moving tables in order to get in or out).  The table's small so it's a good thing this place seems to focus on a lot of small plates that come out at odd times.  Drinks came regularly and food came at a reasonable wait.  

We had the Wagyu ishiyaki (hot rock cooking at your table) which was sort of fun because with such a small table I imagine you might end up cooking your neighbor's elbow.  Wagyu robatayaki, eggplant robatayaki, tempura green beans, eel avocado hand roll, some kind of fries that were really sauced baby potatoes, and a bunch of drinks.

The kobe a8 marbled slices of beef cooked on a hot stone slab was a perfect touch.  The sauces provided on the side hurt the flavor a little for those who just crave the taste of marbled soft juicy beef.  I guess anyone that serves this kind of food would get raving reviews because it's just that good.

The sushi was okay, but the gold flakes on one of the rolls added a great effect.  The rolls were not much to speak about.

There's never been a reason for me not to write a review but since I've been actively writing format of my other jaunts I figured its about time to do it here!  

Anyway, I usually spend my time at the bar.   Personally I think it's the best place to sit back, enjoy great sake and have a fine meal while engaging with others.  Plus, I have absolutely NEVER experienced a moment of bad service in the two years and 15-20 times a year I've been to Samba.  Everyone behind the bar is always incredibly friendly, and though the faces change occasionally, it's always a pleasure to see the usual staff.  They always have a friendly smile and engaging conversation, obviously not for long as they have their work to do and other customers, but I see they treat everyone around the bar like family.  No wonder why I keep coming back!  

My last visit was Saturday March 2nd and I had a guest with me.  As always the service was outstanding and the ladies behind the bar went above and beyond to make our night special.  The food as always was fantastic!  We ordered the Kobe hot rock at the bar with thinly sliced Japanese A5 beef and cooking sauces, fun and entertaining tools your own special little treats.  We also hade surf and turf tacos as well as some amazing King Crab legs.  My date had a great time and we enjoyed a wonderful sake pairing with our meal and I enjoyed a great night of which I hold everyone working that night partially responsible. :)

Needless to say, I recommend Samba to anyone who wants to have a good time, good food, and great service!  Do what I do, sit at the bar, enjoy the people watching, and get to know your bartenders.  They are awesome!",0,0,0

For sushi we had Bobo Brazil roll with is kobe beef, the sushi samba roll with the lobster claw and the Lima roll with Spicy King Crab mix. Also if you want a good cocktail the Samba juice is really good!

They have a busy bar area to have some drinks, a nice sushi bar and a very lively atmosphere inside the restaurant.

The house music was great, the service was quite good, the drink selection wide and the food was excellent. As you would expect for a location in a 5-star Vegas strip hotel (The Palazzo), this is NOT your father's typical sushi restaurant . As our server informed us immediately, the food is a mix of cultures that is served from from one of three kitchens - as soon as it's ready.  That was just fine with us as we were quite hungry!

We found only two problem with this place (both of which could be fixed quite easily): 1) When one of us ordered a glass of cranberry juice, it came watered down. Our server was extremely apologetic and mentioned they called their supplier after they discovered our drink.  Apparently their mix delivery system was on the blink. 2) A bus person was very enthusiastic about picking up dishes... sometimes before we were finished.  We mentioned his need to refrain from this and he complied.

And then the food came only 15 minutes later. While I was eating, he never once came to ask me how it was going or whether I wanted anything else. 

I had to ask another waiter to get me some hot tea. The edamame was suspect, some pieces were downright mushy. The sushi was only so-so. I have had far better sushi, even at far cheaper restaurants. The sushi rice was not fully cooked and certainly poor in taste. The cloth napkin had a stale oily smell. And the miso soup was too salty. What a waste of money!!",0,0,0

Sushi Samba proved us wrong. After our experience there, I now see why they have restaurants in some of the biggest cities in the world. 

First of all they told us that we would have a 50 minute wait. As we were leaving to find another place, the hostess informed us that they could fit us at the counter. The ""counter"" is a raised area that looks out into the restaurant. I'm struggling to figure out how to describe it right now. It's a long table where everyone sits in a row- like a sushi counter- which overlooks the dining area. And you have to be very careful while sitting there. There's not much room and I doubt the people with spacious bench seats below us would appreciate a spilled drink. However, it was the perfect spot for people watching. 

Service was a little slow. Hence, the 4 stars. It took a while for us to get refills on our drinks. The server came over once without us having to wave her down. But food was amazing. I recommend the serviche and taraditos (especially the tuna). The duck breast robata was also amazing. Between the 3 of us, we tried quite a few dishes and we were quite happy with all of them.

The space is broken down into cool loops, so you can feel like you're in an intimate place, but take a look at the walls before you end up at a business meeting under the kabuki ""adult toy"" mural.  

I was there with a pretty large group, and I can understand that food may come out a bit slowly.  However, they lost drink orders, which is a cardinal sin for a place with a bar menu that is as big as it is.  The little bites were tasty, and the few bits of Brazillian food that we had were solid. Not amazing, as there are much better ways to do a Brazillian steakhouse kind of menu, but no complaints on that.

Decor - I love the vibrant colors and pictures they had all over the walls. It reminded me of Anime. 

Service - Excellent! Our waiter was very helpful and made many great suggestions. The food came quick as well even when the restaurant was full.

Food - Great presentation and absolutely flavorful! Nom nom nom! I didn't want to get full so I could eat some more!

Ordered:
Sea bass yakitori - This was our first dish to arrive and it definitely set the bar. The fish just melted off. It was cooked well and seasoned perfectly. The Peruvian corn that came with it was good as well. Very robust and large kernels. 

Yellowtail ceviche - AMAZING! The lime juice and other flavors blended so well together. This was my favorite dish along with the Sea bass yakitori. 

Tuna ceviche - The tuna was fresh tasting but wasn't as great as the yellowtail ceviche. Maybe I got spoiled but I thought the cherry tomatoes and almonds over powered the fish, which too me isn't a good thing because I love raw fish. 

Kanpachi sashimi - Nice sliced of fresh kanpachi and jalepeno. Wonderful dish. 

Neo Tokyo Roll - It was good but not great. Nothing much more to say about it. 

Shrimp Tempura - Very crisp and fresh. Lightly powdered shrimp. Didn't have too much tempura and was not soggy like other places. 

Signature Fruit cocktails - Strong but also fruity (meaning I could tast the FRESH fruit flavors). A good strong drink doesn't need to taste bad.

It seemed he had made an assumption that we weren't going to spend a lot or tip well, and that was pretty annoying.  

We didn't let him ruin our meal ...... but he could have done a lot to make it better.  I'd come back and give it a second shot, because the meal was THAT delicious.  Great fusion selections, really unique and fun food.",0,0,0

so we walked right up without a reservation and were seated immediately.  ordered 2 pieces of sake sashimi [salmon] at $4.50 each piece, they were pretty wimpy, somewhat thinly sliced measuring at about a measly 3 inches in length and 1 inch in height lol

we're used to something triple in size so we were not super disappointed knowing it was vegas and a super mod place on the strip.  but it was just okay.

only thing memorable was the Seared Kobe Beef ponzu geleé, warm japanese mushrooms, truffled tofu crema 18.00 drool truffle creme.  it was however much like carpaccio lol [beware of fancy names]

had the Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass roasted organic vegetables and oshinko 29.00 - overcooked and hardly any flavor.  also seemed like it was a bit cold at first bite.  we've had really good pan-asian fish at ""house"" in sf.

also had the Rainbow Dragon freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado 15.00 - it wasn't bad but wasn't a wow either.

overall experience was ok, but we won't be back.  the couple next to us complained about the portions for the price.  we knew going in it would cost more but we expected a bit more too.",1,1,1

There are so many reasons why we Iove coming here, and here are just a few of the reasons why:

I. FOOD
A. hamachi Kama!  Love this dish, it's my go-to dish for dinner.  Nicely grilled dish collar bone (Asians have a belief that the more movement in the muscle, the tastier the meat.  Fish collar bones are delicious because they are constantly blowing bubbles ;)

B. Robata (Japanese style charcoal BBQ)--anything cooked on that is good, from the mushrooms to the squid and the steaks...you can't go wrong! 

C. The drinks! Everything from the caipirinhas (classic & Acai) to the Prosecco flavored with elderflower liqueur and lychee purée--the bartenders here set a high standard unmatched by many. If you have a choice get your drink made by Yaz.  His drinks are golden--I will happily drink anything he makes.

SERVICE
The manager (Jeremy) recognizes us whenever we are there and we love that!  

One waitress in particular, Tanice, makes us feel extra special because after meeting our family once she remembers us!  Even if she is not waiting on our table she comes by to say hello.  How superb is that? The service is one of the many reasons why we tell everyone about this restaurant and also keep on coming back!

There are all kinds of amazing dishes for this Brazilian, Japanese, fusion restaurant.  Try the excellent Black Cod Miso dish and the classic chicken teriyaki for starters.

Keep in my this place should be dined at only for the experience and not to get full!

Food: 
1. Seaweed Appetizer: 
To my surprise when this appetizer was delivered to our table there were three different types. I still think that green jelly looking one taste the best. 

2. Huancaina Fries: 
This side dish was super tasty. The fries were actually baby potatoes dressed with a cream sauce and cheese. It was Mmm Mmm GOOD!.

3. Samba Strip roll: 
My friends and I initially chose this roll because we saw that there was lobster in it. With the roll also came a curry dipping sauce. Personally, I liked the roll by itself because the curry  sauce tasted kind of tart\/ sour. 

4. Rainbow Dragon roll: 
The usual dragon roll, nothing special.

5. Carnaval: 
This was my favorite of all the rolls. The contents of the rolls included: shrimp, avocado, yellowtail. A simple but tasty roll overall. 

Service: 
The waiter came by pretty frequently to refill our waters and ask if we needed anything.

I feel bad for servers that get overwhelmed by a busy dining room, but that wasn't the case here.

SushiSamba sounded like a really interesting fusion of Brazilian, Peruvian, and Japanese cuisine.

Inside I found a very lively, posh atmosphere. There was great music playing, giving it more of a club ambiance than that of a restaurant. I also liked the graffiti paint job on the walls. Our waitress was tremendous, and the manager came to check on us periodically too. They definitely aren't lacking in the service department. All in all, this was a really enjoyable place to eat dinner.

We decided to go tapas style and order a bunch of different things to try. My dinner companion didn't have any preferences, so I ordered two small plates (Seared Wagyu Beef and Salt and Pepper Squid), two kinds of Sashimi Tiradito (Kanpachi and Tuna), and two samba rolls (Samba Strip roll and Sasa Handroll).

Our small plates came out first. I was excited to try the Seared Wagyu Beef, which comes with a ponzu gelee, honshimeji mushrooms, and a truffled tofu crema. The meat was amazingly tender, and I liked the acidity of it all. Even the mushrooms were very flavorful. The Salt and Pepper Squid was also very good. It comes with dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, and smoked soy. This dish was definitely spicy. It was like calamari, but way better.

Next up was the sashimi tiradito. The Kanpachi (amberjack) comes with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil. It was absolutely packed with flavor, and I enjoyed the saltiness of it. The Tuna is served in a ceviche-style bath of Granny Smith apple, serrano peppers, and lime. It was beautifully sweet and spicy at the same time.

We were getting a little full, but we still had two samba rolls to go. The Samba Strip roll is a combination of Maine lobster, mango, tomato, crispy rice, soy paper, and peanut curry. I absolutely loved the mango in there, which paired nicely with the peanut. The Sasa Handroll was very different from what you might expect sushi to be. It comes with shrimp tempura, quinoa, shishito, cilantro, spicy mayonnaise, and red onion wrapped in some sort of cone. Our waitress suggested we get two, since it's not very conducive to sharing. I agree. The Sasa roll was a little difficult to eat, but well worth the effort. 

I didn't think we had waited very long for our dinner at all, but nonetheless the manager thought so, and to make up for it she brought over complimentary green tea sorbet pops for dessert. To put it mildly, they were amazing!

In fact, my soul asked me to eat twice here. I happily obliged. The first time we were only there for a quick snack and a drink, but the second time we actually ate a meal there, so I'll review the second time. 

I should give one caveat: I'm not particularly familiar with authentic Brazilian or Japanese food. That said, I found this fusion restaurant both intriguing and completely intoxicating. 

The waitress we had the first time was good, but I really remember our second waiter, Max. He was very attentive and gave fantastic recommendations, but wasn't pushy about it. Most importantly, you can tell he's actually EXCITED about the food. It made a huge difference, because seeing someone so excited to tell you about the ingredients, how the food is prepared, and what flavors are going on together really adds to a wonderful food experience, in my opinion. The waiter ended up recommending a $60 per person meal, a tasting menu of sorts. It sounds like a lot, but given the prices, it was really very fair considering the amount of food we got. As such, I'm not going to talk about every little thing, but more the highlights. 

The Peruvian Corn was addicting. It was a little closer to the hominy side of the corn spectrum, but it was buttery and had just a bit of texture. If it doesn't come as a side, I absolutely recommend trying it as a separate side dish. It DOES come as a side to the sea bass skewers, which I think were my single most favorite thing I tried there. It was buttery and delicious, and so flavorful in little bites. I wish I could describe it better than just ""flavorful,"" but I'm not even sure how to describe how delicious it was. I'll just say that while I was eating it, I hoped it would never stop (so inappropriate but I can't help it: that's what she said). 

Hamachi tacos and a plate of various sashimi were incredible. I liked the sashimi just a little more because the bold flavors of the sauces surprisingly married well with the fish flavor, without overpowering it. 

The most surprising part of the night: there was a sushi roll that included melted mozzerella. Yes. Mozzerella and salmon. I was SO skeptical of this one, and it took me a few tries to get used to it, but once I did, it was like a warm blanket. If you can push aside the weirdness, it's a good roll. 

Another piece of fabulosity we had was a yellowtail seviche (they do spell it with an ""s""). It was tangy but still let the other flavors show, and that is one of the items (along with the sea bass) I will absolutely order again next time I am in Vegas. 

Last, but certainly not least, the waiter concocted a duck hot-pot for us. I've not had much exposure to duck, and was weary of this one, but it was in a buttery sauce with lots of mushrooms, and it was incredibly silky and rich. Needless to say, after all this food, we were STUFFED!!! And of course, very happy. The manager came out to talk to us about the food as well, and I thought that was nice. 

I also tried the cucumber martini and the blackberry mojito. The mojito was good, but not particularly special. The cucumber martini, on the other hand, was light and refreshing and absolutely amazing.

Luckily we were able to find a bar side table which is full service. We had miso soup shared the Lima roll, Jalapeño roll & the Ahi Jalapeño Ceviche. The miso soup and rolls were great but felt the ceviche wasn't as good as we expected.  I also had a specialty drink recommended by our waiter which was very good and refreshing. Don't remember the name but it had grapefruit juice, gin and mint if I'm not mistaken. To end our meal, we shared the samba split which is a banana split that has caramelized bananas, candied popcorn, little pieces of flan, whipped cream and of course ice cream. 

Highly recommend this restaurant. The atmosphere is very upbeat and lively.",0,0,0

The ambiance is very contemporary with tons of lamps hanging from the ceiling. Lighting is minimal. 

Here's the breakdown of the food that I tried.

Tuna Tataki: Very good. Super fresh. I can't say it was the best that I have had but very close to it.

Rock Shrimp Tempura: This was an absolute favorite at the table. You have to try this! It's like tempura popcorn shrimp covered in a spicy alioli. 

Rio Grande three meats: All the meats were good. The dipping sauces made them fantastic. I wouldn't get this again though. Not really great for how much it is.

BoBo Brazil roll: Really good! Kobe beef on top....yum!

I came here with customers and coworkers who say they eat at Sushisamba whenever in Vegas. After dining here I fully understand this. 
First good point: a great selection of whiskeys including two of my favorites Hibiki and Yamazaki by Suntory. Not only that, they offer the aged versions. Now, I wasn't going to waste good Japanese whiskeys on unsuspecting Amerika-jin so Infirst ordered a miles blend that is less than $20 glass. Everyone loved that soninordered the 17y Hibiki ($60\/glass) for the group sample. Oh my!

One of my sales guys did the ordering so I can't swear to the names of the dishes we sampled. Some pictures are posted but if you look you will see that there are over 2000 photos posted at this restaurant!  

All the sushi and sashimi are not traditional. They come with sauces and toppings that give an appealing edge to the fishes. 

The staff is 1st class. I smoke with the manager several times. 1st I wanted to know how he gets Suntory whiskeys that I can't find in Houston anywhere. He said that this comes from his distributor but that he was already past his allocation for the year. Hmm, I would ship a case home on my next trip to Japan if not for the fear of my wife kicking my butty for spending $1000s on whisky. Oh I digress. 

Biiru o nomimasu ka?  This restaurant has a full selection of craft beers from Japan. Even a rice beer for those with gluten allergies that I need to find for my wife. 

Desserts looked great but we were so stuffed and full of drinks that we all passed.

My friend and I found the service average, the decor strange\/ugly, and the food interesting\/questionable.  It's supposed to be a Japanese\/Brazilian fusion place.  I can see this place being a real pleaser for people who are not familiar with authentic Japanese or Brazilian food.  Being Japanese with a sister-in-law from Brazil, I found myself qualified to test the food out.  I think the only dish I got that I found myself satisfied with was the edamame....but it's pretty much impossible to mess edamame up.  My 7 year old niece can make it blindfolded.  

I recognized that things might be bad from the start with the seaweed salad.  Wow was it awful.  Nice presentation but no flavor!!  It was so watered down that I couldn't even taste the seaweed itself.  I might as well have eaten gelatin with no flavoring.  It was THAT bad. 

I also got the red miso.  It was mixed with truffle oil and mushrooms.  I did not find the truffle oil mixed with the miso soup appetizing at all....the flavors just did not mesh for me.  

The sushi was a bit too fusion for me....I found the flavors to not really complement each other.  I did order regular tuna sashimi just to get something with no fusion and more Japanese authenticity....the tuna quality was excellent but WOAH overpriced!  $4.50 for ONE piece of sashimi.  It was good but not THAT good.  The ramen was ok...nothing to talk about later.  

As you can tell, we were not impressed.  We ordered an array of things expecting for something to blow us away, but we were disappointed.  $80 later, we headed home and looked for something on the way to satisfy our appetites.",5,5,1

We were staying at The Palazzo, and Sushi Samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  It was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  We had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  I wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (For management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6\/29.  You know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)

We ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  I had a Blame it on Rio, a caipirinha variation with cachaça, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalapeño.  It was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  The classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cachaça, lime, and sugar.  I also tried some of the Chu-Cumber, a shochu drink with Hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  At some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  They held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.

Dinner was delicious.  We had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  We specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  It was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  We left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  The cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of Japanese and Peruvian styles.

First, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  There was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and green bean tempura served with a rich black truffle aioli.  My favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  These were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  They were pretty irresistible.  Next we got a tray of Japanese A5 wagyu beef gyoza.  These were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  They came with kabocha pumpkin purée, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  The best thing I ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  The shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  The taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.

After the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  I do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  The rolls were great, a nice mix of California standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more Samba-specific stuff, with the stray crab leg and lobster claw.  I particularly liked the Samba Strip, with Maine lobster tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  It was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  The rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  The sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  It was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers I had were great.

The most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  We got two hefty platters of the Rio Grande with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  These were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  They came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  We also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of roasted vegetables - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  We also got miso-marinated Chilean sea bass a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  This was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.

We were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  The lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  We each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.

In conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  Sushi Samba was an A+ choice, worthy of a night I won't soon forget.",9,8,7

Host walked us to the bar (didn't just point and direct). When we sat down, immediately visited by our server to take our drink order and tell us about some specials. The food came fast, surprising us because it was peak hours!

Even more was when I tried to wave down our server to order an additional plate, she didn't see us, and the manager (young guy in a suit) came to us within seconds and asked what he could do, he took the order without hesitating (instead of just saying he will call the server over).

We had the spicy edamame, beef dumplings, Chilean sea bass, and samba split. ALL came out within minutes, presented beautifully (can check out the photos) and tasted even better than they looked!

hits: side dish - corn. to die for! this is absolutely fantastic. salmon jalapeno mozzarella crispy onion roll had very interesting flavor. 

misses: ceviche. we tried the $35 - 4 ceviche tasting. a couple of them (yellow-tail and tuna) were decent but the other two were too sweet and didn't have refreshing ceviche flavor. we also tried tuna roll which was recommended by the waiter and every other table ordered it, but it was nothing special. it simply tasted like the typical tuna roll.

Being a girls weekend away from home, we started off with their cocktail tree which is $70, but totally worth it! Then we ordered Otsumami which is an assortment of edamame, green bean tempura, and shishito which was really good. Their aioli sauce had a hint of truffles and a strong garlic taste but wasn't too over powering and made it really good with the green bean tempura.

After that we had the Rock Shrimp Tempura that had bibb lettuce, tobanjan alioli, black truffle vinaigrette and in my opinion was only average. For my entree I had the Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass and that was really, really good. Very moist, tender, juicy and not fishy at all. It's everything you could wish your fish to be. The portion was a little small, but it was oh, so good!! I also had the Samba strip Roll which had maine lobster, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry and i thought it was alright. But for the price and how much lobster they gave us, it was really worth it.  the last thing i had was their Neo Tokyo roll that had yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca, which is also really good. 

My overall experience was only a 3 stars because they said they were really busy that night (but didn't look that way to me because there were at least 5 empty tables in front of us) and they sat us in a corner and our waiter was a complete douche and couldn't get our order right nor could he remember what we ordered and came back on several occasions to reconfirm what we ordered. The manager there was also dumb and tried to help out only to make things worse because he asked us what we wanted to drink and didn't even bring our drinks and completely forgot about us.

We split a combination platter and two rolls. I can't remember exactly which rolls we got, but one roll had pear in it. I would never have imagined utilizing pear in a sushi roll, but it was a perfect compliment to the raw fish.

That experience pretty much sums up sushisamba: a contemporary take on sushi rolls. Innovated flavor combinations and fresh fish!

In typical Vegas fashion, the interior is beautifully done and sets it apart from your ordinary sushi joint.

The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  

To be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would ""incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes""--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue ""fighting"".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. 

If this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. 

In short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.",1,1,1

Came here with my sister for a convention in Vegas, we walked around the Venetian and Pallazzo for a while until we finally decided on SushiSamba.  First of all, the restaurant is beautiful. I really love the wall painings, interior design, and the bathroom design was really cool as well. Service here was excellent, my water was always full, when I got up to use the restroom I placed my napkin on the table, when I came back it was neatly folded back for me. 

We decided to get two appetizers. First the Rock Shrimp Tempura... Really no point in ordering this. Tempura taste the same everywhere, nothing special about theirs. We also tried the taquitos as suggested by the waitress. These were really just mini taco's. Main Lobster and Yellowtail. Both were nice and chilled taco's. Good sauce on the side. Not sure if I'd order them again, but they were decent.

For dinner my sister ordered their Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass. This was absolutely excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly, it was so soft and delicious. It's served with vegetables and those were pretty good too. Possibly the post Chilean Sea Bass I've ever had. 

For my dinner I decided to order two rolls, the Neo Tokyo and the BoBo Brazil. The Neo Tokyo, which is bigeye tuna and tempura flake was delicious. The little sauce on top was a nice spicy sauce. This roll was very delicious. As for the BoBo Brazil.... Quite gross, too much avocado, wayyy too much in fact, in overpowered the entire roll. Both regular avocado and some mushy avocado. In addition the red onion also gave it some very odd taste. This was one of the worst sushi rolls I have ever eaten.

For dessert we ordered the Samba split for two. It was really good, and a decent sized portion. Everything on the plate complemented each other and the banana brulee was fantastic.",0,0,1

Located on the second floor of the Palazzo Hotel, this place takes sushi to a whole new level. It was my last day in Vegas and decided to try it out with some company for lunch. The atmosphere was quite enjoyable! Loved the ambiance. The only bad thing I would have to mention is the lack of service, though it could have been due to the World Cup Finals contributing to the poor service. Nevertheless, this place has DELICIOUS sushi.

I am friends with the Managers at the SouthBeach Location so when i went to go hang out with a friend in Sin City i decided to pull rank and get some First Class service knowing full well i was gonna lose money on the tables. 
Yeah i lost money but wasnt disappointed one bit at the Sushisamba location at the Palazzo Hotel. I will avoid mentioning having to drop a former friend from ruining my dinner right b4 it started but as soon as i got to the location which i must say is unbelievable and by far is the best designed Sushisamba, A close second will be the now defunct location in Dallas at the Galleria mall. I felt like a kid when i entered the restrooms. I had a nice corner to myself and the Hostess was kind enuff to keep me company since i got jilted by a former friend (which i refuse to talk about).  
I got Ala carte type service and even the Chef, Jose came out to greet me and making me feel special cos he remembered me from the Southbeach spot. The taquitos were incredible i had the yellow tail and the lobster one. I decided i was only going to do small plates so i ventured to the Anticuchos and ordered the Chicken liver which just melted in my mouth and made Vegas worthwhile and followed by the Chilean Sea bass that the hostess recommended. For my drink i always get their Caiprinha which is like a Brazilian mojito and was on point.

Now i was getting full but the Chef surprised me with a Kobe Beef plate which was Sushi grade and once again splendid and lest i forget i also ordered the Peruvian corn for my side which is ridiculously tasty. 

There were several groups in town for Bachelors parties and partying in General and the decor just made the groups blend in and make it very private.

I've been to a lot of top notch sushi restaurants, and this was probably the most unique concept with Japanese\/Brazilian\/Peruvian inspired dishes. 

With a group of 7 with a variety of tastes, likes and dislikes, one of the best things Sushi Samba does is offer a chef's selection of 3 or 4 courses based on (A) how much each person wants to spend (we chose $40\/person) and (B) what each person likes, dislikes, is allergic to, etc. and (C) how many courses (we did 3).

We didn't know what to expect, but the first course\/starters came out and there was a piece of each starter for each person (don't you hate when there is an odd number?!) and the girl who likes chicken over fish got a steak skewer instead of raw tuna. The second course included this fabulous Peruvian grilled and butter sauteed corn that I am seriously in love with. Each kernel is the size of your index fingernail, sweet and lightly grilled for a slight chewy texture. Where can I find this at my local grocer or farmers market?! The third course included a variety of sushi including non-fish, non-raw rolls for the non-fish eaters in our group. 

We were a hungry bunch and left very happy. Bring your appetite because the portions are nice. Service was 5 stars with attentive staff start to finish. Our server came by regularly to check-in, the staff orchestrated plate and settings changes after each course, and we even got a complimentary strawberry vodka drink on the house.",2,1,1

Located inside the Palazzo Hotel, my husband and I came by here last Friday for the happy hour around 5:20 pm for a light meal before heading out for a night on the town. There were plenty of seats available at the bar and so we just sat ourselves. We were immediately greeted by a friendly bartender (unfortunately I do not remember his name) who took good care of us during our dining experience. We ended up ordering:

Classic Mojito, $6 prior to tax- I like mojitos because of that mint flavor. Unfortunately this mojito was missing sugar and had a bitter taste. I probably wouldn't order this again, but I finished this drink anyway (why would I waste perfectly good alcohol?).

Kirin, $5 prior to tax- I am not a beer lover, but my husband liked his drink. 

Salt & Pepper Squid, $6 prior to tax- This salt and pepper squid had a nice salted flavor and the squid had a nice easy chew. 

Wagyu Gyoza, (with kabocha puree & su- shoyo dipping sauce) $6 prior to tax- Our bartender recommended we try this because these dumplings are made of wagyu beef. The beef was tender and flavorful but unfortunately this little dish came with only 3. Loved the kabocha puree and wished I had more of it. It was really nice of a bit of savory sweetness to these small dumplings. 

Spicy Tuna Roll, $6 prior to tax- Fresh tasting, really liked the sauce on top of each piece of spicy tuna. 

Yellowtail Scallion roll, $11 prior to tax- So simple, yet very fresh tasting and absolutely delicious. 

Amazonia, $6 prior to tax- This roll is very vegetarian (and vegan) friendly and rather unique. When I read the description (Swiss chard, portobello mushroom, takuwam, cucumber, avocado, wasabi- onion soy) I thought I would order it just to see how it would taste. And I am glad I did because it ended up being one of my favorites of what we ordered. Each roll is covered in Swiss chard, filled with all of the ingredients listed on the menu. 
--------------------------
(Total=$46 prior to tax)

The bartender that was the main person who took care of our orders and such was quite friendly. He is from Hawaii and so we were talking with him the whole time about that. It has been a while since my husband and I have been to both Oahu and the Big Island and so it was nice to talk about the surf and the amazing restaurants there. 

Somewhere in our conversation, he had asked what brought us here to Las Vegas and I told him that we were celebrating my birthday early. And so towards the end of meal, he made both of us a special complementary drink for my birthday. This drink was pretty strong and rather enjoyable. It had a nice light flavor of cucumber, ginger and lemon. This bartender did not have to go that extra mile to really start our evening just that extra special, but he did. And because of this bartender, I will make sure to come back to Sushi Samba again on our next visit to Las Vegas.",5,3,4

Went to this restaurant with a few girlfriends on a trip to Vegas. SUPER Excited to enjoy a great sushi meal with people that LOVE sushi. Instead we were greeted by a server, name to be disclosed, who was degrading, rude, and treated us like cheap girls. 

One of our friends requested for a carafe of hot sake and this server immediately said that this restaurant was too high class to have any sort of hot sake. Who was this guy? How does he not know that we're just girls who enjoy drinking hot sake from time to time-this server needs to learn some MAJOR restaurant etiquette! As the night progressed, the service did not get any better. I've been to MANY wonderful restaurants in Vegas where the food was great and the service EVEN better and this restaurant definitely put the standard of Vegas restaurants in the low range. Fortunately the manager hooked my friends and i with some shots that were delicious - one of them included cucumber and was fresh and cool to the taste. 

On the positive note, the food was ridiculously delicious (hoping there wasn't any extra protein hidden in it). The Sashimi dishes with granny apple sauce and another with some sort of lemon grass sauce was soo good! The Chilean Sea Bass was delectable and probably the best dish on the menu.

This most recent trip, we were a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. We had lucked out by getting reservations the day of and they didn't make us wait. I thought they seated us in a weird spot...but no, our reservations were just so early, the place wasn't that full, but the table ended up being fine.

We decided to do the omakase style for around $50\/person. They brought out the cocktail tree with 9 glasses of the Samba Juice which was incredible and such a great way for them to start wooing us, haha. 
- First course: fried green beans with truffle aioli (my fave!), grilled jalepenos (big hit!), and edamame.
- Second course: Fish tacquitos (loved the shell, very crispy), a mushroom tacquito & large salad for the vegetarian, and pork pot stickers (good not great). 
- Third course: the famed Chilean Sea Bass skewers (melt.in.your.mouth), scallops with like a chimichurri sauce (delicious), and the Peruvian corn (so unique). 
- Fourth course: Meat\/mushroom coconut milk ""curry"" (I hate coconut milk, and this was the one dish that we didn't make a considerable dent in...and they don't serve rice with this! Weird).
- Fifth course: Sushi. There were 3 different fish sushi rolls (salmon, tuna, and something else) and then 3 vegetarian (avocado, cucumber, and sweet potato--sweet potato was my fave!). They then brought out the dessert for my friend, which was comp'd which was nice.

In my opinion, I felt like the chef prepared way too many fish dishes for this particular group because we had a vegetarian, we had someone who was allergic to shellfish, and we had 3 people who didn't like fish...and yet, we got A LOT of fish. I think a lot of people go to SushiSamba and expect sushi...but it's fushion, it's not traditional sushi. I would definitely recommend doing the omakase style to start out--you can do it for $30-$75 per person and it's really fun. I rate it 4 stars because I think they should be more creative for vegetarians--vegetarians eat more than mushrooms :) But the service is GREAT and the food is amazing.

Tempura fried green beans with truffled aioli and crispy yellow tail taquitos were bright memorable flavors. The pacific roll was decent but not worth the price you pay for. The salt and pepper squid was a let down since they use squid strips, which were thick and chewy. 

Service: Friendly and down to earth. However our server failed to mention a tasting menu to us when other servers had mentioned it to nearby customers. Perhaps a bit of stereotyping?

Ambience: SushiSamba kills it on ambience. Japanese street art and whimsy decor fill the dining area. Its hip and urban and I love it. Their seating arrangements left something to be desired though. I sat centimeters away from guests on opposite sides of me. A bit claustrophobic. 

Verdict: With some standout as well as some strikeout dishes, SushiSamba is that kind of place that's great to share a few Japanese inspired tapas before a drunken night out on the strip.",0,0,0

I liked how clean the food tasted (except the ramen) and I didn't feel heavy or greasy after.  Just content and happy!

The one thing that this place is lacking is customer service. I felt like the entire staff had this ""Entitled - I'm better than you attitude"" -- which I'm sorry, doesn't really fly when you work in the service industry. 

We were a large party, with a very large bill - it was a special occasion, and there were several rounds of drinks, plus we ordered (at least) one of everything off the happy hour menu prior to be seated for a full dinner. Our male bartender was incredibly rude, and seemed very inconvenienced with our parties orders. If one person ordered a drink, he made it a point to interrupt every conversation between others to see if anyone else needed another drink, even if their glass was full. At one point my brother in law ordered a drink, and about 5-10 minutes later my husband ordered a different drink and the bartender very obviously rolled his eyes, kind of flailed his arms and huffed that he had just asked if he needed anything.

One of the roll my fiance and I got had charboiled steak on it, which made the whole roll taste like charcoal.

But, the great news is, they DO have delicious vegetarian options! I quit drinking and even their mocktails were mouthwatering! I had the Watermelon Mojo and really felt like having no alcohol was a-ok! It was so sweet and so watermelon-y. They could have just kept filling my glass up, but thinking about the sugar content gave me pause. So, I had one. It was all I needed to know that their mocktails are FAB!

For appetizers we ordered the otsumami. It was good a combination of edamame, green bean tempura and shishito and I couldn't stop eating it! Really perfect size for a group (unless you have someone like me who hoards it for themselves, then, problems). The green beans were like never ending. I put one in my mouth and then another and another, breaking every now and again for the shishito, which is sweet (but spicy) peppers. Man, I could have eaten that for days. 

This time we just ordered two rolls. Because one wasn't vegetarian I didn't partake, but as with all things SUSHISAMBA, it looked delicious! The other was the veggie kun and it was really great. The flavors blended nicely (there are a lot of ingredients in this roll) and sort of melted in my mouth. I would highly recommend. I also wish they had more vegetarian options, though this was plenty at the time.

This is my second time here, the first time I had the Yamato roll. HOLY. I was a huge fan of foie gras at the time and to have that on a roll was so decadently delicious that it, right then and there, became my favorite sushi roll ever. I won't ever forget that, ever.

Three different cuisines all beautifully merged to make an incredibly diverse menu, including sushi, tempura, ceviches, soups and noodles, robata meats, churrasco meats and more.

We sat down, looked at the menu and couldn't decide where to start...there's soo many options. So when the waiter came by and offered to create a custom menu with a few dishes from each cuisine for about 50 bucks a head we were SOLD!

We had the:
Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos: served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime 
Neo Tokyo: bigeye tuna, tempura flake, aji panca 
Sashimi: Salmon and Tuna
Berkshire Pork Gyoza kabocha pumpkin purée and su-shoyu dipping sauce
Rib Eye Antichuchos: aji panca with Peruvian corn
Sea Bass Antichuchos: miso with Peruvian corn
El Topo: salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion

All the dishes were absolutely delicious! But if I had to pick, the Yellowtail Taquitos and the two antichuchos would be at the top of my list, hands down...the beef antichucho was melt in your mouth, like buttahhh....and the sweet miso glaze on the sea bass was perfection! The El Topo is one of their signature rolls and it's pretty good but a bit on the heavy side from all the mozarella, in my opinion...

The service was extraordinary. The waiters and busboys were hanging on us hand and foot, promptly clearing dishes, constantly replacing utensils, plates, and refilling drinks. For me, the service takes this place from a 4 to a solid 5!

The best in my opinion since I'm a huge meat eater was the 5 meat combo platter, they came with sausage, pork, steak. My favorite was definitely the steak!

And by ""good"" I mean un-fucking-believable. Yea, I said it. Unreal. Never have I wanted to pick up and move to Vegas so much in all of my life, but I'm thinking about it after the dinner I had at Sushisamba's new ultra lounge, Sugarcane. This is an incredible statement for me because for one, I can only take Vegas in small doses, and two, I despise the heat. So having said that you can believe me when I say that I love absolutely everything about Sushisamba, the Brazilian\/Peruvian\/Japanese fusion restaurant at the Palazzo. 

Where do I begin?

Oh yes, Holy Mary Mother of God, I've died and gone to heaven...

A friend of mine is the Publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, Sugarcane. She hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. Upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. As we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the DJ booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of Sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. I""m gonna do my best to do it justice but I would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...

The walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of Samurais and Japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. The DJ that night was Claudio who I wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. There are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. 

The food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. Our waiter Anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. Of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so I guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. Our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (I forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. We ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. 

Our table decided to order the signature Sushisamba 7-course Omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. Anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. Our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the Kobe beef carpaccio with wild mushrooms, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was AMAZING! Next up was the best snow crab I have ever tasted, filet mignon, duck, Chilan Sea Bass (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (I forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate I've ever seen\/tasted. Just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. A stand out roll was the Kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what I can remember) a spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado center. As we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, Anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with Japanese-style sesame rice krispies, Japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. There were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caramel topping. 

Do you see what I'm talking about?????

Here's the rundown....

Party of four:
First round of cocktails (on the house)
Several cocktails to follow
Bottle of premium sake
7- course Omakase dinner for four ($70 each)
After dinner cocktails
Divine dessert platter

Total bill: Approx $600

Not bad I'd say. Not bad at all. 

All in all, I plan to go back to visit several times over. Anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. This dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl.

Food was phenomenal the first time I was there  (July 2009) 
We did the omokase style dining and my hubs and I were simply enchanted with the whole visit.  We were raving about the food, the service, the ambience- it was great!  But my 2nd time there was horrible.

Here's a summary (on a scale of 5)

Wait staff- 3
Food quality- 5
Wait time- 0
Management- 0

We had a party of 12 and were there for a total of 4 hours.  The wait staf was nice (Issaac) but I guess too overwhelmed to be attentive. (Even though they did charge the 20% gratuity)

Food was delicious but SUPER slow.  I have no idea what was going on with the cooks, but management should've taken some responsibility and put us at ease somewhere between the 4 hours of our visit.

Our waiter brought us a round of shots to make up for the wait I suppose.  Nice, but NOT nice to have it thrown in your face as if a favor was made. The manager did this???

We were brought a total of 3 different checks because they kept screwing up.  This made us doubt that they were being fair in the way they were charging us- and we were right.  There were items on the bill that were not brought to our table. SHAME ON U!

We tried to relay our disatisfaction to ""Brian"" one of the managers, but he came at us with a complete bad attitude.  He ASSUMED that we were trying to get a free meal, when all we really wanted was for him to take some responsibility and admit that they SUCKED!

I might return- but probably not with a large party.",3,0,0

But I have to be honest...for sushi I was very disappointed with the serving sizes. I mean this is Vegas...so I expect a generous amount especially for $15 a roll on average and I was not comfortable paying that much for a roll that I think is worth $7 at best at any other sushi restaurant. 

My suggestion would be to pass on this place. I mean you're paying for an experience, and I guess I didn't get what I paid for.",1,0,0

The service was excellent. Our waiter was willing to explain the menu if we had any questions.

I went with two small plates he recommended - the Salt & Pepper Squid and the Berkshire Pork Gyoza - and enjoyed both so much! I had only ever had squid in calamari form, so it was nice to have such fleshy dipping pieces, and the dipping sauces were tasty, one had a little heat to it - yum! 
And the Gyoza - should be called Pork Wowza!! Because it is hands-down, one of the most delicious things I've ever had the pleasure of eating! It was pork filled seared dumplings sitting on pumpkin puree, drizzled and served with a side of sweet soy sauce - ohmygoshdelicious - Highly Recommend this dish for newbies like myself or to anyone who likes yummy stuff!
My friend had the Mushroom Toban-Yaki and added a filet mignon on top for an additional charge, and the waiter communicated thoroughly with the chef to make sure it was all gluten-free (she also could have the squid, just not the sauces.) I didn't try hers, but she said it was delicious, as well!

I usually love SushiSamba and make a point to eat there every time I go to Vegas. This time, I was extremely disappointed.

I ordered 2 Rio Grandes to go since I had to catch a flight and the folks back home love the Rio Grande. Unfortunately, part of my order was missing, even after I questioned it.

On the bill, the Rio Grande was listed as Gaucho, so I asked about this and they assured me that it was the same. Since I usually have a great meal and the service is usually good, I didn't question it. The Rio Grande is 45 dollars on the menu, so I expected to be charged 90 for both. However, for those two items, it was listed as $114. I also ordered 2 sides. 

I didn't bring it up because I usually love SushiSamba and wouldn't mind paying more to support the restaurant. I also ordered a cocktail and the Wagyu appetizer while waiting, so my bill was a bit hefty. On top of this, I included roughly a 20 percent so my total bill was about 190 - after I was reassured that my order was correct. I didn't have time to look through the bag because I needed to catch a flight, but once I got to the airport, I found out that the Chorizo and the ribeye steak was not included (usually the Rio Grande comes with those two proteins and the picanha, but my order only had the Picanha, the two sides I ordered.

You can imagine my frustration. When I takeout from a restaurant, especially one that I frequent, I expect my order to be correct. I honestly regret tipping so much and even ordering takeout from there today.

I would give 1 star for this experience. The extra star is because I usually do have a positive experience (with Philip, who is the best server in the world and has great service).

I don't think I will come back here ever again. Something amazing would have to happen for me to give this place a second chance.",0,0,0

I thought it was in for a LOT of complaining when I walked in with my parents to a darkened atmosphere and loud music, but the food was so tasty that it made up for my parent's initial discomfort. 
**There is back room area with plenty of seating that looks much quieter, so if you're looking to enjoy a more peaceful evening, definitely request to be seated in the back room! 

[NO RESERVATIONS NEEDED]
We were seated immediately despite having no reservations and coming during one of the busiest weeks (with 5 trade shows going on). 

[FOOD]
THIS IS NOT A DRILL. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO!! GET THE MISO SEA BASS (in the Robata section) WITH PERUVIAN CORN. It was, hands down, the best thing we ordered all night. The Sea Bass was lightly glazed with miso, and then literally LITERALLY perfectly cooked to provide just the right amount of tender smoothness. It is truly magical how they have perfected cooking fish on a stick in a fire - but they've done it, and my emphatic description of the Sea Bass will hopefully convince you to try it as well! The accompanying Peruvian Corn was a fun side snack, providing lots of (good) chewiness and consistency - putting regular ol' American corn to shame. 

Seared Wagyu Beef was good and quite flavorful; if you like the taste of truffles, you'll be happy with the truffle cream that complements the dish! 

Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallops were just alright in my opinion. LOTS of bold flavor, but I think the shiso buttery flavor of the dish overpowered the natural sweetness that scallops are blessed with. I normally loveeeee scallops to an insane degree, but these were not my favorite (mainly because I could barely taste the scallop-y ness of it). 

Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos - tacos for the munching! You really can't go wrong when you put fresh yellowtail + fresh avocados into a crunchy home + add in some housemade hot sauce! Easily a safe and tasty dish! 

Salmon Ceviche was GOOOD! Super fresh and a fun ponzu party in your mouth! 

Kanpachi was a miss for it - it was OVERWHELMINGLY sour and had us wincing in its yuzu strength. PASS! 

São Paulo roll was a nice addition to get carbs on the table. Everything tasted fresh - the only downside is that there are only 2 pieces of scallop, 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 pieces of salmon, 2 pieces of whitefish - so the description is a bit misleading. You don't get everything in each roll - all the delicious seafoody friends are distributed across the roll. 

El Topo was a surprise hit! Being a somewhat sushi snob, I try not to mix CHEESE with my sushi, but it was actually really good - especially when the ooey gooey cheese was luxuriously melted onto the salmon. Alright fine - I guess this is one fusion dish I am totally fine getting behind!

They do so much in the kitchen, that when you try so much, it's tough to enjoy everything because there are a vast variety of flavors.

All mini glasses of their specialty cocktails. So awesome! There were four of us and they brought us a total of 3 towers, so we each got to try 6 different flavors. Loved it so much. The variety was just amazing. I'd have to say my top 3 favorites were the Chu-cumber (cucumber flavored one), the lemon samurai, and pisco sour (I have visited Peru before so I've had the opportunity to try an authentic version of this before). So so great!

All the meals brought out for us to share were fantastic! The Peruvian corn was different a cool blend of flavors to add to our palette. The Alaskan king crab legs were perfection!

I don't remember our server's name, but he was very attentive, patient and focused on providing the best possible experience. We had a vegetarian in our group, and he was kind enough to tell us about the vegetarian options and even provide a vegan menu for us to explore. My only quip would be the restaurant's ""set your own price & we'll customize the menu "" option - when we heard about it, we were immediately enthusiastic and decided to set a $25 per head price. Unfortunately the server told us that the restaurant wanted a $50 per head minimum for that option... seems a little strange to me. 

We ended up ordering off the a la carte menu, which was fantastic. We opted for:

Seared Ahi Tuna Tataki: YUM! Each slice of seared ahi tuna was served atop a spinach leave and with a delightful sauce. Absolutely delicious. I could have made a meal out of this dish alone (if I didn't have to share...hehe).

Otsumami - Blistered Shishito Peppers, Edamame and Green Bean Tempura: We originally planned to order a standard edamame bowl, but we followed our server's recommendation to order this instead. SO glad we did! The dish was a perfect portion for 5 hungry people. A few in our group hadn't tried shishito peppers before, so they were absolutely wowed. The tempura was decent - not mindblowing by any standards, but definitely not oily or soggy like some other tempura variations.

Lima Roll: This roll was fantastic. I like tempura shrimp when it's not in sushi, and this roll definitely changed my mind on that - it was absolutely delicious.

Amazonia Roll: Our vegetarian friend LOVED this roll. It's wonderful that SUSHISAMBA has this option, since the traditional avocado, sweet potato and cucumber rolls can get a little boring for our herbivore friends.

Sao Paolo Roll: My personal favorite! Extremely delicious. Such an amazing combination of flavors and textures. 

Somehow, we all had room for dessert and opted for the Mango Tres Leites cake. It was served with a dollop of mango ice cream and a matcha green tea dipping sauce. Overall, a truly delicious end to a fantastic meal. I can't wait to visit the SUSHISAMBA in New York!",2,2,2

I wish I got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend's bachelorette reserved dinner on a Saturday night a week ago.
We got the run down quickly on doing their style of ""omakase"" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. We gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40.
Now, I was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so I was expecting the same good service and food. So I discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the Miso Sea Bass skewers. She happily replied, ""I gotchu girl!"" 
We were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. And one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn't.  
After the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers.
- Otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :)
- Pork Gyozas (ok)
- Rock Shrimp Tempura (wasn't as succulent or saucy but still good)

Our waters were always filled. Thank you water guy!

Then after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the El Topo roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. It was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. This is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!

We were having our fill and we were on schedule. Then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! Also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  We had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. She lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36\/person (plus tax+tip $45).

Come to find out, you can't just order a large hot sake like every other Japanese restaurant in America.  He explains to me I need to buy a bottle (Various sizes, all big bucks).  I can see where this is going, and just tell him we will stick with the beer.  I'm not paying $37.00 for a small bottle of sake.

$6.00 per piece.  
I ordered (4) pieces, $24.00.  Fresh, yes.  Worth it, no!

I ordered one Spicy Tuna roll, $12.00.  It was small, and well chilled.  Even the rice.  Sushi rice should be warm.  My guess is that it was pre-made and refrigerated.

I decide to go with (2) large plates.
MISO-MARINATED CHILEAN SEA BASS roasted organic vegetables and oshinko $29
CHICKEN TERIYAKI-SAMBA STYLE organic chicken, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, crispy onion $26.

The Miso Cod was good.  The Chicken was okay at best.  Purple potato mash was weird.  Neither dish came with rice.  Disappointing.

The hostess tries seating another couple at the same small table she tried to seat us at and they tell her they want a booth too.  

Across from us is a booth with a small Asian man with two women, a blond and a brunette.  High end escorts I presume.  I guess the booths are reserved for that clientele.

He drops the bill, and I see there's a $7.00 charge for the Edamame.  I point out to him we didn't order it, he brought it out with the water.  Confused, he said ""Well, you ate it"".  Yes, that's true.  Since you brought it out with the water, we just figured it was like bringing out some bread.  Neither of us requested this.  Just a guess, but I think they must do this to people all the time.  

He had enough of us, and us of him.  He took off the Edamame, we paid the bill, left exactly 15%, and left.  We would never return to this restaurant nor would I recommend to friend or foe.

In the course of our three day stay, this was the only negative experience we encountered at the Palazzo.  What a shame, it was our last night.",7,2,2

Came here for a bachelorette party dinner and we did the tasting menu for about $75 per person with tax and tip in the end.  

The tasting menu allowed us to try a variety of dishes but a lot of them too!  So much that in the end, I was too full to finish my portion!

I thought the service here was more than awesome! Before they started to bring out the food, they went around to ask about people's allergies and who doesn't like sushi and things like that.  After getting it all down, they proceeded to bring out food.  If they were to bring out something that had something that someone was allergic to, then that person would get a substituted dish!  I thought that was pretty awesome!

We got so many that I can't remember them all but I'll list out the ones I do remember!

Tuna tartar -delish!
scallops - double delish!
sashimi - delish delish!
sea bass - the best of the night! delish delish delisssh!

We ordered the lemon samurai and Nina fresh as cocktails and wagyu gyoza as an appetizer. The Gyoza was so good we ordered a second set. I got a teriyaki chicken and my girlfriend  had the Chilean sea bass. 

The nina fresa was sweet, mellow and complex with a guava juice base and a tang of strawberry. The samurai was sharp, with a nice kick.

The gyoza, like I said, was so good we ordered two. It was tender and done medium. It came with a squash puree and a dipping sauce, which added the sweetness to it.

The sea bass was ridiculously juicy, the vegetables fresh and well grilled, and the sauce very savory. My girlfriend said it was the best fish dish she ever had.

My chicken was remarkable. The meat was juicy and tender, the skin crisp. The teriyaki sauce was made in house and had a spicy aftertaste. It came with crispy onions which accentuated the crispy skin. Everything was on top of purple mash potatoes, not greatly different from traditional mash, but with an aji Amarillo sauce, which was like a mix between squash puree and salty broth.

A lot of things were really heavy, so we decided that sushi was a safe bet. Not knowing anything about that place, we went there sort of on a limb.

I went there on a quiet day at an unconventional time (prob around 3PM), so it wasn't bustling with people and loud chattering. There were probably at most about 5 other tables that were occupied with diners. It's dim-lit and all the interior designing seemed to fit a sort of cool, mellow, and dark color scheme. Very relaxing..

Our waitress was a very nice girl. She was knowledgeable, very attentive, and very sweet. She was working during the holidays, and if she hated every second of it...well, we really couldn't tell. I asked her for suggestions on rolls, and her suggestions were great.

Although their sushi rolls aren't exactly traditional, they were really unique. Flavorful, but light. Just what we were looking for! I got a nontraditional roll that was wrapped in a sort of pink-ish rice paper rather than seaweed, and I just felt so healthy and nice eating it. What a relief from eating something something so refreshing! One pleasant little perk was that when I asked for green tea, we had the option to have it iced or hot. Maybe I'm biased because I was tired from walking around all day, but man. That iced unsweetened green tea was so perfect.

As for the price, I reviewed the menu and realized that yes, it's a little expensive, but what else could you expect for Vegas? I guess it's motivation for you to go back out there and win your Avocado Rolls worth back!",0,0,0

Sushi-wise, the restaurant does a good job. Their rolls are creative and beautifully presented. Check out the Rainbow Dragon, as the use of red peppers offers a pretty un-traditional take on Japanese sushi rolls. It's definitely expensive to grab a meal here once you tack on drinks, but I would say it's worth it. Don't come expecting traditional\/formal sushi, although you can definitely get that if you come here. I would recommend being adventurous and getting something that is unique to the restaurant. The portions aren't huge and while it's easy to complain about that, well, this ain't the Wynn buffet people! Consider it your opportunity to splurge and try a plethora of dishes to widen your palate. Or, since their kitchen is open well past midnight, stroll in later in the night for a post-gambling\/show\/club-hopping snack.

Samba-wise, the ambiance fits the decor they're trying to promote - some sort of trendy and dark restaurant. If you want a quiet meal, don't come here (actually - why are you even in Vegas??).

Drink-wise, this place excels. The Tequilana Caliente is a tasty cocktail that packs a punch. The Caipirinha uses high quality Leblon cachaça. And if those two aren't good enough (or you're like me and you drink both cocktails and want a third), try the Chu-Cumber sochu - our bartender made this into a shot, which went down so smoothly even though it was basically all alcohol. The one downside that evening was that they were out of their plums for their Bushido drink, a cocktail that has daikon in it too. I guess that means there's always something to come back to.",1,1,1

sadly, our group of 9 found they turned their kitchen down to zero.  not in quality - the menu and results from it are identical from the other locales.  but the joint wasn't full, so 2 hours to get some asparagus and sushi rolls delivered to our table....unacceptable.

I am always sketchy about the whole 'gratuity included for large parties' - I find that results in the net average work going down (not up) for a server - but this situation couldn't really be pinpointed on a server phoning it in.

based on my experience here vs Tao, Tao wins out - granted, the cuisine isn't identical, but the experience is largely better at Tao.

Their fish is fresh, but I still don't think that justifies the jack-up in prices. We came here for lunch on a Friday and it was pretty empty, so we got seated right away. We ordered:

-Berkshire Porkbelly Ramen (Spicy Lemongrass Broth, Bok Choy, Bean Sprout, Cilantro, Cancha $18): Not a bad size for the price I guess, and our server was nice enough to split it into two bowls for us since he knew we were sharing. The soup broth is SPICY though- it's that spice with a huge initial kick but then peters out. They also don't skimp on the porkbelly, so that was nice. But I probably wouldn't re-order.
-Yellowtail Jalapeno $7: 6 pieces for $7- not a bad deal. It was a standard yellowtail jalapeno roll, nothing bad or good to say.
-Salmon Avocado $6: 6 pieces- probably the best deal at the restaurant. The size of the rolls were a little bigger, and salmon and avocado together are delicious!
-Spicy Tuna $7.75: 6 pieces I believe, and this was your standard spicy tuna, but less spicy than a lot of places.

I probably should have ordered their fusion sushi with foie gras and other crazy toppings if I wanted to be impressed, but I really couldn't justify spending $20 on one sushi roll for lunch.. In any case, come here to eat if you enjoy posh surroundings, and don't mind high prices.",0,0,0

Such a different flavor profile than normal Japanese food. If you're looking for something of Japanese taste this place might be a hit or miss for you. I love how they bring a little spice and a different flavor profile.

We were surprised - very pleasantly.  Every course was delightfully presented and it was as tasty as it looked...and just when you thought it was over...wait there was more.  I wish we and ordered more of the sushi as it was so good but then everything was!

They try really hard to dress up their sushi and rolls with interesting sauces and for the most part pull it off but I prefer traditional sushi joints that wow you with the freshness of the fish and not the add ons. 

One thing I highly recommend is the Kobe beef. We chose the Ishiyaki which roughly translates to ""hot rock"" in Japanese. They bring out a black rock that is heated to 600 degrees along with a large array of oils, sauces, and salts. The waiter gave us a short lesson on how to prepare the meat and we went to town. Preparing the meat ourselves added a nice social aspect to the business dinner but be aware that seven slices of thin Kobe beef costs $150. Cheers",1,1,1

The staff did a nice job of adding some extra tables to accommodate the increase. It was a little hectic at first getting everyone situated then explaining they would be offering us a tasting menu that would run about $50\/pp. Eventually the group agreed and settled in for a delicious meal.

They started us off with an appetizer trio of Edaname, green bean tempura, and Shishito (grilled peppers). Very well done. Next came out some small plate items of Tuna tataki, rock shrimp tempura (yummy), calimari, and poke tacos which were delicious. Next came chicken teriyaki, ribeye tobanyaki, and a mushroom tobanyaki. The flavors in those 3 items were so good. Very impressive. 

Last was some sushi rolls, a spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, and a whitefish of some sort. These were not impressive and thus the reason for the -1 star. I was expecting some out of this world sushi and it didn't happen. 

Overall, a good night with some good friends and a bunch of laughs, drama, and drunken tomfoolery. I will return here sometime, although there are so many places in the Venetian\/Palazzio that I haven't tried so will do those first.",8,6,8

It's located at the top floor of the palazzo with a hip and dark ambiance. Okay people it's dark crowded and loud. Do you forget where you are?!? It's las vegas people!! This is what you should expect. This is the new era where sushi is supposed to be hip. I took my girfriend and a third wheel there for a dinner and pretty much ordered the omakase. As a person who worked around in sushi restaraunts, lived in Peru, and surrounded by Brazileros, I still was taught I had alot more to learn about the cuisine and the complex flavors on the palate when mixed together. Honestly unless you're ordering the kobe beef roll or the fuie gras sushi... skip the whole sushi list. The rolls are great but for the price, I would opt out for the kitchen orders. Spicy tuna was a little different but nothing to make you stand up and dance. The red miso sea bass (I believe that was the fish) skewers are to die for. The grill is special grill where they use woodchips brought in from Japan. This is the kind of special treatment the chefs use to creats such dishes, so the price is reasonable. All their fish is line caught so for the environmentally conscience, expect to pay more for sushi as opposed to other sushi restaraunts. Their ceviche was very light and refreshing, so was the yellowtail sashimi and the ceviche. The kobe beef tacos. Sorry Kogi was okay for me. Asian tacos are as good as it gets, but kobe beef tacos who can possibly resist. It was spectacular with the spicy emulsion that was served on the side. The duck confit with wil mushroom is a must order. Succulent morsels of variety of mushrooms and the perfectly cooked medium rare breast of duck just melted in your mouth. The sake sommelier was very friendly and knew her alcohol, so if you are interested in ordering sake ask for the pro. From here and there, after 5 other dishes, we ended up with dessert. The chocolate cake, which they said was great, was rather just good, BUT the carrot cake. I HATE carrot cake, but the pastry chef, she whippped up something so magical and delicious. Not too sweet, not too heavy, not too bready... if you can understand what I mean, you will love this cake. In a cake, I look for the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, that will just top off your great meal. Not to overwhelm your palate and your stomach but make a nice closure to the expensive meal you just enjoyed. It was the best carrot cake I've had.

I ordered a few rolls that the waitress suggested and gyoza for dessert. The gyoza was in fact delicious, the best thing we ordered that night. The sushi and rolls however were mediocre, and the fish did not taste fresh. The presentation was nothing special, it did not even compel me to take a picture of it.  Not to exaggerate, but I've had better tasting and more beautifully presented sushi at local sushi places or even AYCE.

I called to make reservations and they informed me on the phone that with a large party of our size, we would need to do a set menu. They said that the waiter would work with us on the day of to put together a menu to work around any restrictions we had. 

We were running a little late (you can imagine how that can happen with1 2 girls) so I called to let them know and they were very nice and accommodating. They said not to worry and that they would hold our table for us. We arrived at the restaurant and were seated at a big table in the back of the restaurant (the restaurant is pretty big). The table itself was huge and we had plenty of space between the 12 of us.

So, between the group of 12, we had the following restrictions: one pregnancy, allergies to peanuts, shrimp, and shellfish. The waiter asked us what amount we wanted to keep it to and we told him to keep it around $50\/person. We ended up with the following:

+Otsumami assortment of edamame, green bean tempura, shishito - all delicious. The dipping sauce had truffle in it... who doesn't love truffles??
+Berkshire Pork Gyoza - pretty good gyoza. Wasn't a big fan of the pumpkin dipping sauce..
+Yellowtail Taquitos - delicious! 
+Sea Bass Anticucho and Chicken Anticucho - the sea bass was amazing (as everyone else has already mentioned). It is so buttery and melts in your mouth.
+A ton of sushi rolls and some sashimi - pretty good... I would say their strength is in more of their cooked food than their sushi and sashimi. I always prefer sashimi over rolls because the rolls are usually too fusiony for me but the other girls loved them
+Rio Grande Churrasco - 5 diff meats with 3 diff dipping sauces. Very good but so full that we couldn't eat much

Service was great. We informed our waiter that we needed to be out the door by 9:30 PM and he made sure that the food just kept coming. By the end of dinner, we were so stuffed that we couldn't even eat all of the churrasco and had no space for dessert. We even came under budget by a little bit and were all way overly stuffed.

They wrapped it all in one amazing ball of bliss when they brought out the Bubbie's mochi ice cream for dessert. Seriously?! My home state mochi?!? In Vegas!?!! Amazing. 

Mike Donbrowski, our server...you gave us the best, most on point suggestions. This was the highlight meal of our trip. No words but these above. So good I had to mention you by name. Hope you don't mind! We will so be back. Thank you for making our night!",0,0,0

I recommend going on a non peak hour. The place got loud during dinner and it diminished the experience somewhat. We went for a late lunch and things were slow, we could hear each other speak, the waitress took her time with us and made several solid recommendations.

The second time, the food was still excellent, but it was loud and not very 'zen'. Waitress was frazzled and not as focused on us.

The food was fantastic both times. Very unique fusion of Japan and Brazilian food that I highly recommend.",0,0,0

The food is exceptionally creative and may be a bit challenging for someone who really enjoys traditional Sushi, but they do serve traditional style as well. I like the super heated river stone (Koren BBQ style) cooking stone with Kobe beef, oil, sea salt, and black pepper.  The sake menu is one of the best I've ever seen and the overall atmosphere is trendy and fun. The Foie Gras was AMAZING.

We had made reservations a few hours in advance on a busy Saturday night (the night before 4th of July) so we understood that it would be a few minutes of a wait. While we waited, we sat near the waiting\/bar area and our to-be waitress asked us if we wanted to order drinks. We ordered drinks while we waited for our table and our waitress brought them to us in the lounge area we were sitting in. I got the strawberry-tini which was really fruity and yummy. 

We got seated after about 10 minutes. I will admit, the menu seemed slightly pricey but it's Vegas and you can't expect restaurants not to be pricey. I ordered the Neo Tokyo roll and it came with 8 small pieces but was the best sushi I've ever had! For $15, it wasn't bad at all because I also decided to order a side of coconut rice which was delicious and only $5. The drink did ring up to be $12 but overall it wasn't bad for the great dining experience. My fellow diners loved their dishes as well. 2 of them ordered a 4-course dinner for $50, which is customized to your liking based on what preferences and allergies you tell the waitress you have and she kind of surprises you. The last diner ordered the Kobe beef sushi and he enjoyed it a lot. It came with delicately sliced raw Kobe beef wrapped around the sushi which looked amazing.

Overall a very fun dining experience!",1,0,0

The cod is dipped in unique sauces that even the most seasoned palates can't distinguish.

You'll definitely need reservations for peak times (ie dinner on a weekend).  It's japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine all in one.  If you like Japanese w\/ a twist, this is the spot to go to.  But beware, for some reason, it was really smokey (prob cause of the brazilian meats they were cooking) and overwhelmed the place (I don't think their blower was working that night).  Nonetheless, the restaurant has a hip vibe to it and along with that came much pricier menu options.  We had a large party of 10 and ordered quite a few things from the menu, but I'll just mention the ones that made our group go gaga over:

1) Chicken Teriyaki ~ Samba Style organic chicken, purple potato mash, aji amarillo, crispy onion - the chicken was to die for esp with the teriyaki sauce along with the PURPLE mash (yummm)
2) coconut rice - a nice twist to rice and vegetarians
3) Rio Grande w\/ a choice of three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, lingüiça with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri) - friends had the hanger steak, ribeye, and i think the pork and came w\/ a variety of dipping sauces.  Let's just say they were very satisfied.

Overall, it's a fun place, but gets a bit crazy and hectic.  Large parties are better suited for a booth table vs. something in the middle of the restaurant where we were seated (seemed like we were in the way).  They are also well known for having a large saki menu, although we didn't get to try it out that time.  Just more of a reason to come back.",0,0,0

Though my eyes were not necessarily on the food, I noted a few things, sitting at a table vs. sitting at the sushi bar: the emphasis was on the fusion foods (sushi menu was backpage) and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu. I agree with Bunny G. that no one bothered to explain anything about the menus.

Ordered their house ice tea which is a mint tea Arnold Palmer, served with lemon & lime wedges.  Very tasty & refreshing since I don't think I've ever had an Arnie with mint tea.

The edamame was standard fare, served cool with crushed rock salt sprinkled on top.  I ordered 2 rolls, shrimp tempura (6 pcs), and a spicy tuna (8 pcs).  The shrimp tempura was exactly that, no fuss, frills, standouts.  The spicy tuna, I think was just a tuna roll served with a squirt of sriracha.  Good thing I wasn't there for the food!

The decor & service were exceptional and it looked like there was a special\/private dining area in the back.  Interesting decor that isn't particular of any single culture, or at least any that I know of.  There were these wooden chairs that looked to be carved out of giant coconuts but could really only seat an Ommpa Loompa.  Another strange touch, that doesn't quite work to me: The food menus were not on the small side, but the cover was like leather, as in, not self supporting.  The only way to read the menu, that didn't feel awkward, was to lay it on the table.  For some reason, I didn't want a leather menu touching my little appetizer plate.  It seems unsanitary.

Because the prices were so high, I rate the food a 2-2.5 stars, but the decor & service a solid 4 stars.  So, 3.33 stars, it is!",3,0,1

Never having been here, we were a little overwhelmed with what to order. The server came by and suggested the omakase which I think was about $60 per person and you can customize it with your likes, dislikes etc. having experienced the omakase- it was a great way to try many different things at a cost more economical than if we chose to share a few things from the menu.

Most of the food was pretty tasty but there were a handful of things that missed the mark and were not memorable. Also, the oysters smelled rotten. It was really disgusting. We sent that back.

Drinks took a long time, tables are cramped for space compared to the large, clunky dishes. They also forgot to bring things we ordered but charged us for it.

My friend and I wanted food but didn't want to be over fed either.  We asked the server what we should have and he suggested the 3 item meat plate (part of the Latin\/Brazilian side) and maybe start with a seabass appetizer.  We went with his suggestions and were so incredibly satisfied.  The seabass was amazing.  It was flavorful but light just perfect before our meat combo.  For two girls it was more than enough food.  There was an option for a 5 meat option but I think that would've been over board.  Everything was pretty yummy and satisfying. 

Service was also nice.  Although this place is extremely busy at night and it's pretty hard to see (the dark atmosphere is great for romantic night but hard to see the menu).  Also, the decor was interesting.  I found myself having slight ADD trying to look around at everything from video montage in the background to the fun anime like murals.

A lot of people have recommended this restaurant, but I think it's a bit overrated. 
I love sushi.  Although the sushi was well presented, they didn't taste like anything spectacular.  Surprisingly not too many rolls to choose from even though they try to create some original specialty rolls.  

Neo Tokyo Roll - Spicy tuna inside, tuna outside.  This roll was just ok.  It just tastes like spicy tuna.

Sea Bass Skewers - Probably our only favorite dish.  Comes with corn.

El Topo Roll - Good, sorta like a crunchy roll, crispy onions and mayo on top.

Pork belly ramen - Highly recommended by server, but a huge disappointment.  It was a failed attempt.  The broth was clear and bland.  It tasted like instant ramen with a hint of tom yum soup flavoring.  Nothing like ramen at all.  

Sushisamba has good food, it just didn't show me anything new or exciting except that you're in a really nice restaurant, but you're paying for it.",1,0,0

The server suggested doing their a la carte menu where we tell them a per person price point, our likes and dislikes and the chef will customize a meal for us. 

Best idea ever!!!

We said $60 per person would be good.

What we received: 3 course meal, complimentary dessert for the bride to be and a free round of small strawberry drinks for the table.

The appetizer course had 4 plates: fried green beans, edamame, and peppers; dumplings; buffalo shrimp; taco with tuna I believe...but I told the waiter at the beginning that I dont eat anything raw and they bought me a lobster taco instead

The entree course: steak and mushroom;  fish skewers (I normally don't eat fish but this was my favorite!); crab

Sushi course: so much sushi I can't even name them all!

Dessert: (for the bride) white and black chocolate mousse with small rice crispy chocolate balls

The best part was that they customized the entire meal for us including the number of items for everyone to share. The $60 pp was more than enough food! With tip, tax and not including the bride's share, it came out to $80 pp. I think we could have done $50 and been satisfied bc we were super stuffed afterwards! Yum!

First some background.  We were a group of six New Yorkers in Vegas for a guys weekend of college basketball and good food.  All of us are regularly eating out in relatively expensive restaurants and love a good meal, consisting of both food and service. 

Having had an absolutely miserable experience the night before at Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse in the Paris hotel, we were really looking forward to a nice evening and these guys really delivered.

We were seated promptly and when the waiter came over and suggested that we could order from the menu or if we preferred we could give him a budget and he would serve us a meal.  We asked for a suggestion and he said that we'd really enjoy our meal at $65-70\/person unless we wanted to also have a Kobe Beef course in which case we should figure closer to $100.  Having had steaks the night before we gave him a free hand at $65-70.

Course after course of creative imaginative wonderful foods arrived, each one better than the one before. The final course was more traditional sushi with several creative rolls and as a few of us eat a top NY sushi restaurants regularly, we were more than pleased.

The waitress handed us menus and walked away for like 20 minutes.  Hello? We're thirsty!  Take our drink order!

We sat there puzzled looking at the menu and wondering why she wouldn't say, ""Welcome, thank you for coming in, is this your first time with us?  Let me tell you a bit about the menu?  ""It's a mixture of sushi and some South American country""...or whatever!  

The menu had rolls with weird combinations.  I really wish she would have spent some time getting us excited about what to order or make some recommendations.

We went up to our room, freshened up and headed out.

We were quickly seated (it was a Sunday Night and the place was half full) and placed some drink orders. My wife had one of the specialty drinks which was quite good and I had some Nigiri Sake. We started off with the Otsumami appetizer which came with Edamame, Shishito Peppers and Green Bean Tempura with Black Truffle Aioli. All 3 were excellent but we found ourselves fighting over the Green Beans and that yummy Aioli. 

Next up was a mixture of Ceviches and Tiraditos. We tried 4 all together with both Salmon and Yellowtail. Amazing flavor. The Yellowtail Ceviche Taquitos were also amazing. I could eat those all day. We also had a couple of things from the Robata grill. The stand out was the Miso Glazed Sea Bass. It was incredible. So tasty. It was the best Sea Bass I have ever had. Period! The Peruvian corn that came with it also was quite tasty.

The waitress recommended the Mushroom Toban-Yaki with some grilled duck from the Robata grill. It was so intense and earthy. I definitely got use of those umami tastebuds with this dish.

We went for an early dinner on a weekday. The place was empty, and we were seated right away. The menu was honestly, somewhat intimidating, and really shi shi. I like sushi, sashimi, sushi rolls, etc. I didnt really vibe with the brazilian twist the menu had. I did not research the menu enough before going in there. (Which was good in retrospect, because then I probably wouldnt have gone there, and missed a great meal.) I assumed- sushi samba= sushi. Lol. We ordered regular sushi rolls, sashimi pieces and miso soups. The miso was great. The grade of the sushi was out of this world. Def some of the best I have had, and I am a sushi addict. I have eaten it all over at home, and I try to get it whenever I am on vacation. Def recommend. There are high prices for the specialty fusion foods (which made me nervous and therefore I stuck with what I knew), but the place is gorgeous, service was fantastic, and if you are willing to take a chance on the specialty foods, Im sure you wont be disappointed.",0,0,0

It was super empty at 8:30 pm on valentines night which I thought was really weird. 

I'll start off by saying service was impeccable. Even the manager came over to check on us and wish us a happy valentines day and even chatted it up with us for a little while. He even brought some kind of champagne with strawberries for us at the end of our dinner. I believe his name was Jeremy so if I'm correct....then thanks Jeremy you definitely made our experience a good one. Kudos to Philip our waiter as well. He dealt with our drunk asses throughout the entire dinner and provided amazing service at the same time. 

We ordered an order of the wagyu gyoza to try. Yeh we ended up ordering another 4 orders right away. I think that might give you a good idea of just how amazing this dish is. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed with it. Then we got the churrasco with like 3 or 4 different meats that came with 3 different sauces. If you've got money to spend then I definitely suggest getting this dish. The spicy tuna hand roll with spicy mayo on top was also AMAZING. Hands down the best spicy tuna hand roll I've ever had. 

The two downsides to this place and the reason I took off one star is because of how pricy this place is for the amount of food they give you and the fact that their bathroom had absolutely no lights. I literally couldn't see where I was or what I was doing the entire time I was in the stall.

Some of the highlights:

- yellowtail tacos
- yellowtail in lemongrass sauce
- sea bass (I don't eat sea bass, but my friends were raving about it!). The Peruvian corn that came with it was excellent 
- some kind of steak, cooked medium rare served with rice and beans
- a sushi platter with spicy tuna, California, and shrimp tempura rolls

The menu was quite interesting. If you dont know about the concept, its japanese and south american & latin american fusion. And I think it pairs together very well. For the quality...I thought the prices were set accordingly.
The ambiance - very hip...very cool. The vibe of the place is incredible and you just get that feel that youre in a chic and sexy place. The music, the decor, the servers...its all there. The bar area in the front is very accommodating and there are large tables and booths set up for large groups as well.
So why only three stars...? The service. Now I know you cant always judge a place completely on one visit, but the service was very suspect here. Now, I should have known better than to expect great service from a bar seat for dinner...however, it was a slow night there, so I thought it would be decent at least...and it was just barely that. Slow...slow...slow. And my bartender\/server just seemed not aware of everything that was going on. Bringing me incorrect sushi order at first, then a incorrect drink order, then completely mischarging the order of the gentleman next to me. And when all this was happening, the managers just seemed to be too concerned about a large birthday party of ladies than what was going on with the gentleman order and bill or my incorrect orders. I think this place probably still does very well cause its a cool spot with a great location inside the Palazzo...but service is very important. I will go back again and hope that my service experience will be different next time.",0,0,0

We had a reservation for 3 people at 8:30 but didn't get seated until about 8:45, which wasn't too bad. I would recommend getting your drink order in ASAP because I felt like it took awhile for our waiter to come at all. That's really my only complaint with this place--I feel like try didn't have enough waitstaff. Oh, and the place is loud as hell (but great club music) so be prepared to shout your order.

I highly recommend doing the chef's tasting menu (not on the menu I think)-- you pick a price point you want to spend (we spent $70 pp) and then let the server know what types of food you don't like or have allergies to. It's a great way to sample all they have to offer. Some of out dishes included ceviche tacos, a platter with edamame, roasted chilies, and tempura green beans with white white truffle aioli (to die for btw), Kobe beef gyoza, wagyu and sea bass skewers with Peruvian corn, and two different kinda of sushi rolls with tuna and tempura shrimp.

In fact, everything that came out were things that they already have on the menu. If we had known we would have just ordered $120 worth of food and chosen what we wanted to eat. On top of that I told the server I do not eat raw fish and my husband does, so we both expected to see some raw for my hubby and cooked for me, but they brought out everything cooked. It was okay for me, but my husband did not think it was okay. Overall, everything was very tasty, but I felt like it wasn't worth it. The last two rolls they served us was also two different variations of a California roll with a little bit of lobster on top and tempura in the other. My advice would be not to get the tasting menu and opt to order your own dishes. I'm not complaining though. We will be back and maybe after I get to choose my own items I may increase my star rating. I have to say we left feeling fairly full from the meal.",0,0,0

We also had some kanapche tiradito and seared kobe beef and those two were the best I've ever had.  

It was freakin expensive but I love the tapas style and they had the BEST COCKTAILS EVER.  Just when you feel that alcohol burn about to hit you, it doesn't.

Zero interaction or greeting with the line of 6 or 7 sushi chefs. This is not common at the sushi bar. Bad sign. 

Ordered Kumamoto oysters. $5 a piece. I had these just a few weeks ago in CT and they should be meaty, thick oysters that melt in your mouth. They were like underdeveloped bluepoints. Not worth $5 each. 

Was offered a special if toro carpaccio with Xavier topping. I asked if I could get it with whole tomorrow instead and after checking with the chef was told yes. When it was served I took one look at the Toro and having had a bad experience with grizzly tuna instead of fatty tuna I immediately mentioned it and said it did not look good. I said I would try one and if I didn't like it I would like them taken back. They were horrible and were returned. When I got the bill they were shown but deducted out. Good thing, as for pieces were $66 and the seven caviar eggs on each of them were an additional $16! The reason the chef was chopping them up is that he knew they were tough and grizzly. He should not of agreed to make an inferior product. 

Tako, octopus, was very good

Hand roll (hamachi scallion jalapeño) was  good

Uni sushi (sea urchin)  with pheasant egg was excellent.

This place is nestled deep within the Palazzo shops, but don't let that stop you from going as it is definitely worth the trek.

shishito - nicely charred, spicy, drizzled with oil and sea salt. Very good. Best shishito I've had.
Organic chicken - a little heavy with the sauce but still a good eat.
Sea Bass - yum! Both the chicken and the sea bass were served on a bed of Peruvian corn, which was very tasty. 
Rainbow Dragon roll - nicely crafted roll of fresh eel and avocado with just the right amount of sauce.
Kanpachi - delicious with lots of wasabi.

For drinks I had the Caipirinha--a Brazilian concoction--which was not only excellent but also a steal at only $10.

I would deduct a star as our staff failed to mentioned certain items were out of stock after we had ordered them, but I realize this place is very new and they're still getting their act together. I'll definitely come back again.

Feijoada, chorizo, linguisa(kinda portuguese sausage) and some peruvian corn which is like giant hominy. 
Well the order was wrong because I ordered sides and  he asked me how I wanted my eggs. The bartender was really slow. I asked him some questions on why he was shaking a certain way and he said it was because they put egg whites in the drink. I explained a different method on how to make the drink that he won't tire himself out and he said ""No it's better my method"" LOL I asked him where he worked before and he said...""Grand Lux Cafe"" Yea Nuff said. I didn't introduce myself to him because he was too hard headed in knowing what was right and wrong. So he fcked up my order, returned the Churros when I asked him for it to go, and then he stiffs me on eggs on the bill. Yea I'm gonna order from the table next time. I think brunch is for rookies.

My sister and I were overly excited about Sushi Samba being a Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian restaurant. We ordered a little bit of everything. So here it is:

- Chicken skewers with Peruvian corn and scallops: Very very tasty. Chicken was tender and grilled to perfection! Peruvian corn, who knew such a thing existed, but nonetheless like ordinary corn. I especially liked the scallops because they were lemony and the presentation was so pretty!
- Jumbo shrimp ceviche: way too sweet
- Tuna ceviche: tuna was fresh and soft, not too sweet, but not too bland. 
2 sushi rolls, but I forgot the name, but one of them included kobe beef, I think the Bobo Brazil... and that one was AMAZING!
- Tuna tataki: MUST ORDER. Good presentation, perfect balance of crisp and soft. Tuna was tasty
- Seared wagyu beef: the sauce accompanying this dish is so perfect. The beef and mushroom was so good.

They chat with their guests, offer great suggestions, listen, and make them feel important, basically what a bar staff should do.  Rico and Buen were the reason I came back on night #2 and Erica was the cherry on top.  Also kudos to the fantastic GM for understanding what guest service is all about.  Without a doubt I'll be back!",0,0,0

The atmosphere is good! I like how to the place is set up and the menus and place settings are nice. Menu is a little hard to read but with the internet, we were able to figure out everything (our waiter didn't come for drinks right away.. we waited about 7-10 min which was long for the amount of people in the restaurant). 

Got our drinks and food at the same time because we had so much time to look at the menu. We ordered spicy tuna and salmon avocado rolls. We also ordered the heirloom tomato salad and the organic chicken anticuchos. Got our sushi first, not the appetizer -- heirloom tomato salad. Sushi was good! No soy sauce needed for me. The heirloom tomato salad was not heirloom tomatoes. They were cherry tomatoes. We were completely disappointed for $13 -- it was not at all what we ordered so we sent it back. The waiter said the menu said ""heirloom cherry tomato salad"" but it most definitely did not. Then we had the organic chicken anticuchos (waiter's recommendation between that and the ribeye). This was good, but not 2 skewers for $10 and some corn. It was good, just not worth the amount paid. I wouldn't get again. 

Get to our bill and he took off the salad, which was good. However, when you look at the bottom of the bill, it has tip % prices. NOTE*** be aware. Always double check your tip price that it has on there*** our tip percentages were based off of our price BEFORE the salad was taken off! Our bill was $34 and our tax was around $2.50 and it said 20% was almost a $10 tip! You do the math! So we asked and he said it was for the original bill which was around $47!

Do your tip yourself; double your tax; double check their work! Computers aren't always correct! That wasn't right for the tip calculator to have those values on there for the price that was in big numbers and bolded..",1,0,0

***Tuna Tatake - So fresh with bright clean flavors- definitely try this.
***Rock shrimp tempura - Sauce was tasty but tempura was really heavy. Everyone else at our table loved this dish though.
***Sea bass w\/ Peruvian corn - I think this is really popular, but our fish was really really dry. Least favorite item we tried.
***Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos - Really yummy bite sized goodness.

Sushi was delicious. Music was way too loud. I'd come back for another glass of house wine and a roll before heading out to the clubs, but I wouldn't spend my money here on dinner. Let's not forget that Nevada is land-locked, you shouldn't be paying that much for sushi that isn't SUPER fresh.

We were a party of 6, who waited nearly an hour and finally left in disgust. The story seemed to be that people were taking a long time to leave. That happens in every good restaurant in the world, and managers learn to allow for it. They learn how to gently encourage people to leave. If the wait is egregious, they tell you what's up, maybe comp you a drink. What they don't do is keep you standing outside, with no information, like you were a walk-in. Treating customers like cattle is a sure way to make sure that they write bad reviews on Yelp and tell their friends not to go there. Sushi Samba simply sucks.

UPDATE: You can tell a lot about a restaurant by the way they handle things that go wrong. Like the review above. I got a message the next day from their Regional Director of Operations apologizing profusely and offering to make things right. I had already left Vegas, so it was too late.

I alerted my waitress immediately that I am vegan and gluten-free. She brought me out a special vegan menu and told me the items that are available gluten-free. I got the edamame appetizer and for my entree, the Amazonian roll and individual veggie rolls special. Brown rice was not available as a substitute for the sushi rice, which I prefer. However, I was able to get over it once my sushi came out. Both my colleague and I agreed it was the best sushi we had ever eaten. I ordered another Amazonian roll and devoured that, too.

Although it is pricey, this restaurant is a must 5\/5.

The hostess who answered the phone was courteous and professional and we were able to get a prime reservation on a Saturday night. The good stopped there. 

Our server was unbelievably rude and unhelpful with the menu. His only obvious desire was to up-sell us on all of the choices we made. I understand the desire to up-sell, but there is a way to do this in a genuine less greedy manner. I would have ordered more drinks if he had even bothered to check on our table, but that seemed to be above him.

The seaweed salad arrived and it was both mushy and very under seasoned.

Then, the real culinary horror arrived: a plate of sushi samba's signature sushi rolls. One roll was topped with burnt foie gras that also tasted a rancid. I mentioned it to the waiter the one and only time he came to check on our table and he told me that, ""Everyone else really likes that roll. I'll have to talk to my manager."" ummmm???  Why wouldn't you offer me something else from the menu? Why would you let a patron leave dissatisfied?

And that was the last time we ever saw him. It was as though we had offended him and for the rest of the evening he completely ignored us. We waited over 20 minutes for our check to come after the table had been cleared.  I almost got up and left. What an insult to have chosen a restaurant for such a special occasion and then to be treated so poorly.

A short walk from the Encore, SushiSamba seemed to fit my need for some discounted booze and appetizers. 

Their long oval bar by the main entrance was pretty much empty, so I easily settled into a spot and perused their happy hour offerings. They offered three different whiskey cocktail concoctions for $6. Not being a huge whiskey fan, I picked the one that sounded the least rough to me. It was actually pretty decent, although I could have used a little more cocktail and a lot less ice. 

I picked three appetizers, an amount that is generally plenty at most happy hours to fill me up to the brim. The shrimp & chorizo skewers (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA) were my favorite. The shrimp was barely cooked through with nice char marks and the chorizo had great flavors. The chimichurri-like sauce on top was great. I could have eaten a lot more of these. The sliced ahi tuna (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#-AMDCTLNjWrfNMkPbPGf0A) consisted of two very thin pieces of ahi drowned  in a soy-mustard sauce and topped with a halved cherry tomato and some leaves. This portion was super tiny and made me wonder whether happy hour at this place meant you get a quarter of the portion for half the price of the regular appetizer dish... I got the same feeling with the shredded pork mini tacos (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#i30qdbtwZSj2f8tNbjkqLQ). One bite and those suckers were gone. The spicy sauce on the side served in a shot glass looked cool, but it was so frickin' hot (the bartenders thoroughly warned me) that you could only use a mini droplet on each taco. So what was the point of serving that much sauce? Again, the portion size was disappointing and the taco was just average. 

Two drinks & three appetizers = $37 (including tip). I left hungry and unimpressed. For around $40 I can usually eat and drink myself into stupidity at happy hour. Sheesh, I could have had a great entree and a nice glass of wine at many of Vegas' amazing restaurants instead.

Ambience:  Dark and somewhat trendy sushi fusion joint.  There is a bar area but the rest of the tables are set up in a funky circular fashion.  Tables are pretty close to each other and you will not have a private dining experience.  
Service:  For the most part good.  We were seated right away.  It did take a while for the server to get to us (and she apologized).  She didn't give us the Sushi Samba intro like I heard another server give the table next to us (explaining the whole fusion thing).  Orders were taken and things proceeded to go smoothly.  There were no mistakes on our order.  We asked for sake recommendations and she appeared really knowledgeable.  She was decent in explaining their omikase (pretty much no set omikase).  Food came out at a decent pace.  Water was refilled quite nicely too.
Food:  Past review said that this was a great sushi place.  I disagree.  If you want the best sushi, you don't go to a fusion place in Vegas for it.  If you want to try a different twist on japanese\/brazillian cuisine, then this is the place. So I went here without much expectations.  Highlights included the Yellowtail taquitos (more like tacos).  I loved the sauce\/foam that came with it.  Very light and a nice way to wet your appetite.  Sea bass and Lamb Robata (sp?) were both really really good.  There was a sweet sauce on both.  Sea bass melted in your mouth.  Came with 2 skewers.  The lamb was a decent size and was sliced thinly.  This was also a melt-in-your mouth experience.  I would order both again. We had one of their specials which was a white fish in a tofu sauce.  It was just ok.  We made the mistake of ordering a roll.  I think it was an El Toro (or something like that) and it came with salmon, cilantro, mozerella cheese, among other things.  The flavor was ok, but the rice in the roll itself was really hard.  Like they had premade it.  Made the whole roll just awful.  I like their sake selection.  We passed on dessert.
Value:  Just like vegas, things are pricier. But I thought the vibe was decent.

The restaurant is tucked away in the corner and has a dark sexy vibe to it. We had 6:30 pm reservations on a Friday night and since it was a little early, the restaurant was not overly busy which allowed us to receive a lot of attention from Mike, our waiter. He was one of the best waiters I have had in a restaurant in a long time...he was very helpful in helping us select a bottle of sake and made recommendations on the food and how many plates to order for our group of 5. Plus he checked on us often enough so we didn't sit with empty glasses, but not too much where it was annoying.

The food was amazing for the most part. The scallops and chicken robota were my two favorite things that we ordered that evening. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were not gritty at all. They didn't quite have that melt in my mouth feeling, but were some of the best I have had since moving to the Southwest. My husband sampled some of the sushi that our group ordered, and even as a sushi newcomer, he was not blown away by it. It was probably the most disappointing of the dishes that our group ordered. Our group received three complimentary desserts (we were celebrating 3 birthdays that evening) of which the chocolate hazelnut dish was my favorite. It was absolutely heavenly.

Our group's bill came to approximately $200, which I thought was reasonable given the number of dishes we ordered, plus we also had a bottle of sake ($62 itself), and several other alcoholic beverages.

They had a good selection of food on their menu.  Like I said, it's fusion so you will see various Brazilian, Peruvian, and Japanese food on their menu.  I was really craving some sushi and so I ordered two rolls - the Green Envy roll and their spicy yellowtail roll.

I really liked how they crushed the spicy wasabi peas and put it in the Green Envy roll - it gave it a nice crunch w\/ that wasabi kick!  I also REALLY liked their spicy yellowtail roll.  It was simple but I thought was a perfect b\/c it really let the taste of their fresh yellowtail shine through~!!",0,0,0

The one bad thing about my experience here was - they could've sat us at a bigger table.  I swear we must've had the smalled table that 11 girls squished into a booth and 3 chairs at the end?  Our martini glasses were spilling everywhere!

Drinks - they were REALLY slow in bringing these out to us.  And the cocktails we ordered were overly sweet.

Food - we ended up doing the tasting menu ($50pp that's without drinks and tip)  I have to say - it was good they catered to what we requested and taking into consideration any food allergies one may have.  One girl had allergies to avocado, so they made a serving especially for her that excluded it.  There was a serving for each person, to get a taste of everything.  

The food was alot better than I expected.  Except there is this particular taste in the sushi, I wasn't quite sure what it was it was almost floral like, I wasn't a big fan of that, but other than that all the dishes were good, even the gyoza!

But this place is different, offering a spin of Brazillian flare on the Japanese standard.  I liked the playfulness.... 

but back to the important stuff... the Kobe!  Grade A5 from Japan (I'm guessing Vegas had a shipment of this because every place said they had A5 Japanese Kobe!)  Sushi Samba brought out a plate of raw sliced kobe next to a line of dry and wet spices\/marinades.  Then came the huge hot rock.  We were then instructed to dip the beef in the marinade of choice, set on rock for 30 seconds a side, then sprinkle with preferred dry spice.  I watched the ladies at our table go first and I saw them immediately go to their ""happy place"" with the first bite.  After the rest of the table ate, I could see everyone counting the remaining pieces to see how many more bites they had.  Hahahaha!!! So much fun!

Great Sake list if you like that (which I do).  Hundreds of junmai daiginjo bottles going into the $1,000's.  I found a decent one for $50 (300ml).  So recap, get the kobe, enjoy the sushi... don't go if sushi is all that you want, there's better.",0,0,0

Spicy Tuna Roll - good not not too different from other spicy tuna rolls we tried
Shrimp Tempura Roll - good portions of shrimp tempura and not too greasy
Salmon Sushi - great flavor with asparagus.  This was my mother's favorite.
Japanese Style Salt and Pepper Squid - a bit salty but quite tasty.  Small portion.
Yellowtail Seviche- two thinly sliced yellowtail with a tasty spicy sauce.  This was my favorite.

In addition, we ordered the California roll which was $14.  However,  they used real crab instead of imitation crab.  It was quite tasty with generous amounts of crab used.

This place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. I have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked. 

The Chilean Seabass on the Robata Grill section was probably my favorite rendition of Chilean Seabass. Our waiter said the Robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. But wow it was good. You have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food.
Probably the only time I felt like a winner in Vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.

The Yellowfin taquitos were so unique, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.

El Topo - good but not great. Table loved it though.

Rock shrimp tempura with black truffle aoili - if I ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come true - this will be the first item on the menu. WOWWWW. It made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. But really how can u not like shrimp?

Unfortunately, the review that I chose my return on isn't a glowing five star, but a glowering 1 star.

The only meal I ate in Vegas for 3 days ( I kid you not) was Friday not at this place.  It came highly recommended by numerous friends, so I thought this should be some great sushi.  

Boy was I mistaken. 

Firstly, we had a 10PM reservation.  We arrived at 9:45 thinking we'll grab a seat at the bar and sip on a cocktail and people watch at all the bachelorette parties, etc.  Well, 45 mins later and we still didn't have a table.  My stomach was growling, and my face was scowling at this point.  

The hostess was rude when we would ask how much longer for a table, she would just say, You're next.  Really? I'm next you said that 10 people ago??!!

When we finally got our seats, we ordered the following:

--Rock shrimp:  It was tempura battered.  The first few bites were good, but as everything began to cool, it just became mushy.  

--Fusion sushi roll was boring, bland and well, you get the point

--The only thing that was excellent was the sea bass. It was moist, delicate and absolutely delicious.  But, $25 for 2 skewers left me wanting.  

The peruvian corn was awful..

The restaurant itself is everything that you would expect from Vegas. Upscale, trendy and expensive.  $200 for three items and 4 cocktails.  Not worth my only eating experience in Vegas that weekend.",6,6,4

The food is so good!  I thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is DELICIOUS.

Ambiance is classy and cool.  It's a nice location within the Palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  Service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a Friday night at midnight.

We got:

MOQUECA MISTA - shrimp, squid, sea bass, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA#T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA

This thing is the BEST EVER.  Creamy Thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  Rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel DIVINE.  I thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow I kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!

EL TOPO SUSHI ROLL - salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)

Very unique roll with interesting flavors and textures = Delicious!

CHICKEN TERIYAKI - Samba Style organic chicken, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)

When I saw the huge price tag I thought ""WTF?!"", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so I had no control).  BUTTT I'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had in my life!  Super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (I think) to a crisp.  The sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.

As with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the Las Vegas Strip, I did think the prices were a little inflated.  Hence the lack of that final star.  However, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas.  I'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.

What a terrible mistake I've made all these years. Looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon SushiSamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. We made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.

Samba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in Vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious. 

1) Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza (4.5\/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth

2) Yellowtail Taquito (5\/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this

3) Yellowtail Sashimi (4.5\/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour

4)  Berkshire Pork Belly (3.75\/5) - I am admittedly biased towards pork belly so I loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the pork belly itself was cooked to perfection

5) Sea Bass Anticucho (5\/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very fortunate because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the sea bass skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of sea bass cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is. 

6) Rio Grande (4\/5) - from their Churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and wagyu picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the wagyu picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.

Quite simply, I loved my experience at SushiSamba. The service was fantastic. The food was unique and delicious at the same time. The atmosphere embodies that of Vegas- vibrant and exciting. The price of the dinner was what I'd expect from a ""strip"" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50. 

I can't wait to go back to SushiSamba for some yellowtail tacos and sea bass.",4,0,3

Gave this place 4 stars for originality of food and drinks, and the atmosphere.  It was not too dark, not too bright, with artsy decor on the walls and different pictures rotating on projection screens (NOT PG rated, BTW, I saw a breast or two flash by, though there were nice scenic pics in there too.)  They have a club\/lounge in the back of the restaurant, which was recommended to us by a Dior employee at Caesars mall, he said it was a mix of hip hop music and some other music, he went on a Saturday.  However, we weren't able to go since it's not open on Sundays.

Me and two other girlfriends of mine went here late on a Sunday nite (sat 10 pm?) and there was no wait.  Not that this matters, but an added bonus was that our waiter was HOT!  hehe.  Anyways, the menu had a lot of things that I had never heard of before, so if you're not used to Brazilian \/ Peruvian \/ Japanese food then the staff should be able to explain it all to you before you order.

We ordered the tuna ceviche and shrimp ceviche for appetizers (see reviews below for details of the dishes I talk about here).  Both excellent, and fresh, and a decent-sized portion (about a cereal bowl full), but pricey at around $15-17 each.  We also ordered spicy tuna rolls, which were excellent (the tuna practically melted in our mouths) as well as the BoBoBrazil roll, which Mr. Hottie Waiter recommended - slices of Kobe Beef atop a roll with a bunch of good stuff in it that I didn't know (sorry to all you food buffs!).  I think it was a mix of onions?  Both very good.

As far as cocktails, I would definitely recommend the Chu-Cucumber cocktail.  I think that's the name of it.  Again, Mr. Hottie Waiter recommended this, which I decided to try even though it didn't sound good at first.  It was surprisingly refreshing!  It has some sort of Japanese liquor in it, which supposedly had a lite Vodka flavor, as well as Roseflower and cucumber.  I ended up having two of these (they were in a martini glass), and the third having substituted the original liquor for Gin, as a recommendation by the bartender, which had a stronger alcohol taste to it.  One of my friends tried the Samba Juice cocktail, which she said was good and tasted a little like sangria.

Overall, great atmosphere, a bit pricey, but original food that you wouldn't find at your regular sushi restaurant.  I would definitely try this place at least once on a trip to Vegas!  Hopefully I'll get to check out the lounge next time!",0,0,1

If you're going here, you might as well splurge like you already are. Order the Ishi Yaki - it's at least $150 worth of Wagyu beef that you'll season and toss on your own hot-stone, leaving it to cook to your liking. You may also offend your neighbors: they'll envy your plate, but they may also not like how the smoke is incidentally wafted in their direction by the vents. 

The wild Mushroom Toban-Yaki is on the salty side. The Tiger Shrimp Tempura is more than enough for 2 people despite being labeled as a small plate - loved it. I didn't like the Lobster Taquitos because of the lemongrass and ginger. The Watermelon Mojo beverage had too much mint for my liking. I'll be back to try out other dishes!

The service:
I'm also not typically a fan of Asian cuisine, but I definitely enjoyed most of everything else that was ordered. I appreciate the waiter serving my table for making recommendations (and yes, up-selling). They definitely came by to check on us very often.

Lucky side note: 
I think I've decided on going to SushiSamba during their slow times: right after the holidays and before New Years Eve. It sounds like this place is less hectic during this time frame. Even so, I managed to have a piece of plastic flung my direction during dinner. I thought I had been drinking too much, or a part of the restaurant's decor had started to deteriorate but nope - it was a patron's credit card that somehow flew out of one's hand and landed behind my seat cushion and the wall lighting\/backrest. They nearly had the whole place turned upside down trying to find the thing. My date and I should have taken this luck to go gambling afterwards.",0,0,0

I had a horrible experience here on the one night my friends and I had reunion dinner together in Vegas. THE ONE NIGHT WE WERE ALL TOGETHER. 

- Everything was really salty, and we had to send back one of our dishes because we couldn't eat it. 
- The menu was limited in terms of sushi, despite their moniker. Should have been a red flag there. 
- We waited at least 10 mins for anything we asked for (twice!). It was a waste of our time considering we were in Vegas and of the three hours we spent at the restaurant, 2 of them was just us waiting for water, napkins,  bowls,  the check, and the manager.
- When we asked for the check, no one came to our table to give it to us for another 10 min. Not only that, they never updated the check so we had to go up to one of the computers and ask the server for another check. 
- Eventually we asked for the manager, and they told us if we stay there, they'll bring him out. So we stood to the side and waited. But after about 20 min of waiting (again), the same server came up to us and asked if we wanted to see the manager. He told us that manager wasn't coming but he'll grab him. 

This was a ridiculous experience, and I would never recommend this restaurant to anything of my friends.",2,1,1

I'm drawn to a ""sushi"" place once again.  

Nonetheless, the Brazilian beats and atmosphere from the outside looking in made SUSHISAMBA seem different, and well worth trying. 

So we did.

SUSHISAMBA is a Japanese\/Brazilian\/Peruvian fusion restaurant.  Hence the aforementioned ""beats."" 

The visuals of this place are more ""club"" than restaurant, both from a lighting\/decor perspective, as well as the patrons drinking around the bar.  

That being said, as we were seated at our table, the fusion influences did highlight how somewhat boring and ""polite"" the sushi places I normally frequent actually are.  SUSHISAMBA has a much more vibrant atmosphere.

Regardless, I was in the mood for sushi, so I stayed within that zone on the menu. 

My dinner companion fears the stuff... which made this place perfect.  I could indulge, while she self-cooked meat on a ultra hot stone in front of her (yes, that is an option).  

Thus, my sashimi\/sushi\/roll selection was served before me with zero guilt .

Everything either of us ordered was very good.  No complaints on the quality whatsoever.  The only negatives are repeated from what other reviewers have mentioned:

--  if you order outside of the Japanese realm, the price seems to go way up.  If you treat it as a sushi restaurant, the price is in line, even for Vegas.  

-- Again, outside of the ""sushi"" realm, portion size could very well disappoint. 

--  The tables can feel a little too close for comfort with your neighbors.  But this varies depending on where you are seated.  

Overall, I am a fan of the traditional sushi-restaurant  fare served here, because it trumps the overall experience I have elsewhere -- the quality is fine, the atmosphere is more fun.  

Venturing beyond that will no doubt deliver quality, but you may end up needing to order more than expected to be satisfied, and end up with a much lighter wallet.

The bartender was super sweet and made us great cocktails. I enjoyed the Lychee Bubbletail, which was delectable. K had a drink with berries and elderflower liqueur, which was also fab.

K had insisted that the sea bass skewers were amaze balls, so we went with that. We started with two orders (2 skewers each) and sides of the coconut rice and black beans. The beans were tasty, but hard to eat with chopsticks. Coconut rice was fantastic and I could have eaten a whole bowl by myself (but I'm glad I didn't).

Karen's suggestion on the skewers totally delivered. We even ended up getting a third order because they were sooooo good! Melty and flavorful. We even convinced the guys next to us to get an order and they liked it, too!

Both accommodated us perfectly in our requests for pre-ordering drinks, finding an ideal price-point for our group, and making sure the menu suited our needs. 

We were seated in their backroom at a great big table. Our waiter was extremely friendly without being overbearing. We ordered the family-style meal and asked for options on the lighter\/fresher\/fishier side of things. All items we got were awesome-- they hit the nail on the head with our requests: 

green bean tempura, tuna tataki, ceviche tacos, terriyaki fish skewers, a wide variety of sushi, edamame... and even more! They also made special plates for one of the girls who didn't eat raw fish. Bonus points right there!

At our price point (about $40\/per person before tax and tip) we had plenty of food and even extra left over. Splitting everything family style made for a really fun evening and made splitting the check extremely easy. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning a party. Now I just have to check out Sushi Samba in Chicago!",0,0,0

- Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza - kabocha purée and su-shoyu dipping sauce - beefy goodness, sauce was delicious l

- Salt and Pepper Squid - dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, smoked soy - fried perfectly, love the seasoning on top

- Yellowtail Crispy Tacquitos - served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - fresh, textures were well played, it was well balanced with the lime

- Sea Bass Miso Skewer served with Peruvian Corn - sea bass was nicely flavored, and the corn was highly addicting

- Mushroom Tobanyaki -  poached organic egg, wild japanese mushrooms, garlic chip - flavorful and delicious, I can drink gallons of this!

- Japanese Wagyu Ishiyaki - hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables - beef was good, lots of sauces to play with, but for me, all you need is the beefy goodness, no sauce

- Yellowtail Sashimi - jalapeño and lemongrass - fresh and delicious, they didn't give us jalapeño, but pepper instead

- El Topo Roll - salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, red onion, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - something different, delicious though 

- Lima Roll - shrimp tempura, spicy king crab, avocado - basic roll, nothing special

- Neo Tokyo Roll- bigeye tuna, tempura flake, aji panca - did not care for this roll

- São Paulo Roll - scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, whitefish, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chimichurri - this roll was okay, nothing special

It is a japanese\/brazilian\/peruvian fusion tapas restaurant that is a master of molecular gastronomy. However, this is NOT the place for a large group. It is best for a group of FOUR people, at most.

First off, this place is expensive with small portions, but how many tapas restaurants are not? That's the whole point of tapas: to have the ability to try many different dishes of bursting flavor without being too full or overwhelmed at the end. That being said, I got to try six different dishes and was very satisfied at the end.

This is what I ordered:
-Seared Wagyu Beef (highly recommended, ponzu gelée, warm japanese mushroom, truffled tofu crema, so delicious) $18
-Salmon Sashimi Tiradito (recommended, orange and mustard miso sauce over buttery salmon) $13
-Seabass Anticuchos (recommended, skewered sea bass, miso sauce, and peruvian corn) $17
-Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza (highly recommended!!! kabocha pumpkin purée and su-shoyu dipping sauce; this was my favorite dish, a party in mouth!!) $18
-Pacific sushi roll (skip, it was good but nothing too amazing. there were other rolls that looked more interesting!) $18
-Yellowtail taquitos (toss up, it was good but not as special as the rest of the dishes I had) $12

Oh.. and I ordered one cup of tea.. and it cost $4... My total came out to $108 with tax.... for two people..... for our first meal of the day... Hmm.....

Group of six...all sushi enthusiasts from California...ready to throw down a great meal after a great show (BTW Blue Man Group Rocks!) 

The worst service EVAH! Why have three different kitchens if your servers cannot keep up with ONE!?  Ordered Sparkling saki Moon Rabbit...got Star Rabbit instead...mmmm...ok...BUT to have the nerve to treat me as if I didn't know which saki I ordered?! SHAME.  

Then we look at the menu...
Seriously? $6 for ONE piece of sushi? WOW!  I know I can get grade A sushi without the price elsewhere so I opted for a quasi-meal and ordered the Lobster for $25...knowing it was gonna be small, I figured I would try and get somewhat of a meal since my sushi bill alone would've been OFF the charts.  I was told it was the shell with three small pieces of lobster on top.  WRONG! I about fell over and died when I realized, after digging through the smelt eggs with my chopsticks, that there was NO meat!  NO LOBSTER MEAT whatsoever!!!  I went in again and picked up what I thought was meat and it was a piece of shell.  HOLY SHIT...they just served me lobster tail without meat...NO LIE.

I sent it back and refused to order anything else since the rest of my party was almost done with their meal.  I was annoyed, hungry, and our check took a fucking century because our server knew she was getting her 20% no matter how shitty our experience.

If you stay at the palazzo it is easy to get to from your elevator suites. This is why I ate here. Because being pressed for time made this place super convenient.  We also had super speedy service in one hour flat to make it to a show in time. 

The dishes we ordered were all delicious. Served tastefully in a visually appealing way that it was too pretty to touch when served. The dishes were all unique with a chili kick in every bite.

I have to highly recommend the sushi rolls and the sea bass. The sea bass was flavourful, fresh and super tasty. For the price it was great because the portion was large as well. This was the best offering for sharing as most plates served here were small. It was also cooked to melt in your mouth perfection. 

The sushi rolls also stood out to me because everything was so fresh. Every bite was great. They also were crafted masterfully that they never broke apart when eating. I personally loved the neo Tokyo roll. Even people at my table that did not like raw sushi enjoyed these rolls. 

They also have a delightful menu for children. My son really enjoyed his wagyu sliders. And gobbled them up without sharing. He liked them so much he wanted more. The price was a fabulous deal too. I do love restaurants that give great options for children.

Service was spectacular from seating to payment. Fast timely, and courteous service was appreciated.  A dinner for four was paced perfectly with little intrusive interruptions.  And everything was faster than expected. I'm sad I didn't try this place sooner. It was a pleasant surprise that totally blew me away. 

It is however a Japanese restaurant with more cooked dishes available. Which is a nice change for picky raw Japanese eaters. I actually liked this place and the quality is on par with nobu or Mizumi.

Absolutely try the mini sea bass tacos, sea bass skewers, and any sushi!

The Saki menu is impressive, extensive, but very expensive.  I don't know really know fine Saki, so it is hard to justify $100+ for something I don't appreciate and typically stay away from that too.

It came with a side of fingerling potatoes with a sprinkling of some kind of cheese on top, which is called ""fries"" on the menu.  The pickles, I did not like - too tart.  I tried everything on my bf's anticuchos combination bento.  The box usually comes with chicken, beef and shrimp, but he requested the shrimp be switched out for the miso sea bass.

One thing that is always a priority on vacation is food. It has to be, this is a break from the mundane life I leave behind, so why do I want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? I love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. I didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.

I ordered the trio seaweed salad that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. Each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. Not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. For lunch I ordered yellowtail jalapeno which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a spicy tuna that was all sorts of bland. I think I would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food. I didn't order anything complex, and maybe they just let the ""easy"" stuff slide, but I wasn't terribly enthused enough to want to go back and give it a second shot to see just how good the rest of the menu is according to the higher ratings given.",0,0,0

The asparagus was very tasty too.

When we got there, the hostess set us at a table and asked us to move again because they had a reservation for party of 4, so they had to sit them there.  There were other tables with 4 people seats available, but we agreed to move.

When I was here last time, the waiter was very nice and friendly and he had a good knowledge of the menu, especially the tasting menu options.  However, this time, we did not like our waitress.  When I decided to go there, I had tasting menu in my mind and I asked her to give me more explanations on that as I wasn't the one to order last time.   I am not sure if she was new to this place or not, but she seemed like she had no idea what the tasting menu entails or she didn't want to sell it.  She basically said that there are 3 courses and they can customize it if we had any preferences or allergies.  However, she did not say anything about what kind of foods will be on the tasting menu, whether they are from the regular menu vs off the menu items and even what kind of foods we will be served.  When I asked for difference between different tasting menu options, she basically said the quality of meat and fish are different.  Everything she said was very vague.  

Although we still didn't really get much info that we wanted, since my experience last time was pretty good, we decided to do the tasting menu with the waygu hot stone bbq thing.  The few items that we got were tasty.  We liked wagyu dumpling and chilean sea bass with corns.  Their  ceviche taco thing was okay and we were not a big fan of the tuna appetizer that they brought out.  We got the wagyu bbq which I think is good to try it as a experience as the meat was tasty and it is a unique experience but I am not too sure if it is worth it to pay $128 for 4 oz wagyu to grill it on a hot stone.  

After trying their tuna dish, We realized that we can have sushi in LA too, so we asked the waitress to suggest something unique to the restaurant rather than sushi or rolls which we can get other places for part of tasting menu as she said she can customize it for us. However, she couldn't really give us any suggestions or tell us how they can customize for us.  By then, we were not happy about the service and some of the foods that we tried, so we decided to cancel the tasting menu and pay for whatever we ate and left early.  

Maybe my expectation was high for this place but I am really disappointed on their waitress' knowledge on their menu and some of the foods.  It was a very special night for us, so I really wanted it to be special but I have to say that dining at Sushi Samba definitely was not the highlight of our evening, rather more of a disappointment of the evening.  I saw every food item that we were served on the regular menu, so maybe it is better to stick with ordering off the menu rather than tasting menu and skip the wagyu hot stone bbq.  I won't be going back to this place in the future.

Go or No?  Go.

Tease:   SushiSamba is a Japanese Sushi and Peruvian fusion place in the Palazzo.

Why I went:   My wife and I wanted a late afternoon snack, and sushi sounded good.  We were staying at the Palazzo, so we figured we'd give the place a try.

When:  11\/17\/12

Food:   Between us, we got the shrimp tempura roll (generic, but pretty much as good as you could get), ume shiso roll (very flavorful), urchin, Spanish mackerel, and king crab.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  The overall menu looked super interesting and something worthwhile to check out in full for a dinner or lunch.  We just ordered small things as nibbles.    

Service:  Very good.  

Hints\/Final thoughts:  SushiSamba has enough interesting items on their menu to make it stand out.  Additionally, they do just enough traditional things to please some more hardcore sushi fans.  This is a fusion, so expect it in almost everything.  But the tastes are interesting and the food is fresh.",1,0,1

I would recommend making reservations as the place can get packed.

I came with a group of about 8. The menu is extensive. You probably won't know what to get especially if it's your first time at this joint. Our waiter, who was really nice and helpful, asked us how much we were willing to spend and he would take care of us.

Take care of us he did. We were set up with a 6 course meal which included Peruvian and Japanese style cuisine. I can't remember everything (because there was a lot of variety), but there was lots of good stuff like sushi and steak. Peruvian corn is TASTY!

Presentation of food was perfect. They are quick with filling water and the plates and utensils are elegant and unique. A few times during our meal, they replaced our plates with fresh ones.

We paid $45 each and we were all very satisfied because the meal was filling and not too much.

The service and the environment and professionalism they give you at the restaurant was well worth the money and I would definitely come back here.

The background music they would play was very samba. I was really diggin' it.

The bar area looked interesting. I would have sat down to have a few drinks if I wasn't too messed up for before.

The bathrooms were incredibly nice. However, I can only really speak for the men's room. It's like the urinals have their own big stall. You just have to see it. They have someone there asking if you would like some soap and after you're done washing your hands, they give you a REALLY soft towel to wipe your hands on. NICE!

Flawless service, excellent food, and the DJ-rocking atmosphere put Sushisamba at the top of my list for great Las Vegas dining. At first, I was skeptical. Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian dishes? And they all work together? The answer is yes, indeed they do.

If you're lucky enough to get Jimmy as your server, do follow his recommendations. His were spot on, plus he took excellent care of our table all evening. Jimmy suggested we give him a price point per diner, and then he delivered a sumptuous multi-course meal, taking us on a culinary trip to all three countries in under two hours. Oh, and did I mention I have a food allergy? Sushisamba didn't even blink. After my Celiac diagnosis three years ago, I thought I had to give up ""chef's choice"" or prix fixe meals. Not here. While most of our courses were GF, when they weren't the kitchen prepared GF versions especially for me, and I didn't have to agonize over my choices or worry about my safety. Sushisamba took care of everything.

And what dishes they were! Start off with a caipirinha, the signature drink of Brazil, and then let your server delight your senses. A few of the highlights: the tuna tataki; yellowtail taquitos; miso-marinated sea bass; and the moqueca mista. The moqueca mista was the crowd-pleaser of the evening, a beautiful seafood dish with the tastiest chimichurri rice I've ever had. But the star of the evening was the sushi.

I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. 

We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) 
- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) 
- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)
- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  
- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. 
- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! 
- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) 
- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! 
- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  

***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol 

OVERALL RATINGS:
Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)
Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! 
Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio
Presentation - 4 stars
Service & Ambiance - 4 stars

I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!",2,1,1

I ordered a couple of things, two different ceviches, one hamachi collar, and one whole roast fish (I was combining lunch and dinner budgets, because I was getting on a really long flight). I have to say, my server didn't bother trying to pace my food. The whole fish came right after the collar, and although they accommodated my request to take it back and keep it heated, it had definitely lost something. Minus one star for that, and the restaurant hadn't even become more than one-third full yet. Secondly, the two roast fishes were way too similar, even though the whole fish was advertised as having all kinds of goodness and was much more expensive than the simple collar. However, both ceviches were excellent and I suspect this place is much better at Latin-Japanese fusion than anything else (but what should I expect?). This place is probably worth exploring (and requires it), but you'll need a big wallet or some serious need to dine in cool locations. I would get my fix of this kind of cuisine elsewhere.",0,0,0

She wanted to have sushi on the Strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the Strip don't open until dinner, except SUSHISAMBA, so that's where we landed.  While we waited for them to open, I was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. The Peruvian Corn seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  Neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but I felt like I was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. But it was all uphill from there. 

Our server, Drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and I told him I had been to the one in Miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. When I tell you, you MUST order these, I'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, Peruvian Bay Scallops, prepared differently than the one on the menu. They were so good we had to order another round. I am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the Yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, I loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. Next up was a table favorite as well, Sea Bass Miso, it melted in your mouth.  I was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so I wasn't expecting the amazing flavor I tasted when I took my first bite. Drago suggested the El Topo roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, I normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. Then came the grand finale, my friend is a HUGE Kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the Wagyu beef, excellent grade A5, Ishi Yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  DESSERT, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the Peruvian Hot Chocolate con Crème served with traditional churros and the Coco Duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. The second one was by far the best. A must. Also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think I drank a pitcher of it.

If you're hungry, the ribeye and the rio grande are definitely filling and delicious. Overall I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like on the menu. 

Last time we were there, Jade constantly checked in on our table since we were running on a tight schedule and had a flight to catch. I always enjoy the the great food, the modern atmosphere, and the service always exceed my expectations.

We decided on this place and my friend made the dinner reservation. When we arrived, it didn't look like reservations were really needed as there were a good amount of empty tables during Saturday dinner time.

My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. It was odd because whenever I've sat at the bar, the sushi chefs would make conversation or at least greet us. None of them did. My friend ordered a 15 piece omakase (about $52 if I remember correctly). She thought it was just okay, but definitely not worth the price tag. I ordered a miso soup and the São Paulo roll. Okay $6 for a miso soup? Really? I mean I understand it's Vegas, but it literally tasted like a normal miso soup. The São Paulo roll was recommended as one of their most popular rolls. The first thing I noticed when it came out was how minuscule the fish portion was. Some pieces didn't even have a full layer of fish across the top. I wish I would've taken a picture to display what it looked like. For $24, I just expected a bit more. 

The service was so odd here. The hostess that was at the front when we checked in was not friendly. There were a few servers crowding around the end of the sushi bar where we sat. They were chatting it up amongst each other, which I thought made for a little unpleasant dining experience. Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed by this restaurant.",2,2,1

I do have some suggestions though. first of all, make a reservation or show up very early. second, instead of getting lost in the menu -- it's a fusion restaurant so think myriad choice and complexity multiplied by something other than binary -- have the wait staff put together a tapas selection based on their favorites. tell them how adventurous you are else up may end up with little fried crabs you're supposed to eat whole. just sayin. last thing, don't leave without trying the purple mashed potatoes.

We were a party of eleven and with that many pallets to please, we needed something different, we needed SUSHISAMBA. 

A couple people in the group had been here before and spoke highly of the fusion restaurant, but for many of us this would be our first time so we made a reservation for 7pm. Typically when we travel for business there is always one or two people who join your group at the last minute, so we held a table for thirteen just in case. 

Most of us arrived to the restaurant on time however two people were running a few minutes late but on their way. Unfortunately because we were not a party of ten, the server refused to seat us, even though it would only be a few minutes for them to arrive. She also said they could only hold our reservation for 10 minutes.  Needless to say, they arrived in time, but I thought that it was not only a poor business decision to seat us early (most people will enjoy a cocktail or two while waiting) but just rude. 

We were seated in the far back of the restaurant and the servers were very attentive. They quickly explained the Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese fusion concept of the restaurant and then without missing a beat he began to pitch us on the ""Chef's Choice"" option to the menu. I will admit, it was a good pitch, but obviously too good to be true. With this option the chef would listen to our likes and dislikes and create dishes that appeal to our tastes based on our budget, much like when dining at a Chef's Table.  The catch to this.... The restaurant was packed, there is no way the kitchen is creating anything special for us.... They're just serving menu items that will maximize your budget and increase your check. 

Sadly five of us fell for it and ordered the ""Chef's Choice"" menu, the rest of us ordered ala carte and decided we would share plates amongst each other and asked for separate checks.  Funny enough most of the plates that were being served off the ""Chef's Choice"" menu were the same plates we ordered, but with a few exceptions.  The food was good.  It by no means blew me away, but nothing I ate was bad and I really cant find anything negative to say about it. We had a number of small dishes that included edamame, seaweed salad, rock shrimp and wagyu gyoza, plus an assortment of sushi rolls. 

The checks came and as expected the ""Chef's Choice"" total was nearly $100 more than the ala carte (and we had an extra person).  I signed the bill, put the receipt in my wallet and didn't look at it again until I got back to the office and had to submit my expenses. 

As I reviewed the bill I took notice to the quantities of the plates ordered. We specifically ordered different items knowing that we were sharing, so I was surprised to see that I had duplicates on five items. I know we all liked the rock shrimp and ordered another plate, so that wasn't a concern. However there was only one other questionable roll that no one recalls ordering and the other three were definitely not ordered, delivered or consumed.... But we paid for it. 

We aren't talking about a lot of money here - $36 - $55, but it's the fact we were obviously taken advantage of.  Maybe the waiter wanted a bigger tip, perhaps the restaurant wanted to recoup some funds because we didn't take the ""Chef's Choice""? Either way I wrote the management group letting them know of my disappointment.  In the end I got an email from the general manager offering to return my $36 with an apology. 


As a chef, when I am dining out I expect my experience to meet an acceptable level of expectations that may differ from others, however lets face it, with so many choices available these days a restaurant has to be spot on to keep you coming back.  Apparently in this case SUSHISAMBA needs the money more than I do as I will not be going back.",1,1,0

The waiter even gave us an extra one, perhaps because of the rush. If we weren't full from the rolls and didn't observe our server motion to the kitchen that they were done several minutes before we received the skewers, then we would have asked for another order...

The seared wagyu beef is an ideal appetizer for two - the meat was so tender, and I felt like all the components of dish really complemented each other. Make sure you mix each piece of meat with the ponzu gelee and honshimeji mushrooms!

The chilean sea bass in its own right is amazing - hard to mess this up when the fish naturally has so much oil and fat to add to its flavor! The miso marinade was perfect. I think that perhaps the vegetables had too much char on them though

The one downside is that the prices are quite steep. However, with the frequency that hubby is able to have sushi, since most sushi rice has wheat in it to make it stick better, it was worth the 100$ check for two people.

Stick with one and make it amazing. Don't dabble in all three. Perhaps that's me being a traditionalist, but so be it.

The waitress seemed put off by the large quantity of us at the table. She huffed and puffed constantly. She highly suggested that we pick a dollar amount and stick with it. When we asked if we could order something from the menu separately, it was frowned upon. We'd tell her what we liked\/didn't like and they'd customize the menu for us - sticking to our chosen $$ range. If we didn't like something, they'd take it back and replace it with another item from the menu. In a way, kinda cool and makes sense but then again, it was frustrating. We couldn't pick things we eyed on the menu. We had to cross our fingers it showed up.

Sushi Samba is a blend of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine and they had plenty of dishes to choose from.

We got seated at the bar, which I find odd that you can't order straight from the sushi chefs that are standing right in front of you.  So it's like seating at the tables anyway, but your closer to the TVs and can stare at the fresh fishes available.  

We started with Seared Kobe Beef- ponzu geleé, warm Japanese mushrooms, truffled tofu crema, I thought it was a little too salty, but overall, the dish was very good.  

sashimi tiradito- Yellowtail jalapeño and lemongrass- the yellowtail was fresh and the sauce was good. It was more lemongrass tasting, didn't really taste the jalapeno. 

anticuchos which are two skewers served with peruvian corn (double the size of normal corn and a bit harder) Sea Bass and Miso- the fish was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  This was the most recommended dish and it was worth the try.  There was no fishy taste. 

Samba Rolls- El Topo- salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion- warm rolls, very tasty, melted right in my mouth.  

For sushi, their ika was good and their sake (salmon) was pretty darn fresh tasting. 

Their green tea was also very good. I believe it's $5.

The yellowtail sashimi tiradito was also wonderful. Thick slices of fish came in a bed of lemongrass and jalapeno sauce. 

The let down were the rolls. We ordered the green envy and the lima and both were a little weird. I'd say avoid the rolls. The flavors were just off and coming from LA where you can find fantastic rolls at many places, I wouldn't order rolls at Sushi Samba again.

Small plates:
Wagyu Beef Goyza - do not miss this! It was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.

Yellowtail Crispy Taquitos - light & delicious with an Asian dressing on the greens.

Robata:
Ribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.

Sea Bass - Phenomenal. There's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. Melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.

Samba Rolls:
Neo Tokyo: Similar to a spicy tuna roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. Fresh and great flavor.

Dessert: 
Fried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. Not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.

They pride themselves on Peruvian-Japanese-Brazilian fusion - all of which I really like on their own. But this combo it tasted more Panda Express than the promised Fogo-de-Ceviche-Tokyo.  Lunch was over $100 for the two of us. Neither of us had drinks and we both left a little hungry.

I tried the 'Yamato roll' which had foie gras, gold flecks, and fresh tuna. Sounded good, but then to my horror, they slathered teriyaki sauce over the whole combo! 

I then ordered the organic chicken skewer (Robata-style) with a side order of coconut rice. Again, the chicken was covered in some sugary yellow..something. And the rice was doused so heavily in coconut..something, that it was nearly risotto.  

The plain nigiri sushi pieces (salmon, salmon roe, and the tuna handroll) were fine, but not extraordinary. The yellow tail sashimi came waddled in something I can only describe as orange and tasted like plain Japanese curry sauce.

At least the decor, like everything Vegas, is unashamed and unaware over-the-top, (which i kind of enjoyed) and the service was friendly and prompt.

My boyfriend and I visited Sushisamba on the suggestion of the concierge at the Wynn. We wanted something that was moderately priced for a nice dinner, but not too expensive, and something ""exotic"" - not American, Italian, or Mexican. We were looking for a unique dining experience without being too fancy. Sushisamba hit the nail on the head.

Our appetizer rainbow sushi was one of the most wonderful things I have ever eaten. We had potsticker-type pork deliciousness that I don't even know what it was called, and then we had a pork belly entree which we split. I realize that I am not being very specific about what we ate, because all I remember was how freaking good it is and my mouth is watering at the thought.

A Sushisamba was short lived in Dallas and now I can see why...this would never fit in Dallas.  A very lively restaurant at the back end of the Palazzo Shops.  Once seated the very charismatic server explained that the menu, influenced by Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine, is designed to be shared by the table.  Definitely an odd sounding combination of countries for a menu but it worked out well.  Peru and Brazil are heavy on the meats, and with Peru having an Asian influence in their culture, it made perfect sense to fuse the three together. 

When dining with a large group here it can be very confusing as to what should be ordered with a shared menu concept.  Someone at the table should take charge of the ordering or ask your server to lead the way.  We relied on our server to guide us through.  He listened to our likes and dislikes a delivered a wonderful sushi platter.  The rolls were small but great flavor.  We enjoyed it so much we ordered a second platter.  Try the Samba Roll...lobster and mango served with a curry peanut sauce.  Still hungry we ventured to the Peruvian side of the menu and ordered the anticuchos served with Peruvian corn.  A sweet and heavy starch corn, much different that what we have in States.  The skewered meat was very sweet and tender.  Next were the fried mushrooms...a recommendation from the server.  These were outstanding...deep rich flavor fried in tempura.  This sounds like a lot of food but it is not.  I left quite hungry but satisfied with the quality of food and service we received.

It was very crowded on a Friday night, to be expected.  We called ahead but when we got there they said it would still be a very long wait so we decided to sit at the sushi bar.  The waiter was very nice and helpful with recommendations when we asked, but he was just swamped.  We ordered several small plates and they all came right in a row so that we didn't have much space and felt rushed to eat.  Our drinks (which we ordered first) didn't arrive until we were almost finished with our meal.  The mint julep was one of the worst I've ever had, but the other drink we got was fine so maybe that was just a one time thing on the mint julep.  Also our order got a little mixed up, we ordered two sushi items and when they brought it out one was correct and one was wrong.  But it looked good and the place was kind of hectic as I said, so we decided to keep it.

Now to the food: some dishes are really delicious.  I would recommend the Kobe beef carpaccio with mushrooms, it was a really nice combination of flavors.  And the duck skewers were cooked perfectly and came with a sauce underneath that was yummy but didn't overwhelm the duck.  The sushi items were fine but not special.

So we let him take the reigns and it was AMAZING. he brought several courses of Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian dishes and everything was delicious. I was so glad to be able to try foods ive never had before. I dont even remember everything that we ate, but i do remember the donut holes for dessert. they were soo good! at the end of the night we probably spent about $50 per person and it was all worth it for such an awesome dining experience.",2,1,1

I don't know where to begin... Let me just say I had the worst service by the rudest and most dismissive people at Sushi Samba - ever! 

- The edamame was cold
- Sushi rolls were tasteless 
- Appetizers - tasteless 

I made the waiter aware that I have a shellfish allergy and then I asked questions and ordered my food. When one of my rolls came out the waiter said,""The tempura is fried in the same oil as shellfish, but if you don't care we don't care either!"" 

Did you read what I just said he said to me?

Okay, so very confused I handed the cups of tempura back and ate my food very disgusted in how he talked to me. The main waiter pretty much avoided our table. When I told him what was said to me he said,""I don't know why he would say that to you."" Wait a minute does basic customer service ever occur to you people? How about you apologize! So he says I'm going to get the manager I said no don't.

He tells the manager anyway and the manager walks over in a drive by motion and drops the updated bill on the table and says we removed the roll and kept walking.

Again NO apology or acknowledgment! I didn't need the roll taking off, I just needed a sincere apology and they made it clear they weren't going to give me one. 

I asked myself why did they behave the way they did? I realized it was because we weren't dressed up like the other patrons. They assumed we were poor, so they treated us in a dismissive manner. They assumed that I was only complaining about the roll, because we couldn't pay our bill - false! 

Sometimes all customers want is to know that you appreciate their business and whatever mistake took place won't happen again and just maybe an apology to go with. 

Terrible service...",5,2,0

Food is what my ratings are all about, but good (or bad) atmosphere can certainly sway a star out of me as well. We went for the Omakase, which simply means the chef picks your entire menu.  I highly recommend it at any Japanese restaurant that offers, accepting that you're going to have a bit of a higher tab. That said you will also get the best of the best on the menu, without even thinking and that is exactly what we got.

On our last night in Vegas my husband requested either steak or sushi. Now, I don't care for sushi. I know it's an acquired taste and I'm working very diligently on acquiring it. So I said, ""let's do sushi."" We hopped on over to SushiSamba and were greeted warmly and sat right away. Our waitress was amazing. One of the best waitresses I think I've ever been waited on. She shared her favorites and offered to make suggestions\/ answer questions all without being snooty like you know they sometimes are. (maybe that's just me, maybe I'm projecting). 


We ordered: 
Mojitos - you can get muddled fruit added and we got pineapple. Seriously tasty. 
Tuna Ceviche - tuna, tomatoes, jalapenos, and more. This was my first time eating ceviche and I think I'm in love. 
Chef's Plate sushi and sashimi - I'm not big on sushi, I mentioned that right? This won me over, well, this won me over on raw fish. I've decided I don't care for the taste of seaweed so it's really just the rolls I don't like. Sashimi? Yes, please.
Trio of meats platter - you get to choose 3 or 5 meats. We did 3 - hanger steak, rib eye and linguica (which is a sausage, I didn't know what it was, had to ask). Oh my, just divine. Everything was cooked to perfection, the two chimichurri sauces that accompanied were amazing and it came with collard greens which I happen to love but my husband does not. He ate the collards. :) 

My only complaint is that I was too full for desert. I guess that is not the fault of SushiSamba but still, I was pretty disappointed. I also wished we hadn't eaten there on our last night because I would have liked to eat there again. Oh well, there's always next time.",3,2,3

Or we could just sit at the bar area with some nice, round wooden sofa chairs (I have no idea how to describe them but they were super comfy) which were first come, first serve. These seats were so comfortable that we wondered why anyone would even prefer a table.

Service was quick, and even though we weren't seated at a table, our server was very, very attentive.

We got the nashi cocktails which were amazing but not too fruity or sweet. We figured that since this seemed like a ""weird"" place, we would try to get ""weird"" things we wouldn't find elsewhere.

We ended up getting a bunch of things: 

- crispy jidori egg: which literally looked like a bird's nest and was very savory. the gnocci can come off as a bit too stuffy, but it held the crumbly meal together. the truffle and onion puree was subtle but definitely present.

- seared wagyu: OH MY GOD. there was just so much flavor in each bite, it was ridiculous. the truffle taste was very strong, but just below the line of becoming too overwhelming. I didn't really get the ponzu side... but the mushrooms on the side were almost as good as the wagyu beef. they should probably come up with a vegetarian dish around those mushrooms.

- the sao paulo roll: seemed like a regular roll really, I think there might have been too many flavors at work there that I never really noticed the scallop taste which was a pity.

- the sushi samba roll: definitely comes off as heavy nothing special but it was good. I felt bad that the lobster didn't really shine through on this one...

- edamame: the standard. my coworker who I was with said, ""the salt is really important in edamame."" and they had salted it well though I'm still not sure what he meant by that.

We also got two desserts: the soy cloud and the donuts. The soy cloud was a cheesecake made from soy milk and cream cheese, but it had the texture of light fluff. It was just so interesting, and we really wonderd how it was done. The donuts were served warm (and generously covered in sugar) with a side of ice cream. It reminded me of the popular korean dessert, ah-chu, which is warm churros covered with vanilla ice cream. The contrast in temperature and texture between the two really made it a joy to eat.

All in all, the rolls weren't that fantastic, but the main courses(?) were both interesting and delicious. And the cocktails and desserts really topped it all off.

At ~$200 with tax\/tip, it's on the pricey side, but given the ingredients they use, the price isn't for nothing. Might be back again if staying near the Venetian.",3,1,1

However, once we arrived, we were told it was at the bar area only. Whomp. The bar area is super small but we managed to snag a little table and squeeze all of our bodies around it. Not the most comfortable seating, but it'll have to do.

We ordered everything on their happy hour menu. All the dishes were about $5 and we wanted to try everything. Unfortunately our waitress came back 3 times just to tell us that they ""no longer had this item on their happy hour menu"". BOGUS! I asked why and she told me that their menu is ever changing and since we came on the last day of the month, ""they ran out of ingredients"". REALLY?!  So instead of eating, we decided to just drink and ate whatever few things they did have on happy hour. We ordered some rolls off their regular menu and they were all lacking.

Bad: We made a reservation for 9pm and were still left waiting 20min for a table. I feel whats the point of a reservation if your stuck waiting.
The Samba rolls are a little over priced, but its Vegas so its expected.
They don't give you wasabi....HELLO its sushi who doesn't give wasabi and pickled ginger. Instead you get this creamy green stuff they claim is wasabi but it's not. Not one hint of spice, tastes more like creamy avocado.
Also rolls are not full rolls like a regular sushi place, they are pretty small.

Good: Service was good, our waitress was attentive even though the place was slammed.
Also the rolls were tasty. If you do go for sushi the El Toro Samba roll is amazing, as well as the Pacifico. 

So for 7 rolls my bill was $95.00 and we eat them in l less time then our wait for them to be made.

We made reservations for 9 ppl and was seated right away as soon as everyone arrived.  The waiter, Max came by quickly and introduced himself and suggested we do a prefix menu (that he picks out based on a few questions he asked our group). He brought us our drinks and chatted with the table, since it was someone's bday at the table, he also bought us a round of shots.  Liza then came by and introduced herself to the table and asked if everything was good and wish ""happy birthday"" to the birthday boy.  Max and Liza came by our table multiple times to make sure our group was having the best time. Toward the end of the night, the table next to us started cheering, so our table started to cheers with them, which caused the whole restaurant to cheers (this continue to happen 5 times later throughout the night).  So my advise is that this restaurant could be very loud at times depending on the groups there. 

On to the food: it's AMAZING!!! the sea bass was delicious and the meat entree was very good too.  The sushi was very fresh and tasty and they had this roll w\/ melted mozzarella cheese, weird combo but it worked - it was probably my favorite roll on the sushi plate.

I was extremely excited to try this place because of all of the positive reviews\/rants I've heard. I am always looking to try new Sushi places and I must admit that I am quite the Sushi expert!

The first thing I must say is that this place is pricey! For $85 I only able to order:

- 2 glasses of Cabernet Sauvignons
- 2 Miso Soups ($6.00 each and only had 1 Tofu in each bowl of soup)
- Rainbow Dragon Roll
- 2 Avocado Salmon Rolls
- 1 Piece of Salmon Sashimi (embedded in an unknown vegetable)
- 3 Hand Rolls

May I remind you that all of this was shared between two people. The portion size was fairly small. However,the freshness and the quality of the fish was amazing. That is probably the only thing positive about this restaurant. Oh yes, can't forget the fancy lighting and ambiance.

I was not impressed by the originality of the menu nor the taste of the food. I have tasted better sushi rolls for more than half the price of a Sushi Samba roll.

The miso soup did feature cilantro, but I can't say it went to anyplace that miso hasn't been already. The robata were as well prepared and flavorful as any I have had in town. And, oh that Peruvian corn: giant kernels of sweet maize. It came with the robata, and I thought it was divine.

I don't even know where to start. 
Honestly, the reviews are completely deceiving and I was highly disappointed! 
I was so bummed because we were on a really good streak of eating amazing food in Vegas too! 

Straight to the point.
The entire experience was not at all what we were expecting. 
The ambiance is really nice however, it is pretty dim -and seemed more like a club\/bar lounge than a restaurant. Honestly, I would go to a whole in the wall looking restaurant with delicious food than something that just ""looks"" nice. 
As an avid sushi consumer, please believe me when I say the food here is a complete disappointment! Save your winnings and go elsewhere-- McDonald's is not too far away you know. 

What we ordered: 
I'm so mad right now I don't even remember the names of the food we ordered! But we had a group 10 people. And NO ONE liked their food. The portions seemed to have been aimed for people that are about the size of a 3 yr old with the price of a pasta entree at an Italian restaurant. I mean, really- almost $20 for two less than 4 inch skewers of meat? What the hell is that? No sides- nothing. Just that. 
My sushi rolls were more bland than an infant's pureed cereal! 
We were all in disbelief. So much that traded of our sushi rolls with one another to see if it might have been what we ordered that wasn't tasty. 

Customer service:
The waiter was set on how we should order when she came to our table. 
She heavily ""suggested"" that we order food as a ""family style"" in which every rolls, tempura, skewers and all are placed in the middle of the table and you grab what you eat kinda thing. Considering not everyone eats the same portion or even like the same things -how the hell are you going to split the bill fairly? We decided not to order that way and asked if she could place everyone's items on separate plates. Which didn't end up happening. They squeeze 4 rolls onto one plate which 
(1.) Looked messy 
(2.) We couldn't distinguish which roll belonged to who 
(3.) The flavors and sauce of each roll started to mix together.

The concept is incredible: japanese-peruvian fusion. It has such a fun and creative menu.

At first glance, you may think it's not going to be good for vegetarians, but actually there are quite a few options.

The clear winner for me was the Crispy Jidori Egg - it came out perfectly cooked (love that runny orange yolk!) and the kabocha gnocchi was delightful. The generous helping of black truffle shavings didn't hurt either.

I wasn't sure it was going to be enough food (and it is a little on the small side for a full meal), so I ordered the Amazonia roll, which looked interesting and definitely veg. It was pretty good, but I'm not sure it was $12 good. I might go with something else next time.

The selection of beer and sake is great - they have anything you could possibly want, including dark Asahi (soooo good).

The sushi rolls are huge, so I recommend just ordering one.  Well, one roll will cost you as much as an entire steak dinner at a normal restaurant so to overdo it.  However, if you just won at the tables and would really like to splurge, then go ahead and take the hit.

Typical of all the overpriced restaurants in Vegas, the service is exceptional.  Many people also come here for the décor.  It feels like you are walking into the inside of an anatomical oversized sculpture.  Just sit down, hand them your wallet, and remain calm.

This restaurant never ceases to amaze me with how good the food is and how good the service is. It is located in a very good area of the shops closer to Palazzo than Venetian and the architecture of the restaurant is very cool. We ordered a lot because we had not eaten yet: we ordered the yellowtail scallion rolls, which have a little bit of rice with a lot of yellowtail with scallions and literally melt in your mouth. We ordered the Chilean sea bass which was incredible and the Peruvian corn side dish and seaweed salad appetizer. The vegetable tempura was also outstanding. We received two complimentary samples of a scallop on a shell with a fabulous array of ingredients to top it that was delicious. The house ice tea is one of the best ice teas that I have ever had. We share a form of banana split with really cool features. The ice cream and whisky whipped cream were a total wow, surrounded by fresh berries

The fusion of Japanese and South American flavors are a perfect combination.  Since I like my food on the spicy side, I found that Sushi Samba adds that flare to usually very neutral sushi.  

The one dish I found to be my favorite of the visit was the Hamachi (Yellowtail) Sashimi Tiradito.  Hamachi is always a great choice for its oil content, but along with the spicy\/tangy sauce it is served on is a more than suitable replacement for shoyu.  I also tried the Yamato Roll, which is sushi with maguro and  foie gras, a great and unique flavor.  One disappointment I found was the Kobe Beef Sushi.  I would rather have had otoro.  One last recommendation, don't order collard greens at a sushi place.  It was decent although it was no southern style collard greens that I prefer.

Go figure.

I'm a bit of a millionaire (actual percentage varies but it has been known to exceed the single digits) so I decided that I was going to pick up the check on dinner for the three nights we were in town. I made all the reservations and I made sure we were all on time. I am that kind of guy. This is how I have amassed my aforementioned fortune. Details. The deets.

We got to Palazzo a few minutes late, actually, so disregard anything I said about our timeliness. Anyway, they seated us right away. We had a nice round table with a view of a support column. It was one hell of a sexy support column, mind you. All white and supporty-looking. Damn. I bet it works nights on the other side of town if you know what I mean right right right?

OK this review is getting carried away with itself, I'm sorry about that. Realizing that most of my family were classless heathens from New Hampshire I decided to let the waitress know our food allergies and from there, order anything she thought we might like. This might be the time to let you know that if you do this, they do a very good job of selecting tasty, pain-free food, but it may result in somewhat of a shock to your wallet. Just an FYI, really. Five people, with limited alcohol being served, and the bill came to about $450 after tip.

A dent in my bank account, you see, as I am ballin' out of control. I want to say something about making it precipitate that hasn't already been said but I can't think of something witty enough to include here. Please imagine dollar bills falling from cumulus clouds at a rapid pace.

Everyone was happy with the meal, though on the way in one of our group suggested that we go to Senor Frogs instead, and I almost did a 180 and walked back to my white Audi A5 2.0T with tan leather trim and drove all the way back to LA that instant, leaving my brother behind, even though he wasn't the one who made the comment. Almost. But I didn't, because it was mom's 60th birthday weekend and I wasn't going to let them bring me down, bro.

PS we ended up going to Senor Frogs for drinks after and it was fun, too. My brother ordered a drink that almost came out in a glass shaped like male genitalia. These are the moments that Instagram was invented for, brother.

This is a little misleading. I swear this came up under ""Chinese"" on Yelp while we were looking for something (in a group of four) but this is definitely not Chinese. It's Japanese Brazilian fusion, which I had never had, but was awesome. The menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, ""are you OK with raw fish,"" ""do you have allergies,"" ""how do you eat red meat,"" etc. This was helpful - usually I'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason I was having problems focusing. Worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.

What we got was really pretty exceptional. Gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. All sounds fancy, all really good.

Then a warm plate - grilled sea bass with a sweet glaze, filet mignon (not their A5 wagyu, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and king crab leg, all with a side of elote. The bass was good - tender and flaky, and I like the glaze. But it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. Firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at N9NE. Tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. And the crab was that near oh my god moment. An *enormous* king crab leg, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. Wow, this was exceptional. And while I guess I should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a crab leg family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.

Finally, sushi. Their Neo Tokyo roll, which is their version of the spicy tuna, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. As well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. All of the cold rolls were good - I especially liked their Neo Tokyo roll. The sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...I could do without. It was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. However, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. This was about the only misstep I could find.

The atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of Brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, Brazilian slums, and Japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. Not sure what they were going for. But whatever.

Great spot - Chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. The total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. I loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. If you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.",2,0,1

Naturally, I immediately assumed it was sushi with a bit of a twist, but I didn't really expect the menu they had in store! They offered a very cool Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian fusion (not your everyday mash-up!) and everything was executed brilliantly. I was a touch put off at the outset when the waiter told us that he could create a dinner experience FOR US without much of our input. After finding out about food allergies, dietary restrictions, etc. he gave us a ballpark of about $50 - $60 per person and took it from there. We, quite literally, ordered NOTHING off of the menu - everything that we ate was something that our waiter thought would be a hit for us. While I was skeptical, it actually worked out well! He brought us some amazing dishes (the corn that accompanies the sea bass is insanely good and the ahi tacos were stellar) though we could have probably done with a couple fewer dishes. We left absolutely stuffed and very impressed. 

I'm sure we could have kept it under $100 (not including drinks) if we were to order on our own (we got a LOT of food, including a few orders that probably wouldn't have been on our agenda), but if you're okay with the price range laid out, they do know their stuff!

We have never eaten there, but we love sushi and Brazilian food so we figured we'd give it a try.  Wow - am i glad we did. We live in Las Vegas and eat out quite often. I have always believed that while the food in a restaurant is important, a review on food may not be that helpful.  We all have different tastes - for example, we are not big ""spicy food"" eaters. So someone with different tastes might not find our food review that helpful.  However, one aspect of dining i believe is extremely important, and also very helpful in a review, is the service. And, while the food was excellent (I'll get to it) the service is what really made this restaurant stand out. 

Service: Our server was Mike D and the manager that evening was Allen Holmes. The first thing i noticed was Mike's product knowledge.  He introduced himself and asked if we had been there before. Once he found out we were new to the joint, he began asking us what we liked and explaining both the food and extensive sake menus. We found out through Allen that the servers go through extensive training and try all of the food as well as most of the Sake at tastings they have each week. That way they can learn how to pair the food with different drinks. Mike suggested a number of dishes and we ended up ordering most of them. The appetizers arrived pretty quickly and as I'll describe below, some were nothing short of amazing. Upon the suggestion of Mike, my fiancee ordered the Sea Bass and I the Rib-Eye special. Both were so insanely good we just could not believe it.

Mike was attentive and very engaging. He didn't bother us, but at the same time he made sure we were enjoying our dinner and seemed to enjoy taking a moment to get to know us. It seemed to make him happy we were having such a good time at dinner.  This is NOT something you see with most servers in Las Vegas. To add to the service, the bar manager Allen stopped by our table and and chatted with us, making sure we were having a good time. We spent some time talking with him about the restaurant - He seems to really know his business and it was impressive to hear how much he enjoys working there. 

We didn't have time for dessert since the show was about to start, but we looked at the menu and told Mike we would be back after the show.  We went back for dessert and Mike made a point to say how nice is was to be able to serve us twice in one night. Allen also came back and said hello - and brought over some Farofa (Brazilian dish that has the consistency of sand - not my favorite, but she loves it) because my Fiancee had commented that next time she wanted to try it - He remembered. What I also found was pretty amazing was that Mike had saved the bottle of water we had ordered at dinner on ice - in case we returned. Since it hadn't been finished - we didn't have to order a new bottle. WHO DOES THAT!! 

Food: As for the food, the appetizers ranged from OK to amazing.  The Tuna Tataki and sushi roll we ordered were OK. The tempura shrimp and vegetables were very good - light and crispy, not oily. The best appetizer for me was the GYOZA. I eat steamed dumplings everywhere i go if possible and these were the best i have EVER had. I wanted to order 3 more, but decided to wait for my meal. Glad I did!. My Fiancee ordered the Sea Bass. Mike said it was the most popular item on the menu.  We understand why.  The best she has ever eaten. I agreed after tasting it. The sweet sauce that comes with it was insane.  The Rib-eye special I ordered came in a covered dish - sizzling like a fajita. It was tender, juicy and cooked to perfection (medium rare). Rib-eye is my favorite dish and this was just different enough (yet the same) to make it one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately, its a special, so I'm sure it wont be around forever.

Lastly, when we returned for dessert we ordered the cheesecake and sundae - both were deconstructed versions of the two dishes. Very tasty - especially the caramelized popcorn they use in the sundae. I finished my meal with a nice port wine and cup of cappuccino.

All in all it was such an unexpected treat it made a night out in Vegas spectacular.  Which is rare for 2 people who have lived here for over 14 years.",0,0,0

If however you are interested in being more cultured in regards to your typical sushi restaurant, then you may continue reading.

Sushi Samba is a great restaurant to taste a blend of very unique flavors...the menu is not your typical one but rest assured, your server is happy to answer any of your questions. The server started off by asking us if we've been there before...I have so I said yes. If I would have said now, he would have prefaced our meal with a story of the restaurants background i.e. stylings of food, etc. I know this because I overheard another server doing it. 

With any tapas joint it is always easy to over order...and me, my bro, and his fiance did just that. Here is what we got.

-Shishito (grilled peppers): the sea salt adds a great flavor, the peppers themselves are literally grilled
- Filet Mignon robata: a small portion of robata grilled filet mignon cooked exactly how I wanted
- Sea Bass and Miso swewers: recommended by our server, these skewers were OFF THE HOOK!!!! Melted like butter in my mouth...the miso flavor was out of this world.
-Miso soup: the only difference between this soup and the others...they add cilantro
-Coconut Rice: the side order of rice could actually feed 2 people. We ordered 2 not knowing this. The coconut flavor is not at all overpowering...I've gotta learn how to make this rice!
-Green envy roll: YUM!!! salmon and tuna rolled with some crunchies to make this fine number
-Spicy Tuna Roll: not as spicy as I thought it would be but still yummy
-Rio Grande (5 meats): this meal on its own came with black beans, collard greens, rice, 5 different meats, and 3 sauce pairings. WOW! You need to order this...there was 3 of us and we couldnt finish but the options were great. The sauces were extremely complementary.

Sure our meal came out to $172.69 pre gratuity for 3 people but for the service, quality and presentation of the food, and the ambiance...the price seems quite fitting.",2,0,0

We were all seated separately (understandable), but were under the impression also that we would all be able to order whatever we wanted from the menu.  Well, that night, the manager told the bachelorette that we had a fixed menu (which was not told to her at time of reserving), and that there was nothing he can do about it.

I was really craving Sushi on the day we arrived in Vegas, the weather was amazing as usual, and I just needed something good. We hadn't tried Sushi Samba yet, so we made a reservation and added in that we were celebrating our Wedding anniversary.

I got the spicy Tempura Rock Shrimp, which was good but portion size should have been nearly double what we received, since it cost almost $20 (for an appetizer) I mean it was a lot of lettuce and greens, not much shrimp.

Next we got 2 yellowtail Taquitos and my husband ordered Robata - chicken and Berkshire Pork Belly - and the waiter tried convincing us we needed the filet mignon and duck breast instead - which were ""better"" - (he actually meant they were more expensive) and we did not want them. Not a fan of duck breast, my husband once again specified Chicken and Pork. The Peruvian Corn that comes with the Robata was outstanding - delicious! That corn may have been the first highlight of our meal.

We ordered a couple of sushi rolls and they were good - just not memorable. I just wanted a ""WOW"" experience and it never happened.

I am a fan of Japanese Whisky, but I never got any - I ordered some cucumber and gin cocktail instead which did not taste good at all - I regretted it at $15 per drink. They brought out 2 glasses of complimentary champagne for our anniversary, which was more palatable than my cocktail. That was the 2nd highlight of our meal. Overall, we spent $150 on food that was fun and cute, but did not satisfy. But...when in Vegas, I guess. I've eaten better for a quarter of that price. I was full for about an hour, and then started getting hungry again.

1- the Kumamoto oysters they served were bad.  Like old and spoiled bad.  It took half the remainder of my dinner to get the taste out of my mouth from one of them.
2 - No Brazilian beer.   I ordered a Brazilian lager and 10 minutes later was told they were out of it.  I then ordered a South American Pilsner and they were out of that.  I then decided not to drink.  After mentioning the oyster quality to our server, the manager asked what they could do.  Well, they found that Pilsner they were out of.

The sushi was decent, but not exceptional. The Brazilian fish stew was rather boring, the coconut rice, beans and quinoa about average and the grilled eggplant not so good.  I was hoping for the eggplant that Sensei can deliver.

Tables are very small for the larger number of dishes and it's extremely loud.

I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese fusion.  I haven't been to Peru, but feel that Brazilian cuisine is about as good as  English food.

We started with sake and also got a few cocktails. I got the cucumber cocktail which was delicious and not too sweet.

- seared wagyu beef: thin tender pieces of meat with a delicious sauce and TRUFFLE
- broiled peruvian bay scallops: the sauce on these were incredible- disappointed that there were only 3, because I could have eaten like 5 myself
- crispy jidori egg: kind of strange but good flavor. almost like a bird's nest appearance. I wasn't sure what I was eating but it tasted pretty good.

I really was disappointed because my Mom's side of the family are Asian immigrants to Brazil who had lived in South America for decades. I really thought this was going to be Brazilian style Sushi, but it wasn't. A lot of people don't know this, but Brazil has the 3rd largest population of Asians outside of Asia.  1st being the USA, 2nd being Canada, and 3rd being Brazil.  Did you also know that Brazil has more Japanese residents than the United States? So, I was very excited that a place like this opened up. 

I am a big fan of ""fusion sushi"".  I love new and creative twists on the oldschool style maki, but Sushisamba just doesn't do it as well as other sushi restaurants. Sushi is really really popular in Brazil.  And unlike Americans, the Brazilian sushi houses tend to be very traditional. That means that they don't really like California rolls or other types of fusion sushi that is popular in America.  But, the menu here is more similar to Ichiro Mashita's American style sushi. 

Sushisamba prides themselves on having ""fresh fish"", that is of higher quality than smaller sushi restaurants and that is their justification for charging higher prices. But, even places like Sushi Bomb(North West), Sushi on Rainbow(Koreatown), Sushi Twister(Boulder Highway) and even the overrated Goyemon(Southwest) have fresh fish flown in everyday, and some of these places even keep the fish alive in tanks until the day of serving. And they only charge a fraction of what this place does. You know, even the Edomaezushi style Kabuto restaurant's prices are lower than this place.  

I guess I'm just really upset over the fact that they hyped this place up as a Brazilian-Japanese style restaurant and it wasn't any of that. It wasn't Brazilian cuisine and it really wasn't authentic Japanese cuisine. And, I just recently found out that the owner of this place is a guy named Matthew Johnson. That doesn't sound Brazilian or Japanese to me. 

You know how a lot of full-blooded Japanese yelpers always complain about how they hate Sushi bars that are owned and operated by non-Japanese Asians and have Latino cooks? Yet, this place is owned by a White man from New York City and we don't find those same Japanese Yelpers complaining? Why is that? Someone explain that to me? Where is Alex S and Hootie B??",0,1,1

This place is great for groups.  I was with a group of 8 and we were in party mode.  The ambiance added to it... I would say that it has sort of a loungey\/clubby atmosphere, but dress is casual.

Our waiter was awesome.  I wish I could remember his name.  We basically told him what we liked and didn't like and he created our menu for us.  We had so many different plates that I can't remember them all.  We had a lot of sashimi, a lot of rolls, and some in-betweens.  The ones that stick out in my mind are the Yellowtail Seviche Taquitos and the Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass... DELISH.  They also served us these raw, semi-thin slices of Kobe beef with a bunch of different sauces and spices that we could dip it in before searing it on a hot rock!

We also had a few bottles of expensive sake and were taking shots all throughout dinner...  KUNG PAO!

With all that said, there are two reasons I didn't give Sushi Samba 5 stars.  The quality of most of the fishes was good, but not great.  This was more evident in the sashimi-style dishes.  Also, the pricing is a bit steep.  Our meal ended up being about $200 per person.

Featuring a special ""Election Day Menu"" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opportunity!

Drinks on the menu:
* Obamarama (blue) for $11 ""Svedka Citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry"" - Really good the first time around. Pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  The guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  The second time I ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  A good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; I passed the second one off.

* Maverick (red) for $11 ""Pearl Vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava"" - Served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  Pretty tasty as well. I enjoyed it.

Bites to eat:
* Shishito Peppers ($2) ""grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon"" - They give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  I tried one and found that to be good enough.  Didn't really care for more.

* Organic Chicken Aji Amarillo Anticucho ($2) - I found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the Peruvian corn that came with the dish.  That was the best part of it.  Our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? Hmm... 

* Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll ($3) - Really good roll!  I liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  I like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  And the slight crunch is nice too.

* Salmon Avocado Roll ($3) - Pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  But it was fresh fish and good.  I'm sad I didn't order more.

* Mini Chicharron de Calamar ($3) ""cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain"" - Our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  Ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  It wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  I don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  

* Japanese Chicken Wings ($4) ""teriyaki and sesame"" - It's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  Good, but messy.

* Chilled Oyster Sampler ($4) ""ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters"" - Really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  We were supposed to get another order before we left, so I missed out on more!  Next time!

* Mini Yellowtail Seviche ($4) ""ginger garlic and soy"" - Reminded me of Hawaiian poke with the dressing.  It was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.

* Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos ($4) ""shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce"" â"" Two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  Very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  Our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!

* Rosca ($9) ""homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce"" â"" Recommended by our bartender\/waitress as her favorite dessert.  Four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  Disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.

We spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  So, the girl making our drinks also served us.  She was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (Our drinks were good for the most part except for that second Obamarama we ordered.  But hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  I had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  With certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  Our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (Makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)

Overall, we had a decent experience at Sushi Samba.  You definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.

3.5 stars.

They also offer a happy hour (Sunday through Thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.

i recommend the 25$ teriyaki chicken. the way sushisamba prepares chicken teriyaki is unlike any restaurant that ive ever been to. i was expecting some cookie cutter skimpy chicken teriyaki. but to my surprise the chicken teriyaki came on top of a pile of purple mash potatoes and tasted AMAZING. the chicken was flavored perfectly and.. it melted in my mouth. moist, juicy, tender, man did i enjoy chewing that day. in combination with the mash potatoes makes for a most savory dish. 

sushi is also a good option here. sushisamba sushi comes lightly wrapped in rice rather than how sushi restaurants ordinarily fill their rolls with rice. i liked that. it accentuated the other ingredients such as kobe beef, caviar etc. we pretty much ordered all the rolls and each one was different from the next. although i cant say i enjoyed the kobe beef one as it was kind of bland. also, i wouldnt recommend the oysters because its quite ordinary.",4,3,3

The waitress was ok. I ordered a beer, which I had to ask for twice because I didn't get it after about 10 minutes.

The nigiris and rolls were really great so I suggest you try atleast one of the rolls(all of them are unique and good) and order lots of the nigiris if you're not doing omikase! It is a fusion with Brazilian Japanese and Peruvian so they do have some dishes such as Peruvian corn, etc different stuff that they make for presentation and taste! The only reason why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because some of their ""best"" wasn't to die for or anything. And the truffle oil is an acquired taste and I absolutely disliked it (it leaves such a smelly after taste in your mouth) so you can always tell them not to put that!

A great thing though is that if you don't like something you can let them know and they'll make you something else in replacement of the course that you didn't like.

SUSHISAMBA made a huge impression on me from the very first time I visited in 2011. Food, service, ambiance, decor = always impressive and amazing! Since then, I've celebrated two of my birthdays there, and always make it a point to visit each and every time I'm visiting Las Vegas. 

During my first few visits, I'd dine here for their unique sushi rolls with aji panca sauce (made with Peruvian chili peppers), and especially their tiradito (Peruvian-style sashimi). I would often order the kanpachi tiradito with yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, and the yellowtail tiradito with jalapeño and lemongrass -- both absolutely amazing, and unlike anything I've ever had before! I remember the first time I dined here with a friend and we ordered the tiradito. We enjoyed the sauce so much that we each ordered a second bowl of rice just so we could finish the sauce that was left over in the plate and put it on top of the rice so it wouldn't go to waste! 

But that was THEN!

I no longer order the tiradito that made such an impression on me. Now, since 2014, it's an absolute must that I visit my favorite sushi chef at SUSHISAMBA, the AMAZING Chef John Um, who creates the most unbelievable, OFF-THE-MENU, omakase-style plates of edible sushi art that I (and most likely you, too) have ever seen! Chef John not only takes pride in selecting the freshest, quality fish for his sushi bar and staff to serve, but the man's work is inspired by art and his incredible plates of sushi reflect this perfectly. He also chooses fish that I have never tried or seen on the menu at any other sushi bar that I've been to. His sushi seems to be influenced by Peruvian tiradito, and often creates unique sauces that he adds onto his canvas-like plates to be dabbed onto each piece of sashimi or sushi which enhances the flavor of the fish. These sauces are preferred to be used in place of soy sauce or shoyu because the fish is so fresh and amazing alone that IMO, the overpowering soy sauce only kills the flavor of the fish! 

I ""discovered"" Chef John's amazing edible art while browsing Instagram (@chefjohn -- you should definitely check it out!), and I've posted a couple of photos of the incredible sushi that I've had the privilege to order from Chef John during a few previous visits! During my most recent visit in September 2015, Chef John wasn't there, but one of the other amazing sushi chefs created a sashimi sampler plate for me! I posted that one too. Needless to say the presentation was absolutely stunning as well, and I can't wait to see what they create for me next time I'm there!

I understand the intent, but it was my bday and XS was calling my name. Oh and, they pour great drinks - a plus and rare practice in Sin City.

Anyway, the food is worth roughly 10 golden, shining stars. Get the yellowtail taquitos, don't ask questions, JUST GET THEM. You can thank me later. But really, ANYTHING on this menu is decadent.

One of the other reasons I like the joint is... Sushisamba. 

All fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing I can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  And that's more than I can say for a few others that are no longer at the Palazzo.   It's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will. 

Favorites from the menu... Moqueca mista (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the sea bass are my favorites of the full entries, which I wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  Save big plates for your second or third go round.  Almost anything with the wagyu is a hit; I think sushisamba drives the South American flavors home using fine Japanese beef.  But if it works... 

The Yamato roll... Epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  Super indulgent foie gras and wagyu are almost a taste bud assault.   But at the same time, you have to try it-share it. The Saõ Paulo and the Neo Tokyo are my favorites here.   The Samba Strip is also pretty awesome.  Again, pile enough good things together and see what happens. 

The so so and not so on the menu... If anything ... Rock shrimp (discontinued) and Tiger shrimp tempura.   Mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   The robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber.

I arrived first and waited at the bar and got a Moscow mule. It's a circular bar that is half inside and half outside the restaurant so it's great when you're waiting for your party to arrive.

We were seated inside and the ambiance is really lively. It was pretty dark inside but they were really busy for a Wednesday night ( but that could be because our entire company pretty much took over the hotel that week). Our waiter took out drink, We got the lemon samurai which was really good. I think it had vodka and some citrus notes in it, also a little strong but that's a good thing right? :) 

Our waiter returned and gave us a thorough breakdown of all the options we had. Basically you can order what you want or you can have the chef whip up a meal for you based on your likes and dislikes. We decided to order a bunch of different dishes (they're tapas style btw). 

We started with the Otsumami (edamame, tempura green beans, and grilled shishito peppers) which was really good. I liked the tempura green beans (could be cause it's fried lol). We also got the crispy taquitos, salmon ceviche, yellow sashimi tiradito, the ribeye tobanyaki, and the Sao Paolo roll. Most of this was recommended by our waiter and other recommendations we received.

Everything came out really quickly actually. And everything was DELICIOUS. The taquitos were super good the only thing about them was the shell was really flimsy and practically broke apart when you picked them up. The salmon ceviche was really good and had a nice kick from the jalapeños. We had some colleagues that said we HAD to get the yellow tail tiradito and it was really good! It actually tasted like a Dorito lol but I would definitely say to order one of the tiradito dishes. The only hot plate was the ribeye tobanyaki which the table next to us got so we decided to try it and the beef was super tender. 

The service was really great, our waiter was very tentative and knowledgable. My colleague had to ask us what he said after he was done talking because she thought he was so cute lol.

Vegas is about the latest clubs, the crazy pool parties, and always the massive selection of fine restaurants.  Coming from the SF Bay Area, I've been lucky enough to be blessed with great cuisine, so, going to Vegas to dine is more about trying out new places and checking out the amazing decor of the restuarants.  Despite this fact, oddly, enough, I have been to Sushi Samba 5 times now and counting!!!  This is the only restaurant that I have been to more than once there minus the late nights at the Grand Lux Cafe...LOL.  But, I think that definitely says something.  This place has the top quality sushi and a very rare pairing of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian flavors.  I absolutely love the variety of dishes and the friendly and hip feel of the environment.  Just check out the menu and you will know what I mean.  You can do ribeye steak, sushi, oysters on the half shell, porkbelly ramen, Samba cobb salad and sashimi cerviche all in the same place.  Plus, throw in the hip Vegas feel, cool music and presentation and you're in business.  Also, the restaurant is kinda cool to in a way, that it is tucked away from the busy part of the hotel.

The service sucked big old donkey balls.  Our waitress was SO rude, short and annoying.

I get the whole family style and how it makes it easier with larger parties, but at least tell a sister that when she makes a reservation instead of springing it on her when she sits down. 

Then don't refuse to bring menus, get pissed when we ask for them, or be brusque and rude when taking orders or bringing food.

The decor of SushiSamba, like other restaurants at the Palazzo, are really well decorated and ornate.  The interior had a curvaceous geometric style to it with muted colors which gave a modern approach to the Brazilian vibe they mixed with their Japanese-styled menu.

THE STAFF -

We made reservations a few days before, which is very crucial.  The front desk ladies were very charming and were very polite.  Our waitress, Isabela, was phenomenal in service; and, let us take our time when enjoying our meal.  She did not rush us, she got our orders in quickly and managed the meal quick and neatly.

THE FOOD - 

I started appetizers off with their Kumamoto oysters, Salt and pepper squid, and Coco Leite.  The Kumamoto oysters were catched from the west coast of the hemisphere, and were $5.00 each, so I just had to order six of them.  The oysters itself were quite miniature, which I did not mind at first, but I think it's quite expensive for how little we got.  The salt and pepper squid had bold flavors of shichimi pepper and sea salt which was a bit acerbic to the appetizer itself.  The Coco Leite was nothing special, it was literally 90% ice and the rest was juice.

Our entrees came out at the exact same time which looked scrumptious.  My friend had their Samba strip (which is their Maine Lobster), and I ordered their Neo Tokyo (which had bigeye tuna).  I really enjoyed their succulent Lobster, which also came with delectable sushi rolls.  Their menu has a bunch of Vegetarian and Pescatarian friendly foods to choose from.

For dessert, I ordered their Mochi, and my friend and I shared their Yuzu Tart Cheesecake which looked absolutely magnificent.  My Mochi had four very contrasting flavors, and two very homey flavors like cookies & creme, and chocolate.  I really enjoyed the green tea flavor which is my favorite.  My friend's Cheesecake came with a huge sugar sphere with cracker crumbs all around that gave a majestic vibe to the plate.  

To recap, we ordered the following :

Kumamoto Oysters($5.00 ea)

Salt and pepper squid ($15.00)

Samba strip ($19.00)

Neo tokyo ($16.00)

Mochi ($10.00)

Yuzu Tart Cheesecake ($13.00)

We sat down at the bar and crickets....No one came over to greet us, wink something to at least acknowledge our presence..15 minutes later the bartender comes over and realizes we are sitting there, doesn't say they are sorry just, have you""guys"" ordered yet? ""guys?"" I hate that..I am a woman!

The servers ask you for allergies, food preferences, etc. and tailor the tastings based on that.  One of our group is a pescatarian, so they brought extra seafood to that side and less land animals.

I cannot remember all of the food that was presented, nor did my eyes and stomach allow me to take pictures of it.  I just dove in (along with the rest of the party).  

My absolute favorites were the ceviche taco and the fish skewers.  I don't remember the type of fish but it was so perfectly marinated and cooked. There was wagyu beef gyoza and other items, but those stood out the most.  When we thought we couldn't eat anymore, they brought out rolls of fresh sushi.  Who says no to sushi?

I'm always apprehensive when I dine with a large group, no matter where I am. This was no exception since I came with a group of 20.

They had several people satelliting around the table getting our drinks, refilling water, taking used plates etc. We did a omakase style and had several waves of food hit the table. It was all beautifully presented and delicious!
Some favorites of my were the shishito peppers- they had a nice blistered skin and were sprinkled with salt. The beef gyoza with kabocha purée melted in mouth. I had to snag another one! It was one of the best things I ate. The crispy yellowtail taquitos had a spicy foam on the side, nice crunch and clean flavors. The miso sea bass is so buttery and almost caramelized on the edges. It came with a side of Peruvian corn that was so delicious! You know you're a chop stick master when you can scoop more than one of those kernels into your mouth at a time! By this point I was stuffed- but they still brought out a variety of steaks, thinly sliced with rice and beans. Also a wave of sushi rolls and then some mochi balls for dessert.

Parking: It's on the Vegas strip so I recommend parking off strip if you need to park
Best time to go: Either when they open or late at night around 10pm

I remember coming here a long time ago for one of my girlfriends birthdays when we visited Vegas. Somehow we stumbled upon this place on Yelp and we were SO glad that we did! They have an Omakase option (chefs choice) where they work with your budget $ and what you like and don't like which is a great feature to have in a restaurant. 

I came back again last week after remembering how much I enjoyed it here and I enjoyed the food just as much as I can remember. However, the prices are not nearly as good as I remember!

Last week, I came here for my birthday (3 days belated, but can't a girl embrace her birthday for more than just a day? )

Made a reservation for 9pm on a Sunday night via OpenTable and in the notes it said it was for my birthday dinner. Upon arrival, to our surprise there were still a lot of people so when we checked in wih the hostess she said we needed to wait an extra 10 minutes - that's fine! We sat in the waiting area behind the bar but as we were sitting there with full view of the hostess area, we can hear and realize that after 5 minutes she began seating others that didn't have a reservation, same party size as us (just 2 people) and came after us! Rude, right? So I asked went up to her and asked her again and she smiled and said yes, I have a table for you. Then proceeded to seat us at the worst possible table. They have a lot of art and it's designed in a modern way, but above me I had this object literally a couple inches from my head so I felt like I had to crouch down the entire time. 

Now onto the more important things:

FOOD! :)

We were going to opt for the Omakase but realized it would be better to just order a few things we actually wanted to eat since we knew the specifics that we wanted. 

Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza - $18 (Rating: 4.25\/5)
For 5 pieces of tiny gyoza, they were good but I couldn't tell the difference between regular beef and the A5 Wagyu so it was a bit disappointing. However, still good and I would recommend to order it during their happy hour!

Crispy Hokkaido Scallop - $7 each (3.5\/5)
It's kinda like a lettuce wrap and the waiter recommended it but this was just ok and not memorable

Uni Nigiri - $9 each (4.75\/5)
So good! There was no fishy taste but I wish there was a bit more uni because it seemed a little skimped but we were really surprised at how good this was. 

Japanese Wagyu Nigiri - $12 each (3.5\/5)
It was ok, but we've definitely had better. It was not seared but was actually kinda cold. The texture wasn't melt-in-your-mouth good either  I probably wouldn't get this again. 

Salmon Nigiri - $5 each (4.25\/5)
It was good and the texture was good too! I would order again. 

Sao Paulo Roll - $24 each (3.5\/5)
This roll has a lot of items in it so we picked this one. It consists of scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, whitefish, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chimichurri. It's like their version of the rainbow roll. 

Overall, I really like this place and I'll definitely be back. Be sure to make reservations!

Our server asked us a bunch of questions about our preferences & food allergies to gage what type of menu we would receive. It didn't matter because EVERTHING they served us was absolutely great.  Here is a run down of what we had: 

-Green Bean Tempura (light & crunchy) 
-Shishita Peppers (could eat a pound of these everyday)

- Service here is exceptional.
- Most items are pretty good.  I stick to my staples.  Spicy Tuna hand roll and the Wagyu Gyoza.

The cons:
- Place is so freaking dark.  When a 1\/3 of your patrons are bustin' out their phones to illuminate the menu, that should tell you something.  Yeah, I scoped out the real estate.
- Bottled beer.  My Kirin was skunky.  If I weren't so drunk already, I'd have exchanged it.  Instead I was a retard and tried drinking it with my nose pinched.  I stomached about a quarter before I said ""No Mas"".

This place looks and great, sounds great, and tastes great! There's not much that's negative here. I tried a little bit of everything (and racked up a great bill for it) with hot and cold items, but out of it all I would stray from some of the cheaper rolls and stick with their signature items. I didn't have much that I didn't like and I didn't feel rushed, I sat at the bar and people watched, there were a large number of post Cirque show watchers that came by. 

An interesting mix of people, but nothing out of the usual for Las Vegas. I would suggest to sit at the bar because it's quicker for many things - and the bartenders are excellent here. Multitaskers to the max here. 

The fusion is here, but I tasted less of the Brazilian side of here and more of a French european flavor. Still - worth checking out. 

So when next walking through the shops of the Venetian, make a stop at Sushisamba - and maybe the Hawaiian Cookie Company cause they're a great post dinner snack.

There are also a ton of shrimp and it's battered to perfection in a spicy mayo sauce. The hand roll was also fresh and delicious but pricey for 1 hand roll. Service was good and it had a trendy vibe. The only thing I didn't like was how dark the bathroom was. I could barely see. Overall, a great place to grab sushi\/asian food.

Update: I went here again for lunch and got the miso sea bass skewers with peruvian corn ($17) and el topo roll ($15). The sea bass was a hit. I loved how soft it was but it was pretty sweet. The el topo roll was not good. It had mozzarella on it which was so strange with rice. It was like glue. Everything else here should be good but don't mix cheese with sushi rice.",1,1,1

SUSHISAMBA is a must every time we pay a visit to Sin City whether it's for lunch, dinner or a midnight snack.  Easily accessible through the Grand Canal Shoppes entrance closest to the Wynn.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that this place can be pricey... but you're in Las Vegas... what did you expect, $13 sushi buffet?  No thanks.

My favorites here:
-Purple Potato Mash:  so delicious and buttery-good.  great side to even share with others at the table
-Green Bean Tempura:  comes with a really tasty aioli that trumps all other tempura associated sauces
-El Topo:  my favorite of the sushi rolls hands down.  So unique with crispy onion and mozzarella and incredibly melt-in-your-mouth good salmon.

I loved the rich colors, the textured art, including a projected video montage of Japanese and Brazilian history onto the wall behind me. 

The food and drinks were delicious. And while the price ranges fairly high for a sushi place, it's Vegas and it's good Vegas. Exploding with flavor Vegas. The Seared Wagyu Beef was very delicious - loved the strong beef taste contrasted with the sweet jam and mushrooms! The seaweed appetizer was also fantastic and the perfect started size.

The 3's
Spicy tuna & spicy yellowtail were just so so.
Edamame - could have done without the lime
Salmon sashimi -nothing mind blowing, but edible
 

The 4's
Snapper sashimi - a larger cut than the other sashimi, only the fish skin was rough on the tongue.
Eel\/Avocado roll - tasty with decent cuts of unagi
Pork belly skewers - good marinated taste, though small in size

 
The 5's
Yellowtail Belly sashimi - Ask for it, it's off the menu, but the chef had some available the day I was there.  Very fresh and the best sashimi at the table by far.
Yellowtail Jalapeno - super hot and spicy, it hurt so good.

We started with edemame and shishito peppers. These were good peppers but not my fav. We ordered a few different things and shared the dishes. Shrimp & veggie tempure- great spicy dipping sauce. Miso sea bass (large plate) it was the best thing we had there. El Topo roll- I was worried how the cheese would be, but the roll was really good. The Sasa handroll left much to be desired IMO. Agedashi tofu had lots of flavor in the sauce that is used. Other dishes were ordered which I didn't try, but everyone liked the food. One eh thing was that the table would get full and we would have to flag down a waiter to take away the empty plates, as oppose to them coming by often to check. 
There was an extensive sake list, but we opted for a bottle of wine. Nick made sure our glasses stayed full. If you are looking for some non-traditional sushi, this is your place.",2,1,2

The food was excellent, we had:

Yellowtail Seviche - everyone's favorite, excellent dish, great fish, great seasoning\/sauce to it.  I'd have more right now if I could.
Kobe Beef - very good as well, served with mushrooms and sliced super thin.
Beef Tenderloin - which was cooked on the Japanese grill and came out very smoky, it was good, not great.
Rock Shrimp Tempura - also quite tasty, for such a small dish, there was a lot of shrimp packed in.  Nice spicy sauce to it as well.
Sushi Roll - can't remember the name of it, but it was salmon topped with melted mozzarella and little fried onion things.  That was the one dish that was a miss in my book.  The onion overpowered the rest of the dish.  Wasn't bad, but I didn't think all the flavors worked that well together.

I stay away from the stuff like the plague and was so pleased to see a large well stocked menu of items I could enjoy apart from the typical ""chicken teriyaki"". 

Naturally I love Brazilian food so Sushi Samba was a great choice for me. Over my some odd 7 trips to Vegas last year, we ate here 3 times. 

One time we opted for a ""omakase"" menu, which means trust the chef, where you let you waiter know a price point, food restrictions, or requests and they form a menu for you. It turned out to be wonderful! Everyone was please with the selections, and left full and satisfied. 

Some of my favorite items are the caramelized plantains which are sweet and tender with a delightful crisp. I also love the seared Kobe beef served sashimi style, with ponzu sauce. This is my favorite dish, the tender beef coated in a zippy ponzu gelee is such a balanced and flavorful dish, I highly recommend it. I also have had a few of the duck dishes, which neither knocked my socks off. 

A few things I don't like about the joint is the slow service. It takes about 2.5 hours for dinner and when you are dying to hit those craps tables, that seems like forever. Second is the loud thumping club music. I understand they are trying to invoke the feeling of rhythm and sex into their food, but it ends up just being annoying. When I have to shout at my group to have a conversation and I'm not bumping and grinding on a dance floor, that's a problem.

He told me to tell the waiter how much we each wanted to spend and for then to bring us a tasting menu of sorts. Unfortunately, my wife doesn't like truffle anything, masago or mushrooms. Each of those ingredients were scattered throughout the menu so we just ordered of the menu.

We made reservations and were promptly seated. We started off with the yellowtail taquitos and the Wagyu beef gyozas. Each had an amazing flavor to itself, the yellowtail definitely had a citrus flavor by a yuzu or ponzu sauce but I couldn't put my finger on it. It came with a side sauce that when added, definitely gave it a kick. I would highly recommend both of those appetizers to start.

We shared the heirloom tomato salad and a Lima roll which was pretty basic and nothing special. We each had an order of Sasa handrolls which was amazing and also a must have if you're there. We finished our dinner with a samba split dessert which was amazing.

They have the most extensive sake and Japanese whiskey collection I've ever seen but we stayed away this time from experimenting. This is a must visit when at the Palazzo in Vegas.

I found this restaurant on Yelp before we came. I absolutely love sushi and she hates it. We both love Texas de Brazil so I figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked Sushi Samba. I always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so I picked the SÃO PAULO for $24. It had scallops, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. To be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. This is coming from someone that loves onions too. If I come back I'll probably ask them to cut that out when I order. I also ordered a generic spicy tuna roll. For our two sharable sides we ordered Purple Potato Mash and Peruvian Corn. The two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. The Purple Potato Mash had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. The Peruvian Corn had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way I like. The real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the Berkshire Pork Belly rather than the lamb chops she was thinking about. I asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. I neglected to mention to her that Pork Belly is literally a seared section of fat. She was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. My girlfriend was actually quite content with the Purple Potato Mash and Peruvian Corn.

But, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing Vegas the right way. Ha!",1,0,0

I'd go back to Vegas and the Venetian for another bite here, that's for sure!

I started off with the Chu-Cumber cocktail (from the ""Japan cocktails"" sec'n), which is made of: shochu (the OTHER Japanese distilled spirit, aside from sake--a pretty good alternative to vodka, if I say so myself), Hendricks Gin, elderflower liqueur, and freshly muddled cucumber. Refreshing, light, just a tad sweet. Very good.

We then tried a bit of everything... Peruvian corn (love those giant kernels), a few small plates (crispy yellowtail tacquitos--spicy aji panca sauce and lime? yes, please), and a ""large plate"" a.k.a. entree. So, there's this cool long bar area in the middle of the restaurant, where you can perch yourself and eat\/drink more casually... and the guys sitting next to us at the bar were SushiSamba regulars and highly recommended the Chilean Sea Bass for one of our large plate selections. Because I like you all, I'll echo the suggestion. So. good. so. tasty. so. tender.

I think it's a great restaurant with a vibrant vibe, and a delicious menu to boot. I already recommended it once to someone else who ended up going to Vegas a few weeks after I did, and they loved it, too. Definitely a bit pricey, but what do you expect when you're smack dab in the middle of the shops at The Palazzo? At least the quality matches the price!",3,0,1

The dining room is large and well designed (rumor has it the build-out cost $10M).  We had a large party of 12, which can always be a challenge for a packed restaurant, but not here.  Our waiter was terrific and recommended family style meal and provided two options - w\/o Kobe would run around $60pp, and with Kobe would run around $80-90pp.  We opted to go without (which I suggest based on our experience).  Boom - out comes the food.  The meal was around 3-4 courses and included cooked appetizers, sushi rolls, and beef \/ pork proteins.  Each course was fresh - hot dishes hot, cold dishes cold and tasted great.  The ribeye was a bit overcooked, but given how many they crank out, it wasn't a huge disappointment.  The experience here was a thousand times better than Mastro's the night before in terms of level of service, food quality, and how fast the dishes came out.

For about the same amount of $$$$, Nobu gave us much less and not good food. Who needs a celebrity chef? 

The assortment of 4 tiradito. Holy cow. That Salmon, mild and yummy. Most salmon is smokey in flavor. This was different...so fresh and tasty on its own, didn't need smoke flavor. Awesome. Also had mushroom tobanyaki, yamato with foie gras, wagyu ishiyaki, tomato salad with lobster (---be prepared to pay a lot for this one)...lots of fresh, sweet lobster. Seabass (like buttah) and scallop (like buttah) anticucho skewers with peruvian corn, and a comp dessert pop for each of us - green tea ice cream ball dipped in chocolate and pop rocks.

We ate here a few nights ago and absolutely hated it, mostly thanks to our terrible server, Tanis.  She refused to bring us any menus and assured us she would customize a meal for us that we would love... I left hungry.  There were 6 of us total, 2 of us don't eat any fish.  We told her that in the beginning when she was refusing to bring out menus.  For our second course, she brought out raw fish for the fish eaters and cooked fish for the non fish eaters... wtf?  I waited around 15 minutes for her to come by again so I could get something different to eat.  When I was finally able to flag her down, I asked if the two non fish eaters could get something non fish, to which she replied, ""I brought out two extra fish dishes for everyone else.  There's nothing you can eat for this round.""  That's obviously terrible customer service.  She could've brought us out another two mediocre kobe mini tacos like she brought for us the first round, but she obviously doesn't care about her customers experience in her restaurant.  I had also ordered a drink from her which I suspect she intentionally forgot since she knew I was upset with her, it was her way of getting back at me.  When I complained about it to my friend she conveniently was able to hear me that time and asked, ""Was there something about another drink?""  I told her I didn't want anymore drinks from her because I was not going to play her little immature, power games.  So instead I left the restaurant and walked to a nearby bar, came back to the restaurant and finished my drink there so that she wouldn't get anymore of my money.  Tanis is the worst waitress I have every come across in my entire life, and that's just after a trip to London, the city of zero customer service.  If Tanis doesn't like serving people, maybe she should look for a new job?  Thanks for the memories Tanis, I can't wait for you to see this!  :)",0,1,0

Water and plate removal was efficient. Atmosphere was good, food was also quite good, but perhaps because it was fusion it wasn't all that memorable to me.

-Wagyu beef gyoza: I think this was the best thing we ordered! The beef was soooo good and I loved the sauces on the side. 

-Pork belly ramen: Everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. It had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and I really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup). 

-Sea bass and shrimp skewers: Both came with a side of Peruvian corn! So yummy! These are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos.

The highlight of our night with SS was our waiter and their staff.  They were all magnificent.  Our waiter also knew his bar menu, to the dinner menu all the way to dessert. Bam, home run!!  We can't thank you enough for taking such great care of our group.

If you are a true sushi enthusiast, you must go to Sushi Samba to experience the most PHENOMENAL SUSHI ever!

My boyfriend and I got to Sushi Samba at around 12am on Saturday. It was packed with pretty people and the DJ was bumpin' the beats! We didn't need a reservation and were seated quickly. If you're like us and willing to splurge on a palate party sensation, then continue on with reading my review.

We were greeted by our fabulously bubbly (*not in an annoying way*) and knowledgeable server Isabella Monstrous (she gave me her business card *how cute is that*). She recommended the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos (they look more like mini tacos really)...man was she SPOT ON! These little tasty tacos were filled with fresh yellowtail pieces that were swimming in spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime! They were so delish we decided to get a second order. Then we continued on our tasting tour with the following dishes that were the highlights of our night (we ordered more than this, but I don't want to write a colossal review):

* Assortment of four - *My Favorites!!!
o Yellowtail (Jalapeño and lemon grass)*
o Kanpachi (Yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil*)
o Tuna (granny smith apple, serrano, lime)*
o Salmon (orange and mustard miso)

* Seared Wagyu Beef* (ponzu gelée, warm japanese mushroom, truffled tofu crema)
o This was my absolute favorite thing of the night!!!! This sauce was amazing over the Coconut Rice (flavors were savory, not sweet, coconut flavor was not over powering). The Wagyu beef was so buttery and melted in my mouth. 
* Rock Shrimp (creamy and crispy deliciousness)
* Dessert - Samba Split
o I cannot even begin to describe how exceptional this dessert was! I was pretty tipsy by the end of our dinner thanks to a 720 bottle of Komotsuru sake ($115, but so worth it, fruity, light flavor and gold flakes don't come cheap). All I remember is decadent coconutty and dulce de leche creamy goodness! Seriously, when I took my first bite it was like...""COME ON, REALLY?"" I wanted to get another. Thank goodness for my boyfriend's fatty prevention intervention! Good lookin' out my man!

Overall we loved this place because the tapas style servings were perfect for a couple who wanted to try a little of everything. Their Brazilian play on sushi fusion is quite genius and it works! 

The restaurant is bright and beautiful and most importantly the attentive and knowledgeable servers and wait staff make your meal so much more enjoyable!

The bathrooms: Weird creepy stalls with sliding doors that reminded me of an airplane toilet and not very clean!

The food was really good, everyone in our party was happy with it. Particularly the whitefish skewers and the wagyu potstickers were fantastic. For our large group, the waiter said if we set a price point per person, they could bring out favorite dishes in waves and do a mini-type tasting menu. We set $50 per person and it worked out well for our group.

However, we did not enjoy the service beyond that. I ordered 3 bottles of champagne up front, courtesy of a friend who could not attend the birthday, and the service did a good job of refilling our glasses and keeping it flowing at the table. However, the waiter brought out a bottle and presented to me before opening, and I thought we had already had 3 bottles. I asked if it was a 4th, he said yes, and I told him no thanks. It felt rude to bring out a bottle before asking if we wanted more, perhaps hoping we had lost count, and then having to send it back. He also was not helpful to us in understanding best way to divide check, and kept coming back to check in short intervals if it was ready.

Good food, not great service experience.",0,0,0

We were offered the menu but also the waiter recommended we do a tasting, assuring the price would stay very reasonable. We went with the tasting. The server checked on any dietary restrictions (!!!) which was my first experience of this in Las Vegas! I typically eat a diet free of most meat (minus fish) and no dairy. But, being in Vegas I let the dairy slide. The server recognized my meat preference and brought something completely different and still amazing when he offered other meats to the group. Another member didn't eat rice\/noodles and he accommodated that as well! For that alone... I give this place five stars (I wish I could give more!)
The servers and staff at the restaurant seem to work well together. A group came in loud and rowdy after our group. Among many things, the people banged the table, chanted Trump, and cursed a storm in an otherwise chill restaurant. The team came together and asked them to bring it down, took steps to minimize the potential damage (broken glassware, etc) and finally removed a member of the group. Had we not sat next to them, I'm not sure we'd know how much the team quietly took care of the problem... all while taking care of our group and others around us.

1.  Menu is too large.  How the hell do you expect me to order something from this websters dictionary sized menu?  Keep it simple and DO-ABLE.
2.  If a restaurants main ingredient is salt, its going out of business, quick.
3.  Its too dark and the ceiling is too high (which makes it too loud).
4.  Too ambiguous.  Let me clarify this.. the name of the restaurant is ""Sushi Samba""  Alright cool, probably tapas style Japanese food?  Who the hell knows?  EXACTLY!  No one knows!  What kind of crowd do you expect to be in here?  Well, there were families, young couples, old couples, alcoholics, birthday dinners. wtf is this place? pick your target and hit that sh*t.  

The only upside from this was that the food came out quick.  Almost too quick.  Now that I think about it, it was probably pre-made and microwaved.. oh and topped off with some sea salt.  BADABING!

From edamame to plantains, wasabi to chiles, SUSHISAMBA is a true testament to the unique tastes created by immigration and integration and the balanced evolution of these flavors over the last 100 years. 

Having visited the Las Vegas location several times as well as the Miami one, SUSHISAMBA is high on my list of culinary experiences that delights time after time.

Among my favorites is Yamato roll, comprised of tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar, topped with gold leaf. At $19 for 3 pieces, you may have to take a sledgehammer to that piggy bank, but you probably won't regret it.  

Another outstanding roll is the Bobo Brazil, filled with avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, and chimichurri inside, layered with tender seared wagyu beef on the outside. Every bite melds into the tongue and disappears in a flurry of flavor.

I tried the Kanpanchi Tiradito on this last visit and didn't find it worth the $19. Drizzled in yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, the 4 small slices of amberjack were acceptable but not exceptional.

On a final note, our waitress looked like a gorgeous supermodel, which worked out great in curbing my own appetite, thus making the meal more affordable. I already started a new piggy bank for next time.",15,9,14

The cocktails could use some improvement. Given the price and the clientele, I think they need to bring in a mixologist to redo this section of the menu.

The restaurant is located in the mall between Palazzo and Venetian and was easy to find. The decor was beautiful and the ambience was fun and lively. The menu was pretty unique with Japanese and South American fusion items. We didn't even order from the menu though because our server offered to customize a tasting menu for the group to share. We explained to him our preferences (sashimi and beef please!) and then left it all up to him.

Our server took a huge chunk of fat and ""oiled"" the stone for us and we just started throwing down thin slices of wagyu on that thing.

Then a sashimi sampler came out with 4 different types of sashimi with various sauces. Last but not least, a huge plate of sushi rolls including otoro (tuna belly) nigiri with gold flakes sprinkled on top. Bougee!

Came here for dinner whilst on vacation. Cute place with a bar area and then more extensive seating for the restaurant area. Our party of 3 ordered an appetizer of kobe beef (super super pricey! our waitress had to inform us that the actual price was even more expensive than what was listed on the menu) and I wanted yellowtail so we got the hamachi sashimi tiradito. The kobe was really tender and delicious; we got to cook it on a hot rock ourselves. It came with an assortment of sauces and oils and salts, but my preference was just to dip it in the sesame oil before cooking it and then getting a few grains of the black rock salt to stick to the edge of the meat before eating it. The tiradito was yummy too. It came with a tangy spicy, ginger-y sauce (that was also given to us with the kobe) and was topped with little red jalepeno slices (and since I love spicy foods, that was awesome to me).

For main entrées, we ordered the chef special sushi platter and asked to make sure they gave us the 'yamato' as one of the rolls (which is really fancy with foie gras and tuna and caviar and gold leaf). We also ordered the 'bobo brazil' which contains kobe beef and chimichurri (one of my favorite sauces) amongst other things, and the 'rainbow dragon' which had a wasabi pea crust on it, which made the texture really interesting (in a good way).

To go with our meal, we also ordered several different kinds of sake. We ended up having the manager (who is an avid sake enthusiast and has been to Japan many times to find delicious sake for the restaurant) help us out with choosing the right sake to go with our dishes. We started off with an unfiltered, super fruity, sweet sake which I fell in love with. I'm not a big fan of sake usually, but this one was really good. The other ones we tried were all pretty good too (light and I could barely taste the alcohol) but they were all overshadowed by the first one we had.

Since we had already racked up a pretty extensive bill with all the food that we ordered, we decided to splurge on a little dessert too. I ordered the 'carmen miranda' which is just seasonal fruits with a little cake and yuzu sorbet. The sorbet was tart and refreshing and a nice way to end the meal (like a palette cleanser and breath saver! haha). Someone else ordered the warm chocolate banana cake. Our server told us it was the most popular dessert but warned us that it was super rich and heavy. It came out in a huge flying saucer shaped dish with a tiny dip in the middle to hold the dessert. I didn't taste it but it definitely smelled and looked amazing and the guy who ordered it seemed to enjoy it.

Oh! And the highlight of the night was when the DJ started playing some Fedde le Grand tracks!! GAWD. A meal encompasses not only the food, but the ambiance, and that was perfect for me.

The restaurant decor fits Vegas very well.  It was bright and kind of loud, but not in a kitschy way.  We sat at the bar and always made sure that we arrived at the beginning of happy hour.

Went there for a special treat and oh my... we had one.

First off I would not say the sushi is extraordinary, in fact its standard but I did love the yellow tail scallion there more than I do at most places, but the items on the menu other than sushi is what got me!

First and for most  the drink tower is amazing and unique from the appearance to all the different varieties like the cucumber one, strawberry, grapefruit, and so on...we tried total of 6!!. My favorite was the one with the cucumber and the one with the mint cant recall the actual names due to all the drinks ; ) 

Now on to the MEALSSSSS the ones I loved would have to be the steak tacos, best I had in a really long time and the sauce that they come with has a little kick that makes it all so complete. Another one would have to be the Alaskan king crab leg cut in perfect portions to be grabbed with the chop sticks and topped off with a cream sauce was sooooooooo good!! There was also the miso sea bass if you like the taste of the miso flavor and appreciate sea bass like I do its a must, even though my last bite on the skewer was not as great as the first 3 ; ( and my favorite dish of the whole night would have to be the in shell scallops!!!! I had never seem my scallops served in a shell till I went to this place, they were cooked with perfection and had some sort of pesto butter topping them off. I can literally eat so many and never have enough!! 
One more dish worth mentioning would have to be the tempura shrimp even though I am not a fan of most fried foods this one was good!! And the portion was giant!

As far as the dessert I am usually one to clear out all the plates but this was not the case for me, we got the mochi variety dish but it was too frozen it didn't do the mochi justice, and our other dessert consisted of friend bananas (Which i am not a fan of) and coconut cream and the best coffee ice cream I have ever had! This meal was a fun teat and experience and the staff was amazing!

We tried a mixture of classic sushi, miso soup and some fusion dishes. The sushi was exceptionally fresh with unique presentation. 

Fusion dishes to try: 
El Topo (roll), which had salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion. It sounds absurd and it was just that... absurdly delicious. 

Carnaval (roll)- shrimp, avocado, yellowtail, soy paper. This one wasn't as good as El Topo, but still offered a cool twist on a typical Japanese favorite.

Miso soup - it was a great miso but with added cilantro to lend to the Brazilian side of the restaurant. Amazing twist!

Wagyu gyoza - kabocha purée and su-shoyu dipping sauce made this sweet, tangy, and a little spicy. We ended up ordered another batch after downing the first order in 30 seconds. So good!

My husband and I both did the tasting menu, which we though was excellent, and the price was amazing - about $60\/person, which included about 6-8 courses, which is a great deal.  They had a nice variety of different types of dishes, including raw fish.  The food was creative in taste and in presentation.  They verify a price point with you prior to creating your tasting menu which is very considerate and pretty unusual overall.  

In general the service was very good, great at allowing us to get multiple drink orders, serving the other guests that didn't get the tasting menu, and just overall experience was great.

LUNCH

The whole Japanese\/Brazilian\/Peruvian fusion idea had me curious. That, and if I am honest with myself, I was craving sushi because it's been awhile. Enter SushiSamba for lunch. We were seated promptly at a booth and perused the menu. After some deliberation, I decided on the Samba Strip roll (Maine lobster tempura, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry) and a side of Peruvian corn. The presentation of the Samba Strip roll was lovely, and the lobster claw was filled with succulent meat - as it turns out, chopsticks are the perfect implement for digging out every single morsel of claw meat. The peanut sauce was delicious with a tang at the end that had me coming back for more. And interestingly enough, the Peruvian corn, when dipped in the peanut sauce, was quite delicious. The Peruvian corn itself was wonderful - it has a slightly sweet, tangy sauce on it which complemented the roasted goodness of the corn very well. About the size and similar to hominy, it had a memorable (in a good way) stick-to-your-teeth texture.

DRINKS

The atmosphere becomes more clubbish in the evening and the music gets turned up a notch. We gathered at the front in the waiting\/bar area and pretty much took over the couch and chairs there. Our server was great about allowing us to hang out there for an hour or so over drinks. Speaking of drinks, I had an amazing concoction called the Nashi martini (Grey Goose La Poire, shochu, St. Germain elderflower liquor, fresh lychee, passion fruit ). I could have bathed in it, given the chance.",2,0,2

We ordered a variety of things off the menu (hey, we had to try it all), and not one failed to amaze my tastebuds.

Pretty brown legs moved her quickly about the room, her tight black skirt barely hiding what lay beneath. Eyewear gave her a professorial look, high heels a come hither look. Yet it was the direct and patient manner in which she explained the menu items to my father that sealed her as the total package for me. I wish I remembered this fine creature's name but, alas, I was much too smitten to remember such a detail.

Dad ordered his usual Scotch and Mom and I opted for plain water. As we looked over the fare--a Japanese\/South American type blend--I kept stealing looks at The Professor. She caught me a few times but neither of us cared. Both of us smiled, in fact. It was an old game played by many throughout time, usually with far more success than ever attained by yours truly. That aside, the dining room was darkly lit, with a sushi bar in back and bar in front. A raucous group of tuxedo wearing party boys were slamming shots on the stools but eventually simmered down. Perhaps one of the uber hawt barmaids had mentioned their over exuberance and they'd relented.

Anyway, after smooth as silk tutoring from The Professor my dad finally settled on sea bass(miso) and Peruvian corn with a side of roasted vegetables. Mom went with a single samba roll which contained Maine lobster, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper and peanut curry. And as for me, I wasn't in the mood for seafood so I asked for chicken teriyaki(samba style) with purple mashed potatoes. 

The verdict?

Perhaps everything was fine. I never really know when with my parents. Their company is somewhat like being immersed in fine mist after a few drinks. You can sort of see and understand what's going on, but not very clearly, which means you occasionally misread what's actually occurring. To wit: Dad liked his fish(but he picked the restaurant so he would have liked whatever slop they put in front of him). Mom said her lobster roll was good(but she never says negative things until years after the fact. Kind of like her own statute of limitations if you will). And me? I always kind of defer to their mindset when in their company so I think my chicken and potatoes were good, although for something touted on the menu as a Large Plate I wish there had been more bird and buds.

Eventually The Professor laid our check on the table, and Dad swiped it up before I could, although I must confess it was a lame and slow attempt on the part of my right hand. He gave his usual 15% tip and we departed Sushisamba--which by the way is located off the shopping section of The Palazzo Hotel\/Casino. 

I guess we might have had a nice time there(I can't really be sure) but this much I do know: Mist or no mist, The Professor in high heels forever has my heart in her grasp....",5,10,5

I had some kind of tuna tacos that had lime and other flavors (I don't recall their names) and a special Peruvian sauce that was absolutely delicious. The miso, too, had some cilantro. I had a specialty roll that was a signature of the style, excellent, but, just like the above, I don't recall its exact flavors.

The downside was everything else. The service was inattentive and unhelpful when we had menu questions. Our server forgot basic things like making sure our table had soy sauce (the tables to either side did). The portions were not filling at all, necessitating that we order about three entree-size items each. This wouldn't have been so bad, except the prices were exorbitant. An equivalent meal at a less hip sushi place would have been about a third of the price.

The Yamato roll, for example, is expensive for a roll, but not for the yumminess of the foie gras.  But, some of their other food is just ok, very small portioned, and way overpriced.  The drinks are weak and are also overpriced. It's like the place thinks it's too cool for its own good.  I feel ripped off every time I go. I might not go anymore, to be honest.
-Douchiness on NYE.  We dropped by for lunch and were presented with a special menu, cutting off nearly everything normal and adding in some $30+ (charged per person) ""small plates.""  There were no hand rolls or cut rolls available, even with 5 sushi chefs at the bar.  And, to top it off, the orders of sushi are for one piece. One piece of sushi for 5 bucks! No sushi place does that mess!

While I do enjoy some of the food, I don't enjoy the feeling of being ripped off by a place that really thinks it's so cool that it can.  If I'm going to spend $100 for lunch, there are better places with better food.",5,1,3

The quality of everything here is amazing and very fresh. I'm extremely picky when it comes to sushi and this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The service is always impeccable and it is super clean in here. It doesn't have the fishy smell that most bad sushi restaurants have. The pricing is very reasonable for the location (inside the Palazzo and on the strip). The decor of the restaurant is pretty in-tune with the rest of the hotel and other restaurants - hip, modern, and a little funky. They have great cocktail selection and a full bar, as well as a happy hour menu. 

SERVICE: 5 Stars.
I've never had a single complaint about the service here. Every time we come here, the service is always consistent and excellent. We celebrated my friend's 21st birthday here with a group of about 20. After ordering countless rolls, plates of sashimi, cocktails and shots, our server graciously brought the birthday princess the 3 Wise Men shots. Doing stuff like this makes you come back because a year later, my friends and I still recant this story and bring up Sushi Samba.

FOOD\/DRINK: 5 Stars.
Everything is so fresh and good. I usually order Omakase and my favorites seem to be the Yellowtail, Uni, Fresh Ono, and Tuna. The  Tuna Tutaki appetizer is excellent and something I order whenever I come here. For non-sushi eaters, they have plenty of choices. They have a lot of unique cocktails custom to this restaurant that pair well with almost anything on the menu. 

You will not be disappointed eating here!",11,6,10

This experience was a little lack luster compared to my first.  I did end up taking my husband here as previously mentioned.  I entrusted our menu choices to our server.  Not as impressed. Maybe I just didn't care for her choices as much as I did the first time with Max.  She ordered us these grilled chilies with lime, and they were just okay for me.  Little disappointed though, as I mentioned to her how much I liked the black truffle green beans and didn't get any.  I did tell her I didn't mind raw things, but I should've stopped right there because thats pretty much all we got after that.

The tasting menu was exactly what we were looking for and didn't even know it. Thanks to our amazing server we went on a culinary adventure. Vanessa selected all of our drinks as well as each course and she was spot on with her selections. We will definitely be back to SushiSamba and are already looking forward to a repeat performance.

I was recently on a business trip to the Sin City and ate at SushiSamba three separate occasions. The first two were great experiences, but sadly third time wasn't a charm. It completely ruined my entire experience.

While the sushi was good (certainly not the best I've ever had) I was appalled when my co-worker found a hair in his roll during my third meal there. As soon as he did, we notified our waitress and her reply was ""can I get you another roll?"" so he ordered a new one. Then she asks, ""is it blonde? Because if it is, it may have been mine but don't worry I showered this morning.""

Yelpers, I kid you not.

OH GEE THANKS! Now I can rest assured knowing your dead skin cells that are possibly floating around my stomach were at least CLEAN.

I about died - but instead stuck to eating coconut rice (I didn't dare touch a roll). A few minutes later..... another hair.

This time I stormed up and demanded the manager who questioned us the entire time and seemed entirely unconvinced that there was any hair in either of the rolls. I am sorry, but when a customer is SHOWING YOU a hair in their food, you should probably not question it. She then says, ""I just have to check because sometimes it isn't hair. Sometimes it is just small shards of chopsticks that look like blonde hair.""

Are you kidding me? So now, I should be happy with the fact that it might not be the waitress' CLEAN blonde hair, but instead a shard of chopstick that could pierce my esophagus?

I have never experienced a more ridiculous restaurant situation in my life. Needless to say I left with the worst impression of the entire restaurant, which is a pity considering the first two occasions went well. Good luck to whoever dines at this place - but don't worry, at least the hair in your sushi roll is probably clean.",2,8,0

We arrived and looked at the menu, but ended up not needing it as we settled on the option our server gave to us... tell her our likes and dislikes, and they'd make a custom menu for us to try a bunch of everything.

What followed was a lot of food that we would have never ordered... and we were delighted at the items they brought us.  Our favorite was the chilean sea bass, which was so tasty.  It came with peruvian corn, which is like huge overgrown corn.  We also really enjoyed the yellowtail seviche taquitos and the rock shrimp tempura, as well as a few of the numerous sushi rolls they had brought at the end.  And our meal also included giant crab legs, some peruvian sashimi, and at least one or two dishes I'm failing to remember.

The music was a little loud and not to my dad's taste, but that's typical in Vegas.  The meal was definitely a unique experience, and we wouldn't have stumbled upon half the dishes without letting the chef do his thing.  I highly recommend you dine in this fashion if you visit Sushi Samba.",3,1,2

Hamachi sashimi - although the fish was fresh the pureed sauce and red jalapeño   kill off any flavor of the fish. 

Salt and pepper squid - good concept but over cooked. The squid was stringy. 

Shisho peppers  - not cooked well as the size of the peppers varied from very small to very large. No consistency in the bake so the small peppers were overcooked and the large peppers were still a bit undercooked. 

Sasa Handroll - a shrimp tempura with quinoa in a soy wrapper. The quinoa was aldente so the texture of the quinoa overpowered the entire roll. Also the shrimp was smothered in saracha mayo so you could not taste the shrimp.

The ambiance in the Strip branch is pretty nice. You don't get to mingle with a crowd of people like in their Dromo (Miami) location but you still get to have a hell of a dining experience. The dining room is pretty dark almost like a nightclub, the music is loud and the drinks are strong. So all in all, this is a supper club.

Otsumami is a must to have as a starter. The trio of shishito peppers, green bean tempura and edamame is the perfect way to start over a round of caipirinhas.

After this you can do a round of robata. Filet mignon, lamb chop, chicken, eggplant and seabass, they're all great and some of them come with the huge Peruvian corns which are so tasty.

As for the main course, I have tried their sea bass entree which I loved until I had the Moqueca. The Moqueca is simply the best seafood stew I have ever had in my whole life. It is a medley of shrimp, squid, sea bass and crayfish cooked in a pot with coconut milk and cashews.

Top this with more caipirinhas and maybe a couple of their desserts from their expansive dessert menu and you'll have yourself a great dinner right before you head into an endless Vegas night...

We had dessert and we had a Samba Split which was AMAZINGGGG!!! I had on the side some Mochi Ice Cream and I couldn't stop eating on both dishes!

Service: Pretty normal. Nothing really worth noting.

Food: Yellowtail tacos were amazing! Sashimi quality and sushi rolls were good\/sorta expected. Also got the pork belly ramen, but wasn't as good as I imagined. The ramen was good but didn't care for anything else in it. The broth was a little spicy as well. 

Price: I think the bill was $110 for 2? It's not the cheapest place but most sushi\/Japanese places are similar in pricing and on top of it, it's on the strip. So that's not too surprising.

Exceptional service, super fresh and delicious food, and a fun, high-energy environment. 

Everything we ordered was GREAT, and our waiter was helpful in navigating the menu and offering recommendations. The menu offers Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian cuisine. Amazing mix.

Tuna Tataki - this was a unique twist on tuna tataki, with the tuna served wrapped in tatsoi (type of Asian greens) with asparagus, heart of palm, avocado and a crispy garlic citrus soy sauce. So good and so fresh, with a ton of different textures and flavors that worked really well together.

Yellowtail Tiradito - wish the portion was larger because this was so bomb. The yellowtail was extremely fresh, and the unique combination of jalapeno and lemongrass was unbelievably good and refreshing.

A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza - very decadent and hearty. It's served with a kabocha puree that's slightly sweet and mushy, but goes well with the crispy gyoza skin and beef. Make sure to dip in the shoyu sauce. Not a traditional gyoza, but still, very good. More sweet than savory.

Miso-marinated Sea Bass - we got this in the large plate, rather than the skewers. Served with roasted veggies. Fish was SO buttery and delicious. Not fishy at all. Even the veggies that were served with the fish were spectacular, roasted to perfection and great dipped in the miso sauce.

Ordered a few other items, but the above were most noteworthy. All of the sashimi cuts were SO fresh. Super impressed.

I woud HIGHLY recommend the Miso Chilean sea bass, as it was once of the BEST I have ever had. The vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though I hate Brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.

The Spicy tuna rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places I've had them.

The BEST vegetable dish I've had in a long time were the Collard Greens in an asian dressing. They were crunchy and filling enough for two. Though, next time I'm not sharing! 

Another stand out to me were the Fried plantains. Normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. I loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese. 

Besides the sea bass, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. This was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.

Let's talk about the food- everything on the menu is delicious. The different ethnic combinations is what sets this place apart. The flavor the variety, and a must Chilean sea bass skewers.

The service- always smiling very friendly. The management comes over to give our party a complimentary app for being returned guests. They really know how to make you feel welcome and special. Everyone from the manager, bar tenders, greeters, servers, and bussing staff conduct themselves in a highly professional manner.

If you are in vegas you have to stop here, try and do small plates and try all different things on this wonderful menu.

We went with a group and had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. with around 8 people we basically just gave the waiter a set price and told him to pick stuff himself and let us try as much of a variety as we could. The lowest he could go was $40 a person which sounded fair to us. 

For the next hour and a half he brought out around 10 plates all with delicious things for us to taste. I was worried that no one would leave full but we all filled up pretty quickly and everything was beautifully made and tasted great!

It's pricey but I think it's worth it. Next time I go, I will be prepared to drop more cash to get more food.

I will never forget the sea bass. Ever. 

The waiter was great by the way. I don't remember his name but he's great with people, knows the food inside and out, and really made it a great experience for us. He's blond with curly hair, not too tall, and lean, not a big dude. try to get him if you can.",0,0,0

After a fun filled weekend adventure in Vegas, we decided to give SS another shot. It was my cousin's birthday, and we figured we would stop by for a farewell Vegas-Birthday dinner. We stayed at the Venetian, which made SS a stone throw away. We couldn't have came at a better time, the environment was so much more personal than the time before. I highly recommend avoiding peak dining hours if possible. This will give you time to enjoy your meal while getting some extra attention from servers. Since we arrived at around 4pm on a Sunday, the timing was perfect. 

Our party grabbed a couple dishes and shared them all. This was the perfect way to sample everything. We started our mission into Japanese\/Peruvian\/Brazilian adventure with...

Otsumami: A mix of three appetizers. Edamame, Fried Green Beans, and Grilled Shishito Peppers. My absolute favorite was the Shishito Peppers. They were doused in sea salt and lemon, and one out of every couple were spicy. Perfect mix to the subtle hues of the Edamame. 

Yellowtail Seviche: Little tiny tacos filled with a mixture of yellowtail, onions, avocado and a side of chile sauce. These little babies packed a flavorful punch!

Next up was the Smoked Alaskan King Crab Leg: Wood fired, served in the half shell, perfectly cut and smothered in a signature sauce. These were so delicious and just melted in my mouth like butter!

Round four, Peruvian Bay Scallops: Served in the shell as well, perfectly cooked. You can tell that they know how to prepare their seafood because everything tasted so fresh. This was my cousin's favorite dish and her first time ever trying scallops. 

Then came out the Rock Shrimp Tempura. We could hardly eat anymore, however we asked for the most flavorful, scrumptious items, and intended on finishing them! After that, the Yellowtail Sashimi. It had spicy blended orange sauce on it, that was the perfectly paired with the fish. My personal fave of the night. 

Make sure to order a signature cocktail while you are there. We had a couple (after all, what kind of birthday is complete without drinks?), and the one that really stood out was the Chu-Cumber. It was like you were drinking the most exquisite cup of tea mixed with the cool tones of cucumber, all while getting a little buzz on. 

My taste buds are so happy that I gave Sushi Samba another shot. The best part was, management remembered that it was my cousin's birthday, and brought out a little slice of carrot cake with ice cream and sparklers crowning the top. It was definitely a birthday dinner that we will all remember.",2,0,2

First is the genuine creativity of the food.  Amazing.  They meld some crazy combination of Japanese, Peruvian, Brazilian and Freaking sexy.  I don't know.  But every dish, and we had MANY, surprised the palate.

The manager was caring and even offered us a free starter.  Some little piece of ocean life on top of a finely chopped pile of garlic and green things . . . outrageously good.

Very far and few in between, you'll stumble across the ""sensibly"" smart... who could hold their own, but isn't too far removed from the average person.  This is where Sushi Samba comes in.  Sushi Samba isn't by any means authentic Japanese cuisine, but you'll leave there with the impression that you had a quality dinner without the ostentatious price.   In other words, if your objective in Vegas isn't a foodie adventure, but you still want to have a decent dinner...go here.

Without further delay, we ordered lots of dishes between the 6 of us, but I'll highlight the ones worth mentioning:

Cevice- Salmon asparagus, red radish, pineapple, lime 13.00
(4 STARS)

Duck Breast and Ginger Sweet Soy (aka Duck Tacos)   14.00 
(4.5 STARS)

Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass roasted organic vegetables and oshinko 29.00 
(4 STARS)

El Topo salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion 14.00
(4 STARS)

Cassava Carrot Cake brown butter ice cream, cinnamon cream,
rainbow carrot chip, orange reduction 9.00.  YUM!!!  Seriously..just try it, even if you're not a carrot cake person.

Visited on a Saturday night for a light dinner.  Our waiter suggested the full course, similar to Nobu or other similar restaurants, however we opted for single menu items.  I ordered the Sea Bass and the Peruvian Corn.  Words and photos cannot describe how awesome the sea bass was-definitely top 5 contender.  

Critiques:
Service was good, not great and felt a bit rushed  through each course.  
Also, seating is extremely cramped, which makes for a smokey facial when they bring out your neighbors Wagyu on the rocks  and the place is loud- difficult place for a romantic conversation.

Tips: You need a reservation or you will probably sit in the overflow area outside the restaurant.

Seriously just go in there and grab some drinks, let the waiter take care of you. Everything is great and the vibe is chill vegas style   

Suggested drink is Hendricks and tonic with cucumber. Delicious. Different.  Try it. 


The sea bass melts in your mouth. Unbelievable!

Go in there ready to get the party started. It will exceed your expectations. 


Our waiter name is Justin. He wasn't bad but busy. 
Only reason I didn't give a 5 is because there was some slack in service. At one point we received dessert menus and then didn't see a waiter for 10 min and we had to ask for him. Just a little disappointing since the meal was so expensive. I expect personalized service. 


I did let the manager know and Jeremy took care of us. He let us know what the reason was as to why Justin was extra busy which was a valid point. I appreciated the transparency.",1,0,0

So here is what happened. My twin brother's girlfriend made a reservation for 15 a few days before our group arrived in Las Vegas.  By the time we arrived to eat our group had dwindled to 8, we all know things happen in Vegas & plans change. Anyway, we explain the situation to the hostess and were seated promptly. My first impression of the place was 'dark place but nice'. The restaurant wasn't that busy, empty tables all around us. Our server arrives to our table with one menu and pretty much says the rest of us cannot have a menu. He tells us that due to the size of our group we cannot order individually and are required to agree to a $60 a person menu. He seemed a little nervous, said something along the lines that if we have a problem with this, then you can speak with the manager and disappeared. We're all like, WHAT?  At the time of the reservation, this should have been explained and it was not. So we ask to speak with the manager and had to wait for another 45 minutes to have this accomplished. 

Anyway, we order a $70 dollar bottle of sake to make a toast before ordering dinner. By the time it arrives to the table our group had grown to 12. We had a second server approach our table and we explained to her that we were not aware of the requirement that we could not order individually.  I forget her name but I think it starts w\/ an M (she is the reason for the 1 star). She explains that we can order al a carte, however due to there being 3 different kitchens, they cannot guarantee that everyone's food can arrive at the table at the same time. Everyone at the table agreed that this is okay and we are ALL given our own menus, finally. Dang! Our 2nd server was very apologetic and seemed to understand our situation and said it would be fine for our LARGE group of 12 to order what we want. So we're all like cool, we can do this.

20 minutes later, the manager comes to our table and tells us that we CANNOT order individually because he will not put his kitchen staff & chef's through that. We are all sitting at the table in shock. Really! Professional chefs can't handle 12 different orders. He proceed to push the $60 dollar per person menu & how his kitchen will customize our order regarding any food allergies, like, or dislikes but they can't handle one person ordering a sushi roll and  another whatever else is on the menu (I didn't even get a good look at the menu due to all this crap going on).

By this time, we get the money together to pay for our sake & one beer and are packing up to leave. My twin brother who is a server and has been in the restaurant business for years and knows how to make the customer happy, went to talk with the manager to let him know that we were not happy with the situation and that we were leaving.  My group was not rude, loud, or disrespectful at all, we just wanted to have dinner & a good time. We ended up leaving without dinner, the manager comped the drink bill, and we gave our ""good server"" a $30 tip for at least being kind and hearing us out without trying to bamboozled us each out of  $60+.

So, would I recommend this place to a friend or anyone else, HELL NO!",0,3,0

It had fresh sushi and delicious!
Not to mention, it was within our hotel, Palazzo for an easy drop by for dinner.

Was in Vegas for my bachelorette party and needed a quick bite before our last outing.
Reservation was a breeze by using OpenTables. 

Ambiance was hip and had lot of round booth tables for big parties and many alike us were celebrating bachelorette parties.  
We ordered to following, while the server did mention that the server caters to your likes and dislikes and order your small plates to share, we opted to just order as we were in a hurry.  Also had mentioned it was a Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian fusion.  Overall I would describe it as an upscale sushi joint.

Uni sashimi - super fresh and delicious uni from Catalina, CA at a decent price! Was one of our favorites.
Rock shrimp - every restaurant has different twists to it, but it was a bit too crispy for my liking and the sauce didn't really have much zest to it
Yellowtail tacos - while the concept was great, it was slightly missing something.  Maybe they should make the taco shells a bit more crispy and highlight the dish with stronger sauce.  
15 piece sashimi plate - while fresh, nothing too special or out of the ordinary.  Would recommend in ordering your favorite fishes individually
Sao Paolo roll - I was eyeing it the whole time to order it, but didn't because we were watching our carbs that night.  Luckily one of our friends ordered it and it was the best dish for me!  The truffle oil was seriously the most delicious sauce that tied it down and there's barely any rice, so it was perfect!  Would get this again and again.

Based on our meal, would stick to the rolls and individual sushi\/sashimi to your liking for their freshness.   At the end, we got a complimentary celebratory cake\/ice cream pops!

I apologize to the manager that brought it out to us... I guess I was too absorbed in wanting to take the picture I must have muted him out as he was speaking to me\/congratulating me... as my friend pointed it out.  I totally didn't mean to do that.",1,2,0

What to try:

Sea Bass Skewers - unbelievable!  You will die and go to heaven.  Its cooked fish and is amazeballs.

There was this one dish that I still dream about.  It was a king crab leg opened up with some kind of butter sauce within the shell.  IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER TASTED.  I've been to a lot of high end japanese restaurants and this was the first omikase where I was actually happy and satisfied after.

This hip little eatery offers a fusion of Brazilian\/ Peruvian\/ Japanese cuisine. The food was interesting, but in my opinion, not quite worth their price tags (except for the kobe slivers). Our party ordered a variety of dishes, most of which became a challenge to split amongst five. One dish had three large scallops, another dish- six smaller mushrooms, and of course the aforementioned kobe beef slivers. I believe we spent more time dividing up morsels than actually chewing and swallowing our meal. Up until the rolls at the end, I felt like I hadn't really eaten anything.

I wouldn't really recommend this place for groups- although the dishes are tapas and meant to be shared. Sushi Samba would probably be more suitable as a romantic date place. The lighting is dim, the ambiance sexy, and the dishes more ideal to feed TWO adults.",0,0,0

I'm a big fan of Latin\/Asian fusion which, at first mention, confuses most people. Trust me folks, it works. Here the specific Latin influence is South American. Our group ordered a mix of the two types of cuisine and not one dish disappointed. (The menu is large and diverse enough that even the pickiest eaters in your group will find something) The robata dishes were fantastic, as were the tiraditos. The sushi rolls were not that impressive as far as sushi goes. It was my least favorite part of the meal. 

Dessert was amazing. We sampled three desserts, the mochi, some sort of chocolate hazelnut dish, and a banana dish. Since we were celebrating 3 birthdays the 3 desserts were complimentary. For 5 people, including a bottle of sake, the total bill came to about $200 which is more than reasonable. 

The atmosphere is fantastic. It is a great place for large groups, the large circular tables provide everyone with the ability to have a conversation. There is nothing I hate more than dining at a long rectangular table with a group; you almost always end up just talking to the people sitting in your immediate area. The ceiling follows the Asian theme with cherry blossoms and the like, while the walls are filled with South American graffiti art. The one thing I could do without was the party video footage from one of their other restaurants, it cheapened the experience a bit. However, halfway through our meal it switched over to a Godzilla movie which I enjoyed much, much more.

It's 1:30 in the morning and we're in Vegas.  We're hungry, and tired and just wanted a good meal.  We found this place on Yelp with good reviews and decided to check it out.

I ordered the lobster robata, which the waiter described as lobster cut in half, grilled, and finished with a sauce.  This sounded a lot like the way lobster is prepared in Mexico and I'm starting to see in other restaurants particularly in San Diego.  So I was excited to have it this way again.

What a disappointment - what came to me was only half a lobster, the size of which could not have been anywhere near a pound.  It was grilled well and the sauce was very tasty.  

But seriously, for $25?  If I spent that much back home on lobster, I'd have enough to feed my entire family and still have some left over.

My wife had the Lima, which was very good.  For sushi, it was not like what we get in LA, but it's worth noting that if I ever find myself here again, this may be what I order.

The ambiance looks like Dr. Seuss on acid, but it was dark and cozy at the same time - it is an unusual setting.

We made reservation a couple of weeks prior to the event. Reservation process was easy enough...you communicate via text with one of the mangers there. Since it was for a huge party, we had to pick from 2 prefix menus to make things easier on the day of. One was for 75 dollars and one was for 85 dollars, we we went with the 85 dollars one. 

You do have to sign an agreement which is kinda weird. And there is an 85 dollars coordinator charge. Super lame and expensive since it's just making a normal reservation and it's not like they coordinated anything for us. They only put our name down. But apparently it's for the personalized menus they made. If we knew they charged for that, we would've skip it . And there was also a typo on our menus that I only noticed after wards, it said course 4 twice on there. If I noticed that at the time of dinner and realized they charged us 85 dollars for it  I would've said something.

The food was really good though and 5 courses definitely filled us up.

My favorites:
-yellowtail taqitos  
-sea bass skewer  (best sea bass ever)
-wagyu beef (cooked on a hot stone, suc
h a fun experience and makes me want a hot stone)
-samba lobster roll
-lima roll (with shrimp and king crab)
-salmon rolls 

They did a good job at accommodating to a few individual's dietary restrictions. We had a vegetarian, pescatarian and non seafood eater in our group. And they made great accommodations for them all.

The first time, we splurged on a 9-course omakase that included kobe beef cooked on a rock and various delicious & well-crafted dishes. As a sushi lover, I only eat fresh, perfectly cut fish and Sushi samba has this side down.  I also LOVE their children's menu which includes the cutest bento boxes. Both salmon & chicken are good and its arrangement of fruit skewers and ice cream sundae topped with krackle pop candy (?) is amazing. My family love to dine out with kids and this place by far, has the best children's menu for reasonable price.

The second time we got the sushi\/sashimi boat and three-meat dish. Meat was good and sauces were once again, excellent. I really enjoy sushi\/brazilian fusion because it nicely satisfies my entire palette. 

Mango mojito was good and reasonably priced but I made a mistake of letting the waiter choose our bottle of sake which turned out to be nearly $125 per bottle. Sake was very smooth but our entire meal came out to over $500 which I believe, is too high for fusion\/sushi. But again, the Kobe beef and excellent sake made up for the price but next time, I'll be more careful when letting them choose my drink. 

Overall, Sushi samba is a great joint if you want to enjoy a night out with friends and family with good sushi & unique fusion dishes. However, be prepared to spend some $$ or you might be unpleasantly surprised. :)",2,0,0

The sushi was well made but I wasn't exactly blown out of the water and neither was my boyfriend. He and I are avid sushi eaters and we love complex rolls with a lot of flavors and textures to them. So the Lima roll and San Paulo roll were both just decent. We could have gone without them.

I give it 1 Star, for the trendy and fancy atmosphere, and members of the staff, that did their best to be accomodating. That's it. 

Like my friend, Philip, I've eaten  Sushi in many cities and many places, including Japan, In my opinion, wheather you are a visitor or a local, you can do a lot better (See my review of Jjanga).

I am used to sitting at a Sushi Bar, and interacting with the Sushi Chef, who is usually from either Japan or Korea. One that observes the traditions and honor of the art. This place is not the case. When you ""yell out"" your order to the Sushi Chef, you are virtually ignored, and told, you must give your order to a Server. So, what is the point of a Sushi Bar, if you can't enjoy the traditions of inter acting with a Sushi Chef?

My host, my previous employer and business partner, was buying. For that I am glad, because otherwise, I would probably have not gone to this place. 

The quality and presentation were similar to other ""trendy"" places you would find in the Las Vegas tourist zone, and the trendier parts of Los Angeles and New York. Honestly, it was not nearly as tasteful, or satisfying as several ""local"" places, situated ""off the Strip"" in this town. 

I walked out hungry enough to eat a full dinner less than two hours later, and my gracious host walked out with a charge to his credit card close to $300, for three people,  for a ""piss poor"" experience, a bottle of Voss Water, and a cocktail for his significant other.  

So here's my take. If you're a guy on a date with a very ""hot"" looking girl, or ""dime piece"", and you're setting the mood for a ""table at the club"" later, and plan on a "" night to remember"" and tell your buddies, this is a good bet. Looking around the place, I observed many a flashy couple that would fit this scenario.

If you want to enjoy a really good Sushi or Sashimi Dinner, that will leave your taste pallet satisfied, and leave you money left over to enjoy a ""night to remember"", than I suggest you drive outside the Las Vegas Strip, and dine in a spot frequented by ""locals in the know"".",1,1,0

I had to turn my flashlight on my phone on just to figure out of there was a counter, a purse hook, where the TP was.

-MISO SOUP cilantro and tofu
-JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA kabocha purée and su-shoyu dipping sauce
-UNI sea urchin (both nigiri & sashimi)

The Japanese A5 was perfect, the flavors all blended so nicely together! The beef inside the savory gyoza was rich and juicy in flavor. The sea urchin was fresh and buttery.

To start we had miso soup and edamame. The miso was good and they put cilantro in it, which definitely gave it an interesting and new flavor without totally changing the miso. The edamame was pretty standard, although my boyfriend said he felt the salt had a different flavor which made it taste better.

My boyfriend and I opted for the tasting menu. We told our waitress our likes and dislikes and the price range we wanted to stay within per person. She bought out courses for us based on our preferences. The ahi taco was good. Of everything we tried three dishes really stood out as amazing, the scallop with some kind of green sauce on top, the miso sea bass, and the king crab leg (also with a sauce on top). The sea bass was amazing. If I were to return, I would probably just have an entire plate of that. All three of those were very good. There was also a side of corn that tasted quite yummy. The sashimi was good. I particularly liked the yellowtail. The tuna was good and the white fish was very bland. We also had two rolls. One was the Lima roll, which was good, but I was disappointed they gave us a roll with tempura. I can't  remember the name of the other roll, but it had tuna and asparagus. It was good.

Over all, the meal was awesome. I loved trying the different combinations of foods and getting to try a wide variety from the menu. If you're up for splurging, I definitely recommend giving it a try.

*** WARNING*** We attended the dinner with another couple. Our friend asked for a spicy hand roll and to make it very, very spicy. He said when he goes places he always asks for extra spicy and is disappointed. Our waitress put ""super spicy"" on the ticket. Well after one big bite of the roll, he had to rush to the bathroom and proceeded to throw up 25 times! It turns out the sauce put in the roll was SIX MILLION SCOVILLE heat units.  Way too much. The manager was good about checking on our friend in the bathroom, but all they did was take the hand roll off the bill. I know our friend asked for extra spicy, but I feel a good chef should know where the line is and to not do that to a customer. The restaurant should have comped the meal, since they didn't even get to eat the dinner (they had it boxed to go, but it just went to waste in their room).  They weren't even offered a free dessert, which I'm pretty sure even a silly chain restaurant would have done. It was their last night in Vegas and he had to spend it sick in his room. So, a word of caution to all you spicy heat lovers, be careful they will not hold back and potentially ruin your night!!",1,2,1

I love sushi and found this place through yelp! I am so glad that we came here! We did make reservation for a Saturday dinner... But I saw many people just walked in. The place is packed for Saturday night... So I would definitely recommend to make reservation.

We always have hesitation about fusion sushi... Especially Peruvian\/Brazilian Japanese... What in the world...! But we got converted...!

- from small plates, we got tuna tataki, $16: seared tuna, served with asparagus, heart of palm, avocado, tasoi, cripy garlic and citrus soy on top. It is a perfect bite, fresh, crunchy, sweet, sour and salty! 
 
- from Raw section, we had yellow tail and tuna sashimi ceviche for $15 each.
Yellow tail is served with ginger, garlic and soy. Tuna is served with grapefruit, jalapeño and almond. The fish is very fresh, sliced like sashimi style, melted in your mouth. I like the ginger sauce better because it is not too tangy or sour.... just perfect!

- from Robata (grilled on skewer), we ordered hamachi kama, ribeye, lamp chops and Asparagus.
Hamachi ($13)  is perfectly grilled and seasonned with lime and sushoyu on the side. The fish is just melted in your mouth.
Ribeye ($13(  is tender and served with aji panca (Peruvian pepper) and corns. The corns are so tasty and juicy!
Lamp chops ($16 each)is perfectly grilled served with red miso and lime. It is tasty but quite expensive since each lamp chop is $16... And you definitely want more than one.

- from Samba rolls, we had Neotokyo ($16). It is their fun version of spicy tuna with the big eye sauce on top of the roll will make you smile.

- from soup section, we ordered Tomkatsu ramen ($20). It is huge portion definitely for sharing. Ramen noodles are served  with pork belly, salted eggs, bamboo, scallion, bean sprouts. The broth is savory!

- Desert: samba split ($16): doce de leite ice cream, with caramelized banana, coconut flan, dried pineapple, popcorn and whisky whipped cream... Can you say too much of good things!

- Drinks: lychee cooler ($16)... Very tasty vodka with coconut and lychee! 

Our dinner bill was over $200 but we did order a lot of food... I literally could not breath after our dinner!

There were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. Typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  However, we were served typical menu items.  I think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. 

The Good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. The Bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  

Instead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: 
(1) Tuna tataki: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. 
(2) Wagyu beef dumplings: Not enough brought out so I never got to try it. 
(3) Mini yellow tail tacos:  I liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. 
(4) Crab tempura: How ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and I had to share one bite of one piece? This wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. 
(5) Sea bass and shrimp skewers: Again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. 
(6) Steak and mushroom stew: Everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. 
(7) Sushi rolls\/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but IMO were rather underwhelming. The sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. We were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which I easily could have eaten by myself.

I felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). 

Yes, our server was pleasant and friendly. Yes, the food was quite tasty.  And, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection.

It was kind of a last choice for our big bachelorette party of 18 girls.  At first I was like... eh, I can try that in NY.  And you're always taking a gamble with Asian Fusion.

But, we knew the bride liked sushi and so we eventually caved.

Here is the breakdown of my experience at Samba:

Decor\/atmosphere - dark, swank, very appropriate for the occasion.  They sat our party in the back room where no one else was seated.  That was nice.  We had privacy for the first hour or so of our meal.  The air conditioning was cranked up way too high but they said they turned it down.  I don't think they did.  I damn near lost my toes trying to keep blood flowing to the extremities.

Service - friendly, cute staff of slow-talking Brazilian boys.  They're good but something tells me they were hired as eye candy rather than for their perfect waiting skills.  As we sat down they asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water - don't you hate when restaurants do that and trick you into buying overpriced bottled water?  I specifically clarified ""tap"" after some of the girls said flat and they still brought out about 7 bottles all opened and ready to pretty much pour straight into our throats.  That was my one big complaint of the night.  Oh yeah, and I also asked them to box up some leftovers for us to take, which they never did.

Food - surprisingly yummy.  We had a 7-course pre-fixe which included a shrimp appetizer, organic greens salad with carrot-ginger dressing, giant sushi platter, miso sea bass, teriyaki chicken over purple mashed potatoes, beef carpaccio(?), chocolate bread pudding and finally a tres leite (I have no idea what this is but it was delicious). The highlight for me was the sea bass.  Very similar to a miso black cod or butterfish.  I loved the chicken.  Usually, I'm indifferent to teriyaki but it was moist and so unique with the creamy potatoes.  The beef dish was like a beef tataki - very rare (almost raw) and with nice acidity.  Desserts did not disappoint at all - I'd say it was actually a highlight of the meal.

Confused staff and very Rude snobby manager sum up my experience.

It is not all about the Money, it is about how the team and a establishment makes you feel and overall dining experience,

I called ahead for happy hour \/ Samba Hour and they said it will be for that night. Upon arrival I told hostess we like to take advantage of  their Samba hour for drink special and get sushi off their regular menu  the hottest took us to the back room , which it was Empty and said the special drink menu is only served here! 

Even thou the restaurant was half full ( mostly clueless tourists) We were the only ones in that back room the waitress came and said there is no special menu there in the back room that night and took us back to the front, to be seated in the main restaurant!!

So now we are in the front and the hottest claim that the So called Samba Hour is only at the bar and sit us there, only for the bartender minutes later to acknowledged that the Restaurant manager  Called off the Samba Hour all together for that night, and there was nothing special to begin with as they advertised and told us over the phone.

Does anyone knows what they are doing!?
The team has lack of communication with the manager and each other!!

Why the waiters, bartender and hostess are not synched!?

It was our Anniversary the next day so we got the table and stayed. After all we were just gonna use the samba hour for some drink and get the food off the regular menu
anyway.

The snobby hostess treat us like some hilly billy as if it was our fault getting moved around 3 times, and said the manager will come over to make it up.

  $200 in bill later for some very average sushi, no sign of manager to at least apologize for moving us from room to room and seat to seat and literally being humiliated due to their confusion .

I travel to vegas regularly and just wanted to give this place a chance.

For great sushi and service I would Go back to Nobu or Social House both on the strip, will never even consider this place ever again.

I initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. However, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. One of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.

While I understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. It was sickening. I almost sent the food back, but I decided to give it a try.

Fortunately the food and drinks were decent. They weren't memorable in the sense that I will tell my friends and family about it, but the food and drinks were a good attempt at sushi, robata, and cocktails. I would give the quality of the food 3 stars.

However, when I spoke with the manager about the disproportionate amount of inedible food on the plate, he was extremely rude to me. Instead of explaining why the presentation was the way it was, he simply said ""this is the way we make it,"" and he walked away. Anyone in a customer service centric job can tell you this is the wrong way to respond to a custom complaint.

At the end of the evening my wife and I were left feeling that we were overcharged, under-served, and disrespected by the management. I could forgive the obvious technical errors with the food if the staff was more communicative, but the interaction I had with the evening under-experienced manager only added insult to injury, which is why I give this restaurant 1 star.",0,0,0

The first time I came with a group of 4 and it was so great, I demanded to go again the next time I went to Vegas.

However, this time, with 14 people, the staff was incredibly rude to us and made it extremely apparent that they did not care about us, because we would need to pay the 20% gratuity anyway.  Dining with a group of people with extremely varied tastes, we wanted to order ala carte from the menu...a simple request.  

However, the waiter\/maitre d refused to let us do so, and kept pushing for us to go with the ""tasting sampler"" which would be customized to our tastes.  He kept trying to haggle down the price, which wasn't the issue.  The issue was that some of us wanted only high quality sashimi and rolls and others did not eat raw fish.  Eventually we gave in because we had been arguing with him for nearly 45 minutes.  He promised that there would be ""lots of sushi,"" and food started to come, without ever asking us what types of food we liked.  Eventually sushi did come...4 very, very small rolls, with the cheapest types of fish possible.

Although the food they brought out was good and I tried things that I would probably not have ordered, I wanted to eat the things I did like in large quantities, as did the rest of the people in my group.  If I'm going to pay as much as food at SUSHISAMBA costs, it better damn well be things I actually want to eat.  We probably would have spent more money ordering what we actually wanted anyway.

I have never dealt with service being so pushy and so unresponsive to our requests.  This trip definitely made me rethink my previous love of the restaurant, I'm not sure if I'll be back.",0,0,0

We took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes sea bass with Peruvian corn and Yellowtail Taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. The Peruvian corn was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the sea bass. We let the server know and he brought out some Purple Potato Mash just to try something different and it was better than the corn. 

The service was great. Our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. We enjoyed 4 different sakes, which was more enjoyable than the sushi. 

If you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.

When we first walked in, the decor is super pretty. Place looks really trendy and it was packed on a Wednesday night. Ambience is very hip and is perfect for a date night or girls night out.

DRINKS
NINA FRESA - our server recommended this drink and its super yummy! its a vodka cocktail drink with strawberries and guava.

FOOD
SALMON SEVICHE - excellent seviche... the sauce has a tangy pineapple taste mixed with a little bit of spice because of the jalapenos. really good appetizer.

BERKSHIRE PORK BELLY ROBATA - i think this is the best out of everything that we ordered. the pork belly is super fatty on the outside (but in a good way) and just melts in your mouth. it has a sweet\/salty glaze on top of the meat. this dish is just amazing. i highly recommend this dish.

LAMB CHOP ROBATA - good dish but since they served it with the pork belly, this dish was overshadowed.

BOBO BRAZIL - not your typical sushi roll because they put seared beef on top! this roll is super good though!!! i really recommend this one too.

SAMBA STRIP ROLL - out of all the dishes that we had, i was least impressed with this roll. i ordered it because of the maine lobster but the portion is super small and the taste is bland compared to the price ($19.00). if you really wanna try this dish, i suggest you skip the sauce because it overpowers the maine lobster.

Service is okay and I notice the waitress did not course our meals... Refill on drinks is also a bit slow.

My dates cocktail was pretty impressive as well, the cocktail glass lined in sugar.

I'm pretty partial to Asian Fusion, in general, and with the addition of the Brazilian flair, this place is one of the rare few that get my five stars.

In Vegas style, a pretty swank interior with hanging sculptures, a viewing window of one table, into the mens bathroom, and open and expansive seating area in the back, all come together nicely for a great meal out.

Although it's definitely on the pricier side, it's really worth the money.  And hey, you're in Vegas, and you can't be cheap in Vegas.  When ordering, you have two options: order off the preset menu or let the chefs create a sampling for you at the price you want.  Because this restaurant is a fusion of mainly Japanese and Brazilian, they have many different chefs creating many different things.  Although I tried both, I prefer choosing from the preset menu. This way I don't get something I don't particularly enjoy.  

Out of what I've tried so far, my favorites are the São Paulo roll, the sea bass antichucho, and the garlic butter scallops.  The São Paulo roll is a wonderful combination of scallops, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, red onion, masago, avocado, truffle (!!!), and chive oil.  The sea bass has a miso glaze and comes with Peruvian corn.  The scallops are a bit more special because they aren't on the menu.

It took us about an hour to decide on which restaurant in the Palazzo to dine at....because man are the restaurants SUPER PRICEY. Since we had friends that had to catch a flight we had to eat in the Palazzo so we decided on this place for a group of 9.

This place blends Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian cuisine....while it sounds like a great idea (never heard of such an Asian Fusion Combo)....I think this place tries way to hard to be different. The only thing that I really liked was the grilled sea bass....super yummy but it still was $16 for two mini skewers. It came with Peruvian corn which sounded interesting....but turned out to be huge corn kettles that tasted like buttered lima beans....yucko!!! As far as the sushi I tried about 5 of the 10 rolls they had. Wasn't too impressed with any of them. They looked pretty and all....but weren't so yummy. I tried a few other dishes too....it just seemed like they were blending unique flavors that just didn't blend well together. The few things preventing me from giving this place 2 stars was the great service (note: they do get 20% tip for groups.....so I do expect top quality service), cool ambiance, and hot guys. Check out the break down below:

2 STARS - FOOD (Overall disappointing)....EXCEPT FOR THESEABASS 
2 STARS - PRICE (Expect to pay $40 - $100 per person if you want to get full)
2 STARS - PORTIONS (I left still a bit hungry)
4 STARS - ATMOSPHERE

5 STARS - HOT WORKERS!!! (seriously...do you have to be a model to work here....there was lots of eye candy dressed in all black)

Price wise, of course it's more pricey $$$ but worth the ambiance, service, and sushi.",0,0,0

On this visit, I ordered the king crab leg.  At $25 it seems like a splurge, but it was huge, meaty and absolutely delicious!

Tuna sashimi was fresh and tasty and even my grilled asparagus was perfect.

It wasn't one thing, but many. We showed up last night (a Sunday) around 9. The hostess was ice cold, took 5 minutes to even acknowledge us... as she chatted with a co-worker (the place was fairly empty). No greeting. No smile. We watched her treat others the same. She led us to a booth with grease marks on the seat (we had to ask for a towel to wipe it down; she could of cared less). Our waiter continued the bored vibe. He said hello, walked away, and then finally reappeared 15 minutes later to take our order. Not friendly at all (and we're always overly polite) and would disappear for long stretches. Lots of staff standing around, chatting (with the exception of the busboy who busted his ass). The manager (guess; big guy in a suit) was extremely attentive... toward one particular table (seemed like friends of his). I've never seen such poor service before. It was like an episode of Bar Rescue where the owner isn't there and the staff doesn't give a damn. To top things off, they forgot to bring out one of our orders, but we told the waiter to forget it... to just bring the check. A word of advice to SS corporate.... fire the hostess (first impressions matter), promote the busboy, and train everyone else. Bad service can kill a good restaurant and drive customers away.

To start off, the cons of this place was that it was super cramped and nothing was done even though they asked us what we were celebrating.. Kind of lame in my opinion. But onto the food..

My boyfriend ordered an assortment of things and everything I tried was relatively good, some amazing while others were just good. 

We had the crispy taquitos: 1 yellowtail and 1 japanese wagyu. Both were so good and flavorful!! I can't even explain it.. But they were so small.. Like a 2 bite and that's all kind of thing.. And for the price of it, I can't justify it.. Lucky enough for me, it was my birthday and my boyfriend took care of the tab. 

We also had the kanpachi tiradito. This was hands down the best thing all night! I kept thinking about it even after the meal and even to this day. It comes in 4 thin slices  for $19. So expensive, but the truffle oil and the sauce that accompanied it pulled through together so well. 

The sea bass anticuchos was pretty good too.  It was like 4 pieces of fish on each skewer with 2 skewers. The glaze on the fish was good and the fish was cooked perfectly while still having the flakiness.

I also had the uni sashimi, hirami nigiri and yellowtail jalapeño rolls. Those tasted like how they should be.

Because my boyfriend didn't think we would get full, he ordered the rio grande churrasco. The meats were good and flavorful. A bit on the salty side but the greens and rice helped to balance it out. This dish felt somewhat out of place because everything felt so light, but this was definitely too filling and we had to pack the rest to go.

He informed us of the type of restaurant Sushi Samba was, which is a fusion of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian.  We all weren't sure of what to get so he suggested we do a ""tasty menu"" which I think was the Omakase (on the website menu).  This allowed us to try the different types of food the menu had to offer.  We let him know what we liked and what we didn't like and he informed the chefs and they brought out a plethora of tasty treats that was enough for 7 of us.

THE BEST meal I had all weekend in Vegas. I love sushi. I love whiskey. I love sitting at the bar. I loved the company I had. Even had some laughs with neighboring guests that lost an oyster. 

We ordered two sushi rolls, two appetizers but a double order of the squid because of that incredible smoked soy sauce. If they would bottle that, I would order it online like I do some hot sauce from Nashville. 

They had Japanese whiskey that I was craving. Bottle service for clubs and outings is cheapest with vodka. I missed my whiskey! I believe I had a $25 shot while my friend had a $39 shot. Oops. Should've asked. It was a unique, almost coffee-like whiskey, something similar to SF's Seven Stills.

Service was incredibly friendly and you could tell they work well as a team. If I had time to go there again before I took off, I would. Open one in the Bay Area!",6,4,7

Each portion is tiny so  getting food for multiple people so it can add up. We tried the yellowtail (2 pieces in an order), spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, salt and pepper squid, and the enzo roll (I think that's what it called). The yellowtail was fresh and had a unique sauce (lemongrass) that it came with. The first two rolls and the squid were ok. And the enzo roll was my favorite. It had salmon and these crispy bits in it and was rolled in like a white rice paper instead of seaweed. For drinks we all tried the Fresca, which had muddled strawberries and a bunch of alcohols. I found it light, sweet and refreshing. All and all, a good place for a little something something before dinner.

A big fan of asian fusion, this place was a true celebration of Japanese Brazilian Peruvian cuisine! More on the expensive side, but totally worth the amazing presentation and rich flavors -- every dish was explained to us upon arriving to our table, which made the anticipation even more intense! The assistant manager Jason was very knowledgeable about the menu and extremely charming, making our dining experience all the more enjoyable! :)

WE ORDERED: 
- Shot tree (nina fresa, nashi, samba juice)
- Wagyu gyoza (kabocha purée and su-shoyu dipping sauce)
- Yellowtail taquitos (avocado and roasted corn miso, with spicy aji panca sauce)
- Sea bass anticuchos w\/ peruvian corn
- Alaskan king crab raw bar
- Jumbo shrimp raw bar
- Chef's inspiration Sashimi 15
- Sawagani (flash fried japanese river crabs)
- Tiradito 4 (tuna with granny smith apple, lime & serrano; Yellow tail with lemongrass and red fresno chili; Kanpachi with Yusuf truffle; Salmon with garlic ponzu and Japanese honey) 
- Minter sweet oysters
- Tuna tataki (asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, crispy garlic citrus soy)
- Otsumami (green bean tempura with black truffle aioli, edamame & shishito peppers)

Everything was simply beyond satisfactory. Whether it's a date night, a birthday celebration, a girls night out -- this place is the perfect pick (and officially one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, hands down!).

The absolute favorite and a must have is the waygu beef hot stone. They bring out thin slices of waygu with different oils and spices. You get to cook yourself and the beef is so juicy and tender! It's a must have on the menu. I have brought work groups here and they all rave about the sushi. My largest issue is the service, sometimes is great and sometimes not. We once had a reservation for a large group and Ty somehow lost and took an hour to fix, my issue was they really didn't seem to care about the large inconvenience even though we had a table of 15 and spent thousands of dollars.

The interior much reminded me of Social House in Treasure Island, dark and swanky. The small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. The server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfortunately we didn't get to try any.

We had the assortment of four sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. My favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.

The hamachi kama (yellowtail cheek) was as good as I've had, but missing the grated daikon that it traditionally comes with.

Chicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over peruvian corn) were very livery. I expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite Pho Ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the grade of liver or what.

We also tried a couple rolls, the Neo Tokyo with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. I liked this one more than the BoBo Brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. The kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. Both rolls were pretty good though.

The standout of the meal was the Berkshire Pork Belly butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.

We also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, Sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. These were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.

Fantastic, with your every need being met, and a little bit of hovering to make sure all is to your satisfaction. I weirdly prefer a distant waiter, so it was a little off-putting to have my drink refilled every time it looked half-empty, but they have a top-notch staff, really.

THE FOOD.
Some interesting fusion-y stuff, for sure. I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to Japanese food, so I hesitated at ordering many items, but luckily the group I was with didn't have that issue. The craziest item was the foie gras & gold leaf topped sushi - 100% unnecessary, but it did live up to the Vegas-excess hype that's going on.

The location in Ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  We went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  However, the place got PACKED!  THEY DECIDED TO PUT A ROW OF 6 OR 7 TABLES EXTREMELY CLOSE TOGETHER SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE HAVING DINNER WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU.  YOU CAN HEAR THEIR ENTIRE CONVERSATION, BY THE WAY.  Just entirely too intimate for me.  

Our visit started out kinda rocky.  Our waitress lacked time management skills and\/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? Dont know!  All I do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  So after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  While we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.  

The menu is a combination of Pervian, Brazillian and Asian fusion.  OOOOOH SO DIVINE!  IT WAS SO HARD TO DECIDE ON WHAT TO CHOOSE.  We finally decided on Sushi and Seabass, miso soup and seaweed salad.  The miso is delicious but I've had better.  My friend ordered the Red Wild mushroom and truffle Miso.  IT WAS SOOOOO DELICIOUS!  But, THE SEAWEED SALAD IS A MUST HAVE TO VEGGIE LOVERS.  Seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  I was so pleasantly surprised.  When to food arrived, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT SUSHI I ORDERED BUT ONE OF THEM THE BEST EVER!  As expected, the food is expensive.   Between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. So don't go here if you are trying to save money.  If you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  But, you will still be hungry.

I am a huge fan of Asian Fusion anything.  I would give this place 5 except for the small tables we were sat at.

This place was extremely busy with your traditional lounge down tempo music playing.  It has a huge projector screen displaying various images of sport or anime.  We made RSVP and got seated within 10 minutes.  

Here we go, the host sat us right by the server isle between the entrance and the kitchen, not impress and not off to a good start.  After getting bumped several times I asked to be moved.  Then they moved us to a table that was so close to another couple that we might as well been sharing the bill.  There was no room to move.  I told my girl to wash her hands first before sitting down because we have to pull the table out and asked the people on both side to excuse us.  So far, even worse start.  

Now the food, we were told that the portions are small, so be prepared to order a lot and to damage the AMEX.  We asked for some recommendation from our server whom by the way was absolutely excellent and was there for everything we need.  He even apologized for the tomato can seating we were in.  We ordered the Tuna Taquitos which was unique with taste and textured - 5.00 per pc.  We had the Yellow Tail Carpaccio with yellow sauce - 18.00 for 5 pcs and worth every penny. I had the Filet Mignon,small and pricey but again worth it.  Jennifer had the Sea Bass, again soft and unique flavors, we also had the lamb chop from the Robata and it is the best lamb chop I had recently.  We also had a few rolls as well, small but delicious.  For desserts we had the Donut Holes dipped in melting chocolate.  Again,the great taste!!!  

The service is impeccable, even with small tables, the drinks were unique a bit soft, but the flavors were remarkable.  The portions are extremely small, but again, the taste are unique - Japanese with Brazilian.  The table next to us were from Europe (whom thought this place was as of value, I guest that what happens when you get a Euro into a dollar; instant discount) recommend we try the sampler menu - 80.00 per person but 7 courses.

This place blew us out of the water. 

I'd gotten recommendations to dine here if I ever visited Vegas. Those people are on top of their food game. (Looking at you AJ) 

Sometimes, places are hyped up and I end up having a disappointing meal, even if it was good. This place was not that.

Our server, Jeff, was friggen awesome. He was so friendly and informative. He really knew his stuff and he didn't give us any pressure. Super attentive also, he came around like 3 times while we were going over the menu to see if we needed help. We ended up going with an omakase style of ordering. We gave him a budget of $80pp and told him our must haves and to just wing the rest. He did an excellent job.

Notable dishes:
JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA  - when this dish came out, I was a bit underwhelmed. It just looked like bland dumplings on a plate, but the texture and taste of this was just amazing. It was melt in your mouth, different textured, simple but tasty flavours. I would definitely have more of this.

ASSORTED SASHIMI & ROLLS - The fish was really fresh here. Any of the sashimi would be a good choice. I can't remember what rolls we got, but they were generally really good. There was one that was a bit bland and I believe it was shrimp inside. 

DUCK BREAST - Okay, so.. no joke. This dish ruined mushrooms and duck for me. After our table had this, we couldn't stop raving about it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. A whole duck breast, skin and fat on, seared a perfect medium rare, served on a bed of assorted mushrooms in an asian liqour sauce. Holy moly my, this was SO GOOD. Definitely the best thing we had all night.

The food was pretty good but it's definitely leaning towards more of a high-end Asian fusion restaurant than a traditional sushi place. We ordered the crispy taquitos and two orders of the 9 piece sashimi. The crispy taquitos were suggested by the couple at the table next to us and it was a great choice because it had so many different textures and depths of flavor. It reminded me of the hamachi shot appetizer from Alexander's Steakhouse but in a crispy taco shell. The sashimi was just ordinary, having only selections of tuna, salmon, and hamachi. The salmon was my favorite since it was very sweet, but overall for the price, the sashimi wasn't very amazing.",1,1,1

Even thought the restaurant features three international flavors (Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian,) we were there straightly for sushi.  Upon opening up the menu, the $$$$ you see under the ""Sushi Bar"" section represents a ""unit"" price, what it means is that for $4.5 - MP, you get ""a"" piece of sushi and not ""an order"" of two pieces which you normally would get in a normal kind of Japanese restaurant.

As the foodie in my family, I did all the ordering.  I got the edamame, rock shrimp tempura, yellowtail ceviche, seaweed salad, chicken antichuchos with Peruvian corn, Neo Tokyo roll, Veggie Kun roll, and Yasai quinoa temaki roll.  All of this was enough to feed five people. 

The portion for the rock shrimp tempura was huge!  It came with this spicy sauce that really gave it all of its flavor.  The ceviche had balanced flavors between the tangy and sweet.  I thought the chicken was okay, but the corn it came with was yummy!  I was also amazed by the seaweed salad, in that it was an assortment of different seaweed.  The sushi rolls were also delicious.  And I really liked the fact that the temaki rolls were made from quinoa.  My sister, being vegetarian, was happy with the food she got.

I also got their house ice tea which tasted like a virgin mojito.  And as for dessert, I got the coco duo and the samba split for two.  The coco duo is good for two people (it was hard sharing it with 5..).  I loved the praline and the bit of gold flakes.  I really loved the samba split for two, which was actually good for my entire party.  It was an assortment of caramel popcorn, yamazaki cream, caramelized bananas, assorted berries, dulce de leche ice cream and flan..  One word: wow!  If you're going to order dessert, the samba split will not disappoint! 

We were going to get the fondue, but the waitress told us that it was the least popular and said we should order something else.  If anyone did order the fondue, please let me know what you thought of it!

It originally started in New York City in 1999 and I will tell you that not many restaurants offer such a unique combination of Asian \/ South America fusion cuisine quite like this.

I came here for lunch without a reservation and the restaurant was pretty empty, so I was able to get a seat at the sushi bar. I reviewed the menu and most of items were pretty pricey. Special rolls range from $10 to $26, tonkotsu ramen is $20, each small plate (e.g. taquito, gyoza, etc) is at least $10, and robata (meats, seafood, vegetable, and antichuchos) ranges from $7 to $19.

***

Sea Bass Antichucho (miso and Peruvian corn, $17): A bit too much of miso glaze and tasted slightly salty, but sea bass itself was very good. Peruvian corn tasted pretty chewy and it was a pretty filling food. (4\/5)

São Paulo (scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, whitefish, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chimichurri, $24): $24 sushi roll ... that's enough money for an AYCE sushi! If I can ignore the price, then I do think it was one of the better sushi rolls I've had in a very long time. Fresh fish and good flavors. (4.5\/5)

Great food quality, but portions are pretty small and prices are expensive.

I love the concept of Samba, and stick with the appetizers and small plates.

The service and attention to detail is simply impeccable and worth every penny.

It's dark, it's loud, and there are colorful flashing images of Japanese stuff on the walls. Since it's fusion food, there might have been other images spliced in between. I don't know, it's probably all subliminal.

Japanese-Brazilian-Peruvian fusion is an interesting concept. I've eaten all 3 types of cuisine separately, and I know the distinct flavors. But fusion? Usually I take that word to the extreme -- either really bad, or really good. Here, based on the dishes we had, it's teetering somewhere in the middle.

Right off the bat, our waitress was energetic and helpful, especially when I asked her for recommendations. Since the menu can be daunting, she recommended the chef omakase, which can range from $60-100 per person. The higher range includes cooking thin slices of kobe beef on a hot rock. We eventually decided to go with the items on the menu.

I started off with the Samba Juice cocktail, which practically has every exotic fruit flavor imaginable like watermelon, acai, raspberry, guava, passion fruit, etc. While refreshing, it was just basically overpriced fruit juice. It desperately needed more alcohol. Oh there was rum in there? I think there was a tickle of rum on my tongue. 

The food arrived fast, which was good and bad at the same time. The tables for 2 are ridiculously small and cramped. It was like playing Tetris, trying to fit in all the plates on our table without having anything fall over. We ordered a good variety of dishes, some hits and some misses.

Thumbs up:
- Rock shrimp tempura
- Crispy taquitos (tacos) w\/ yellowtail seviche
- Yellowtail sashimi seviche

Thumbs sideways:
- ""Whole"" squid w\/ lemon aioli
- Grilled hamachi kama
- Banana honey crisp taquito (taco)

Thumbs down:
- Samba strip roll w\/ maine lobster
- Miso sea bass skewer w\/ peruvian corn

This may sound extreme, but just telling it like it is -- the $19 sushi roll tasted like Costco sushi. The texture of the rice was mushy and slithery, like it was pre-made and left in the fridge for a while. I didn't even really taste any lobster. They did leave out the shells for presentation, just to remind you that it does, in fact, contain lobster.

The miso sea bass skewer was horribly oversalted, either from plain salt or from the miso marinate. While buttery in texture, it was barely edible without having to take a big gulp of water. The peruvian corn kernels look like regular corn on steroids. While intriguing to look at, they were bland and had an uneasy and chewy texture about them.

The other dishes were okay, nothing extremely imaginative or creative on the palate. Although we ordered our own dessert, our waitress was nice enough to give us an additional complimentary chocolate mousse with these little crunchy malt balls on top, to celebrate our anniversary. It even had a sparkler on it, attracting dozens of eyes. I felt like a baller at a club, albeit for 10 seconds before the sparkler died off. 

Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner with good service. But the whole fusion thing didn't work out for me. If I want Japanese food, I know where to get it -- the same goes for Brazilian and Peruvian, respectively. It was cool trying the place out, just another restaurant checked off on our long list of Vegas bookmarks.",10,7,7

Sushi Samba is a unique restaurant in that it's a blend of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian influence, and we had so many different flavors and samplings of things, this will be quite a mixed review.  

They definitely anticipate people being unable to choose from the wide-range of items on the menu, so they actually give you the option of letting the waitress put together your order based on likes, dislikes, preferences, food allergies, and based on PRICE, etc.  We spouted out... ""Salmon!""   

                ""Tuna!""  

""SPICE!""        ""allergic to shrimp!""    

                 ""Jalapenos!""  

So, the waitress brought out the following:

(1) Edamame with sea salt and lime.

Small plates:
(2) Berkshire Pork Gyoza (kabocha pumpkin pureé and su-shoyu dipping sauce) - VERY good! The pumpkin puree is a nice touch!  Just be sure to scrape it all off the plate when you pick up the gyoza!
(3) Tuna Tataki (white asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, citrus soy) - This is seared tuna, marinated a bit in vinegar and ginger - also very good. I have never had tatsoi before - but it is quite good! Tastes and looks a bit like spinach but is better!

Seviches:
(4) Salmon asparagus, red radish, pineapple, lime - quite good! 2nd fave of the four seviches.
(5) Yellowtail jalapeño and lemongrass - Our table came to the consensus that this was the winner of the 4 seviches.  Perfect amount of spice from the japaleno, and just a bit of tang from the lemongrass - goes very well together with the hamachi! VERY good!
(6) Tuna granny smith apple, serrano, lime - I did NOT like this one - the apple taste is awful in my opinion... Pass.
(7) The last one had a very traditional Peruvian seviche taste - lemon, lime very simple, and good.  The type of fish they used escapes me now.. apologies.

Robata:
(8) Sea bass and miso anticucho - sea bass pieces marinated with delicious miso on skewers - SO GOOD. The fish is very fresh and tender - and the miso is light, but very tasty!  It also comes with Peruvian corn kernels - which if you haven't had it - each kernel is about 5 times the size of a normal corn kernel, and is a bit meatier. YUM!

Large plates:
(9) Toban Yaki organic mushroom, charred green onion, garlic chips, kobe beef! They split this in two bowls - which was strange because one bowl was better than the other. Not sure how much I liked this dish - the sauce was very heavy\/creamy yet bland and lacked something. The other bowl had more tang to the sauce and was better - inconsistency - not good!  Mushrooms were yummy though!

Samba rolls:
(10) El Toro (salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion): the fave of the bunch yet still not that great seeing as how it doesn't really ""count"" as sushi - melted mozzarella? come on.
(11) Neo Tokyo yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca - this was a disappointment! The waitress called it the ""ultimate spicy tuna"" - but it was NOT spicy whatsoever.  She mentioned that they use a fresher version of tuna - not so when you order spicy tuna elsewhere (where they use the leftover bits of fish and mash it up). MEH, pass.
(12) Veggie Kun avocado, tomato, arugula, oshinko, yamagobo, wasabi nori flake, tofu miso - PASS! Tastes fresh but dude - where's the fish!? 
(13) CAN'T REMEMBER this last roll because I was SO FULL and couldn't have anymore!!!

This was SO much food - 70 per person. I'd pass on the rolls, and go for samplings of their other small dishes, seviches, skewers! 4 stars.",0,0,0

Portions were unnecessairly small and over priced. One of my favourite dishes is sea bass. I'm always thrilled whenever I see it on the menu. This is the first time I ordered the dish and thought a simple 'meh' by the time it was done. It was fatty, overly sweet and just not the sea bass I know and love anywhere else I go.

Overall we left with a lot less money then we should have and without a typical Vegas memorable food experience.

I say pass, especially considering all the other amazing restaurants on the strip.",0,0,0

Food was just so-so, I like my Japanese food to be delicate and have a perfect balance and only using the most minimal and basic ingredients. When I started tasting weird flavors that didn't go well together in my assortment of food, it ruined what I come to love about Japanese food.

Reading about the Omakase experiences was what got me interested. I'll spare you the details on the interior. (Aunny D. explained it perfectly) The place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. They hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. The service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome. 

Now for the food.....

We had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both Traditional Omakase($100) and the Sushi Samba Omakase ($80). After going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the Omakase. This way, you end up getting food that would be in the Omakase anyway, more food (Omakase 7 -course), and for less. 

""Small Plates"" and ""seviches & tiraditos""  (Graded A to F)

Tuna Tataki  - (C+) Chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish

Seared Kobe Beef -(F) Just not worth it. Mushrooms overwhelms it

Chicharron de Calamar - (A) Excellent and generous amount!

Sashimi Seviches - (B) grapefruit juice, jalapeño, almond + 
passionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro 

Sashimi Tiraditos - (D) Yellowtail jalapeño and lemongrass + Salmon orange and mustard miso

Sushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. Sushi Samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. For $33, we had the Samba Sushi and Sashimi combo. The sashimi was nice and thick.  Both Salmon and Yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. The sushi was a complete joke. You get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. Most Japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. Sushi Samba gives you ONE. My whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. It doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. Guess what? They're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. We also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work. 

Now here's how we felt that the chefs were completely LAZY or inexperienced. The sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. Plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. Overall, I would not waste any money on sushi here. It's a complete insult to customers. 

Our final dish was the 5 Meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, lingüiça with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - This dish was fantastic. The meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (A+)

Now, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. More than double than what you'll get in a Omakase.  We had about 5 bottles of Japanese beers. Our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people) 

I would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. Its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. DONT come here for the Japanese food. Go to a real Japanese restaurant for the Omakase. Just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a true Omakase.  

If you actually read this whole thing. Thanks!",4,4,4

The sushi was excellent.  We tried the chef's selection which came with a nice assortment of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and shrimp.

Total incl gratuity: ~$110

I am so stunned that Sushi Samba (SS) has an overall rating of 3.5!  It definitely deserved a 5 in my book.  Was pretty blown away by all of their food.  I'm not usually that impressed with Asian fusion but they deserve two thumbs up.  We arrived at 10pm and I was expecting it to be rather dead but it was still busy and happening.  All tables occupied, loud music bumping, and servers running around.

The BF and I decided on a few dishes to share.  Everything on the menu ranged between $10 - $30.  Granted we ordered a number of different items - for variety and sufficiency - we figured our dinner bill would be a little pricey.  Seeing shisito peppers on the menu, I had to go for it.  I don't know what it is about these little things but I love them.  SS serves them grilled with a splash of lemon and seasalt.  A very good and light starter.  It actually went really well with the lemongrass sauce that was served with the hamachi tiradito.  Don't even get me started on that lemongrass sauce. O.M.Gee. I'm pretty sure there was a hint of crack in that thing because I was drinking that stuff.  It was so incredibly delicious.  When the waitress tried to take my plate away, she noticed how much I was savoring each drip of it so she brought me out a ramekin of it.  Naturally I was dipping everything in that sauce.

The seabass skewers were just as delectable - melted in my mouth with the perfect flavor of miso.  Highly recommend!  We noticed our neighbor ordered the moqueca mista. It looked delicious and we opted for it as well.  It was the perfect entree.  I couldn't have been more pleased.  The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.  The coconut lime flavor was delicious.

Seriously, SS is fantastic  I can't emphasize it enough.  Since I've been back home, I've been telling everyone about this place. No joke!  One can only hope that they'll open one in SF.  I'm headed back to Vegas in a week - making my way back there for SURE!",3,1,1

It was somewhat crowded when we got there on Valentine's Day weekend although I should say I have never seen Vegas this empty compared to previous years during such holidays.  My first impression of the restaurant wasnt as expected, the tables were somewhat worn out and chipped at on the surface, and due to the place being crowded the tables and chairs were very close to the neighboring tables, it felt like the people who were setted next to us were actually sitting with us.  So that was kinda annoying.  Ok enough of negative :) now the positives.  Our waiter was excellent.  I wanted to eat sushi but i was thinking of trying different things on the menu, therefore our serves suggested that we order this special that they have.  He asked us how much we wanted to spend and according to our budget he would bring different dishes so we could basically taste their whole menu and have variety of foods.  Our waiter stated that if we dont like any of the food that is being served he would be happy to replace it with something else.  I was ready to spend around 70 a person so he started off according to my budget.  We had different variety of sashimi, cut rolls peruvian dishes with mushrooms and duck, crab legs etc.  He served us with 7 different dishes and we basically told him to skip the desert since we were very full at that point.

Service was very poor... This was quite possibly the worst experience I've had all year. We sat at table 109; our server's name was not on the receipt so I do not know his name. We had a party of eleven girls.  A lot of us flew in from across the country to have a reunion and celebrate a birthday, but no one left with a smile on our face. In fact, our birthday girl even left EARLY because she just was not having it. 

The food in general was unimpressive. A lot of items were very heavily salted (like the miso soup and seabass).A miso soup for $6 is rather comical, considering a box of sea salt costs half the price and our soup probably contained a third of that much. We had to send back the seabass because it was way too salty. You are better off getting sushi elsewhere. I follow one of their sushi chefs on Instagram, and had felt lied to when we got our rolls. Our rolls looked and tasted so average; I've had better from our supermarkets in Little Tokyo. Maybe he only works at the sushi bar? Unsure, you'd have to confirm if you dare to dine here. 

For everything we wanted\/needed, we had to ask for it at least three times. Why did it feel like I was begging for extra bowls, to-go boxes, or updated bills (at the end of the meal)?

I told our server to cancel one of my orders (one of the specialty rolls). I was in no mood to eat and wanted to get out of the restaurant as soon as possible. But it was brought out later anyway. I did confront him about it and he said he would take it off for me. 

Our server had brought out an outdated receipt thinking it was okay. We said we wanted to see the updated check so he excused himself to go get it. So we waited for a bit and eventually got tired of waiting and asked a nearby server to get us our check. Which of course he did not. This was another solid twenty minutes of waiting like sitting ducks. By this point, we did not want to stay in the restaurant for a minute longer, so we walked up to a host stand, asked a server who was standing there not doing anything, to get us an updated bill so we could check out. 

After our server noticed us, he walked over to us and told us to go to the host stand up in the front to wait for the manager. He said our transaction would be quicker if we went to the host stand.. So we got our updated bill, which deducted the roll and extra seabass, and paid our bill. Our server thanked us and told us to have a great rest of our evening. I asked our server if the manager was coming out right now and his response was: ""oh no, he's not coming out. But I can grab him if you want."" 

Wait what?!?! So you LIED about bringing your manager out? Okay... You shouldn't have brought it up in the first place!! Now at last, I am livid, because my patience has finally run out and one can only handle so much.

Our friend left a bag of hers at the restaurant so we reluctantly had to head back and grab it. As she walked out, a server noticed she looked quite upset and asked what the matter was. My friend told the server that we felt quite mistreated and very disappointed at our experience.The server offered to deduct 15% from our total bill, but we refused. We were not there to snag a comped meal or there. We were there because we follow one of your sushi chefs on social media, and was really excited to immerse ourselves in a SUSHISAMBA experience.

My friend and I studied hospitality administration in college, are\/were in the hospitality industry for many years, and I myself have been in the restaurant industry. We really did try to keep our cool and be understanding. We defended the server many, many times, saying that even though he might not be on his A game, he was very nice overall. There was only so much we could do to defend his actions, but our last twenty minutes spent that this establishment was unforgivable. Please take your money somewhere else, diners, and spare yourself the headache.",9,0,1

* did I just say that?! *

Their menu is very eclectic and extensive comprising of Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian influences, with a fun cocktail and sake menu to match. This place does wonders for the partygoers in Vegas: a very lively ambiance, great for big groups and the food is kick ass too. 

And sometimes, you get luckier with an awesome server like Max. He deserves a raise (and the 25% tip we gave him!) From start to finish, we were completely taken cared of.  At first, we couldn't decide if we want to order sushi, ramen, sashimi, ceviche, churrasco, how many appetizers, are we gonna order sake?! Or just cocktails? Maybe both? (why is this even a question?!) 

He suggested the omakase menu, asked what price point we were comfortable with ($50\/person, not including alcohol) and what we want to have: definitely foie gras, definitely meat and some sushi. 

He went to town! OMG. All these years I've come to Vegas, this is one of the few times when we put our total trust on our server and we were so happy we did! 

We sipped on pisco sours, Hendrick's cucumber martini and ordered a bottle of sake. Soon after our food came and the kitchen paced our dishes well. 

The Appetizers: steamed organic edamame, green bean tempura with truffle aioli and grilled shishito peppers.
 
From the small plates menu: the freshest tuna tataki topped with white asparagus and avocado,  crispy-chewy salt and pepper squid and pork gyoza with kabocha pumpkin purée and su-shoyu dipping sauce. 

The miso marinated chilean sea bass was the softest fish ever! simply served with roasted asparagus, it was incredible to have seafood this fresh in Vegas.

Undeniably, the star of the show was the Rio Grande plate which came with grilled hangar steak, ribeye and pork tenderloin. It's a good thing there weren't any vegeatarians in our group, we dove into that plate with so much gusto! the malaguito pepper oil and chimichurri sauce paired perfectly with our succulent meats.

Then came more food! three different sushi rolls and a couple of nigiri sushi. California sucks for banning foie gras, so I'm glad that Max included the Yamato roll in our omakase menu:  tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar made prettier with gold leaf. Holy mother of [fill in the blank here]!!!!  JUST GET IT.

You'd think we'd end the fantastic meal right here, but no, our birthday girl wasn't forgotten: a complimentary chocolate mousse with malted balls inluding a sparkler for the celebrant! sister was all smiles, of course.

Thank you sushisamba! Ask for Max if you want to turn your night from ordinary to a great one!",18,18,16

Miami's food is much fresher, much better prepared, much better presented, much better tasting.  Had the miso bass anticucho, which was not as fresh as I am used to have it, and the elote was overcooked and not fresh either, like almost mushy.  

Also had a caipiriñha type of drink with mushed berries.., aweful! Couldn't swallow and I am not able to tell what it was about it.

Loved, however, the pineapple turnover.  Was perfectly made, as big as the palm of your hand, not too sweet, not too sour, perfect texture and consistency, plain quite delicious.  

The restaurant is very dark, lots of dark wood.., the bar is like a piece of tree trunk.., the waitstaff does not seem to have any sense of style, although I have to say everyone was very, very nice.., but the point is that it is not what you expect once you have been to the more stylish, chic restaurant in Miami Beach.

Long story short, we were at the wrong casino.  We decided to stay at Palazzo.  We love the Palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  However, this is my least favorite dining expereince I've had to the Venetian or Palazzo.

SushiSamba was having their happy hour on Friday 4-7.  We sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  We each decided to try the Caipirinhas.  I'd equate this to a Brazilian margarita.  I think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  Not positive though.  She hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of ""This isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done"".  We didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  We just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  I thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  Then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  If she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  Regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  Didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.

As far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, shrimp tempura roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  Chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  Shrimp tempura roll was average.  Salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  Without the sauce, they aren't very good.  Last but not least, the dish I truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  The yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.

All said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  Not bad.  However, there was something about this place, I don't see myself ever coming back here.  Other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  Average to mediocre at best.",1,1,1

I give it 3 stars because I felt like the servings were  skimpy on the Kobe beef and some of the sashimi- and they didn't do a great job placing the items ( like the hot stone to cook the Kobe beef) within reach of everyone on the table. For the prices ( I selected the 100 dollars a person option) I felt like there should have been better service in this area. Also some of the dishes to pass that had sauce on them ended up getting spilled on some of my guests and it was a little awkward having to wipe the melted butter off the shirt of the guy next to me. Maybe they need deeper dishes for those items to prevent this from happening. The fish was grade A and the sushi was fantastic.

Not until after I finished my large Kirin did the girls get their drinks. It wouldn't have been so bad if the place was packed. Then it came to our meals. We placed our order for sushi and to my surprise one order, which usually means two pieces, means one. What the hell. I could have gone to a better sushi bar and paid less. I spent $65 for 10 pieces of sushi. I could understand if I got some blowfish but I didn't. Squid and Uni nothing fancy. The rolls were nothing to brag about and then my wife ordered a steak. It was over cooked and had quite a bit of fat on it for a New York cut. It was also lightly seasoned and the sauces were bland. The presentation was way better than the taste.

What I found different about this establishment compared to others is the approach of ordering from their menu.  Our waiter asked us for a price range we're willing to spend.  An example range is $60-$120.  My brother (who's birthday we're celebrating) said about $80 per person.  Next, the waiter asks us what our likes, dislikes, allergies, etc in order to create a unique dining experience for us.  My brother basically said he doesn't want to eat sushi (he didn't feel like it that day), wants to try the gyoza, and definitely want to sample the kobe beef.  After our drinks arrived, we waited about 10-20 minutes before our appetizers and entrees came.

We tried a variety of food which ranged from gyozas, skewers, sea bass, and kobe beef.  The main attraction is the kobe beef where they bring a large stone that's heated to 700 F for us to cook our thinly sliced beef on.  The waiter demonstrated by taking some butter and spreading it on top of the stone followed by laying the beef on top like it's sunbathing.  After a minute or two, the beef slices were dipped onto 1 of 3 sauces and finally onto our table.  The verdict: mouth watering bliss.  Almost as good as the kobe beef I had in Kobe, Japan!!!

- Seabass: $29 miso glazed and pretty freakin delicious. Cooked perfectly also. But the portion was probably 3 maybe 4 bites at most.

- Handrolls: We had salmon skin, salmon and avocado, spicy tuna, and yellowtail. The ingredients were fresh, but the rolls were very small and about ~$8-$10\/each.

- Various rolls: We tried the Yamato ($19 for 3 pieces). There wasn't even enough for me to get a chance to try it since there were only 3 pieces LOL, but my friends said it was probably the best roll there. Pure decadence being topped with foie gras, caviar, and gold flakes. We also tried a few other rolls for which I can't remember the names (SORRY!) but they had wagyu beef and another had maine lobster. Both were interesting, but I wasn't blown away.

- Nigiri: Fresh but again, extremely pricey! $5-$10 a PIECE! Yup, not an order of 2 pieces...that price is PER PIECE! O_o

- Sides: We ordered the corn and plantains at $7 each. The corn was delicious but a very small portion in a cup. Same thing with plantains. Grilled deliciously but only a few slices for a whopping $7.

The service was fantastic and our server was very friendly. I would list off everything we ordered, but there were five of us and I couldn't remember the names of half the things we ordered, let alone all the desserts (we ordered 3 sampler platters for dessert, so I'll just stick to a few. My father ordered one of the duck dishes, I don't remember which one since I didn't place the order, but it was fantastic. The duck was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a perfect complement to the natural flavors of the duck. The two rolls we ordered were the Samba Strip and the Bobo Brazil. The Bobo brazil was absolutely phenomenal. The seared kobe inside was of great quality and worked very well with all of the other ingredients. The Samba Strip was very different for me, as I had never had a roll with Lobster and was a little unsure, but I'm glad we went with it! I loved the way the peanut curry worked with the mango and the texture of the lobster. The most memorable part of the night, by far, was ordering the dessert. My girlfriend is from Brazil and one of her absolute favorite things is Brigadeiro. She was ecstatic to see it on the dessert menu in one of the dishes, because it is difficult to find a place that makes Brigadeiro (good or not aside, there just aren't many places that have it), especially where we live (AZ). She asked our server if she could just get a small plate of Brigadeiro by itself for dessert, and the server he would have to check with the chef. Here, though, they went a little above and beyond for me. Despite the Brigadeiro being listed only as an ingredient in a dish, the chef said that they would make a plate by itself, just for us. However, the chef wanted to inform us that it was not traditional brigadeiro, and even prepared a small sample for us to try before ordering a plate so that we wouldn't be disappointed if we were hoping for the traditional stuff. I can't find fault with service like that.

On a side-note, they have a dish that is cooked on a hot stone and comes out sizzling on that hot stone. I have no idea what it was called, but it was ordered repeatedly by other tables and smelled absolutely phenomenal. I would go back just to sit at the bar and be able to smell that dish being brought out to other tables.",1,0,0

The combination of the food, staff, music & hospitality is above & beyond. The manager, Rannah, was incredible & most importantly, genuinely cared about the service & our experience at the restaurant. She was sweet enough to give me a complimentary delicious mojito for my loyalty to the brand. LOVE! 

The must haves - seared beef tapas, yellowtail taquitos & seabass miso. I might have cried a little bit  indulging in all the food we ordered. It was that good! Bottomline, Sushi Samba across the board is phenomenal, but the Vegas Strip certainly wins the gold medal. It was one of my highlights during this particular trip.

Start out with a drink.  The sake list is long and distinguished, sure to satisfy even the most discerning sake drinker.  And if sake is not your thing, they have great signature drinks. Try the Yemenja (vodka, ginger liqueur, lemongrass and mint).

Time to eat!  You'll discover the menu is just as eclectic as the ambience, fusing Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine.  If you want sushi, they have sushi.  Or if you prefer Brazilian BBQ, they have Churrasco.  But it's the smaller more distinct plates that make this place great.   The miso-glazed seabass skewers are a MUST, served with large kernel Peruvian corn, they're ""melt in your mouth"" good.  Also, the Samba Strip roll (lobster, mango, peanut curry) will knock your socks off.  One could return to this spot several times and still not try everything on the menu.

I had the yellowtail tiradito and it was an incredibly flavorful appetizer.   The Pacific roll with king crab, asian pear and a wasabi-avocado crema was excellent.  It was a generous size and it was different than your typical sushi offering.  

I highly, highly, highly recommend the sea bass & miso skewers.  The texture is perfect and the flavor is spectacular!  Three of us ordered it and left not a crumb on our plates.

Takeaways?  Fast all day.  Go to Sushi Samba in the Venetian\/Palazzo.  Drink fun drinks.  Order a la carte and enjoy the options.  Eat the sea bass or you are missing out.",0,0,0

I got in late on a Saturday nightbefore a convention, and I was craving sushi. I stumbled upon SushiSAMBA was quickly seated a table. The ambiance is dark, sort of like a night club but with sushi chefs inside. Because it's Vegas, the staff is distinctly beautiful. To their credit, they are all super nice and attentive. A live DJ spun an eclectic mix of songs ranging from hip hop classics, to top 40 and some 80s soft rock ballads. Every track had a great, catchy beat, and I found myself bobbing my head along with it more often than not.

I started with a Red Rice Ale which was absolutely fantastic. It is a pricey 11 oz. bottle at $14 but I loved the flavor. I stuck to a simple chef's choice sashimi and sushi combo which ran for $30. I've seen worse prices and i was definitely pleased with the value once the meal came out.

The display that came out was fantastic and consisted of 6 pieces of sashimi (tuna, yellowtail, and salmon), 6 pieces of sushi (tuna, shrimp, and mackerel), and a cut roll which came with a key lime and hoisin dipping sauce which I thought was really weird until I tried it and marveled and how the flavors complimented each other.

After the meal I had a Yamazaki Japanese whiskey, aged 18 years. Something about Japanese whiskey just does it for me. I had a 12 year Yamazaki a month or two ago but this 18 year whiskey was outstanding. It was sweet and spicy and went down smooth. I am glad I had it neat as I'm sure I would have lost some of the complexity if I had gotten it on the rocks like I usually do.

All in all, SushiSAMBA was an amazing experience. While I can't lie and say it was not bit expensive, I definitely felt like I got my money's worth. I'd love to come back here before or after a night out with friends to share the experience with a group",0,0,0

Tuna tataki
Uni nigiri (6 orders: only 1 piece per order)
Hamachi sashimi

Yamato roll was expensive and small. I can understand why it's expensive but the price wasn't worth paying. I absolutely love tuna, foie gras, and caviar so that's why we ordered it.....but all those together on a roll just wasn't to my liking.

Tuna tataki was above average but nothing to rave about. Every place puts their own spin on tuna tataki. So, me being the tuna lover that I am...we had to try it. I've had better. It wasn't memorable.

Hamachi sashimi was suprisingly fresh. We were hesitant to order it because we were thinking Las Vegas wouldn't have fresh fish. We were surprised.

Uni nigiri was the best I've EVER had anywhere so far. VERY surprised! Also liked the nori (seaweed) around the uni because it wasn't too chewy. They don't put wasabi in the middle which is a plus for me since I don't like wasabi.

The good: 1.5 stars for the uni alone, 1 star for the fun atmoshphere, and 1 star for the large menu selection.

SushiSamba is an Asian Fusion type of Restaurant.  It takes the combination of Japanese, Brizilian and Peruvian cuisine to create their menu.  After attending a show in the area we had the craving for some Sushi.  We had decided on Sushisamba.

My expectations were low, just another sushi bar in Vegas...
We gave our server, Veronica, a per-person budget and let her pick.

 I was blown away!

We were served Mini Tacos, Sea Bass skewers, Sashimi Ceviche, Seared Wagyu Beef, Salt & Pepper Squid and more. The plates just kept coming. How did they get such incredible flavors into the food? I would put Sushisamba up against the best. Sure, Nobu (Malibu) may have great atmosphere, but the flavors, quality, variety, and probably 100 different sakes here, make them a strong competitor.

We were pulled in by stunning smells illuminating from Sushi Samba's cozy corner restaurant.  Service from the start was top notch.  We decided to sit bar-side.  The sous chef, Robert, came out and gave us a personal welcome for our first visit; followed by a generous on-the-house appetizer.  Sea Scallop with pesto magic.  One bite was packed full of a fresh, balanced flavor that took my taste buds to a place they haven't been in many years.  After one bite, I knew we had come to the right place.

On recommendation from the chef - we ordered Sea Bass with veggies and a sweet miso drizzle.  Now to me, Sea Bass if very rarely billed as a ""main course"" but wow - this dish was spectacular.  A must try for any fan of the sea.  The cocktails are inventive, unique and balanced.  Try one of their special Sake Martini's - tastes like you've never had before.  

Sushi Samba is the real deal.  They made it perfectly clear that the restaurant intends to better serve their customers and grow it's gourmet creations .  All of their products are the pinnacle of fresh.  No doubt restocked daily.  The presentation of everything from drinks to dinner was carefully crafted with intention and purpose.  Quick service and an aim-to-please attitude top to bottom made us feel more like we were clients than customers.

We ended the night with a round of delicious fruit sake cocktails and a heart-felt thank you to Allen, the manager on duty.  In my opinion, the pricing is quite appropriate given the freshness, quality, service and atmosphere.  They nailed it, BRAVO!

So if you're a fan of fine dinning, service, sushi or delicious cocktails - I highly recommend you make plans to visit Sushi Samba.

This was entirely satisfying for 4 of us and did not punch us in the nads with the bill.

OMFG, I absolutely LOVE THIS PLACE! Came here before the club and everything was just so freakin' AMAZING! I didn't get to order everything I wanted to, but I will DEFINITELY be back.

Ordered:
x TUNA TATAKI asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, crispy garlic citrus soy - I pretty much order tuna tatami everywhere I go and this was good, but not AMAZING. I think I was too distracted by the other amazing dishes.
x SALT AND PEPPER SQUID dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, smoked soy - Probably the best ""calamari"" I've ever had in my life. The squid was so tender and soft and the batter was perfectly fried.
x CRISPY YELLOWTAIL TAQUITOS served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - Ummmm, literally one of the best things EVER. They are more like tacos... but BOMB @$$ tacos to say the least. At $6\/ea, they were worth every penny.
x ASSORTED TIRADITO - all were good, but the best one was definitely the kanpachi. I could be biased since it's one of my favorite fishes, but OMFG this thing is SOOO good. Next time I'll just order a whole order of just that :)  
- YELLOWTAIL* jalapeño and lemongrass
- KANPACHI* yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, chive, garlic
- TUNA* granny smith apple, serrano, lime
- SALMON* kinkan honey, garlic ponzu, garlic chip
x SEA BASS miso and peruvian corn - Ok, the sea bass was soo good, but the effing CORN was where it was at. They were the biggest, most gigantic corn kernels I've ever seen in my life!! The boyfie enjoyed this one so much he said he wanted to order 2 order for himself next time.
x Yellowtail and scallion handroll - Decent handroll, but nothing to rave about.
x King Crab handroll - I wasn't going to order this, but crab handrolls are the boo's fave so ordered myself one too. AMAZING. CRAPTON of crab in this handroll and it doesn't come with the disgusting mayo-y sauce like most crab handrolls :) 
x A few different rolls which were forgetful.

Service was a little slow, but they were friendly. Crappy job at refilling our drinks, but the food made up for it. Pretty decor and upscale, trendy vibes.

We had a reservation at 8:30, and we arrived around 8:15. We knew we were a tad early, so they told us it would be a few minutes. We did not sit down until around 9 p.m., meanwhile they sat parties of walk-ups ahead of us. I was willing to overlook this little snafu when we finally sat down, but then we were completely ignored by our waiter. By the time 9:30 p.m. rolled around, we had not ordered, we did not have water, and we did not have a waiter. He finally made his way over to our table, at this point we were starving.

We all got cocktails and ordered, but it really felt like they were off their game since everything took forever to reach our table. I have to think it was a bad night, because this place would be out of business with service like this every night. 

The food was okay, we got the appetizer sampler, a few specialty rolls, and skewers. Typical sushi fare, I didn't quite see the fusion aspect. My friend got pretty sick after the meal, so something he ordered did not agree with him. 

Overall, horrible experience, I'll never go back and I'd never recommend it to anyone coming in to town. Save yourself the headache and pick almost any other restaurant for a better time.",0,0,0

Careful when ordering the Kobe, it's $27 an ounce usually a 5oz minimum. My smart friend ordered 10oz's off the bat thinking it was only $27 total. I am not sure of the name, but the Kobe cooked on a hot rock is delicious. Worth $150 per order? Just for the experience.

The bad the service at least from our waitress was horrendous. It took us at least a half hour to order anything drinks or starters. When she was taking our order she was talking to the other servers at the same time. She was never anywhere to be found except by the kitchen window, which we had a perfect view of, talking and laughing with other servers who were all actually leaving to help their tables during the conversations with her. We started asking questions to other waiters cause she just wasn't there. We left early from our dinner because it was taking far longer than anyone should be sitting there for.

The good, the food was good not the most amazing sushi I've had for the price but good. Fish was fresh and the small plates were tasty. The other staff working were very helpful and always around to help us. Even when the other person at my table spilled something on themselves they went to go get club soda and extra napkins for cleaning up.

I like the concept of the restaurant  so that drew me in. Sat at the bar last Thursday and we had great service from the bartenders, a blonde gal and dark haired gentleman. The bar seats are these really comfy large round stools, which I liked! I had a really good spicy something drink with tequila, enjoyed it! We weren't super hungry so we did edamame, sashimi tiradito and two rolls.  Had the yellowtail sashimi tiradito. Ok, taste wise it was good, but it didn't have that super awesome super fresh melt in your mouth taste AND portion size was way off for the price. I'm not upset about the 4 pieces,  I'm upset that they were so small and paper thin! I would have rather gotten another one of their awesome looking rolls for the same price.
We had two of their Samba rolls which I enjoyed. The Carnaval and El Topo. It was hard to decide on the rolls because they all sounded awesome. These were both pretty good, enjoyed the Carnaval the best. The fish tasted pretty fresh as well and was not overpowered by all the other flavors going on.

We stayed in the Jockey Club, which is connected to the Cosmopolitan, so the majority of our meals took place in there because they have a lot of decent restaurants. 
I had this place bookmarked in the weeks leading up to the trip, but I didn't really pay attention to where exactly it was on the strip. I also hadn't planned well for the weather, and brought mostly black dresses. 
Well, this place is located in the Venetian. If you don't know how far the Venetian is from the Cosmopolitan, just imagine how long the strip is, then imagine walking about half of the strip, just for lunch, with one person in your party wearing a black dress and the other wearing a dress suit and pants. This is during summer, when the high reaches nearly 110 degrees during the day. Yes, my boyfriend loves me very much to be dealing with this sort of thing.
We finally arrived and noticed the interesting decor, which was not traditional at all. We knew this was a fusion restaurant, but we were starting to worry that the food wouldn't be as good as advertised.
Luckily, our worries were put to rest after receiving the appetizer we ordered, which were gyoza with kombucha paste filling. They were tangy, and if dipped into the sauce, salty. Very delightful...I would recommend to every customer.
Next the manager came over and talked with us for a bit before recommending the sea bass skewers with Peruvian corn. We hesitated a bit, because we wanted sushi for lunch on account of our plans for a buffet at dinner, but he insisted that it was a plate that shouldn't be overlooked, so we got it.
Soon after, he returned with complimentary ceviche tacos, as a gift for buying so much food (we also got a special roll each and a roll to share)! Quite a lot of food for a meal we wanted to be light.
The tacos were decent, I'd say 3\/5 stars. Interesting to try, but I wouldn't say I'd order them if I return. The skewers, however, were 5\/5. The corn was huge and chewy, while the skewers were well-flavored and -cooked, and unbelievably tender. I am immensely grateful that the manager suggested these, as it was one of the most unique dishes I've ever had. I would recommend these to any customer, as well.
I didn't try my boyfriend's roll, because I don't like shrimp in my sushi, but my roll was pretty good. I wanted their Samba roll, but settled for the Maine lobster roll. It may be difficult to believe, but I thought there was a little too much lobster on the roll (don't hurt me)!
We split a basic salmon avocado roll, which was average. 
It ended up being a lot of food in general, but a lot more than we expected to get.

Some people say that this is some kind of fine dining place; the problem is the food was nasty and the menu didn't even make sense (Do you want some fried plantains with that Sashimi?

If you give them a set $$ amount that you want to spend they really stay within that figure and help you enjoy a variety of their dishes. More than you probably would if you tried to attempt on your own. 

Starting off the meal was a trio of veggie dishes including Green Bean Tempura with Black Truffle Oil. Happiness. We all loved that and ended up dipping everything we could into the Truffle Oil.

For the main course we had a selection of 5 different meats with a variety of dipping sauces including two types of chimichurri, one red and one green. The red had more of a vinegar flavor to it. Different than traditional but still delicious.

Sides included collard greens and peruvian corn. 

As a last course we were given 3 large cut rolls of sushi including the El Topo. A must if you want to experience salmon and crispy onions together. Very different and quite delicious. 

Obviously we had cocktails as it was my birthday, so my sister and I both ordered the Chu Cumber ""chu-tini"" and it was beyond. Anything with elderflower in it is refreshing and light and makes me want to jump on a plane to the most lazy, tropical destination possible.

They used the same sauce that ruined my potstickers to ruin my chicken. 

Either way it was $100 wasted in a bad meal.",1,0,0

No point in having a reservation as you will have to wait 20-30 min. after your scheduled time.  The front end pretty much sucks. Our server was very good though.

Food was small, nothing special, and ridiculously priced.

-Rock Shrimp was good, but like a glorified calamari dish, nothing spectacular 
-Fusion rolls were a joke, no flavor
-Sea Bass was AWESOME!  2 tiny skewers like $20, um ok, not worth it

The restaurant is pretty popping, and trendy with a DJ its a cool environment
My recommendation is to go sit at the bar have a few drinks, and maybe an appetizer if you are staying at Palazzo, if not skip Sushisamba.",1,0,0

So-so quality sashimi, boring tasteless roll, and a huge bill at the end - I guess paying so much was punishment for being silly enough to think that sushi in the desert could be fresh and amazing.

I am a sushi snob. I expect the best quality fresh fish. Good sushi for me typically is found in a coastal city where the fish is as fresh as it gets. If you are happy with decent fish with a slight odor and don't mind wasting your hard earned money, go to SushiSamba at the Palazzo.",0,1,0

I wanted to reserve a place that wasn't Italian or heavy in the Venetian or Palazzo for my group of 8 girls.  We arrived a little early for our reservation and was seated immediately.  My cousin told the waiter what we liked and didn't like.  He said he would create a meal according to what we wanted.  Everything was fantastic.  Below is what we had and its description:

Pork Gyozo-  Each dumpling was served on a delicious pumpkin puree.  Delicious!

Sushi Platter- We got 5 different types of rolls, 2 of each type.  They were all so good.  

Tiger Rock Shrimp- Yum!  If you like honey walnut shrimp then you will definitely like this.  It was perfectly made.  

Yellowtail Ceviche tacos- These were the best tacos I have ever had.  The sauce it came with was a yummy spicy foam hot sauce.  They were small but definitely satisfying.  They just melt in your mouth.  So good!  Probably my favorite thing there.  

Steak- The Steak was served with collard greens, potatoes, rice, and black beans.  It also came out with 3 different sauces that were all so good.  The green sauce was my favorite.  

Seabass on Skewers- This was served with some Peruvian corn.  The seabass just melts in your mouth.  They were perfectly made.  The corn was also really good and went perfectly with the seabass.     

Shots- Our shots came out beautifully presented on a shot tier.  Two of us didn't drink so our waiter brought out two that were watermelon juice so we could join in on toasting.    

Dessert- Dessert was a mix of the best vanilla ice cream, creme burlee, mixed berries, and banana.  It was nicely made and topped off with some sparklers.  

Everything was so tasty and beautifully presented.  The food wasn't just all Japanese.  It was definitely a fusion but everything went together wonderfully.  I think for us 8 girls it was about $75 each.  It was very worth it and we all left stuffed and happy.      

Our server took care of us really well.  I liked that he noted there were 8 of us and made the portions perfect for 8 girls.  One of our girls couldn't eat raw fish or anything spicy and he made sure she got her own individual thing.  He also made note that two of us couldn't drink and brought out shots for everyone with 2 virgin drinks.  He made great recommendations and was helpful.  He also took time to take a couple photos for us.  As for the the ambiance, it was beautiful.  We had a great time celebrating.",17,11,11

You have to try their extensive list of Saki and their cocktails which are broken up by country: Japan, Brazil, Peru. Samba Juice is my favorite especially on a hot summer day.

This place is a little pricey but is well worth the splurge. I don't know where else you can find this type of fusion!

No business for Sushi Samba ever and in the future, either!!!!

Sushi Samba was a good restaurant. I visited the other location before. But, I will never come back to this location again since the hostess is so RUDE!!!

for our appetizer, we ordered the kobe beef dumplings which were very flavorful. for our main dish we ordered three different rolls: bobo brazil, el topo, and carnaval. the carnval was my favorite, but still average, compared to other sushi i've had. the bobo brazil is topped with thin slices of wagyu beef, which i thought i would enjoy, but it was just mostly fat that you couldn't chew through. the carnaval comes with melted mozzarella cheese at the bottom, which i didn't find adding of any value to the taste. the only thing i did like at the restaurant was the non-alcoholic watermelon drink. it was sweet, sour, and refreshing which i loved. 

i didn't care for the ambiance or customer service either; our waitress barely came to our table and the place was too crowded. i'm glad i tried this place out, but i won't be coming back.",1,0,0

We ordered a small order of oysters (just two $5 each) to me that seems a bit extreme as I have gone places where I can get a half or a dozen for a better price. But they were really good and presented nicely. Food was good, our first order came out pretty fast. Our waitress was working the bar as well, so after out first order finished, we waited about 10-15 minutes for her to come back, she was busy, I was trying to be patient. Only thing that saved it is she was very very sweet and remembered our large orders with no second guessing it. Food was good, just seemed pricy for such a small quantity.

We order a bottle of decent saki, and our waiter had to be reminding twice to refill our drinks.  And he got two of orders wrong.  He made some excuse about the system, but one order was wrong after I reminded him of my hamachi order after getting the yamato roll.  We told this to the manager, not sure if he will do anything.  I think we was just going to calm the customer, I told him it was one of the worst services in Vegas, and we have been to many places (including cafes and Joel Robuchon's place) of wide range.

The ambience was great and service was decent (though our waiter forgot to bring us bowls for one of our bigger plates, not a big deal). The food was just simply mediocre. I don't know if it was because we didn't order the right things but we left bloated yet unfulfilled. 

Between the two of us, we had Hokkaido Scallops, Wagyu Taquitos, Seaweed Salad, Moqueca Mista, Neo Tokyo Roll, Salmon Handrolls, and several different nigiri (including their Alaskan Salmon nigiri, which they claimed to be equivalent to the salmon version of fatty tuna). The scallops and taquitos were pretty good, but all of the sushi was just... meh. We have been to many sushi restaurants, both high-end and low-end ones, and for the price we were paying here, we expected good quality sushi. Instead we got something similar to what we can get at a $25 sushi buffet, just served in a better environment.

I guess in conclusion, if you came here only for traditional sushi, you might very well be disappointed just like us. After all, this is a Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian mixed restaurant.

The Skinny: spent $50+ on sub par Peruvian influenced Japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).

We were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the Venetian properties. We thought great! If the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. 

So we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. Of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. The rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.

We should have known. I mean when the first dish - Yellowtail tiradito - came out, I knew it wasn't going to be good. The thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. I really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. Definitely not well balanced. 

Wagyu gyoza (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. Although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. The kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.

Chicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. The meat, slightly grilled\/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.

Eggplant anticuchos with a side of Peruvian corn was okay. I dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. However the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  The Peruvian corn is definitely not one of my favorite foods. Potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. It was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing I needed to try again.

The sushi (Veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, Ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon\/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and spicy tuna - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. Considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. It kind of ruined it for me. Factor in the high rice to filling ratio, I cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. This is rather unfortunate because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.

The only highlight of the meal was the salt and pepper squid. Melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and I truly enjoyed.

Food service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. There was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. It was unfortunate that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. After our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. However, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-MILFs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. The two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. So the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. He was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.

In reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however I rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. However, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.",1,0,0

She ordered 4 orders of Unagi (Eel), $4 ea. I ordered some Edamame, $6 and the Seared Wagyu Beef, $18.

The Beef was awesome and while it's a small plate, it's very rich and fulfilling.  TBH enjoyed her Unagi....it's her fav.

We ate lunch at around 3 pm, which is a great time to do that because it's between the busy lunch and dinner hours, so there's not too many people around.  When it gets busy, it can get crowded.

A buddy and I sat at the sushi bar, the lady brought us over the menu, we browse it, deciding what to get and really couldn't decide.  The server stops by and explains some items and then also mentions we have the chef's choice (omakase) and we hesitate for a minute and sure, we'll take two.

The first course was string beans tempura, boring right?  No, the truffle aioli sauce that came with this was amazing.  I can't even explain the taste, it was really good.  You can drink it with a straw.  

The second course pork gyoza, sitting on a squash puree of some sort, I want to say butternut squash or something similar.  These were OK, nothing special.  The rock shrimp tempura was delicious, nice spicy mayo sauce on top.  And the last component was a yellowtail taquito.  I liked these and it was served with a spicy sriracha sauce of some sort.

Third course was meat heaven.  Grilled pork tenderloin, hanger steak, and ribeye.  Woo-wee!  I have to say though, some of the ribeye was a little charred, particularly the end pieces, but the middle was done right, medium-rare.  The hanger steak was good, tender and chunks of fat, good stuff.  The pork loin was awesome.  This dish is served with three sauces, two types of chimichurri and some peruvian pepper puree sauce that was unreal!  The pork fit so perfectly with this sauce, so recommended for anyone.  The chimichurri was so-so, not so great, but still good.

The last course consisted of rolls.  They have a special spicy yellowtail tuna roll with tempura flakes, but I thought this was OK, I've had better.  Then a simple salmon and avocado and eel and avocado.  I've had the eel\/avocado mixture many times, but I must say this is the best I've had.  The typical black sauce that's topped on was really good.  It had a sweet taste to it and all the flavors meshed oh so well.  Good stuff.

My companion was done as we had so much food.  I decided to take a dive and get some dessert.  It was a chocolate, white chocolate pudding\/custard type consistency and some crushed chocolate granola on the bottom.  It was OK, not that good.

Overall, great spot and recommended.  The chef's choice isn't as steep as all vs Nobu and Morimoto's (where I've had both).  You get the ""fusion-ness"" from the Peruvian and Brazilian influence.  Luckily there's a few on the east coast in NYC, so I don't have to travel as far.",0,0,0

Eating these tiny crabs was like eating a few crunchy crackers with some lemon base coating.  I then had some yellowtail crispy taquitos which were very unusual with some very spicy, lemony sauce.  I would definitely recommend these.  I had the Samba sushi & sashimi assortment, which was very good.  In summary, the sushi and sashimi are very good here.

Pork belly Ramon soup - Oh my so tasty, large portion of pork belly, multiple mushroom varieties, bok choy, noodles and a spicy cilantro broth.  Yummy

Tuna Roll - with foie gras and caviar, small portion but so worth it, the fresh tuna mixed perfect with the warm foie and salty caviar.

Sea bass Kabobs - Just get them!!!  So buttery and fresh, they had a perfect taste and texture.

Sushisamba just so happened to have ample availability on a Saturday night, so I was a bit hesitant, but since it was in the Palazzo where we were staying we decided to give it a try. 

There were a few highs and lows regarding some of the menu items:

Rock tempura shrimp was not that great. It was too salty and saucy and I couldn't taste any of black truffle dressing. Just lots of ginger and soy sauce. I would probably skip out on the yellow tail crispy taquitos as well...something just tasted off with this. Didn't particularly enjoy the sauce it came with.

The Uni was bomb. Didn't have any type of fishy aftertaste. It was smooth and buttery, so definitely recommend getting the Uni if you come here.

The Sao Paulo roll was probably my favorite, the truffle on top elevated this dish and paired perfectly with the sashimi and other toppings.

However, after 15-20 minutes, no waiter came by to introduce themselves or get our drink order. Long story short, several managers came over to apologize, brought over a round of drinks and dessert, and made sure our every need was looked after. Our waiter, Mike D, was extremely friendly and helpful too. Some of the girls in the group had special dietary needs. He made this a priority and ensured all the food came out properly. Also, some of the girls in the group did the tasting menu and Mike D picked out some amazing dishes! I would definitely recommend doing the tasting menu since you get a sampling of so many different items.

We were seated promptly at our reserved time.

The service was immediately kind of odd. Our waiter did not give us menus (other than for drinks), but instead started talking about how if we had a particular budget in mind, they could send us enough food to fill that budget. Butbutbut...I saw the menu online! I knew there was a menu. I wanted to be in CONTROL! Would the waiter let us be in control?

After awhile yes, yes he did. We were able to secure some menus, and he then proceeded to go through the different sections of the menu with us as if we were eight years old and\/or eating dinner by ourselves at a restaurant for the first time. Is fusion really that scary for people?

So we ordered a couple of rounds, tapas style, like we do. There were hits and misses along the way. The best stuff was in the robata area of the menu. The pork belly with the butterscotch miso about slayed me with its awesomeness. The duck breast dish we got was also killer, with a fantastic sauce and lots of meaty, meaty mushrooms. The Shishito peppers were solid, as was the sea eel we got nigiri style. It's hard to mess those two up. The yamato rolls, in all their decadence, were worth every penny.

The seared wagyu beef was probably the biggest miss of the evening. The menu does not list truffle oil in the dish's ingredients, but that's about all I could taste. And for me, truffle oil makes everything taste and smell rancid. Not appealing. The El Topo, while quite good, was also a bit of a disappointment. I love fried onions, but they seemed to overpower here. The yellowtail sashimi also seemed a bit off, as the lemongrass sauce wasn't particularly complimentary. 

The service was alright but stayed a little odd during our visit. Sometimes our waiter would be absent for long periods of time, and then suddenly would be around almost too often. The place was loud, almost too loud. Prices are about what you'd expect for a sushi spot on the Strip. Overall, I enjoyed this place, but it is easily overshadowed by the plethora of better options nearby.",1,0,0

The food presentation is all about variety - small portions chased with some sake, beer or other beverage of choice.

The seating is interesting as nothing is square and the colors are warm Peruvian and the food is pretty Japanese with a dose of flavors atypical of traditional Japanese foods - like limes and jalapenos.  But my wife and I loved it.  Cerviche with yellow tail was the opener along with roasted duck over a bed a mushrooms (a combo of two menu items recommended by our server), then salt and pepper squid (calamari- esq) and a tuna skewer served with huge corn - unique combo, rice would have been fine with me.

Definitely recommend doing it that way with large groups.

For our second time, we were a slightly smaller group, walk-in, of 11, who managed to get a table right away (another large group had just left, coincidentally, were friends of ours). Again, they offered the same setup, and we took it, but this time we had a few with dietary restrictions. They took those requests, and brought out all plates for family style.

So this location is a mix of Chilean, Brazilian, and Japanese tastes. It certainly was unique. The environment is vibrant and alive. I felt that it really complimented their fusion style really well. They had flat screen TVs and projectors everywhere, showing pleasant scenery or traditional acts. I was just amazed by their design and color throughout the restaurant. Their decor was also very compatible with their theme. The look was sharp and inviting at the same time.

The food was great. I tried the BoBo Brazil Roll. I tried this because I wanted to experience their unique tastes, and it certainly brought the restaurant's fusion tastes together. It had seared kobe beef and red onions on top of what I think was an avocado roll with kaiware, and some other ingredients. It cost $17; the taste was awesome, but we could not decide whether or not it was worth the full $17. Other items we ordered included a pork belly ramen, a ribeye bento box, and a terriyaki chicken bento box. These were generic dishes, but they turned out great.  
The restaurant serves dishes in appetizer or small portions. Do not expect a large portion when ordering an entree. This restaurant is more for people who want to shell out a little bit of cash to enjoy something unique. Four of us ordered a total of 6 items and then mochi ice cream for desert. 

The service was really on top of everything. Our waiter knew the menu and was able to tell us what was in every item we asked, and told us what to expect from the restaurant's style of cooking. He came around periodically to make sure everything was okay, and just did a perfect job.

- $6 Edamame. Were they able to pontificate about the glories of Socrates vs. Plato? No? Well for that price they should have been.

I want to give this 5 *'s but last time it just didn't live up to the hype. I brought my girl and she was like this is the place you keep raving about?! Boy did I feel dumb.

On my first visit I had the Chef Omakase. I was the only one at the bar because I was gambling for so long. I made a killing at the tables and was feeling rather giddy - so I went all out. The sushi chef asked me if I had any allergies\/no likes... which is easy for me - no octopus and no squid. 

Wow did he come out guns blazing - A toro over warm rice with some special sauce. It nearly blew off my mouth. Then he went with a three lineup selection - Hamachi, Red Snapper and More Maguro.. but these had some sauces and jalapenos and ginger. Nice follow up. I said. How are you going to beat that....

He surprised me with a Peruvian slice of Filet mignon covered with Foie Gras. WOW dang that I guess I will stop doubting this chef. He lined up a couple more slices of sushi and I thought it was over. Pretty good, but I am thinking he is ending on the wrong note when he busts out a fried rice cake with Foie Gras and yellowtail Belly.... I nearly jumped out of my seat of how good that was. After that experience I adamantly recommended this to friends who wanted to try something different.

On subsequent visits with a couple friends we did Omakase again, but this time it was mostly rolls. I mean the sushi was great but the rolls left me wanting. Gone was the foie gras...and with that my 5th star.

On my last visit my girlfriend ate pretty standard stuff nothing spectacular and since we didnt do Omakase I was left on my own to decide which usually means pretty boring. I love the surprises chefs give me  when I order Omakase. Hopefully I will be back and the chef can surprise me and make me change my rating...until that my 4 *'s will stand.

So their ""concept"" for a group of 8 guests....a waitress brings ONE menu for EVERYONE at the table. (Apparently there is a ration on menus at this restaurant). She happily tells you that you give her an ""idea"" of what you like and then SHE will decide what to bring to your table based off of what you tell her - the prices for this ""family"" style of ordering started at $50 per person and went up from there - NOT INCLUDING ALCOHOL OR DESSERT. WTH??? Oh, but you don't have to pay for something if you don't like it......supposably. 

As she brings these TINY portions out to our table for us to fight over, we soon realize that no one is really getting what they wanted and no one is satisfied with what she is serving us. Some liked certain items, but honestly, the bowls of white rice was the most filling thing we ate. Even the black beans were terribly under seasoned - how can anyone screw up black beans?? 

Remember the ""if you don't like what she brings out, you don't need to pay for it"" rule? Well, the minute you complain about not liking something, the waitress gives attitude and acts frustrated at your lack of ability to communicate what you want her to bring you.... when most of the table did not get a chance to even see the menu in the first place. 

After a meal that felt like we just ate at an Ethiopian Restaurant and still hungry, we chanced ordering a ""large plate"" dessert and some other people at our table ordered a ""small plate"" dessert. When the desserts come, our dessert was a VERY SMALL piece of cake on a VERY LARGE SAUCER PLATE.....and the our friends who ordered the small dessert was larger than our dessert, but on a SMALL PLATE....SO they didn't technically lie about the size of the plates, but lets just say they really need to rethink their menu and overall concept. 

Ultimately, we left the restaurant $75 each lighter in our wallets -( as the tip was already added for the crappy service we did get.)  and feeling like we should have all gotten a jar or lube on our way in as we all felt assaulted at the end of our meal.

If I could have given a lower score, I would have! SUSHI SAMBA is a huge ripoff with crappy service and an even crappier concept. The one positive is the interior design of the restaurant was creative, which is the only thing positive I can say about ti, sadly.",3,2,0

On both occasions the food was out of this world and we were able to experience a table meal and also a bar- happy hour meal. Both were unbelievable and special in their own way.
On our first trip, we had Alice as our server and we were blown away. She knew the menu like it was her own and made recommendations for us that we really enjoyed. She came just often enough to check on us and explained each dish as it came out. She spaced all the plates to come a few minutes apart so we could have our hot food hot.
We had been here before and this trip only confirmed our opinion that this is one of the premium restaurants in the city. The chef sent out some special dishes for us to try because we were loyal returnees. Yellow tail taquitos were amazing as was the São Paulo roll. The seaweed salad was an excellent way to cleanse the palet and to sop up all the leftover sauces that were so delicious and you didn't want to give up.
Drinks were delicious as well and since I didn't think I remembered either one, I'm guessing that the drink menu changes often. The mad Russian had a chu-cumber and I had a lemon samurai if you read this within a reasonable amount of time as its written. Both were awesome- but I'm sure that whatever you try, you'll be delighted, as were we.
On our other visit, we brought my sister and chose to eat at the bar. Wow! What an awesome happy hour. We ate just about everything available and went back for seconds on some. Standouts were sea bass skewers and the lamb lollipops. Wagyu sliders we a hit and the rock shrimp left my mouth watering. The Calamari was cut into strips rather than rings and was out of this world. You'll be like us if you're lucky, and try everything. You won't be disappointed. I'm reasonably sure- but don't hold my feet to the fire- that this location is as good at gets- rivaling the location in NYC which we love as well!

First of all, thanks to my procrastination, I've forgotten the incredibly friendly manager's name who treated us newly legals to 3 Chu-cumber shots, which, btw, go down ridiculously well. (Maybe his name was Anthony...?) Anyway, he also hooked us up with a bouncer at Tryst and we got in without having to wait! So the staff and their service is really really amazing. I'm pretty positive if you go there (soon), there will still be this omg-drool-with-my-eyes-like-it's-possible waiter there ready and waiting to fill up your glass of water... or take your order... or ravage - no, that's it. 

Enough about the awesome service, the food was also REALLY REALLY amazing. It's a Brazilian\/Japanese fusion type restaurant, but I'm not really big on Brazilian unless it's like a churascaria, so we went with mainly Japanese type dishes. (I mean ""Japanese"" in the most non-traditional way though) 

The condensed version looks like this and in this order (But ALL should be had at least once - write it down guys, seriously. Prepare yourselves):
BoBo Brazil Roll
Green Envy Roll
El Topo Roll
Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass (way too small for it's own good.) 
Neo Tokyo Roll

This place is pretty pricey, but I've been here 3 times already and I don't intend to stop. I've pretty much made an agreement with myself that I will eat here at least once any time I'm in Vegas. 

5 Stars!! 

Okay, and I know I mentioned ""condensed version"" earlier which implies a more in-depth explanation to those, but too bad? You're just going to have to trust me.

My wife and I dined at Sushisamba before catching Rock of Ages.  The ambiance is fun but a little busy.  It can be difficult to hold a conversation.

I started out with the red miso soup with mushrooms.  It was way to salty even for miso.  I ordered some sashimi and a sushi roll with foie gras.  It was good but not great.  My wife ordered a bunch of sides (she's pregnant and was craving rice, beans, and plantains all at the same time!).  She complained that the food was a bit too spicy.

We ordered mochi for dessert.  They were pretty good but standard without anything standing out.

Some colleagues and myself decided to meet here for a dinner meeting and overall, atmosphere, waiting service, selection of food, and cleanliness all surpassed expectations.  I do admit though, that a) I was not ready for the bill, and b) ultimately, there's better value elsewhere.  

I'll explain: 

The location is extremely convenient being in the middle of the Venetian Palazzo so it literally was down the elevator and to the left from my room.  The setting was a hip new age laced with asian motif. However, I felt rushed to a certain degree due to the cramptness (3 of us were 6' or taller and over 200lbs) and also the extreme business of waiter + customers + waiting line out the front.  We decided to ask the waitress to order for us as we were more interested in business discussion than the food itself, and felt that we passed on the message that we were looking for 3-4 appetizers or so to whet our palette and no more.  Yes, out came 4 dishes (to this day I'm not sure if it was the main or appy), and absolutely, each dish was delicious.  The braised pork was perfectly cooked with some searing on the edges to caramalize the sugars.  The fried shrimp was well done without any 'oily' taste or textures.  Skewered fish was the highlight of the affair in my opinion as the fish was neither too well done making it tough, or raw on the inside.  And finally, the sushi (hamachi, sake, tamago, and toro) was put together fairly well although I thought the cuts were a little thin for my taste.  

The bill ended up to be just over $300 for three people without any alcohol.  It's not cheap folks.  It's definitely a personal feeling thing but at $300 I'm expecting more... I was feeling the dinner's value was no more than $60 per person and not $100+ per person.  I'd take the extra $40 per person and put it into a taxi cab fare to go to different place but then again, that's only because my value of convenience is probably lower than most.

Well visiting Las Vegas 3 weeks later I decided to look for a local SushiSamba. Using yelp I found there to be a SushiSamba in Venetian on the strip. I checked their website to verify they were open and found out they had a reverse (late) happy hour starting at 11pm till close.
So my friend and I took a cab from Hardrock hotel (probably last time there, thats a whole different story) to Venetian hotel. On arrival I saw the bar was placed in front where there were a few seats available. So we sat down towards the end of the bar and asked if we could eat dinner at the bar. The bartender Mari (Maria)  gave us some menus and we asked for the happyhour menu which had just started. I asked about some of the items on the menu and she was very friendly and informational. My friend was actually not feeling good and she gave him some tonic water and small amount of bitters to help ease his stomach. (which actually helped later on)
She ended up getting real busy at the bar but no matter how busy she got she always made sure we got what we needed in a timely manner. She balanced about 10-15 bar patrons orders drink and food wise along with still making drinking for all the waiters ordering drinks for their patrons. I felt she was really efficient and still friendly in demeanor always smiling! I find good freindly custommer service is hard to come by now a days. Kristina the floor manager checked in with us and made sure we were doing ok and that all our needs were meet. Another great show of good customer service. When the managers come up and check in with their patrons I feel they are actually taking interest and want to make sure all your needs are being meet!
We had a really good night there so much we decided to go back the following night to see if we could have another good successful night again. Well our expectations were exceeded again. Mari was working again and thanked us for returning and even went out her way to have us try a few things on the menu we didn't even order to ask our opinion. She even made drinks to our specific needs (my friend didn't want that much sugar in his drink) She made it to meet his needs and turned out to still be a decent drink. Mari's good customer service was the best during my stay in Vegas and I was there july 4-9. She far exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond! The floor manager Kristina also sat down with us to talk about customer service and again making sure everything meet our expectations.

Started off with a yellow tail taco that was the perfect mix of savory, spicy, and scrumptious. Next was a wagyu beef gyoza that was super juicy on a bed of pumpkin puree that offset the fatty gyoza incredibly well. 

For the rolls we got the neo tokyo which had a decent amount of fish and was quite tasty. The el topo (or something like that) had an interesting concept with fried onions, melted mozzarella, and salmon, but was probably the most ""meh"" dish of the night since the fried onion took over the taste of the roll and the salmon was cooked--it was more like a baked salmon dish with lotsa cheese than a fresh sushi roll. 

The winner of the night, however, was certainly the yamato. Decadent in its description and decadent in execution the buttery beef created a wonderful texture as the foie gras melted on the tongue.

It had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  Unfortunately my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.

Our reservation was for 9:15 PM Sunday night.  We didn't get seated until 9:45 PM despite having our whole party there by 9:00 PM.  I didn't care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren't on a strict schedule.  So I let this roll easily off my back.

As we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  He was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  Beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  Granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  A little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  It took forever for most of our food to come out.  We didn't have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  My friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  The manager's response was something like: ""Things are are a bit backed-up, we'll give you free dessert.""  Now, I don't care how backed-up your kitchen is... that's still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  Dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  We are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!

Our original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  Another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  She was very friendly and courteous, it's unfortunate she wasn't our original waiter because this review would've been completely different.

Our unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  As my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  Yes, our used clothe napkins.  Who does that?  In front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  It seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn't give a rats-ass about making up for it.  In addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  In hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  Of course, we're better than that.

The food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. The food was actually quite good with a variety of unique asian-fusion plates.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than I bargained for.  For such a simple dish, it had a variety of unique flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  My friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.

For me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  In this case, their service failed horribly.  Our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a Chippendale's greeter than a restaurant waiter.  I hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings.",1,1,0

I wanted to take a moment to clarify my review lest the masses get the wrong impression given the critical aspects of my opinions.

First and foremost, the quality of ingredients, the preparation and the service of the staff was impeccable. I'd like to repeat once more that the staff was excellent -- quick, anticipatory, professional and went out of their way to make our experience welcome and enjoyable.

They have an amazing list of sake and wine; one I'd like to investigate and sample from more deeply. And the bartender(s) know how to mix drinks -- great tasting, proper ratios and not too strong or weak, just great flavor.

That the sushi\/sashimi was not to my preference should not be misunderstood as not enjoyable to others. The restaurant was still trying to seat a long waiting list well beyond generally accepted dinner hours (perhaps the late night supper club after seeing one of the many shows in Vegas?). The success of SushiSamba is obvious given the strong following and customer base. And I'd like to try their Brazilian offerings. But my preferences for sushi\/sashimi, no matter the quality of ingredients, lie with a different style of preparation.",2,0,1

We were having a late night second dinner craving so we decided to hit up Sushi Samba that was conveniently at our hotel in the Palazzo.

Enjoyed the dumplings, chicken teriyaki, and we tried almost every roll here. Each one was excellent.

I don't eat pork, so the chef actually created a chicken based Ramen for our group which we all LOVED. It was so flavorful and comforting and really hit the spot. This was my favorite dish here. I'd come back for this!",0,0,0

If being surrounded by a room full of beautiful women is not appealing to you, then by all means you should bypass Sushi Samba.  I think I had flashes of falling in love a half dozen times.  

On to the food... I started out with the robata grill yellowtail.  It was not what I had expected.  Basically I got a charred piece of fish that I had to pick through the bones of, which isn't easy to do with chopsticks.  I wouldn't say the robata grill was a disaster, but I wouldn't order it again.  To the rescue came a plate of the tuna takati.  This was an exceptionally flavorful small plate, and I do mean small.  I think it was 5 small slices of tuna.  A couple of more slices of tuna would have been nice, but the flavor was exceptional.  The topper to the meal was the BoBo Brazil roll.  This roll is something you'd want to photograph before you eat.  The flavor was very good.  I liked the kobe beef on the outside of the roll both for the flavor and the appearance.

Awesomeness = SUSHISAMBA = Japanese\/Brazilian\/Peruvian Fusion.

Yup.

I recently traveled to the Sin City for work and of course, had to try as many good restaurants as I could. While most offered decent food, they were definitely overpriced.

But SUSHISAMBA was simply awesome. My friend and I ordered four plates and they were the perfect amount of food for two ladies to share. More importantly, everything was fresh and delicious.

Here is what we gobbled down.

Sea bass and miso:
OMG. The fish blew me away with its tenderness and deep flavor. The decorative Peruvian corn also added a nice touch to the dish. A must try.

Yellow tail jalapeno and lemongrass:
Includes 4 pieces of sashimi. Pleasantly spicy with jalapeno, the fish was nicely chilled and tasted very refreshing.

Samba sushi assortment:
Has 12 pieces, including 8 kinds of sashimi and one type of roll. Everything was very, again, FRESH. I loved how the rice, fish and all the ingredients melted in my mouth.

Yellowtail seviche:
Wrapped in crispy tortillas and sprinkled with lime juice, the seviche tacos were a nice little summery treat in this boiling city.

What's better is that good food is not the only reason that I like this fusion restaurant.

Our waitress was nice and gave us good suggestions on what to order. My other colleague who came here with a big group also raved about the great service they received.

The ambiance was modern and romantic. I felt like I walked into a trendy, reddish dome, with interesting circular decor.

The bill? Certainly a splurge. But for the experience I had, it was well worth it.

My review is probably (ok definitely) biased because I was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. However, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in Vegas is a production equal to Cirque de Solei that takes upward of 3 hours. But whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the Cosmo to the Palazzo hotel.  The restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge TVs which were super loud. Per the usual at many ""sceney"" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. 

We got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. Our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where I do not know. There seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. He could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. Whether or not they had liquor was the only question (Answer: not enough.) So we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. After the night's beginning, I opted with straight vodka and diet coke.

For food we got a lot. Some  memorable dishes were the Neo Tokyo roll with tuna which was solid, heirloom tomato salad with sweet cilantro dressing, rock shrimp tempura, mushroom tobanyaki, and sweet coconut rice side. My fave dish of all was the heirloom tomato salad which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. The rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. The mushroom tobanyaki was interesting but not to my taste.  Sadly we did not get dessert. 
In conclusion, I can definitely say i hope I will never be back with another bachelorette party, although I would not mind returning otherwise.",1,1,0

Save room for desert... I had the chocolate sata andagi.... chocolate filled with vanilla ice cream.

The ramen was well flavored with the spices. The noodle itself were ok, but all of the veggies and porkbelly were soaked in the broth, which made them all taste delicious.

I don't have much complaint, maybe I can go without the tacos and chicken robata. You have to try the lamb because it's super tender and well flavored. The portion is slightly bigger, but order more if needed.

The food was pretty darn good and the drinks were well prepared. The decor inside the restaurant is distinctive and a real pleasure to enjoy. The only drawback is that it was really dark, so it was more difficult to really take it all in. They also have a video playing on a projector that is good at setting the mood for the cuisine - Brazilian steakhouse meets Japanese sushi meets other stuff - but is sort of odd without sound and just like 1-2 second flashes of stuff. It reminded me too much of Clockwork Orange only without the taped open eyes.

The service is excellent at Sushi Samba as they go out of their way to make sure that you have everything and that all messes, etc. are cleaned up. I'd say that they had about 7 staff members doting on our table and it was a nearly full house.

For sushi I had the sashimi with the usuals.. Was great quality of fish- did not have rolls since they had tacos, I did the lobster and hamachi.. Wouldn't suggest the lobster again but the hamachi was SOOOO yummy!
For dinner we did the Kobe on hot stone experience- while the meat lacked flavor it made up for it in texture- OMG.. 
Hamachi Kama was Huge! And Sake was so Super Smooth.. Love me some Daiginjo! 
I'm a fan of the food.. Pricing well... It's Vegas- that's all there is to say about that' ..",1,1,1

This is a miracle and a true relief and pleasure to anyone who has special dietary needs.  Not only was the service caring and impeccable-the food was fantastic and delicious for everyone in our party - those with special diets and those free of restrictions. 
The ingredients are super-fresh and the menu is bold with tons of variety.

Service was slow, not attentive. They did not seem very busy at the moment either. 

We wanted only a quick bite, so we got an appetizer and an entree to share. Food is super pricey, quality of the food was alright, but at least it came out quick. Sashimi was fresh, the gyoza's the server recommended was good. We also got the Moqueca which comes with mussels, clams, squid, and shrimp and rice. It was like a soup based dish, and it was pretty good. Somewhat filling, but the green soy rice is too much.. My boyfriend didn't even like the rice at all.

I've been to several Sushi Sambas however this one is special as it was my first. It's located in the Pallazo connected to the Venetian which could be a bit tricky to locate. I brought my date here for the first time today, hoping that she too would have the same experience. Unfortunately not, we got there about 2:00pm and was seated quickly as it wasn't very busy. Our waiter seemed a bit nonchalant when it came to the menu itself. I explained to him that I had dined many times at other locations and that this was her first time. He replied ""well they're just like all the others"". First I know that not to be true as they tend have a few items that are unique to the location, perhaps he wasn't aware. Apparently he warmed up to the other guests after us as I heard him say ""hey is this your first time here"".  Anyway we ordered a few cocktails which were ok. My date had the Sambatini which is supposed to be a monthly specialty drink concocted by the bar team. It was a little sweet but good. I had gotten the Samba Juice which was ok. 
For an appetizer we got the Tuna Tataki. It was delicious, however true to Sushi Samba style they give you just enough to have you wanting for more! We resisted :) Next up we had gotten the Lima roll. Very good, it's your basic shrimp tempura roll with avocado but they kick it up a notch with spicy king crab on top. Not over spiced and very delicious! We then ordered our entree which was the Churrasco Rio Grande. It comes with Wagyu picanha, ribeye and chorizo-prepared to your liking and sliced for you. It is served with a small portion of black beans and rice, a little too small amount of beans for the amount of rice. It also comes with collards and dipping sauces for the meat. The meat was very delicious although our ribeye was cooked more like medium well instead of medium.  They wagyu however was perfect. 
Of course we can't just stop there, no no no. Overall I can't give this experience a 5 based on my waiter and aspects of my meal. But believe you me if you have an opportunity to eat here and MONEY to spend-no it's not cheap, then do it! The food is amazing!",3,0,1

We had reservations for 9:00PM after the Las Vegas Marathon so my runner friends could get a nice recovery meal that wasn't too heavy.  And that wasn't too far away from their hotel!

We were seated right away, and the vibe of this restaurant was really fun and funky- dark and romantic but with lots of good music.  We decided to split a bunch of small plates which ended up being perfect.  We started with the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos which were so delicious, but small enough that they left me wanting more!  The tempura mushrooms were light and flavorful with just the right amount of crispiness.  The chicken skewers were YUM but the highlight of the meal was the seabass skewers.  I had these in Dallas and they were every bit as delicious as I remembered.  Love the peruvian corn too.  Normally each order of skewers comes with 2, which would have led to a caveman-style meat fight between the 3 of us, but our server was kind enough to suggest we add a third skewer to the order so we all got to try.  Great service on her part.

We also had 2 of their special sushi rolls- The Pacific Roll and the Green Envy.  Both were very good and tasted very unique, as opposed to a lot of ""special rolls"" you find out there that are just bigger and they charge more for.

We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. 

The three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.

I went here with my husband. We LOVE sushi. We overdo it sometimes. We are the type of people who will have sushi 1-2 times a week so we know what's good or bad and when it is fresh etc. 
The fish was fresh no doubt.  The prices were okay considering the quality of the fish. That being said the rolls were not special.  The flavors did not compliment each other or the fish.  We had three cut rolls and one hand roll and didn't even finish them. The hand roll was great but the cut rolls (sorry don't remember the names) were very boring.

It is definitely one of the more trendy sushi restaurants that I have been to.  In no way am I putting Sushisamba up there with my favorite Japanese restaurant, Sushi Ran in San Francisco.  But it was definitely worth trying out.

I didn't try the omakase, but I wanted to.  I was with my wife, who doesn't like anything but meat and vegetable tempura, so I didn't want to be limited.  So we just ordered off the menu, which was fine.  The rolls here are definitely different then I'm used to.  What with all of the foie gras and wagyu beef.  The Neo Tokyo Roll was tasty.  I liked the tuna and tempura flakes together.  I also had the hamachi nigiri and the uni nigiri, both of which were very good.  I love uni, and this was good.

We had the seasonal vegetable tempura, which was good.  To be honest, I've had better tempura but by no means am I saying that this wasn't a good dish.  I like vegetable tempura, so I would order this again.  We also had the the three meat Rio Grande Churrasco.  We chose the pork tenderloin, the hanger steak and the ribeye.  The hanger steak was by far the best of the three, with the ribeye coming in second.  It was so tasty.  The pork tenderloin was a bit disappointing.  It was dry and uneventful.  Next time, I'm getting three orders of the hanger steak.  And the sauces were a nice complement to the dish.

Everything we ordered was superb and bursting with flavor.  The only warning I would give is that the flavors are quite intense and they stayed with me most of the night.  I'm sure the people next to me at the blackjack table were none too pleased.

So even though I knew it was expensive, if she said it was worth it I was believing her. 

First off, it was crazy loud in the place, and it was very hard for us (especially my grandfather) to hear anything that was going on. But it's a strip restaurant I get it. We ordered drinks, oysters, and the heirloom tomato salad. I didn't eat much of any of those dishes, but for dinner we each ordered a roll: the neo Tokyo, sasa hand roll, and I had the chef special which was tempura shrimp, tuna, and cheese on top. All of the rolls were pretty bland and my roll was especially chewy with the cheese on top. (I knew sushi wasn't supposed to have cheese yet it sounded intriguing.) 

For other small plates we ordered the hamachi Kama, tempura green beans, and scallops with Peruvian corn which everyone raves about. The best by far was the tempura. I have never had Peruvian corn but it was very big and sort of hard. The scallops didn't have any taste. 

My biggest complaint about the restaurant is that we felt that they were constantly trying to take our plates away and clear the table. I understand it's a tapas restaurant so food comes quickly but once all our dishes were there they kept asking to clear plates that still had food on them.

So I had no idea this restaurant had so many locations before coming to Vegas. Anyways, last month, walking around the palazzo, I checked the menu out as I had seen every single cab here with a Sushisamba ad on top. I was very surprised to see that they had many Peruvian dishes. I guess I just imagined it was brazilian with japanese because of the name. I did not expect to see peruvian corn (i miss you so much).

After much convincing, my bf and I decided to come check it out. We ordered a whole bunch of things. We did not make a reservation but they had enough space to accommodate us. I ordered a plum wine cup which was better than Nobu's. I was very interested in the peruvian part of the menu so bear with me with my choices.

BROILED PERUVIAN BAY SCALLOP shiso lime butter crust 15.00

This was really good. The scallops basically melted in your mouth and it kind of reminded me of the scargots at Bouchon. Very buttery.

HUANCAINA FRIES 7.00

I loved them. My boyfriend felt they did not have much flavor but he is not a big potato eater except when it comes to real french fries. Now, these are not really fries, they are boiled tiny potatoes with huancaina sauce and cheese.

ANTICUCHO
RIBEYE aji panca and peruvian corn 13.00

Delicious. I don't know why they don't offer the heart option but I guess people here in the US are not big on trying beef heart anyways.


WILD MUSHROOM RED MISO hand picked organic mushrooms, wakame, white truffle oil 9.00

I didn't like it. My bf liked it a lot he said it tasted ""fresh""

MOQUECA MISTA shrimp, squid, sea bass, mussels, clams with coconut milk, dendê oil and chimichurri rice 33.00

This was the first brazilian dish I've ever eaten and it was just ok. I didn't feel it was great. I think it was undersalted because it was very flavorless.",2,0,2

How do you run out of something that makes up the base for many different items\/rolls u serve.  We ordered something called the Yamato roll which was pretty good except for the fact that it was $19 for 3 pieces.  It was the only roll that didn't have the standard 5-6 pieces.  For that much money I was expecting much more pop.  I love anything with Foie Gras so I may have liked the Yamato roll more than I should've.  However, if you don't like Foie Gras skip it and get something else.  The Miso Seabass was fantastic just like the waiter described.  What bothers me is that they keep telling you how little the portions are AFTER u order the dish which makes u order it twice or more  if you're with two plus people.  The Miso Seabass was like $16 for ONE skewer.  The food is good but be warned if you want to leave full you will spend a lot of money.  Good thing it was comped thanks to my buddy.

""Our food took a very long time to arrive, one by one. Eventually it did and we finished everything, except the fourth entree which failed to appear. We asked our waitress about this who said she'd check for us but she never came back. We then asked another waiter who said he'd check for us and he never came back. Some time later, our waitress finally returns and says they'd forgotten our entry, but that it would be out right away and taken off the bill. I then asked for a dessert menu.

Much later, our food and dessert menu both failed to arrive. Eventually, our waitress returns with the bill, apologizes and says the food (and the dessert menu, apparently) won't be coming, and presents us with complimentary miniature cocktails. My dining companion and I were both underage. Another while later, our waitress returns smiling with our change and asked if we enjoyed the shots, which were clearly untouched.""

Returned a month or so later, eager to try it out again next time I came back to Vegas.

I think this round somehow exceeding my experience last time. I got a lot of the same dishes, as well as tried out a few new ones and I was not dissapointed.

Our waitress was incredible and service was quick and enjoyable...even the parties next to us had a great time and sparked great conversation. The ambiance is hip and sexy while still being inviting and enjoyable.

In addition to last time, we got the Chuchumber cocktail which wasn't too sweet but amazingly refreshing. We also got the phyllo-wrapped scallop which at first I assumed would take away from the taste of the scallop but instead the combination of textures was just awesome. 

We wanted to try one of the Peruvian ceviches, so we went with the ginger\/soy yellowfin one, which was pretty tasty but not quite up on the same level when it comes to crazy flavor profiles. 

The other new dish we got was the Samba Strip roll. As somewhat of a sushi afficianado, I was excited to try it but not expecting a whole lot. Crazy enough the lobster and mango combination with the peanut curry sauce was really crazy good. The roll also was made with some crispy rice and served with a meaty lobster claw so it was a solid choice. 

The sea bass, sashimi, and little kobe taquitos were just as good as I remembered them and was not let down.

Entree: we got A5 wagyu beef and seabass. Even though we only ordered 2oz on the wagyu order, it was served in a beautifully decorated plate with lots veggie and dipping sauce. Half way through the wagyu we were pretty full. Seabass is by far the best ever had, also perfectly seared on the skin to give crispy yet chewy texture and extremely tender inside.

It was an outstanding pairing with my sushi rolls and quinoa dish. 

The Sasa Handroll came with shrimp tempura, quinoa, shishito, spicy mayonnaise and red onion. It was an experience to eat, and should not be missed.

I really enjoyed the fusion of food: Brazilian, Peruvian, & Japanese. The rolls were just ok, but the ceviche and tiraditos were really good. As expected, it was pricey and small. However, unless you are in Peru, you are not going to get large ceviche plates for cheap. I also liked the Caipirinha. The service wasn't bad but was also not very attentive. One thing that bothered me is that the gentleman that brought our pitcher of Caipirinha (hey! it wasn't just for me, people) and when he was serving my cup, the top came out and a bunch of the caipirinha spilled over on the table and a bit on me. Well, the staff handled it well. They apologized and cleaned the mess. However, the inner alky in me was having a fit because I felt the spilled at least a glass worth of the drink and didn't bring us more or maybe a give us a bit discount on the pitcher (just the pitcher). I think that would have been a nice gesture, since it was like if they brought me one drink, they drop it, and not bring me a new one. I really don't think it was absolutely necessary, but it would have been nice costumer service.

We were dying to go back to Bobby Flay's Mesa grill in Cesar's, but when I saw that our own very hotel had a fusion restaurant, marrying Japanese, Brazilian, AND Peruvian flavors, I knew we had to take our money there.  My daughter's part Peruvian, and she never gets to experience the cuisine.  Plus she loves sushi...well, vegetable sushi to be exact.  

As soon as we arrived, I was feeling the service and the decor....nice hostess seated us right away and an informative waitress gave us the rundown of the menu.  I had plenty of time after ordering to scope the murals (fat tip usage in a restaurant?  oh yea!).  

The children's menu also impressed me.  It was a cute menu of that collabed with an artist to give a percentage of each bento box to charity.  Wow!  My kid ordered the sliders and switched out sweet potato fries for Peruvian corn (corn on steriods, as the waitress called it).  We weren't extremely hungry, or in the need for a drink, so we ordered light:

teriyaki chicken skewers
miso soup
avocado rolls
prawn tempura
more Peruvian corn
plantains
white rice 

As you can see, we didn't order any of the restaurant specialties, but what we did get was delicious and filling.  However, as you probably already figured out, this place is $$$!  The miso soup was $6 and no different than the free soup we get at our fave sushi spot back home, and the white rice was.......$5!  WTF!  $5 for ""Japanese"" style rice?  Just because you put sesame seeds on top does not make it $5 (we are Filipino and require white rice with our protein always.)  Oh well, that was the most disappointing part of the dinner.  

The most impressive part of our dinner was the kids bento box.  I wish they had bento boxes for adults because that's what I always order at a Japanese joint.  Her sliders were the smallest sliders I have ever seen, but they were oh-so-cute and worked for a child.  They came with seasonal fruit, which was like 2 blueberries and half of a strawberry, and the Peruvian corn was soooo good!  My daughter ended up skewing up some on the toothpicks from the fruit (Sushi Samba, if you use that on the menu, please credit Jada).  Plus, the box came with the cutest dessert ever...a tiny smoothie with Pop Rocks on top and a little brownie ice cream sundae.  Once again, so small and petite but it worked for her!

I'm not sure if I would be excited to go back again, as I still am to go to Mesa, but if I do I might give the drinks a try.  After reading many of these reviews, I realize I have missed out on some great sushi specialties and drinks (and a trip to the fancy bathroom!).

I'm not a sushi fan. (I'm sorry). However, my tablemates raved about the sushi and even ordered second plates to satiate both their stomachs and their taste buds. 

Came here for a friends birthday lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the variety! I didn't have to force feed myself sushi--that's a win in my book. 

There were Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian dishes. You can see the chefs cooking, too.

I ordered a plate of chorizo. It was meant to be a shared appetizer. However, it was small, so it was a perfect serving size for one person. Pretty standard taste. I also ordered a side of Peruvian corn. It was incredibly filling because it was denser and chewier than the sweet corn I'm used to consuming--I wish the corn was a smaller serving size, though.

Paid $13 for the chorizo and corn.

On the weekends, you can order off the brunch menu from 11:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. The menu had french toast, quinoa waffles, yogurt dishes, churros, and more.

I'd heard great things from friends who've eaten here in the past, and was really excited to see what it was all about.

My two friends got specialty rolls while I ordered a simple spicy tuna roll. When I saw that they had an oyster menu, I asked how often the oysters were shipped in (since Vegas is a landlocked city, it definitely isn't found in the backyard). The waitress said daily, every morning, so I ordered one Kumamoto oyster. It tasted great, added my usual dash of tabasco and lemon juice, and was a happy camper.

About two hours later, after roaming around the Grand Canal Shoppes, we got back to our hotel room, and I felt my stomach grumbling. I had some water and laid down to take a nap. About an hour later, I jumped up, told my friends to avoid the bathroom, and started puking my guts out. I hugged the toilet for about 2 hours, sipping warm salt water in between hurls.

The oyster is what got me, and I'm truly disappointed that it ruined what was a good experience at Sushi Samba. The waitresses were nice, environment fun, but I really didn't expect to start my vacation off with food poisoning.

tl;dr don't order the oysters.",0,2,0

Yellowtail taquitos - not really taquitos, more like tacos, but still yummy!

Tempura Green Beans - the dipping sauce was great!

Salt and Pepper Squid - always love squid! They're big pieces so it's hard to eat in one bite, but also really chewy so hard to take bites.

Miso seabass skewers w\/ Peruvian corn - my favorite dish! The fish was so flavorful and cooked perfectly! The corn was ok, but everyone else loved it!

Lima roll, bobo Brazil, San Paulo - all great rolls, we wanted to order more of them but
got too full. 

Ramen - was just okay. Wouldn't order it again.

Cucumber Soju - so good and refreshing! 

Chocolate dipped green tea ice cream - nice and light. Sprinkles with pop rocks to give it some fun texture!

Glasses sat empty. Plates sat bare. He didn't check on us, even when we were waiting anxiously to pay him and leave.

I was visiting Vegas on my own and decided to treat myself to a dinner at this restaurant that I used to love in Chicago, before it shut down (sadly). It had been so long that I really got to try a lot of new things on the menu and I was in love with all of them.  I started out with a glass of sparkling rose because I'm classy like that. Managers Michael and Jeremy gave me a primo spot to sip my bubbles and watch the fabulous crowd pour in for the dinner service. They also handed me a beautiful taster of their cucumber cocktail, which was fantastic. 

Next Jeremy brought me over one of the yellow tail taquitos, which had a crisp shell and a flavorful foam to spoon on top. It was a great amuse bouche. Along with that, I ordered the Wagyu beef gyoza. The beef just melted in your mouth. It was so good. I tried to slow myself down to savor every bite of the tender meat in the dumplings. The sauce that came with them was also an integral part of their savory goodness. I think I could eat those dumplings every day until the day I die and still ask for them in heaven (or hell, depending on where I end up). 

The next dish I ordered was the Yamato sushi, which sounded like the absolute most decadent sushi roll I could ever possibly order. And it was. And I loved it. Starting with white sushi rice, topped with flavorful fresh tuna, the smallest most perfect piece of foie gras, a dot of caviar, and topped with gold flake. I mean come on. I felt like the Queen of Sheba! Each bite was a beautiful rich, even slightly sweet (from the sauce) morsel. It felt light and sinful at the same time.

Then, Michael stopped by to check on me and suggested I order the Sea Bass Robata. Two skewers of meaty sea bass grilled with a delicious miso sauce. They were the perfect bite to pair with the giant Peruvian corn kernels served on the side. And I ordered mashed purple potatoes to top off the meal. Everything was cooked to perfection. I just felt so grateful and happy to be there.

When it came time for dessert, I was so full that all I wanted was coffee. So I ordered an espresso with a single scoop of chocolate ice cream, which was a great finish to an amazing meal. Then Michael and Jeremy brought me one more surprise: an ice cream pop. Mango ice cream covered with a white chocolate shell and graham cracker.

Everything was just awesome. Michael and Jeremy did a great job, as did my server, also named Michael. Amazing dinner in a really fun city. Beautiful decor. They really made me feel right at home!",2,1,0

First of all we made a reservation and were swiftly escorted to our table. The restaurant was dead yet we were packed into one area, on top of the other dozen couples in the restaurant. I HATE when places do that. We were literally elbow to elbow with strangers in an empty restaurant - UGH.

Second, since we were so close to everyone else we observed first hand what awesome service they were getting. It was too bad our waiter was different (his name was Kiley I believe) and he SUCKED. Disappeared for long periods of time, took forever to take our order and bring drinks, didn't ever say when he'd be back around, didn't check on us, didn't apologize, took forever with the check. Really bad service made worse by the excellent service everyone else around us seemed to be getting.

Third, the only redeeming thing about this place was the food. It was excellent. However, it was overpriced and the portions were really small. Normally I could overlook bad service and a weird atmosphere if the food is great but not with this place.

We were entertained with 4 different sashimi dishes, tuna with a granny smith green apple puree, kampachi in truffle oil, squeeze of lime & some sea salt, salmon in mandarin orange reduction & kampachi in some sort of chile vinegrette... all awesome.

Next we were served with some items from the robata, although the end pieces of the filet mignon did come off a bit dry, the prep, grilled green onion and center of the piece made up for it... I would of liked it not so seared but still great flavors.

This was also my first time having a ceviche with passion fruit sauce, let alone a lobster ceviche.. it was absolutely delicious. The sauce and vegetables were super colorful but all the flavors complimented each other nicely. A tiny bit of sourness from the passion fruit to substitute the traditional lime, and some truffle oil made it taste super buttery.. Super delicious.

  - Aji Amarillo chicken anticuchos - grilled chicken skewers with Peruvian corn 
* Course 3:
  - Wagyu beef ishi yaki - raw wagyu beef comes with seasoning and sauces on the side, to be self-cooked on a Japanese hot stone. This was definitely the highlight of the dinner for me. So good!

Our reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, Mike Durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.

My Fiance and I were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's Omakase. The food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. 

Our charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.

First was the Otsumami, three small dishes: Green Bean Tempura with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (Incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.

Next came Hamachi (Yellowtail) Tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (Spicy Aji Panca) on the side to top it off- This was filled with so much flavour It literally forced my eyes to roll back. A real Treat that I'd highly  reccommend.

At this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. The bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2\/3rds mark. As the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  Kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  Alongside was the ever popular Nina Fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. Both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.

Their Mushroom Toban Yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with Bincho Tan grilled Lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. Their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a unique filling appetizer. My fiances words: That fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)

The Sashimi Tiradito I'm always raving about came next. Still on a midblowing level, I noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the NYC location and the Las Vegas one. So if you think you've had it before, you haven't. Though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. My favorite is the Kanpachi since I'm a sucker for Yuzu (Japanese citrus) and My fiance was a big fan of the Hamachi- If you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.

Off the Robata Grill (Bincho Tan Charcoal) came the most decadant Crab Leg imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the Mastermind Talents of Chef Oscar Toro. Bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. A seasonal dish that may not always be available... So wonderful. If they don't have it on menu, go for the Spiny Lobster.

Also from from the Robata Grill we enjoyed The Miso Glazed Sea Bass with baby corn. Again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end Japanese restaurants- but Sushi Samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.

Ask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with traditional serving, paired with Yuzu Jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which Chef Oscar Toro will create specially for that oyster.- Both ways are unforgettable.

My absolute favorite dish is the KOBE ISHIYAKI. You grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized Kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot River Stone. You get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- Absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. Whenever I see this I must have it, and Sushi Samba's is THE BEST I've had. Not enough people indulge in this and you Must must must!!! 

Our Sushi\/Sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. We got the Neo Tokyo and the El Topo rolls- Neo Tokyo has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the El Topo is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a unique addition. It's like the movie ""El Topo"" you must try\/ see both! 

For dessert we went with Mochi; a soft and chewy Japanese dessert that is traditionally not overly sweet. Sushi Samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. 

By the end of our meal and a finished bottle of Sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. 


**************
Bottom line, if you are trying to decide between Nobu and Sushi Samba, Pass on Nobu and put some Samba in your Seafood!!

Thank you again Mike and Oscar for such a wonderful Night!!",2,0,0

We found that Sushi Samba was a great option within a short walk of our suite in the Venetian. The service was good and, if anything, overaccommodating. We found that the price fell in line with most other options at the strip, probably around $25 per person before drinks. I can't speak for the omnivores, but on the vegetarian side of the table we were very happy with the Amazonia roll, quinoa chaufa, and coconut rice. The avocado roll was cheap and great as a filler. Vegetarian\/vegan food isn't always easy to find in Vegas, and this place had some great options that didn't seem like an afterthought on the menu. Recommended.",0,0,0

I had been to the one on PAS several times, the last time being the Last Time but we were way too hungry and our bellies were three hours ahead so we just made a decision and in we went.

It is a large space with lots of noise and visuals to embrace and encourage one's inner ADD. It was decently populated for a Thursday lunch hour and we were seated near the back along a banquette. Our waitress came to see us quickly and took our drink orders, no hard stuff at this meal, for a Berry Smash and a Coco Leite. They were both good but mostly ice and no refills. :((( For $8, I want at least one refill. It was not alcoholic.

Since we do not eat land meat, we stuck to primarily the Japanese side of things. One order of the Otsumami, a trip of edamame, green bean tempura with black truffle alioli and shishito. The greenie beanies were really good. The edamame as expected and the shishito, grilled spicy peppers with sea salt and lemon, were the surprise. A little hot at first which quickly faded away leaving just the roasted pepper flavor. A first for me and yay, now I am hooked and will keep an eye out for them at other restaurants.

We also ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura. I was expecting a few pieces but this was positively prolific! Very enjoyable. 

We then ordered three of the Sushi Samba Rolls: The Pacific (King crab, avocado and asian pear wrapped in soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema ), Veggie Kun (avocado, tomato, arugula, oshinko, yamagobo, wasabi nori flake, tofu miso ) and Green Envy (Green Envy tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo). I was not so crazy about the Pacific as it was too sweet perhaps from the soy paper? The inside was good though.

Overall though I really enjoyed Sushi Samba. My expectations were low and they were definitely exceeded. No regrets. The hostess who seated us as well as our waitress were very nice and pleasant. The Ladies Loo-cy was really cool-pods, like at Saka Gura in NYC. 

Next time, in a pinch, I would happily go again. PAS? No.

The restaurant's decor is trendy and upscale with dim lighting. We had a party of 7 and sat in one of the round booths that was large enough to accommodate us all but still very cozy. 

All of the waiters that helped us went above and beyond to make our dining experience great. Our trip was to celebrate my youngest brother's 21st birthday, and they brought us out a couple extra plates when they heard this, including a fantastic dessert plate. 3 of our 7 diners were vegan and the staff was also very helpful and accommodating in this regard - would highly recommend for this reason alone, as there was a separate vegan menu with tons of great options to choose from.

We opted to order lots of small plates for the table and share them family style. Would also recommend this, since you get to try a little bit of everything and the sizes are perfect for it. Prices are a little steep, but pretty much along the lines of what you would expect for a place like this on the strip.

We ordered: 
-edamame
-shishito
-heirloom tomato salad
-field green salad
-various different sushis, most of the names are escaping me (they were all great)
-tapioca con leche
-chocolate sata andagi

I will warn you that most of the shishito peppers were not very spicy, but a couple in the batch were burn-your-mouth hot. We were asking the waiter about this and apparently this is kind of standard? Be aware. The heirloom tomato salad may have been my favorite. Additionally, I would recommend the Brisa Caliente from the cocktail menu.

Oh, the women's restrooms were also very cool. All in all, fantastic food, atmosphere and service. Would definitely recommend Sushisamba if you're in LV!",1,0,1

I feel like I should preface my review by saying that I'm from Hawaii and seeing Larger than Life Vegas decor is rare to see back home. This is not to say there aren't trendy, cool looking restaurants, it's just to say they aren't found on every block in Hawaii.

First of all, I dug the atmosphere. Really mellow, a restaurant that looks part modern art gallery, part restaurant, and part trendy graffiti hangout. 

The food was really delicious and I wish I could remember the names of everything I ate. I'm not a big fish person, but I had this miso sea bass and it was sooo good. Just the right amount of flavoring and no fishy taste (which I don't like when eating fish). I also had a butter garlic scallop that just melted in my mouth. 

The service was superb, the manager introduced himself and made sure we had a great time, and the food was delicious.

They serve a variety of dishes inspired by Peruvian, Brazilian, and Japanese cuisine. We didn't really know where to begin, so the waiter suggested doing an ""omakase"" (chef's choice) style of offerings depending on how much you'd like to spend. He suggested creative sets with various price ranges, so we opted for one that ended up costing about $155 a person (without drinks and including tip). The wagyu beef steak strips were prepared raw where they provide you a hot rock (forgot what they call it) that cooks your meat for you and a platter of sauces and various types of salts. To be honest, I didn't need those seasonings because the meat alone was mesmerizing. Also, you have to eat it with the sliced pears because it's a slightly sweet and crunchy compliment to the savory melting flavor the beef provides. The other dish that blew me away was the chilean sea bass. They serve it on a stick which made it look like a lollipop and I sure devoured it like one on a fiery hot summer day. 

Other things we tried that were enjoyable were the wagyu gyozas, sushi rolls (nothing special), various sashimis, and this tasty egg roll looking appetizer that had crispy vermicelli and scallops inside.",1,0,1

The group I came with were starving, so we wondered if there were any tables opened for 10 people. The hostess up front said that she had a private room available and that we could be seated quickly. Yay for private room! But there was a catch that she didn't tell us: $75 order minimum per person. 

Well that didn't stop the group so they went straight to ordering sashimi, sushi, oysters, skewers, satay, and LIVE lobster!? But wait, there's no toro? Yep, our waiter told us they will no longer have toro because the fish is too endangered or something to that extent.

My wallet is already throwing a fit about the thought of how quickly I would go broke, but akdsjhfakjldhf. Words cannot describe how much I want to go back and eat ALL THE THINGS. Well more specifically, all the ishi yaki.

In reality though, Sushisamba is unfortunately a sometimes food (unless you're a bajillionaire, in which case, dine on! I will live vicariously through you). It's just too expensive for me, as a student to afford. Thank goodness someone else was picking up the check when I went.

My family and I had our Christmas dinner here at like... 9pm (yea, we did Christmas in Vegas). It was by far, the fanciest Christmas dinner I have ever had. 

We were seated in the back room area since we had a relatively large party, but since it was so late, it was mostly empty there, which was simultaneously nice and eery. Our waiter suggested we do the tasting menu, where he and the chef craft our meal for us, but since my mom had just been here with some colleagues the week before, we decided to just let her order for us, since she knew what was good. 

- Salt and Pepper Squid: the seasoning made this extra delicious-- a really good starter
- Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos: also yummy, though I may be biased because yellowtail is one of my favorite fish; very lime-y
- Rock shrimp tempura: a twist on regular tempura, but absolutely delicious; if you don't like spicy mayo, maybe not your thing
- Ishi Yaki: Words cannot describe. Grade A5 Japanese Waygu that you cook yourself on a hot Japanese river stone? Yes, please! You take a slice of meat, dip it in oil, and then put it on the hot stone to let it cook. There's a few different dipping sauces and three different types of salt that you can add to your meat. All of them are delicious, though I am partial to the black salt. There were some pears on the plate, so I was like what the heck, why not cook those on the stone too. Still delicious. Even thinking about this is making me crave it. The ishi yaki is really expensive, but if you're going to go for any of the Japanese Waygu options, go for this one because it is definitely the most unique.
- We ordered a bunch of sushi rolls, which were good, but not the most amazing ones I've ever had.
- Also, the lychee bubbletail is really good. The alcohol is not overpowering, it's not too sweet, and they put a real lychee (probably from a can) in it.

Random: I really like the music on their website... That probably sounds really weird, but it's true. Love it.

tl;dr: I know for a fact that the main reason why I love Sushisamba as much as I do is because I was not paying. It was a crazy expensive meal, but it was delicious because we ordered some rather expensive (but good! oh so very good!) things. If you're not willing to splurge, you'll probably think I'm crazy for giving them a 5-star review, but if you are, be prepared to be amazed. Just don't think about the check.

The good: green bean tempura with black truffle aioli, antichuco tenderloin with Peruvian corn, and warm banana chocolate pie.  As far as sushi rolls go: just because you combine a bunch of flavors together doesn't necessarily make them tasty.  The king crab roll with pear was downright odd.  It was served with some type of avocado crema that was not complementary to the crab.  Everything overpowered the fish, in fact I'm not even sure if the roll contained fish.  A green envy roll advertised a wasabi pea crust that I thought would give it crunch. Negative.  Just a light dusting to give the roll yet again an odd flavor.  If you enjoy more traditional Japanese sushi this will not satisfy the craving. However, for light appetizers and drinks this makes for a good spot.",3,0,2

We asked to sit at the sushi bar and after we were seated were told we could not order from the chefs directly, which is absurd for folks from Los Angeles. The food should not be called sushi, it it is more of a fusion experience. We ordered - rock shrimp appetizer, Lima roll, lobster roll and a side of roasted vegetables. The food lacked any distinct flavor profiles and was very expensive. The rock shrimp appetizer was good, but comparable to other rock shrimp appetizers with a basic aioli sauce on a bed of spring greens. The Lima roll was so basic, a crab mix over a basic roll. The Lobster roll looked the most exotic but the flavor profile was bland and lack luster. The service was decent but they got very defensive when we asked why we couldn't order from the sushi chefs.

The caipirinhas were refreshing and strong and the food was melt-in-your-mouth good.  It's definitely a fun spot to hit up for some tasty food in Vegas.",2,1,6

We told her what we liked, what we didn't like, what we were allergic to, and they made our food according to our liking.

The food was really good! All of my girls were surprised to see that we liked every single dish! We also ordered hamachi shots (without sake) and it was still very flavorful!

Since we were staying at the Encore we had to pass through the Palazzo.  We decided to go through the grand canal shoppes to take advantage of the AC since it was 110 outside.  We walked by Sushi Samba and really liked the ambiance so we decided to have a late lunch there.

We had the Rio Grande ($45) which came with rib eye, wagyu picante, and a chicken sausage.  It also came with a serving of rice, beans, and various sauces to dip the aforementioned proteins.

The wagyu picante and rib eye were both melt in your mouth delicious :).  I wish we had a little more rice to go with the meats though.

The highlight of the night is definitely the sushi here.  (Hey, maybe that's why they named the restaurant SUSHIsamba.)  We ordered the Samba Sushi 7 Piece with the Green envy roll ($26).  The fish tasted fresh and the Green Envy roll is delicious!!

The service here was fantasic and we will definitely be back.",1,1,1

     Friends suggested the Peruvian Plate- enough for two, but i was too interested in the menu selection to choose otherwise. He DID goto SushiSamba a bit after me, and ordered it again, so it must be worthwhile.

I went last weekend with my boyfriend to watch the World Cup Final. They let us in half an hour before the game started and gave us great seats right in front of the projection screen. Our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing (we were obviously watching the game and did not want to be interrupted too much) and also made some great suggestions for us without being pushy. The manager also came by and gave us some souvenir soccer balls (although we had a bit of trouble fitting them in the suitcase). 

The food was amazing as well. I highly suggest getting the ceviche sampler and picking four of your favorite fish. Make sure you pay attention to what else is on it though because some have spicy peppers. Also, the Samba Juice was a great drink if you are looking for a cocktail.

My only issue was that it was a little pricier than I would have liked. However, it is Vegas so I knew it was going to be a little more expensive.

My mother believes this happens because non-Asians tend not to eat it, but Asians love it. This is probably why my father who once detested it's clubby and loud environment is now willing to venture there all the time.  For the yellowfin collar.  Squeeze some lemon or lime on that and it's good.

Otherwise the ramen doesn't taste like ramen, but like good noodle soup, and the gyoza is tempting but not actually better than the O'Tasty frozen variety.  On the whole though, it's quite good, and a very fun place for dinner.  The drinks are good and strong, very strong, so be prepared.",0,0,0

First, the menu is a combination of Latin and Asian influences, and there is much more to the menu than just sushi (in fact, sushi lovers might be a little disappointed). The rock shrimp was unbelievably good. The meat options -- similar to Brazilian grilled meats -- were delicious. And despite the large crowd of 20 or so, our service was excellent. I loved the spicy tequila drink, so I had two. The sake cocktail was awesome. And I rarely waited more than 5 minutes for anything I requested.

We were asked how much we wanted to spend, and we said about $50 pp (with tax and drinks, though, it came to be over $90 for those who ordered drinks and $80 for those who didn't).  They do their best to keep under or at your budget - and they did!  It's kinda cool bc they will add an extra piece of two depending on the size of your party and prorate the piece.  No more having to cut pieces because there's only four items and six people.

However, I thought it was lame that I told them I was allergic to shrimp and they still brought out a dish with shrimp!  They asked what allergies we had, so I would assume when they do that, they will try to avoid bringing out anything with those items.  What's the point in asking what your allergies are if you don't adhere to them??  I should have asked to return it or taken off the bill - according to an email exchange with someone when reserving a table, it said we could return any dish we didn't enjoy.  The dish was good, but again, don't serve things people are allergic to after being told.

Anyway, most of the food was good, though there were a few misses.  We started with some tempura fried green beans and edamame - something we probably wouldn't have normally ordered since it seemed like filler food.  We all loved the scallop wrapped in what looked like a fried bird's nest.  So good.  The waguy dumplings were good but something we could have skipped.  Also, another favorite was the Sea Bass and Peruvian corn - omg that was so delicious.  I could have eaten way more of that plate.  The Peruvian corn kernels were really large and sweet.  The Tuna Tacos were another favorite.  We didn't like the Beef and Mushroom pot so much - had a strong coconut flavor, which I'm not a fan of.  We also got a plate of sushi, three different kinds.  One was good, but the rest were okay.  The Banana Boat dessert, though nice, wasn't that good.  We probably would have skipped it.  It was basically pieces of banana with torched sugar on top and ice cream, etc.  

Drinks are expensive but really good here.  I recommend ordering the Samba one was way better than mine, and in a really large glass!  It was fruity and fresh, and there was definitely alcohol in it.  I might go back one day if I win some money, but I'll prob stick to ordering the dishes myself.

The edamame was totally standard and what you expect.  Same with the side salad- tasty and fresh, but not memorable.

Worse, we got tons of candy flakes on them at the end. It was unacceptable. 
I used to work as a waitress, so I understand sometimes it happens.  But not too many mistakes for one table.  It's clear she should have paid more attention to us after making mistakes.

Eleven of us arrived a few minutes before our reservation and I checked in while we grabbed a few drinks at the bar. We were seated just shortly after our check-in when our whole party arrived, which was great, but after that our time at the table seemed to be an unsuccessful long one. We weren't seated with menus and waited quite a while for some info as to what was going on. When our server, Justin notified us that the Chef usually likes to do a ""tasting menu"" for larger parties bringing us items geared towards our tastes we thought that sounded pretty good. He left us to talk it over, and when he came back I asked him if he was sure it was going to be enough food and he said yes we would all leave full so eight out of the eleven in my party decided to try it. With that being said, it wasn't even close to enough food. Edamame, fried green beans and roasted peppers along with what totaled up to be a little more than one sushi roll for each of us and a few skewers of chicken and what looked like a single portion of steak, we all left hungry.

I will say the food was delicious, there just was not enough of it and each of my guests felt guilty not wanting to eat more than others. Several of my party asked me if there was more food coming, but after we received the meat portion that was it. Justin was nice enough to bring a round of shots over for the party, but this was only after two people in my party, who had skipped on the preset menu asked about how much longer their food was going to be after they had ordered it almost thirty minutes earlier! The food was finally brought out with some apologies and my friends ate while we all sat and waited for them to be done.

The decor is great & upscale. Unfortunately though, the food just was not that great. If this was an average priced sushi place I would give it a 3 star, instead of a 2 star. The prices are far above the typical though, because of its location on the Strip. 

If you're a tourist looking for sushi, I recommend paying for a taxi & taking a trip up Spring Mountain Road to go to the many sushi & Asian restaurants not far from Las Vegas Blvd. If you're a local, there are far too many amazing spots & AYCE sushi joints off the strip for me to ever recommend even trying this place.

First off, the Kobe (A5 grade) although very good, was not as good as the one I had at Shibuya. Most notable was the Kobe on the rock. (Feel free to skip the Kobe on a platter of mushrooms as it was on okay and not really worth the money as the Kobe was a lot more well done). Moreover the sashimi Kobe was a little to this for my tastes and not as lean as I would have liked. As for the fish you can't go wrong with the Otoro or Yellowtail. As for the rolls the Yamato was decent\/normal, same with the Neo Tokyo, nothing really special (ie. skippable).

We made reservations at 10:15pm and upon arrival the bar area and the dining area looked pretty full.  

The decor was dark and interesting, with black and white classic Japanese films airing on a large big screen and some classy art\/anime con another wall.  My friend and I had a discussion about how we appreciated the scene.    

Their menu features a wide array of items: small platters, appertizers, large platters, sushi.   I checked out their menu from the Palazzo website prior so I knew what prices to expect.  We started off with a bottle of sake - they have a pretty extensive sake list - and the price was reasonable for a bottle of sake.  

I had ordered the rock fish ($29) and it was prepared very elegantly and was also very very delicious -sweet and moist.  I let my friends sample my dish and everyone really enjoyed it. 2 of my friends ordered the teriyaki chicken ($25) and it wasn't your typical chicken teriyaki - the chicken was served with the bone in and was accompanied with purple mashed potatoes.  I think this was probably my favorite chicken teriyaki dish I have sampled before and the others agreed.  Others at the table ordered sushi, ramen, fries, etc.  There were 9 of us and out of the group, it impressed 3 of us (1 person was myself).  I appreciate good quality food and I thought the prices were reasonable - it is Las Vegas and it is a trendy restaurant in the Palazzo so it's expectable for the prices of cuisine.  Most restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip are usually typically pricey for the amount of food you receive anyway.  I typically like upscale restaurants.  On the other hand, the other girls at the table complained of hunger and that it was expensive.  They didn't agree that ramen for $18 was worth it - they are used to $5 ramen at a no-thrills restautant.  Yes it is only ramen, but it had a delicate lemon grass flavor, it was a decent size, and it is generally a good price for an upscale restaurant.  So this review offers insight for 2 different perspectives.  It was light fare, but perfect for going out to clubs after.  

Service was superb.  Our waiter served us well; had friendly casual discussions periodically, and offered to take us into Sugarcane - the club.lounge attached to the restaurant.  Granted, the club\/lounge was empty and only had 2 people dancing, it was a nice gesture and this review is solely based on the restaurant.  

If you appreciate upscale quality food that emerges to be different and unique in a chic environment try Sushisamba :)",1,1,1

Sushi Samba had some of the best dishes I have had and the quality was great.  They have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.

Wagyu Gyoza
Rock shrimp tempura
Green bean tempura
Pork belly
Moqueca Mista. Seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion
Yamato sushi roll(maguro, Fois gras, Osetra caviar)

i went here saturday night. at some point they brought out some dancing girls in skimpy outfits. i felt it was a tad out of place and noisy, but somewhat entertaining.

i ordered the nina fresa, this delicious vodka cocktail with muddled strawberries. yum.

our party ordered a lot of things. the sea bass skewers were to die for--definitely order some. i also enjoyed the jalapeno yellowtail. it was served with these large brazilian(?) corn kernels. the sashimi was good, too! those were the only dishes i remember. oh, the neo-tokyo roll was super plain and required salty soy sauce to give it any taste. everything was good though, not amaziiiiing.

it's def a schlep to get here from the entrance of the palazzo, but worth it! i had a blast, but wouldn't have enjoyed it if i had to pay (but that's everywhere in vegas, no?).",0,0,0

Fair enough, it wasn't packed so I'm sure it was easier to pay attention to us, but still.  It's not too often that you get Brazilian\/Peruvian\/Japanese food on one menu.  Our server Javier was fantastic - attentive, helpful, knowledgeable, fun, but not the least bit overbearing.  The manager Hayes was the same.  We felt like we were constantly checked on and attended to - quite luxurious.
They helped us pick some amazing items off of the giant menu, and we were thrilled with all of the items we had.
Tempura green beans, yellowtail tiradito, the samba strip roll (possibly our favorite), and the churrasco (we got hanger steak, pork tenderloin and linguisa).
The cocktails.  
Oh.
My.
God.
The cocktails.  
Amazing, fresh, delicious. . . . I had the monthly special (a strawberry mojito), and a lemon samurai which was seriously the most amazing drink I've ever had.
My only gripe with things that are flown in fresh from all around the world - impressive yes, but the environment scowls in your general direction Sushi Samba.  Situated in the largest LEED certified building in the world (http:\/\/www.commercialpropertynews.com\/cpn\/content_display\/regions\/southwest\/e3i76b446d81cf85aa4fc437cba15737e76), you'd think this would be a faux pas.  
Take advantage of it if your conscience allows - you won't be sorry.  The two of us got out after two cocktails each and the shared food mentioned for under $150.  Not bad for an upscale Vegas restaurant.",3,0,4

The decor here is really impressive... love the graffiti art! It was in Palazzo so I don't think anything here would have stunk decor wise.

We were sat pretty quickly. We shared the edemame, wagyu beef, sashimi assortment (tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, and I forget what else..) I also ordered the lima, which is basically a fancy king crab roll.

Food was... ok. Maybe good, but definitely not great. Presentation was nice.

Overall a bit expensive for what it was.. and we were in Vegas. Waitress was really hot... but that's not enough to give it 5 stars.",0,1,0

Two of us felt that way. All the dishes were so flavorful and healthy too. The presentation, the fresh sashimi,  the cod, the biggest corn kernels  I've ever seen and the Waygu beef cooked on a hot stone were fabulous. It's a great place to go with a lot of people so you can try all the different dishes.

Disclaimer. To be honest, our party host  didn't order anything off the menu  but allowed the chef to serve anything he pleased. So, I don't actually know the menu name of anything we ate.",0,1,0

I went for lunch yesterday. The hostess was nice and sat us immediately. Our server was fast and attentive. We ordered the best items on the menu-- hamachi tacos, rock shrimp, kanpachi tiradito, sea bass anticucho, and a neo Tokyo roll. Everything was tasty. However, the hamachi tacos use to be better quality fish. You can tell that it's not the freshest. The rock shrimp didn't have enough sauce and it seemed like it was sitting in the kitchen 10 minutes too long. 
Overall I'd come back but I think the quality use to be better. Great service. 

$150 for 2 people is pretty normal here. That's not including alcohol.",1,0,0
