I dont go to clubs to wait in long lines and get crammed on to dance floors.

I go for the table service and the vip experience which I feel is the right way to see these places so that is the point of view I am sharing.

We had a ""Skybox"" over looking the dance floor its was roomy enough for the 10 of us. We originally had 12 but 2 dudes dropped out, if it had been all 12 it might have been a little tight up there.

From start to finish the service was spot on. The security was security, not like others described in their reviews. They didnt mingle with our girls or flirt, they monitored our area escorted others away from our area, escorted us to the bathrooms (HUGE BONUS!!!). The servers\/hosts were very friendly, outgoing, gracious and hospitiable. The never once let our drinks go empty. The server assistant kept our are super clean the whole night. He was constantly walking by picking up our glasses wiping up ice spills, etc.

The dancers are hot, the tub girls I found to be lovely, and the music was good. From start to finish TAO was great, I'll go back in a heartbeat and do it all over again.

Cheers TAO and thanks for an awesome VIP experience it was truly appreciated",0,0,0

The problem is that there are far too many people inside.  I am used to crowded clubs, but this is worse than most.  It is nearly impossible to get to the bar for drinks.  There is no way you could actually ever dance.

The DJ was great.  He played a nice mix of music.  The lighting and smoke effects were well done.  The girls in the tubs is a great touch as well.

I will come back on a slower night so I can hopefully enjoy the experience a little more.  Saturday night is just too popular.",0,0,0

They offer you 3 rooms to chose from depending on your preference of music. The bigger room upstairs offers the best expiereince in the club. The smaller room upstairs is a bit overcrowded and you dont get the whole Tao experience. The room downstairs plays hip hop but is usually not as busy and live as any of the other rooms. Overall the decor looks great inside. My overall experience is that Thursday night (Tao Industry Night) is your best bet to enjoy the night and have a good time.,0,0,0

One of my friends met a so called club promoter at a pool party in Vegas and told her to gather some friends and come on over to the club. Which we did and they sat us at a booth which was awesome.

Now for the now so awesome part. That booth they sat us at well yeah they also sat 10 other people there and they said all they will ask for is us to tip the waitress 20 dollars. Well we tip her 20 dollars they brought us 3 small bottles of water down vodka and expect us to share it with the 10 other random people they just sat at your booth after you and your friends just paid over a few hundred in tips. And after those 3 water down bottles were gone mainly from the random people sitting at your booth they expect you to pay at least a 100 dollars for another bottle what a joke.

The Only good thing about this place is that it was at the venetian which was the hotel we were staying at and it is very nice in there.

When I say ""as good a time as any,"" that's both true and false. Being Saturday night on Labor Day weekend, the place was crazy packed. Fortunately, we were able to use the hotel guest line and it only took maybe 15 minutes to make it inside. Unfortunately, I had to pay the requisite insane cover charge of $40. Oh well. I justified that with the knowledge that my cousins knew some people who had a VIP lounge area with bottle service.

After we paid and went inside, we snaked our way up the stairs to the rooftop pool area. With the constant flow of people going up and down that stairwell, it felt like we were still in line for something. Seriously. We finally made it to the top and to cut a long story short, we found our group.

I must say that the VIP area really made the experience for me, at least on a night as crowded as that. I'm really not a huge club type person and it was nice to have an area that didn't feel like a zoo of people. My star rating is with that in mind. Tao is certainly a nice club.

We had requested to be seated in Tao Beach and they had said, up to 2 hours beforehand that night, that it was first come first serve. We followed their instructions for bottle service and got their early before 10:30pm.  Ten girls with bottle service yet they still made us wait in line for 30 minutes. Still, no big deal.

 They seated us in a cramped room with seats for only half our party. We were informed then that Tao Beach ended up being closed that night because they believed it was going to be a slow night due to Father's Day. If we had known, we would have gone somewhere else. Exactly why they were vague over the phone. The place got so crowded that I had my head hit over three times by people dancing or just passing by the aisle behind the couch. I had a huge headache by the end of the night.

Close to 3am, the room we were in started dying down. They started moving table service groups to the main dance floor area, stating that they were ""upgrading us."" We ended up following the promoter as he led us around on a wild goose chase. The table that he thought was empty was not.  As he was trying to figure out where to put us, we stood in a single file line squished up between the dancing crowd and the people at the table. 

45 minutes later, we end up back at our original table with only half our party and the room completely empty. They offered us a round of shots to compensate us. Are you serious? We still had half a bottle of vodka left that we could have polished off the last hour. Why would we need your free shots? Weak.

Finally, the guy agrees to give us one free bottle the next time we go to Vegas. We agreed to this since we were planning on going to Vegas in September for another bachelorette. Now, as we try to contact him to honor his agreement, he is not responding. Terrible.

Loved this place when I first ate here, years ago.  And, while I was in Vegas, I decided to bring the girlfriend here to check it out again.  So, we made reservations about two weeks prior.  And on a Sunday.  So, anyway, I think the reservations thing was what made me give this place four stars instead of five.

Even with reservations, we had to wait almost half an hour for a table.  Which I can understand to a point.  Now, the place was packed, but there was still a few tables for two open when we were walking by.  Not to mention, we were five minutes early.  Oh well.  Not too mad about it though.

Okay, first thing I got to say, the Kobe sashimi was awesome.  Had to try it, even though it was quite a pricey item.  Interesting, though some traditional wasabi and some of the fresh wasabi together would be divine.

For my dinner, I had the Grilled Raw Tuna.  The Asian Green Stir Fry was good, though I suppose the saltiness of it balances out the tuna.  And the peppercorn sauce just made it all mesh together nicely.  It was sweet, which accented the Tuna in a subtle way that really pulled the flavors out. 

Then the Lady had the Diver Scallops in curry sauce.  And man, those scallops were gigantic!  Buttery in the center but nicely seared outside.  

Anyway, always had a fairly good time here as a restaurant.  Now, next time, maybe I'll actually get to try the nightclub.  Heh.",1,1,2

Awesome interior, but the point of a nightclub is to dance. You can't dance if you're wedged up against 600 other sweaty, wasted people. I don't care how good you look coming in, you're gonna look nasty if you're sweaty and wasted regardless.

I can imagine if you're really tore up however, it might be a strategic move to shove your way in to the middle of the crowd, since it's virtually impossible to fall down with all those people holding you up.

Also, those girls in the pools are really depressing. When nice girls say hello and ask you how you're doing and you stare blankly ahead and strike a pose from a foot away, you look like you've been trafficked. Either that or you just have to get wasted to make it through your shift.",0,3,0

Why it lost stars:
The dance floor is really small and super crowded.  I wonder if they even keep track of how many people come into the club because it seemed like they packed in people 3 times the maximum capacity.  Also, the music is way too loud... it was almost like we were at a concert.  I was also turned off by the DJ.  I understand that they have to play a variety of music for the general crowd, but alternating 3 hip hop songs and then followed by 3 rock songs and then back to hip hop just breaks the rhythm up.  If they had two separate rooms playing different kinds of music, I would appreciate it more.  

All in all, I'm glad I came to this club. It was definitely something to experience and their decor and plush seats make up or the small dancefloor and extremely loud music.",0,0,0

That girl below who is defending the club for the dress code has no clue. The issue here isn't the dress code in fact. You guys were probably turned down because 1) you came in a group of guys only and\/or 2) they don't respect you. I've seen tons of white guys get in without adhering to the dress code. These bouncers look at you guys and make up their mind in three seconds whether or not they want to let you in. If you are not white, that's a minus. If you're not getting a table, that's a minus. If you don't look like you'll be tipping them, that's a minus. Officially, assuming you are a guest in the hotel or know someone who can get you in that line, if you are the only ones in line and they ask if you're on the guest list, that's a clue they don't want you there. If you pass that, you'll just get more problems. Like you need to have a 1:1 ratio, shoes, shirts, etc. I went once and went straight to the hotel line. There were three guys in front of me. These guys were dark skinned Indian and Arabic guys. Officially, they thought I was with them and had to leave because those three and me didn't have a button down shirt. I told them I was by myself and I knew I was good to go. They only discriminate because they thought those guys were foreign terrorists or something. Another time I went, a black girl I knew thought she had a table. As soon as the waiters figured she wasn't good for a big tip, they asked the whole party to walk outside for a second. They then told them good night. This club is basically for Asian guys who want to be cool and will end up spending a lot of money on tables when the irony is that Asian girls come there to be hit on and to hit on white guys. I'm white and know the things that come with being white, but still, Asian guys are better off as soon as they know what Tao is all about.",0,0,0

The first time was a bad experience for me because of how crowded the place was, nonetheless, I gave it a second try. Well, the second time, I was there for Halloween... and let me tell you, that turned out worse. I was denied entrance: (1) I'm not Asian, (2) I was there with my boyfriend, and (3) I didn't ""look"" like my I.D. I had blond hair back then, yes, I looked different. Lets see, it's HALLOWEEN! Not only do we dress-up on this day (costume, colored-contacts, etc.) - I also have black hair now. I sure as hell am not going to update my photo every time I color my hair. WTH? Ridiculous. It ultimately worked-out in the end as we ended up trying out Rio's Roof-top Lounge, and loved it.

If you haven't gone, you should difinitely go (at least once.) The decor has an Asian Theme to it and is very lovely. It does get croweded here but what nightclub in Vegas doesn't. I also like how there is more then one room so if you get bored of the music, you can migrate to another room. If you hang out at the Venetian, sometimes people are passing out VIP passes that admits 2 ladies in for free Fri, Sat, & Sun night. To be honest, if you know a promoter, you can put yourself and your friends on the guestlist and you all will get in for free. Even the guys. It's usually hard to get into the nightclubs for free but I find it fairly easy to get into Tao. You just have to go early (10pm) If you go later then that, the line gets really long.

I danced on the stage for like 3 minutes and all these photographers for the company party (still not sure whose party it was) took pictures.  Oops. Oh well.  At least I changed out of my company shirt with my nametag. haha.

Update 5\/1\/08

I came here with the girls last weekend on a Saturday night.  We had VIP passes that still required us to wait approximately 20-30 minutes in line.  It was so packed that guys were only allowed in if they were with a girl (one-to-one ratio).  

Tao is way too crowded and pretentious.  You get in line only to be a part of another line in a stairwell that goes all the way to the top floor called Tao Beach or something like that.  It's nice that it's out in the open so you don't get hot and sweaty, but after waiting 30 minutes outside in line and another 10 minutes in the stairwell to get outside...you just want a freakin drink!  It took us ANOTHER 30 minutes to get a drink pushing our way to the front.  After a weak drink that cost us a fortune and I finished in 1 minute, we tried to dance to the pathetic music they were playing.  Shortly after, we got ""complained"" about because we were dancing too close to a VIP table.  There were VIP tables everywhere and no where for anyone else to stand, sit, or dance.  Weak.  This pissed me off and we all decided to go downstairs to the main club area.

Surprise, surprise.  You have to wait in the stairwell again to go downstairs.  Another 10-15 minutes go by.  We see that the music is better and it's easier to get drinks, but we check out the dance floor and it's packed like sardines.  Every other section was the same.  

There was this weird open cage where a scantily clad woman was grinding on top of another woman laying on her back.  Every time I walked by they were just doing the same grinding motions over and over again.  I'm not sure how this related to the theme of the club.  I guess it didn't have to.  I didn't get the chick in a bathtub near the front door either.  

We left feeling irritated.  We would have been happier gambling at the tables.  

Please don't waste your time here.  There are better clubs\/lounges in Vegas.  Not only does this place suck, the people who work here are rude and could care less about your business.",3,2,1

The restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. The entrance to the restaurant itself was very unique! Walking into the restaurant there were bath tubs full of naked women tastefully cover in flowers. No pictures were allowed but I tried unsuccessfully anyway. We sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. The bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full. 
Once we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster fried rice as well as the glazed salmon. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. However, we both thought the lobster fried rice was very salty and way too greasy. Their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us.
After having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. This was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge.
The club was very much like the restaurant - beautiful and full of both naked and costumed woman but this time they were all dancing instead of lounging like the ladies in the bathtubs at their restaurants entrance. Like at the restaurant bar the club bar served very good drinks. Snoop dogg was the entertainment for the night I was there. When the club let out the staff surprisingly handed out flip flops to all the women. But on the downside the flip flops were all the same size but this didn't stop any of the women from using the slippers LOL. My friend said they were a relief from her high heels. I simply took mine home as a souvenir. The take home slippers were definitely a unique touch.
The only negative that I could recall beside the one size fits all slippers was the greasy rice but the rest of my experience was wonderful. I'd definitely return when I'm in Vegas again.",4,1,1

If it were not for our bachelor party getting bottle service, we would not have gotten in.

It was gonna be my first time at any club on the strip so I wanted to make sure everything would go well for the evening. I found some website (napkin nights) that put you on the guestlist for various clubs so I signed up, but still wary. 

Luckily, my friend was walking at the Venetian earlier in the day and some guy who was a host at Tao approached her and asked if she wanted to be on the guestlist for that night. TIP: I don't trust those people out on the sidewalk with guest passes to all the clubs in vegas, try to find someone who works for the club directly. And make sure you have equal guy to girl ratio in your party.

So the host told us to be in line at 10:00pm. We only waited about 15 minutes before getting in so we felt like celebrities haha. It was pretty empty, but the dance floor and the bar was ours. We took advantage of this because before you know it, there's 10000000000 million sweaty people around you. 

All you had to do was stand still on the dancefloor and let everybody else dance around you and you were practically swaying along too. Even though my friends and I weren't able to sit, we had a blast. We left around 1:30am and people were still trying to get in.

They definitely knew how to make things SEXY with nearly naked women in bathtubs, S&M-type women-feeling up on each other by the entrance, a woman suspended from the ceiling while confetti fell onto the dance floor, and the hottest gogo dancers I've seen.

However, I just wasn't feeling the layout of TAO or the crowd.  Honestly, it was like I was back in Houston in Asiatown.  For midnight, there were entirely too many people who had been over-served who were getting rowdy and spilling stuff and falling onto my group of ladies.  The layout of TAO was also a bit awkward.  You first pass through a huge lounge with tables and a bar before getting into the main room.  In the main room, the bar is all the way back, but you have to maneuver your way through stand still crowds and past an elevator before you can even spot it.  There's a small dance floor and an even smaller strip of a balcony.

Once for Halloween, a few times because we stayed there, and once again this past weekend. They're doing much better of organizing the multitude of lines that you have to be in to get into the club.

There's a line for Table Service, Guest List, Hotel Guest, General Admission and probably a Hot Girl line, but i'm no hot girl so i'll never see that line.

Before this weekend there would basically be a hundred people milling around the front entrance trying to figure out which line was which and getting frustrated because you were in the wrong line and only to find out again you were in the right line but you're in the back now.

They now have lines outside the casino\/mall for the guest list and hotel guests and make you walk up the fire escape stairs straight up three stories to the pool area first. That pretty much sucked for all the girls in heels. You can head into the main area but you have to pass the bouncer directing everyone up to the top before you come back down into the main dance area.

I don't even remember what time we got into the club, but it was insanely packed!!!! we all got separated and it was extremely dark to see where you were going. we finally made our way to a bar after 10 minutes or so, this was the main floor i believe? we decided to explore around and ended up on the roof top area. this place was also crowded, but since it was summer, it was HOT as hell. stayed there for a drink, then made our way back downstairs. 

i later realized the reason it was packed because they fenced off all the VIP area, therefore, making the dance floor SMALL. 

my group of 20 ended up chilling at the back bar where there was a lot of room (near the elevators). the drinks were the price i expected to pay for Vegas ($15 cranberry grey goose). bartender was nice and attentive, i assume because his bar wasn't as packed as the other ones.

There are gold Buddhas everywhere and about two rooms for dancing (not counting Tao Beach). The dancers are pretty good and they really get your booty shaking the whole night. The girls in the bathtubs are definitely eye candy for the guys. A couple guys were disappointed because the bathtubs near the entrance were empty the night we went. The restrooms are a little weird. They are located on the second floor. If you are in a stall, you feel as if everyone can see you. But, they really can't. 

This club can get very, very crowded on the weekends. If you want to see the decor without people yelling, passing out, and spitting game, then I suggest you make a reservation at the restaurant, eat, and go to the club early. The dance floors are tiny. There is no room to dance and you will constantly be shoved and elbowed due to the amount of people there. I do not recommend this place if you are claustrophobic. The music was just alright. Could've been better.

The layout of the club sucks ass.  It was super crowded, I didn't even have enough room to wiggle!  Kinda ruins the fun times as well when there's security screaming in your ear to move when there's no where to go!  No room for me to find guys to hustle drinks from.

On top of that, whereas other Vegas clubs have ventilation systems which allow the guests to relax at a comfortable temperature between 65 and 75 degrees throughout, Tao gets into the 90s and perhaps above. I personally don't know that many girls who go out to clubs in fully waterproofed makeup, but you WILL need it if you go to Tao.

Pros: They put the club entrance upstairs from the casino in the Venetian, so the gamblers don't have to trip over people waiting in line. Like all Vegas clubs, if you're an attractive lady, no line, no cover.

Cons: Too easy to lose your friends, waay too hot, overcrowded, and waaay too loud to even understand 2 words screamed into your ear. No where to sit or stand that isn't a throughway for smoking drunk sweaty folk. It's a total meat market, a stinky rotting meat market.",3,0,1

Who would have thought that Asian themed club would discriminate Asians? We were shunned by bartenders for no reason and couldn't get a drink. Avoid this club at all cost and go to better club like Hakassan, XS or Omnia. 

First of all, the Venue looks like darker version of P.F. Chang's and music was kinda out of trend. Not much of EDM. More of top charts from  90's to 10's, ranging from pop to hiphop. The vibe and crowd were pretty ghetto. The only reason why we came here was because we were staying at Venetian and wanted to check out the closest venue. We arrived early at 10 pm and we decided to get some drinks, hoping for better DJ to show up later. There were about 2~3 groups before us and we all patiently waited for a bartender. With ID, credit card, and cash ready on my hand, I thought someone will come soon. But nothing happened for 10 minutes. 

There was a male bartender who was right front of us, making drinks and calculating bills for other patrons. I started to have bad feeling when he refused make any eye contacts with any of us. He took extra effort by looking beyond us, staring at the ceiling at some point while making drinks front of us. I hoped my instinct was wrong but it became obvious that we were being ignored purposely because he did not answer any of our questions about drinks and happy hours. Then decided to serve the group that arrived later than us. I even told him we were here before but he didn't seem to care. 

After wasting time on him, I went after for female bartender who was next to him and she also managed to ignore us for good 5 minutes until all of us waved cards at her. Thankfully she responded to our call but then acted like she couldn't understand any of our words and treated us as if we were foreigners. I simply asked her if I can get 2 mojitos and 1 martini and she kept saying ""what?"" even though I know how to speak Spanish. After several attempts, she told me the bar doesn't carry mojito. I immediately realized this was BS because we had a dinner at TAO restaurant downstairs and saw other people having mojito. I understand the restaurant and club bar is separate business and might have different menu but what kind of bar does not have mojito? I even checked yelp reviews! These bartenders just did not want to see us at all. But for what reason? I do not know what we did wrong except for being only Asian girls around the bar. 

Then I asked her question about happy hours and drinks menu and she said the bar just ended the happy hour. Both male and female bartender knew we waited for them very long. What infuriated us the most was that they both smirked after seeing our shocked expression and female bartender immediately went to other customers without asking any further question to us, as if we were not worth of business. We left the club immediately after this horrendous encounter with bartenders. 

I've been to many other clubs and bars and this was by far the worst experience ever. We all felt discriminated and that feeling ruined our entire night in Vegas. Please educate your bartender and other staffs and treat people equally. After leaving this club, I read reviews from other yelpers and I think it is no coincident certain people are giving a low ratings. Don't be fooled by fancy Venetian Hotel. The club inside is not classy at all.",3,0,0

I worked in San Francisco's club scene for almost three years, so I have to say that as far as aesthetics, my expectations of Tao were definitely surpassed. Located in the Venetian, it is a beautiful setting, with an Asian theme, ""live"" statues [even a woman bathing in rose petals above one of the bars] and walls that don't make you feel like you'll contract herpes by leaning on them unlike some of the places I used to work at. However, looks aren't everything. Half the people in this venue couldn't dance, and that also applies to the go-go dancers next to the DJ booth. They were still ugly after about 5 drinks, which leads me to my next conclusion: either the drinks here are not strong enough, or they need to find better looking dancers who can actually dance. I'm not that superficial of a person [75% of the time], but this is Las Vegas - for all the money that comes in and out of this city, everything is supposed to be beautiful.

The reason I like it is because Tao offers a little bit of variety in music. It's not all EDM like in Marquee & Hakkasan's main rooms. It plays hip hop, top 40, club mash-ups and electronic music and I like the change of pace. I feel it's needed... Of course it all depends on the DJs and some of our friends from HS in the Los Angeles area are the ones that provide the soundtrack to those memorable Vegas nights at TAO. DJ Skratchy is a friend from HS and we all support the venues he spins at and he used to spin at Tao and Tao beach in the past. He's a resident DJ at some of the best clubs in Hollywood, Miami and Las Vegas I wish they would book him more at TAO cause the music he spins is great. Cant lie, I'm biased but let how the crowd moves to the music be your proof. My favorite Vegas DJ.

Saturday night resident DJ Vice is also a friend from HS and his reputation speaks for itself. He brings energy and definitely moves the crowd. You gotta see him for yourself. He plays it all and his timing is impeccable. Definitely a master at his craft.

I recommend getting bottle service to have a real memorable Vegas experience at TAO. Anywhere from the side room, balcony, main dancefloor, walkway and elevated sections will have different pricing. My friends and I have gotten bottle service several times and it's been classic. That's definitely the way to go. Regular pay line will have you waiting a long time. Either get on a guest list, get there super early, of course get bottle service or be a hotel guest. Those are the easiest ways to get in without too much hassle. Bring your patience. Money talks. This is Vegas.

The food was incredibly expensive, but it was delicious. I had lobster dumplings and pad thai, both were great. My friends all ordered the sea bass or the fillet Mignon. I forced them to let me have a bite and they were also amazing. Dessert was the lava cake, chocolate spring rolls and fortune cookie, and even though I was full I forced myself to keep eating. 

Our waiter was funny and had good recommendations about the menu. So yeah. Dining there hit my wallet, but made my tummy so happy.

Our dinner reservation included ""priority"" entrance to the club upstairs. The club made no party of me happy. 

I'd wager 90% of the club's real estate is devoted to bottle service. I don't know if having bottle service would make this place more fun or not, because we didn't want it. We were in Vegas for a bachelorette party and just wanted to go club hopping and have the ""whoooo, we're going dancing in Vegas!"" experience. 

Incidentally, you cannot have that experience at Tao, because Tao is where the ""Whoooo we're going dancing"" feeling goes to die. 

The non bottle service areas belong to overcrowded hallways and a tiny little dance floor. The logistics of the floor are so genius that to exit Tao, you must cross the dance floor. Looking for an exit strategy to get across is akin to what I think Moses felt when he first looked at the Red Sea: ""how the eff do I get across this thing?!"" 

It's an awful set up not only for people looking to run away to a better club, but also for those who decide to squeeze onto the dance floor to actually dance. Be prepared for these inevitabilities: You will get someone shoved into you as if you were in a mosh pit. A girl will step on your feet with her heels. You will smashed up against your friends and strangers in such close proximity it could be labeled as ""extremely intimate.""

It took all the savoir faire and coolness I could muster to not let my mouth fall open in disbelief and then whip out my Cybershot when I saw who we were dining with. Our small party sipped on Ace of Spades (Armand de Brignac) champagne and nibbled on chicken satay, shrimp skewers , sushi, dumplings,  spring rolls and other delicious treats before heading over to the nightclub to really get down.

This gigantic mega-club was packed to capacity (according to the DJ, 7000 strong), a first for the club and apparently any club in LV. We were set up at a table and waitresses, whose attire can only be described as ""bordello chic"",  brought over more Ace of Spades plus Belvy--let the bottle poppin' begin.

When we first got into the club, we tried to order drinks at the bar. There were definitely a lot of people trying to get drinks but the bartender was just flat-out rude to us. He kept making it seem like he was going to take our order and then just somewhat smirked and walked away. 20 minutes of this and another friend managed to find another bartender who didn't feel like being such an a-hole.

Then, we headed out to the dance floor which was INSANELY PACKED (felt like a mosh pit) even though the music was not that good. Even trying to get off the dance floor was a disaster as there were so many people pushing in so many directions. My friend got hurt by an elbow in the face. 

The highlight of Tao was finding out that the daytime Tao Beach area tranformed into part of the club at night. That outdoor area was much nicer but the crowd was still not great and, even on the pool deck, the bouncer quickly insisted that we put our shoes back on. We did see a few (1 guy and then 3 girls) fall over the ropes and into the smaller pool which was somewhat entertaining (since they were not hurt but just amused) but even this was not enough to make for a successful or fun clubbing experience.",11,7,8

Tao was the perfect example of why i prefer avoiding them. First is the politics of getting in. We had some friends who worked their connections to get our group in for free, but we were the lucky ones. The usual $20-25 cover charge and long line make going to this (and any vegas club) daunting. I could drink at the hotel bar with no cover charge and probably have a better time.

Second is the crowd. Tao takes up two floors -- first floor is the traditional night club with multiple rooms containing bars and dance floors. We decided to opt out of buying bottle service and because we didn't, we were stuck with fighting through the crowds. Forget dancing... You would need space for that and apparently space is only given to those who can afford bottle service. 

The second floor is the ""Tao Beach"" which is basically the roof deck with outdoor lounging areas, pool and bar. It was our preferred location because it was less crowded, but because it was still 100+ degrees in the evening... it wasn't the most ideal place to hang out.

The inside is very asian-themed. I remember it being dark and red silhouettes. Also a section with tons of candles(?) which is nice to take pictures. There are bathrooms upstairs and you can see people's shadows through the doors. I like how there are sinks inside your stall.

One of the human equivalents for that is going to a really popular club like Tao. If you're a guy and you're partying in Vegas with mostly guys, good luck getting into Tao without bottle service or knowing someone important. Like they do on the Discovery Channel, the flashiest males (aka guys willing to spend money) are the ones who get in.

On our first night in Vegas, my friends, and I decided to go to Tao. When we get to the line for the guestlist, we see one of many bouncers turn away a group of nicely dressed guys. The same bouncer approaches us and asks how many people we have. Pretty normal question. Then he asks, ""What's the group dynamic?"" 

What do you mean what's the dynamic? ""Um, Jenny, Helen, and I have been friends since high school. We're super close! Sophia is Helen's sister, but she hates Jenny... What? Ohhh! You mean the girl to guy ratio!!""

Luckily we had 4 hot girls and 3 guys, so the bouncer let us get in line. Once we get inside, they force us to follow a long line of people up 5 flights of stairs to the roof (Tao Beach). Then we have to get back in line to get downstairs to the main dance floor. This is a pretty annoying form of crowd control, but I guess they have to do what they have to do. The rest of the night was pretty typical of most clubs.

Here's a rundown:
Pros:
- go-go dancers covered with rose petals dancing in bathtubs (better if there were guys too)
- good music
- cool decor
- a few different rooms to dance in

Cons:
- watered down expensive alcohol
- super crowded
- super hot
- expensive cover for guys if you're not with girls and don't have a promoter coupon

1. It's located in the Venetian..my favorite hotel!
2. It's huge - one main room on the 2nd floor, a smaller lounge room on the the 2nd floor, a lavish rooftop area open during the spring and summer (Tao Beach),  and a lounge on the first floor (part of the restaurant). 
3. Bars - lots to choose from! 
4. Seating - i'm a girly- girl, i pay the price and wear killer stilettos when I know i shouldn't. So finding places to sit is always good. I usually never have that problem here!
5. Bouncers - they're tolerable, unlike most places! I lost my blackberry at Tao during my last romp and kept bugging the heck out of some of the bouncers the rest of the night. I was drunk, and they were nice to me. =) 
6. Decor - it's unlike anything you'll see elsewhere. From the giant Buddha statue to the hundred buddha statues behind one of the bars, to the girls sitting in bathtubs full of rose petals. 
7. Music - With 3 rooms playing different beats you're bound to find something you like. 
8. Bathroom - the ladies' stalls are crazy. Glass doors that fog up when you lock them. You'll have to see it to know what i'm talking about. If the line isn't moving fast enough for you, go downstairs and use the one in the restaurant. Usually there's hardly any wait. 
9. Beautiful people - enough said!
10. It's a restaurant too! - Make a reservation for dinner and stay til past 10 to get into the club without waiting in the huge line. If you're a group of girls you get into the club easily but they might ask you to pay $20 each. If you're in a mixed group, same deal, just make sure the guys don't outnumber the girls.

It was about 2am when my friend Gina invited me to stop at the club for a drink. Since it was a Thursday and Vegas was totally dead I thought we'd give it a shot.

We get to the club and there's maybe 10 people on line.. We're 4 guys in Hugo Boss suits just looking to meet my friend to have a drink.. We're not douchebags at all.. A very low key group.. We get on line as it's moving pretty fast and one of the insecure model wannabe security guards makes us walk all the way to the back of the line.. At that point he says there's no way we're getting in without bottle service. Dude, it's 2am and the place is dead.. Seriously? If I wanted bottle service I wouldve come to the club earlier.. He was super rude and a massive asshole. He spoke to me like I was a child who just stole a cookie from the cookie jar.. By far, the worst experience I ever had getting into a nightclub in Vegas.. Tonight I have a table at Haze and tomorrow at Moon.. Fuck you Toa!",3,5,2

I typically like to make my way to the smaller rooms and avoid the main area due to crazy overcrowding. I love the decor of the club; it's very enticing. But overall, Tao has become an overhyped disappointment.

The overcrowding is comparable to PURE at Caesar's Palace. It's gotten to the point where it's practically unbearable. Couple the overcrowding with trying to navigate the multi-floor maze that is Tao and you're in for a headache. I do like that they have Tao Beach for those who need some air but trying to find it is a real pain. The music is ok and the crowd... meh. I can't believe they let anybody in, especially if you're wearing an Ed Hardy shirt (but I guess that goes for any guy in Vegas who doesn't have his own style but wants to fit in). So much for the upscale dress code.

Each time I've gone to Tao, I was a hotel guest at the Venetian (otherwise generally be prepared to WAIT a while). I've only had to pay cover once but the other times I've been to Tao, I've had complimentary passes. I can honestly say that I'll be avoiding Tao from now on, regardless of whether or not I stay at the Venetian again.

Bottom line: Try XS instead.",0,0,0

Next,  You are in Vegas - There are maybe three to four good clubs here - please realize this and don't complain about the over crowdedness - If you want a place to bond with your friends than go party in the Stratosphere - It will be sooo quiet you can hear your friends think...


As for Toa I have never made a reservation, I have never called in advance and I have never waited longer than 20-30 min.   

It's very simple you walk to the front,  tell the guy you want to get a table and thank him with a small sum in the palm of your hand!!!  yes that is what you should do.

As for the club, great sound system, great venue, if you take care of the bartender on your first round he or she will take care of you on the following rounds.  If you get a table than you should have enough drinks to last you though the night.

I will admit that it is rather hard to find a place to dance however they do have a separate area for the people who get tables and they also have a house room which is less crowded...

We had a reservation for a VIP skybox on Halloween.  When we arrived to check in, Brian informed us that he did not have a skybox for us stating that the reservation had been cancelled.  I showed him my cellphone, which had the Tao VIP reservation confirmation which had been made for us by Robert, Tao's VIP host.  Brian got angry, rolled his eyes and walked my party to the back of a long line and told us to wait here.  After about an hour, a lady came and told us our table was ready. I asked if the table was the skybox and I was told that , ""it was the best table in the house"".  I repeated my question because it was obvious that we were getting the runaround. Again, no answer to my question.  
It was interesting because one would think that since Tao had messed up my reservation, they would be courteous and apologetic but instead they were snotty, rude, arrogant and condescending.
They proceeded to walk us to our location which turned out to be in the middle of a throng of dancing people. The location would sit one or two people at most.  It was not the skybox we had reserved nor the location that we were told we would be located.  We had reserved the balcony skybox at the end, away from the crowds.
I requested to see a manager and the cocktail waitress said that she wouldn't help us and walked away.  I walked up to another Tao employee and asked to see a manager. Someone returned a few minutes later and I explained the issue and he told me that there were no skyboxes available.  I told him that this was not my reservation and asked him to return my license to me and that we were leaving. He then said that they had a skybox available but that it would cost me $15,000.  I said that was interesting since my reservation was for $2,000.  I then showed him my cellphone confirmation reflecting both the price and location.  I couldn't believe the bait and switch that this nightclub was trying to pull. And now suddenly my skybox was available but for a $13,000 increase.  These people were unbelievable.  
I was there with my daughter and several work colleagues.  This was embarrassing.
At this point, one would think this debacle couldn't get any worse but it does.  While waiting for Tao to return my drivers license so we could leave, an employee informs me that my party would need to move because we were no longer VIP's and needed to vacate the area.   So we moved out of the area whereby another Tao employee tapped me on the shoulder and told me we were blocking the cocktail waitress.  
Obviously they had blacklisted us and told Tao staff to harass us. Wow, not only no apology for messing up our reservation but a concerted effort to embarrass and humiliate us.  Bait and switch, harassment, rudeness, arrogance and incompetence.  It must be nice to have so much business that you feel inclined to treat your customers in such a reprehensible manner.",17,1,1

What I like most is how if you get a VIP table, you get to sit UP HERE, while all the rest of the people (the ugly ones) have to stand over there.  See what I mean?  You're sitting HERE, behind a little barrier, and then there are other less deserving people (I like to call them ""eaters"") over THERE.  For that subtle distinction you pay an amount equivalent to a laborer's annual wage in India.  Sweet.

Seriously though I am giving Tao two stars instead of one because it is a bit hipper design than the other big casino nightclubs, in its materialistic Buddhist (er that's a fundamentally contradictory theme yes?) way.  Lots of earth tones with the bling.  And the roided out bouncers are a bit less ogre-ish.  Still I can't believe people fall for this crap.  Standing in line waiting patiently to be a**raped sucks.

The entire night liquor pours, we're feelin the beats, security at our side, and all the while never having our mixers less than halfway full.  They were on top of it.  Everytime our group left to explore, our bottles were immediately placed in the back, and brought back out to us when we returned.

Even with guestlist, free passes and wrist bands, we still waited a solid TWO hours to enter the club. The bouncers told us, point blank, that if we hadn't brought our boyfriends, we'd be in the door right away. 'Nuff said.

50 Cent arrived around 1 a.m. and, after a quick photo-op, I'm quite certain he went through the club, out the back door and left. He wasn't seen again for the rest of the night.

Yes, I understand that it was extremely busy.  It was the night of the Hudson sponsored MAGIC after party and there were a TON of people.  That being said, it does not give the staff any right to be as disorganized as they were.  

Even though we were on Hudson's MAGIC after party VIP list, there was a lot of confusion as to where we should go and who would be walking us in instead of waiting in the 5 lines that they had going (for whatever reason).  

Once we got inside, the drinks were NOT strong at all but they did take amazing care of the Hudson suite\/ table so that made it a little more pleasant.  One thing that WAS good was that the tables were pretty inexpensive at $375 for a bottle of decent vodka. 

 The decor was very Asian... not any particular one but just in general.  Pools of water with rose petals in them, girls massaging eachother, dancers on a platform above the dance floor.

We made a reservation early in the day, and i was informed that if we didn't all show up at 8.30pm then whoever made the reservation would be charged $25\/person.  We showed up around 8.15 and stood in the crowded bar\/lounge area in front waiting for our table to open up.  After a few 
rum and cokes, a pretty decent $10.50 mojito, a trip to the bathroom (guys are yang apparently) and 75minutes we were finally seated.  There were two bachelorette parties near our table to provide giddy squeals every few minutes over the down-tempo house that was being spun.  I ordered an overpriced pinot noir for $69 fairly rubbery anago and mediocre hamachi for $4 a piece.  The Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Peking Duck ($12) was worth it.  Not because it was amazing fried rice, but because I love duck, and it was filling.  So filling in fact that I wasn't able to consume the Japanese Seaweed Salad Sampler ($10) which had three kinds of seaweed that I'd never eaten before.  The one portion with the chile powder I could have done without though.  I heard from others at the table that the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings ($29) was delicious.
  Our servers were very patient and helpful during the meal, but my main gripe with this place was that after spending nearly $900 for the party, we were told that if we wanted to stay for the Lounge\/Club scene, we'd still have to pay the $20 cover.

It was New Years weekend, our last saturday in Vegas. Honestly we went to Tao as a backup. We didn't go to The first club because part of our crew beat us there and left, stating it was bad. In the process we ran into a promoter that got us tickets that let 3 ladies in for free per ticket and one guy for $15, which is a steal when you are talking about vegas on New Years weekend.  The only hitch for the night was that we had a lot of guys in our crew and only two girls. The bounce for the line originally turned us down until we had more ladies.  But finding girls to go with us was simple, especially when you are offering them free entry.  In the line we noticed a lady behind us that looked well into her 80s but I guess, rather I hope she was there for the restaurant.  When we got to the entrance, The decor was amazing!  Asian style and themes, with bathtubs lining the entrance hallway.  The food also smelled amazing, although we werent there to eat. Bathrooms were clean and beautiful, even as a guy you appreciate these things sometimes.  We went to the 2nd floor and both rooms had great music. Good transitions from Hip Hop to Top 40 to a little electro.  I will say this: A lot of the mixes were recycled. I only know because I DJ myself and I have heard them before and have them, but who cares, their purpose is to pack the dancefloor and that's what they did.  The drinks were pretty good and at 2 for $12 the shots tasted great.  Guys will love the fact that they have Gogo dancers who lie posed on display on reclining couches....SEXY.  Anyways it isn't hard to find girls to dance with though it will get a bit packed.  We didn't have bottle service but those who did appeared to be getting the royal treatment, so that will be our next mission when coming to Tao.  We ended up having a lot of fun, it turned out to be our best night in Vegas and I definitely recommend that Tao is on your agenda for your visit to Vegas.",0,0,0

We came here for a huge bachelor party last weekend on Saturday Labor Day Weekend.  Got about the most premium bottle service you could get.  The tables next to the slightly elevated dance floor, velvet roped.

Full disclosure: I was kicked out for falling asleep for 20 minutes at our table, never to be let back in, so I'm a bit biased, but I'll get to that story later (and about how there was blood on the railing of the back stairs where they kick people out - a little disconcerting if you ask me - b\/c it was probably from another patron).  I come to Vegas to celebrate a friend's and have a good time - not to get into a kickboxing match with a bouncer who feels the need to power trip.

Asian brothers, or my brothers with Yellow fever, this is not the place anymore.  Just giving you the inside track.  Come here and find out for yourself, or take my word for it. Up to you.  (You know the other couple juggernauts that have taken over now - go to them).  Wish someone had told us - since we came with 25 (!) Asian guys mostly.  (And we know our white sisters are not exactly throwing themselves all over us Asian guys, now let's be honest.  :)  All good)).

This place still gets packed.  So you will still have the same music and same massive number of people.  A few things have changed though:

1) Waitresses not hot.  Sorry, I know this is mean, but I say it also to give you an indication of the direction this club is heading.  The stunners (which are fun to look at at least) have moved to nicer clubs in Vegas where they get top dollars and tips.  That means this place Tao is now starting to get empty tables with no bottle service b\/c the nicer crowds and hence big or loose spenders are going elsewhere.  Means less money for Tao, less money for waitresses - so they all go elsewhere.

2) Service here was not good.  Used to be a couple years ago the bouncers here would actually help you out with whatever you wanted.  Bring people over, kick people out, literally at your beck and call.  Not anymore.  Instead they will kick you out if you fall asleep at your OWN table where you paid $XXX per person.  I'm not talking about $100 mind you, trust me, it was a LOT.  More than I've ever spent in one night clubbing and definitely NOT worth it.  I mean, I know falling asleep for 20 minutes does not look good, but neither do your waitresses, so why don't you kick them out?  At least give me some leniency after you've fully woken me up and clearly seen that I'm stone cold sober and wide awake.  Hey, I had a long all day at Aria Liquid lounge pool party, cut me some slack.  Terrible way to treat your supposed patrons at your most VIP table.  Plus it's on my credit card, I should've refused to pay.  But a deal's a deal.  Even if it sucked, it sucked.  You win this time.  Ok, so then the bouncers coax me away from table and out our velvet roped area (my mistake in agreeing to leave our area to 'talk to him').  Then he and the other big bouncer lifted me by both elbows (note: I'm stone cold sober - assholes and injustice will sober me up real quick) and it's only 1:30am btw).  They started getting real rough with me.  Then they lifted me up one on each side by my elbows with my feet dangling, meanwhile other patrons are like 'what the fu*k is going on?'.  Then they carry me against my will outside, instead of asking nicely or letting me walk myself out.  Outside the back orange stairwell, I have to wait 45 minutes for my credit card.  Meanwhile, most disturbing is I see blood on the railway of that back stairway.  I finally ask the bouncer what happened, he said one of their guys and a patron.  Who started it, I have no clue.  All I'm saying guys, is be careful.  These guys are rough and do not fu*k around.  They will kick your ass if you give them a reason to.  To be fair, they will probably not take a first swing.  So keep your emotions in check and don't let it get the best of you - or you will be the next person to spill your own blood that night on the railway of their 'supposedly video-monitored' back stairwell (I emailed our 'host' and got a not terribly apologetic almost perfunctory copy-and-paste oh sorry you had a bad time reply).  

Goodbye Tao.  Nice knowing ya.  

P.S.  Tavern on the Green used to be the highest grossing restaurant.  Then you were.  Tavern on Green now closed for good.  I see a similar fate here.

P.S.S.  My friend warned me that Tao sucked now, empty tables everywhere, but I wasn't part of the planning process, so I really had no sway.  Plus we had so many good times here in years past that I thought it couldn't have changed *that* much.  Well, unfortunately it has.",3,2,1

It is extremely small, barely any dancing room without getting pushed and shoved around. The workers there are extremely rude and will shout vulgarities and curse words at anyone.

TABLES:
Trust me, the ""promoters"" will promise you a table, but go back on their word. Don't waste your time here and just go to a better nightclub.

They have dancers flying through the sky to those with table service delivery bottles of liquor.  Going to Tao is an experience and one not to be missed if you are in Las Vegas.

Ladies my suggestions are:

#1. Check it out on a Friday night and take advantage of the free drink wristbands if available

#2.  Make sure you have made contact with a promoter prior to your trip so you can get your party in for free

#3.  Get there early so you can get your groove on before the club gets crowded (and it does get crowded!)

#4.  If your pockets are deep enough, spring for the bottle service.  You won't be sorry.

I'm not saying that as a bitter partier who had to wait hours in line while the asshole security guards went on their power-trips.  (Seriously though...the line outside went on for miles!)  We got hooked up and actually got in within a few minutes, but I soon came to the conclusion that I would've rather stayed outside in line...at least I could breathe out there.  

1.  The narrow stairways leading to the second story dance floor and the rooftop lounge were always packed!  We started out at the bottom, excited to see what awaits us atop this famous club...Within a minute of reaching the top, we turned around and pushed our way back down the stairs, eager to escape the extreme cold of the rooftop and the disgusting humidity of the dance floor.  What a waste.

2.  I'm giving it 2 stars because the lounge downstairs was actually pretty nice...and their drinks were strong, so that's always a plus.

My friend was able to get us on the guestlist which gave us free admission before 12am.  A piece of advice for a bunch of dudes trying to get in...bring girls with you, or you will be waiting to get in for a reaaaaally long time.  We got there at about 11:15pm on a Saturday night, and looking at the line I thought there was no way we were getting in by 12am.  There was 2 lines, one was the regular line, and the other was guestlist, you can also get a bunch of friends together and try to get in faster by buying bottle service.  Surprisingly the guestlist line moved pretty quickly and we were in before 11:45pm.  When you enter you are greeted by girls in bathtubs covered in rose petal pasties.  The first floor is more of the lounge and has plenty of seats and a big bar.  When you work your way up to the second floor there is the main dance floor and there is a back room that plays the music from the dance floor.  There is more eye candy with scantily dressed girls by the door, go-go dancers, and a couple of girls in a bathtub by the main dance floor.  My only major complaint is that for a place that packs in this many people, you think they would have more bars & bartenders.  The bar is seriously 5 deep, and if you order your better off getting a whole bunch of drinks to tide you over.  I do have to say that hands down this is one of the best clubs I have ever been to.  The music was great...DJ Vice was killing the set, and the vibe was very energetic.  They even had a guy come out and jam with a saxophone during the set.  And for some strange reason Blues Clues made a ""guest"" appearance...haha.

I have been here several times, but I did not realize behind the DJ booth there is an patio that overlooks the strip.  So if it gets too crowded inside you can step out there for a breather.

We started off having dinner here with a large group of people.  After arriving on time, we waited to be seated about 30 minutes which would have normally pissed me off, but I was feeling sick and had to go outside to get some fresh air so by the time I came back they were ready for us.

The food?  SO lackluster.  I was really, really looking forward to some decadent cod, maybe a little fresh Maguro ...but everything was underwhelming.  I'd never eat at the restaurant again.  Also, they didn't have enough chairs to accommodate our group, and a couple of my friends just gave up and went back to the Hard Rock to gamble.  I was shocked they didn't do more to help us out.

After finishing dinner, we headed over to the club upstairs.  You would think that after spending $2000 on dinner, they would comp us passes into the club?  Hell naw.  This is Vegas.  We all had to pay to get in, which caused about half our group to venture elsewhere because they knew that what they were about to pay for would be a disappointment.  I had never been, so I convinced a few to stay with me and we payed the cover and went inside.  

Now, my opinion of the club is in comparison to all of the other amazing Las Vegas clubs to choose from.  I thought the club was pretty lackluster as well.  It was big and the music was good, but besides that...I just didn't feel a connection with this place like I do Tryst or BodyEnglish.  It was a bit gimmicky, and their lack of customer service at the door and in the restaurant really turned me off.  I know I'm no high roller, but have we eliminated all customer service for regular patrons?! 

 I also remember that my friend got sick and they wouldn't let me in the fucking bathroom to help her, so she had to drunkenly fend for herself.  I guess thats her own fault, but still.  I know they're trying to prevent drug use, but the girl was vomiting on the floor for crying out loud.  I'm getting all riled up just thinking about it.

Skip Tao for dinner, and check out the club just to widen your knowledge.  It'll make you appreciate other clubs in Vegas even more.",4,3,1

I went to Tao 2 nights in a row (don't ask) and Saturday was def more packed than  Friday.  My friends and I scored on a booth Saturday with some really fun guys, and did most of our dancing there since the dance floor is PACKED. We attempted to get though the crowd and didn't even have to move, the crowd literally pushed us to the other side. And then...Timbaland's ""The Way I Are"" came on, foam comes down from the ceiling, the crowd goes wild!! It was insane and kinda scary.  

Not too sure about the girls in the tubs its a little weird I think to have people rubbing up on each other in still water...ew.

Annie from the restaurant side should be the mirror example of not only the restaurant but also the club side. If everyone acted like her, I'm sure our experience would have been much better. Long story short: a friend fell down the stairs but I was lucky enough to catch her before she hit the ground. However, she lost her shoes and cut her leg to where her entire leg was covered in blood. The bouncer who was covering the stairs and who this happened right in front of, did nothing. I continued to help her out and when we got to the front we asked another bouncer for a napkin or something to help. He said ""what am I supposed to do""... obviously I was frustrated with this answer so I expressed that and he was literally chest bumping me as It in challenging me. I didn't want any part of that so we left. However, being in the hotel industry for many years I understand that you cannot fix what you do not know is broken.

I went on a girls trip to Vegas and was able to get into Tao for free and with VIP every night.  Right to the front of the line, and walked right into a bar with free drinks from 10-11.  A lot of places offer these types of deals for women, and it's a deal that can't be beat.  Tipping $2 a drink for a well mixed is an amazing deal.  

The club is top notch and huge.  It does fill up fast and get kind of crazy on the weekends.  There are bouncers EVERYWHERE so it's nice to know that even though you're in a club, it's a pretty safe environment.  One night I took off my shoes because my feet hurt (I know this is a no-no) and the bouncers were on me like white on rice within 15 seconds!  The bathrooms are also pretty cool.  The glass on the door is clear, but then fogs up once you go in.  

If you go on a Friday or Saturday you will get to see women hanging from the ceiling doing acrobatic types of stuff and they also will dump glow sticks onto the dance floor which is fun!  Probably the biggest negative was the DJ.  The music could have been waaay tighter.  I'd say one out of every 3 songs played were danceworthy.  For Vegas I would have expected way better beats.

I would probably have given this place 5 stars if we didn't have to wait in line to get in.  I guess I have this unwritten rule in my head that if I'm with a group of girls (and we had a bachelorette to boot), I shouldn't have to pay or get in line to get into a club.  Maybe I'm just delusional or something, but hey, it worked for other clubs such as Lavo and LAX in Vegas, as well as random clubs in SF and Barcelona...maybe we're just not cool enough for this club. ;-)  

We were waiting in line for a little while when we realized there were 2 other lines that were moving faster than us.  Turns out the slightly faster line was for the guestlist, and the fastest line was for hotel guests!  Doh!  We flashed our room key from the Venetian and we were in in no time!  At least we got the other half of the deal and we didn't have to pay to get in...otherwise I probably would have given up on this place.

Once we were in, the experience was so much better.  As soon as we got to the bar, some guy already bought us drinks.  When we came back for more, we had no trouble getting another couple of rounds.  The bartenders much better and more efficient, and we hardly had to wait to get a drink (unlike at Lavo), and this place had a much larger crowd too.

After a few drinks in the lounge, we were off to the dance floor and had a blast dancing the night away.  The music was great and they had good variety.  The bar in the club area was really good too...we asked the bartender chick for a couple shooters that were ""cold and refreshing, but girly"" and she asked us if we liked blueberry waffles.  A couple yummy berry shots later, we were back on the dance floor having the time of our lives.  We even got some ice water to quench our thirst instead of that pricey Voss stuff.

Also, I gotta say, I thought their restrooms were pretty cool with the glass that goes from clear to opaque when you lock the door.  I saw that once on HGTV and it was fun to see it in person (Ok, I'm a dork and the littlest things can entertain me!).  I prob can't appreciate it as much as the boys, but I thought the go-go dancers here were better-looking than those in other clubs, and the bathtub chicks were very nice in letting us take their picture.

PROS:
1. Attentive vip entrance (I waited less than a minute)
2. Lavish and fun service 
3. Size\/layout
4. Multiple music channels in well separated areas
5. Sexy staff.

CONS:
1. The hallway monitors are worse than Catholic private school.  I nearly got tazered for helping the beautiful girl I met pick up her dropped clutch in between rooms.
2. The main dance floor had a circa 1997 rave going on with B-list celebrity hosts.
3. The design theme is generic and not well suited for the Venetian.  What was there concept meeting like?
""We've all seen pretty girls in rose petal bath tubs lining the entrance to some disco.. right?  But never before have you seen 16 BATH TUBS!!!
We've all seen a candle light lit Buddha head in a bar.. yeah.. you with me??  BUT - NOT - A - HUNDRED CANDLE LIT BUDDHA HEADS!!!"".
    whooooaaa there Waste Yonivich!
Yeah for excess!  It's Vegas.  We built this shit! 
I get it.. really.. the magnitude of architectural achievements (and buffets at the Wynn) is what we all come for, but that doesn't excuse you (TAO owners) of your responsibility to keep it creatively bewildering.  

Next time, hire a young designer- with his\/her imagination still intact.

PURE is always more fun, and has a MUCH sexier, better dressed crowd.  You just may want to avoid the main dance floor... (read my review of PURE)

We would have ended up spending wayy more than 1500 but didnt want to be confined into one small area of such a large club.

So after waiting in line, this one bald dude held a group of us ""prisoners"" in front of the entrance, behind the ropes. All in all, it was an hour wait.

-After getting through the main entrance (which was freakn crowded that a girl fell and almost got her dress and hair caught on FIRE from the candles), we had to walk up 4 flight of stairs to the dance floor. WHY ARE THERE EVEN STAIRS? people can slip and fall! esp. drunk people!

-the dance floor was ridiculously crowded! it was beyond packed! people were pushing, shoving, and talking smack to each other. I think you have to have muscles to push people aside if you want to get by. the floor was disgusting and sticky from all the spilled alcohol. I just couldn't enjoy it. There was seriously no personal space.

I guess I just came on a bad night. Jay-Z was guest appearing, so maybe that's why the club was suffocating everyone. 

If you've paid online at vegas.com, prepare to wait in line at TAO. Apparently paying online is a new thing they're trying out, so the TAO employees don't know what to do when you show them your printed ticket. GIRLS- be careful with those heels! It's slippery there AND people step on your toes.

The club is large and has several levels, a huge dance floor and a few different rooms to explore.  Not to mention Tao Beach that they managed to slap on the last couple of years.  It ended up just being an extra line to stand in getting in and out of Tao Beach.

Tao, to me, is an overrated, over-crowded club that isn't worth the hassle.  There are TONS of promoters for the club...and if you manage to walk around the Venetian during the day without getting hassled by one, I'll give you $1.  I think the endless lines and lists and eager club goers to get into this club is because of the promoters and the name itself.  So bravo! The people over at Tao accomplished what they were going for.  However, aside from the cool Asian-influenced decor and the HOT rose petal girls sitting in bath tubs, nothing else makes the club super worthwhile.

The dance floor was a nightmare. Don't get me wrong, I had a good time, but there were SO MANY BODIES. And a couple incidents. Like some nearby rando definitely snuck his hand under my skirt and then smirked to his friend about it. And I got cornered by this black guy who wanted to do the most ridiculous dancing ever.

There were crazy lights and if I remember correctly maybe even bubbles floating down from time to time. That and I was really feeling the music.

He was all butt-hurt and walked away and I didn't even have the energy to feel bad about it. LOL oh well.

Now, before all of you start protesting that we should've dropped $$ on table service and whatnot, I should mention that table service would've made no difference whatsoever in my review of this nightclub. Read on, and observe.

We get there at 10:30 because the guy that ""essentially runs the place"" had put me on the guestlist (to quote my good friend, ""A vagina gets you anywhere in Vegas"" - so true). Pretentious bouncers (+1 for bouncer ""Vanilla Ice"" who obviously was not as cool as the other guys, but trying to act like it) wouldn't let us in because we had a bad ratio (5:3), which is understandable. What is NOT understandable is that all the lines were guestlist only until at least midnight, even though the guestlist line was about the length of my foot. So even though there were maybe 50 people in line, we were basically told we wouldn't be let in even if we waited in the regular admission line (which there wasn't any), EVEN if all the guestlist line emptied up. So the two guys in our party sacrificed themselves to go gamble in the casino, and consequently won a couple hundred bucks while we were stuck waiting in a line with some pretentious jacka-er, bouncer, running the 10 people line.

Once inside, the place was SO packed there were sweaty elbows pushing up against me while trying to get to the bathroom. It didn't help that there was some beached whale of a girl trying to block our way through the crowd because she was convinced we were cutting (into what, the dance floor?) so that we could finally go to the bathroom. 

Took forever to get a drink, and to top it off, drinks were weak (and I'm a 3-shot limit girl). Music was pretty good, but the dance floor was PACKED. I've been in my fair share of packed dance floors, but the two tiny dancefloors here weren't even big enough for 100 people. Seems like Tao spent all their money on the decor and half-naked chicks, but forgot to build a large enough dancefloor.

So to get back to the earlier table service comment - if we had dropped $2k on three bottles of alcohol, we STILL would've not had a space to dance in. What's the point of spending $$ in a club, only to not be able to move around? If I wanted to sit and drink, I would've gone to a lounge.

Supposedly our night would've been better if Tao Beach had been open, but seeing as how the only way I would go back is if JT became my bestie and convinced me to go with him, I won't be testing out that theory anytime soon.

My friend and I pretty much had it with this place after 20 minutes, and left the club. Since we had gotten the stamp, we decided to come back later at about 2am to see if it got any better, and guess what? It didn't. Still as packed, still as full of creeps, and still as much suck as before.

So if you're here with a bunch of girls only, give it a shot since you won't have to wait in line or pay cover. But if you're a bunch of guys trying to hit on girls to join the line with you, don't bother. Take your hard-earned cash and go hit up another club. Normally I'd recommend table service to get in to a club, but please take your $2k and go to Tryst and enjoy a night of fun there.

When you think of Vegas you think of trendy clubs serving the best with beauty's all around. You think of opening a playboy and seeing all those girls in a fancy club. THAT is Tao. Ms. Graham and I always do bottle service when we go to Vegas. We only go to clubs once or twice a year, so what the hell. My first experience at the club was standing in line. WHAT? I know. I really didn't expect a line for bottle service either. A pretty short line but still a line. For an experience that cost us around $550.00. 

Let me explain the $550.00. My understanding was that the bottle was the cost of the table and that would be it with the exception of the tip. Our bottle cost $360.00 or so which kind of confused me. I assumed that the additional $200.00 was tax and tip. On top of that I tipped the security guy $60.00 to make sure that another guy didn't come sit next to Ms.Graham while I went to the bathroom like it happened while I went the first time. I also didn't like people walking by and dropping off their empty cups on my table too. I even saw a girl grab a handful of ice from our bucket out of the corner of my eye. The problem was that our table was on the top deck and was right next to stairs to a bar. We had alot of traffic that I really didn't want or expect at a VIP table.  The dancing was great and the music was awesome.  The atmosphere in the dancing area seemed nice, but it was really too dark to enjoy.  Would I go again? Maybe.  But not for $550.00 and not if I had the same table.",0,0,0

- Guest list + 1:1 ratio + correct dress code (jeans, collared shirt, dress shoes) + getting there around 9:45 = free cover! Otherwise its $20 (not too unreasonable). Just get there early and don't slack off for prepartying or eating. 

- Go with cool female friends. If you're all cool they'll spot you drinks during open bar. Last weekend one girl got drinks for our whole group (6 guys). Didn't pay for any drinks and only minor prepartying required. 

- Main dance area is crazy nice for dancing even when crowded, back rooms are darker and great for chilling and meeting random friends! Overall club is on the darker\/mystic side just fyi.

- DJ is good, never been disappointed with the music here. Gets my blood flowing and gets everyone pumped up.

- If the entrance stamp washes off, tell the bouncer and they'll let you get a new one so you can come back in and out. Be courteous with them and they'll respect you.

- Be safe, walk to the club or dish out for a cab fare so everyone gets home safely =)

Good luck and see you on the dance floor!",3,2,2

Kim K.'s birthday.  Lines out the door, spilling out over several entrances.  Promoter friend to the rescue.  Got escorted to separate line, all girls, no cover.  Free well drinks before 11:00.  I couldn't complain, given the situation.

After drinks, got escorted into roped off, VIP area (to the side of the main dance floor).  Even with that, Tao was packed to the brim.  I was not having a great time.  Neither was the bachelorette.

This past weekend we celebrated my best friend's 'Last Fling Before the Ring' - though it was just the four of us, it was a ton of fun. 

Our first day walking the Strip, we managed to get all of the hookups that 4 beauties deserve. We managed to meet a promoter Marc, who hooked us up for both nights. We ventured out to Tao, our second night in Vegas. 

Tao was poppin' - ladies were given bands for open bar access for a couple hours. That meant 3-4 Bay Breezes on the house. We walked around and found Tao Beach upstairs. A little hot because of the desert, but would be fun to sit there in the pool to get rid of a hangover ;)

We met some cool gentlemen from the Bay and because we decked out the bride-to-be in an awesome 'Soon to Be.."" Sash and veil - we got our picture taken by every guy who passed us by. 

The music was really good and the dance floor was packed, but not difficult to bust a move in. All of my girlfriends had a bomb diggity time and I'd like to back again. It doesn't hurt we barely paid for drinks and didn't have to pay cover.

Both times I've come here, there were lines out the door.  Even at midnight, the lines were still around the corners.  I think the cover is $20 but we got in free.  Yay for being ladies.

Tao plays great music - 80's, 90's, rap, hip-hop and rock (old & new school) and more lounge-y type, slower tunes in the other room.  I like the main room better because of the energy.  The other room was playing a lot of slower hip hop, and it made me tired.  

Of course you can't ignore the ladies wearing pasties in the tubs in the front, or the other ladies rubbing up on each other in their lingerie on the way in.  Or the ladies in the bathtub doing both of those at the same time in the main room.  And of course you can't ignore the guys staring at them with their mouths gaping, either.  The crowd is mixed here. some beauties, some uglies, mostly young (20-something crowd) and like Chosen says, the go go dancers are hot.

Smoking patio is cramped.
Some guys are douchey\/pushy\/grabby (that's every club, though, right?)

Yup, just another Saturday night at Tao. 

We went in around 12am and it was free because we were on the guest list.  Earlier in the day we had found a promoter on the sidewalk near the Venetian and he gave us free passes. All we needed to do was text him our names and we would be on the guest list for the night. Yay for freebies! =)
We got in line and waited maybe 10 minutes or so. We had a pretty good ratio too, three girls and one guy. Once you get in, the main dance floor is on the second level. There is a third level too, but people are mostly standing up there. I actually wish I hung out on the first level more. Way MORE space to move around\/dance\/hang out. Music isn't as good as the second level though.

Half of the main dance floor is roped off for VIPs. The rest of us get squished on this super packed danced floor. The DJ was pretty good though, spinning a lot of current hits that we can dance to. They have confetti spewing over the dance floor at various times of the night, and scantily clad girls dancing on a ledge above the dance floor too. There was also a girl doing acrobatics above the dance floor every once in awhile. It was all very interesting and added to the fun vibe of this place. Oh and in regards to drinks, they have girls come around the dance floor and offer buy one get one free ""shots"". We got 4 shots for $24. And they weren't really shots. The shot tasted like a sugary sex on the beach, and wasn't very strong. I didn't even get my Asian glow, and I'm pretty sensitive! =P Not worth it. 

The bouncers are like ninjas here, so don't start crap at this club. There was a fight barely starting to break out in front of us. No physical altercation could even occur before the bouncer flew in and scooped out one of the guys. The guy was totally taken off the dance floor and shoved out a back door in less than 10 seconds. It was that quick. The cleanup crew was on the same spot mopping up the spilled drinks and everything was fine again in a minute. Props to security for keeping the drunk douche bags in check!

Men were friendly and chatted\/bought us drinks. All and all a great time. 

This time around, we were physically crushed. I couldn't even move my arms while dancing because people were squeezing THAT tightly. INSANE. Music wasn't bad, but the pushing really ruined the entire experience. Guys shoved their way through, putting their hands everywhere (my waist\/backside had never been more thoroughly stroked in my life and my girlfriend literally left with a powdery white hand print on her ass --to this day we can only guess what that was). One guy even flipped her off when she declined to dance with him. Then some girl next to us bent over and started dry heaving. Mind you, not even leaving the dance floor.

The following day we were repeatedly approached by more promoters walking around to get back on the same guest list. More or less, unless you're a guy there's no reason to be paying cover.

The club itself is beautiful - dimly lit, with ample Asian touches throughout.  The first floor was very mellow and we soon realized that the 'real' party (and free drinks) was on the second floor. Up we went, checking our coats ($5), and getting out onto the small-ish dancefloor. 

We bumped and were regularly bumped into groups large and small, all vying for precious dance floor space. Security vigilantly kept track of the barricades that cordoned off the tables. The DJ that night spun a regular mix of 80's, 90's, and current dance tracks, at one point throwing in some Journey and giving me a distinct feeling that I could be back in DC with more personal space. 

The crowd was a range of ages and faces - from girls who looked fresh out of high school to a couple that was certainly closer to grandparent age. No matter, we were all content to dance and sporadically elbow one another.

My group of girlfriends are relatively mellow and couldn't handle the ridiculous crowd for long - things got more squished in as the night progressed and we had to weigh our desire to dance versus our desire to breathe.Tao is certainly one of THE Vegas clubs to hit up and there are certainly no dearth of reviews to help you decide if it's worth your while.",4,0,5

TAO has been so good to me over the years, it's given me nights that Vegas dreams are made of.

It actually looks like thought went into designing TAO, unlike a million other warehouse cookie cutter clubs out there. I'd bet money on TAO's interior designer and producer being a girl (a certain mistress perhaps?) because whoever designed the place knows what sexy is. Girls know that mystery and naughtiness in a space consists of red lighting, sparkly chandeliers, and hidden alcoves and passageways. It's not some space a guy thought up or else it'd be a chamber of stainless steel, stripper poles, geometric pleather booths, and industrial flooring, or in a word, cold. TAO is warm and feminine and everything that is SEXY. 

The cocktail waitresses are hot but the dancers are even hotter. Sometimes when I'm on the dance floor I stop and stare at the dancers in awe of their bodies. Their bodies are SICK and they're wearing nothing more than lingerie, shaking like crazy and nothing on their bodies jiggle, WHAT THE HECK. And there's freaking nekkid girls in bathtubs in the middle of the dance floor! Odd but I like it. The promoters that swarm this place are gorgeous too, in a pretty boy douchey way, but whatever. 

The DJ's play the exact music you want to hear at a club. Everyone knows that it doesn't take much to have a good night, just some strong drinks and great company, but a DJ can definitely make or break it. The music is so good in the hip hop room, there's no way you can sit down and not dance.

I've been to TAO so many times and I've been lucky enough to get hooked up with table service in every room. I like the upstairs tables because you have your own private space and room to breathe, the tables by the stage downstairs because you're in the center of all the belligerence, and the tables in the hip hop room because the music is ridiculous. The crowd at TAO is diverse. Girls are dressed to compete and you'll meet people and mingle well.

Tips for having a great night at Tao:
1. Be a girl.
2. Get bottle service, even if you're a girl.
3. Get on something and dance. A platform, a booth, on the stairs, anything.
4. Talk to people not in your group.
5. DON'T go on a Saturday or holiday.
6. Lock the door to your bathroom. Or don't.
7. DANCE, I SAY, DANCE!!!",7,6,5

I've got a jones for you.  I love your frame.  I love your name.  I love your game.  I was here on Saturday night to celebrate my boy Edwin's 29th.  It was kind of an epic night.  We had intentions of going to another club afterwards, but the love at Tao was too strong.  It grabbed onto us and didn't let us go.

First off, I strongly encourage you to reserve a table on a weekend.  You'll save yourself the torment of waiting hours in line.  When we came up the escalator we saw hundreds of people in line for Tao.  I've haven't seen a line that long since I was at Disney World.  Of course, we didn't have to wait in line.

Once we established ourselves, we were led into the club immediately.  Even ahead of those who had tables.  This is where my boys' connection comes in.  It's the type of connection that most may never have, but still, I highly advise bottle service.

Our table is in the center of club, overlooking the dance floor and the wannabee go-go dancers aka drunk chicks with no beat.  Our attendants were ridiculously gracious and attentive.  They definitely made us all feel like a million bucks.

I know a lot of people knock Tao because of the overcrowded dance floor, bars and restrooms.  But if you're VIP, you don't have to worry about any of that.  Well...except for the restroom.

And there definitely is a difference between VIP passes, VIP, and table\/bottle service.  The latter is really where you need to be.  Waiting in line isn't for me.

We went through several magnum bottles of Goose and several bottles of Jagermeister.  The bill came out to several thousand bucks.  Was it worth it?  Abso-freakin-lutely!!!!!  I haven't had that much fun in long time.  A memorable night indeed.

I love you...",6,8,7

First, the lines are ridiculously long and the bouncers are incredibly rude. We've done it all - come early, get on a guest list, bribe - and each time we get a new bad experience with the bouncers. One incident, we were early in line, on the guest list and even spoke with the manager. I was wearing a button down short sleeve shirt and dress shoes. The bouncers let us wait in line for an hour, then when we were finally getting in, he took me out of line and said I wasn't up to code. My really good friend asked to speak to the manager, and they eventually let us in, but that was absurd. When I actually went inside, I was better dressed than half the people there!

Second, the bouncers are tricky when you get in inside. When they think you are drunk, they pretend they will give you water or give you air. Little do you know that they are actually escorting you out of the club. I definitely understand that there is a liability, but they separate you from your group and we lost a couple of people and never realized it until hours later. On top of that, I had one friend who definitely drank too much, and I was there to pick her up, but they would not allow me to. They sent her in an ambulance, and when I got to the hospital, the doctors said she wasn't even that drunk. Apparently the security at Tao are doctors and can judge when a friend can go on their own.

the decor is cool, but the layout of this place is awkward to say the least. there isn't a single place in the entire club where you don't feel like you're being pushed into someone. the hallways are narrow with the whole club being really dimly lit. the dance floor is way too small and overly crowded. the music is ok, but nothing to jump up and down for. the outside smoking area is long and narrow but also really crowded.

My friends and I were on the guest list, and the bouncers advised us to arrive EARLY. Like, 8:30pm early. Okay, fine, its acceptable since it is during a holiday weekend. We get there to be greeted with a heck of a long line, and on top of that, my guy friends had to pay up $40 for cover. Ridiculous. They were also on the guest list! wtf. We get in and were directed to follow the line to upstairs..which led us to Tao Beach (Connected)--we some how ended up on the roof. It was packed, and decided to order drinks. 

The bartender was a b*tch, giving us attitude and didn't even know how to make a M.V.P...come on, its only 3 ingredients! Bartender should have done her job to serve her customers...otherwise no tip for you! Almost $60 for four drinks? Screw that, and pre-funk beforehand in the casino. In addition, Tao was overcrowded, over the limit of their capacity space. To get to floor to floor (3 floors) literally took 15 minutes to get by. Once you are on the floor, you had to push your way through and make your way into the 'dance' floor. Some dance floor, because we\/nobody could dance. No space to move let along walk two steps. Who comes to a club to pay and stand around in a mosh pit!?

Tao is OVERRATED. Skip the ""big"" named clubs in Vegas, and hit the smaller edgier ones. (Bars\/lounges) They have just as good music, with room to actually groove and walk. Skip out on paying a ridiculous amount for cover (for guys) and prefunk before hand elsewhere. 
We did not a have a pleasant night, that's for sure!

Cons:
-OVERCAPACITY filled. Fire hazard
-Overpriced crappy drinks (Yes, its Vegas, but prefunk instead)
-No space to walk
-No space to dance 
-No place to sit
-Too long to get from level to level 
-Long Long lines 
-Bouncers not helpful 
-Bartender a b----
-Throw up everywhere (They need to clean up people's puke asap!)

I know it's Vegas so clearly huge groups of gorgeous girls have a major advantage when it comes to skipping lines, but do you really have to make it so obvious to those who are standing in line forever?? :( There's about a million lines, okay more like one giant line that loops around forever and doesn't move, probably because there's a million ENTRANCES to the line! It seems like every time I saw a group of girls talk to some bouncer, they magically got to cut in somewhere. Okay, now that that's out, onto the rest of the review?

I honestly didn't wait in line too long, it just bothered me because you can see everything happen in the huge open space in front. The bathtubs near the entrance were puzzling! I mean they were pretty, I guess they were so pretty that I didn't notice the girls lounging in them like all the people around me. I must be blind! The inside was very crowded, much more so than other clubs. It's near impossible to try to get back to your group of friends if you leave for the bar or restroom. It's so crowded that it's impossible to fend off the hordes of guys who just don't get the hint when girls don't want to dance with them because you're stuck so close that you have no place to push him away to (which makes me wonder, how did he manage to push through the crowd to reach us??) It's so crowded that if your feet are hurting so bad from being pushed from all directions while trying to dance that you could take your shoes off and just stand there (while surrounded by a tight group of friends bc strangers would most definitely stab your feet to death). Speaking of removing shoes, I took mine off for two seconds on the side just to breathe, and a bouncer immediately found me! Amazing god-like speed! I must admit, he was pretty nice about it. I needed some place to rest and seeing as how there's no place to sit (there never is) I decided to go to the bathroom. The line was ridiculous! The stairs are treacherous and the bathroom bouncer keeps asking whether you're waiting bc apparently people aren't allowed to hang out up there (VIP only?) I feel like I actually spent most of my time out on the balcony, the inside was just WAY too crowded.

Then they handed me a paper which I didn't look over but was supposed to present to the cashier. Once getting to cashier I was then told only 3\/5 of the girls will get comped and the other two are also $40. Are you EFFING KIDDING ME?

Like really Tao? This is what you've resorted to? No wonder everyone says ""Tao sucks now"" and your establishment is not known to be a credible one. Not to mention the restrooms  have no privacy.

Here's went wrong:

We were on a promoter's guestlist and just kept getting ignored.  Which is fine if we were ""not worthy"" but we had just got straight into Tryst- without line or cover- and had plenty girls for the number of guys.  I honestly think we couldn't talk to the guy because he was just so overwhelmed and incompetent.  Once we finally got the dimwit's attention, he looked us up, apologized for the wait and gave us all free passes-- except for one guy... petty.

Once we got in and started walking upstairs we were overwhelmed by the stench of vomit.  It was all over the stairs and just sitting there.  That was the first sensory impression of the place... and it didn't get much better once we got upstairs.

Once you step inside, there are many courteous doormen which assist you and guide you to the club. You feel very privileged because of them..hah


I was really impressed by how beautiful all the people were here. I'd say for every 10 people you saw, only 1 would be off, and even then they would be at least half decent.

Anyway, besides the crowd, decor is beautiful. There are also two bars. The middle level of Tao's is the Tao's Night Club, the upper level is Tao Beach, and the bottom level is the Tao Bistro. For Tao's Night Club, I'd have to say there are some cool hidden corners. There are also bath tubs with nude women taking in bath in rose petals which was kind of cool. Lighting is very dim. 

I'd say this is a fun place to check out but it gets old after a while. Especially if you go on a crowded night, you get the feeling that it gets clausterphobic!  But have fun :)

Pros:
+ good ambiance
+ good variety of music
+ nice Asian decor
+ 2-3 bar areas
+ beautiful people, crowd
+ people to assist you at every corner. When you go to Tao Beach, you'll pass a lot of employees who are in the corners just to make sure everything runs smoothly..The men are dressed in black suits and the women are half nude with bellies showing

Cons:
- drinks run from 9 dollars to $15..kind of ridiculous to be paying $15 for a frozen lemonade with a bit of liquor in it
- really really crowded because it's the ""it"" place to be. A little too crowded for my taste..

Tips:
* I believe you can get complimentary admission if you are a girl by grabbing a pass at the Tao Bistro (get it during the day time before you go!)
* get there early if you want to avoid the lines. We got to the club by 10 and that probably helped us get in faster; We left the club at 1am and the lines were ridiculously long still...
* Don't wear jeans... the people really do look at you up and down
*There's free valet! But it starts at 10!",0,0,0

Overall, I've walked out of this club feeling satisifed for probably 8\/10 of my experiences.  But really, you have to know which nights to go for what purpose.  

Getting in can be quite tough, especially if you don't know what you're doing.  There's about 3 different lines depending on the night: one for regular guests, one for guestlist\/hotel guests, and one for VIP.  Your best bet is getting a promoter's number to get you on the guest list.  They're usually really nice about it and usually can get everyone in for a reasonable price (the most I've had to pay was $20) and girls usually get in for free.  Girls get free open bar from 10pm-11pm, so that's pretty cool.  They're not as strict as XS about guys' attire, but you should dress up in a button up collared-shirt and dress shoes just to be safe because some will reject you; it really depends on the mood of the bouncer.

There's 2 dancefloors, one in the main area and one in another private room.  The one in the private room is pretty small and mostly for people who reserved a table.  The DJ in here in my experience is generally not as good in song selection.  The main dancefloor outside is my favorite because the DJ is awesome.  The only problem is that it gets crowded fast and it gets pretty hard to move around.  Bad nights to go here are when celebrities decide to celebrate here.  I mean the perk is that you get to party with and see the celebrity (Jamie Fox comes here a lot), but everyone wants to also, so everyone crowds the area and it's almost impossible to move and it gets super hot.  There's a small balcony on the outside but it fits like 20 people and every just smokes there so it's not the freshest air for a break.  If you want a break, you'd go upstairs to TAO Beach.  Up here isn't really a club, more like a lounge; they have all reserved tables up there, a full bar, there's music and people dance in the aisles, but it's not necessarily where you go to dance.  It's more for the fresh air and just to hang out and drink.  It's really nice because it's on the roof  so you're in the open air and a LOT of space.  The only problem though is that getting between TAO Beach and the Nightclub can take awhile because a lot of people like to move in between and its kinda crowded.

Back in the nightclub I believe there are 3 bars (1 is in a secret location behind the dance floor).  They're usually pretty crowded and typical vegas price (~$14 cocktails), but the bartenders are generally pretty good.  The majority of the drinks I get here taste great and exactly how they're supposed to taste.

The bathrooms are apparently quite a scene.  I've never been in the stalls for the guy's restroom but all my friends that are girls always tell me about their transparent stall doors.  They are transparent up until the moment you close the door and suddenly transitions to being opaque, so apparently it's pretty nifty to see.  The girls bathrooms are upstairs and there's usually a line to get in.  They also have some pretty nice go-go dancers in the main dancefloor, and in the entrance they have some booths that are there for show, and sometimes, mianly Friday or Saturday nights, they have girls that just sit there and pose in really seductive positions along a bed, lounge chair, etc.  And right next to dance floor, they sometimes have girls dancing in theses tubs.  Literally.  THey're tubs of water with rose petals on top and they're practically naked and dancing around in there.  It's pretty hot.

But yeah, TAO is one of my favorite nightclubs in Vegas, and I'm usually walking out feeling pretty satisfied.  I'd give it a 4-4.5 just because it can get really crowded and hot.",2,1,1

Drinks are average Vegas prices, but due to the sheer volume of people in the club, in all their air conditioned rooms, there is very little room to dance let alone breath.  You could always go up to Tao Beach to get some room, but who wants to be up there sweltering in the Vegas heat.

Luckly we went through a VIP host it was alot cheaper and the host negociated with the waitress. We didn't have to wait in line and got seated right away.

I've had better VIP service, but this is the worst VIP experience ever.  It went downhill when we had to actually walk through the crowd. First off the club is way too crowded!! In most clubs, if you have VIP you get escorted to the bathroom. To use the bathroom from the VIP area you have to walk through a crowd. We paid for VIP service, not just bottles. We had to walk ourselves through a crowd, in which pushed several people (including myself) to fall and tumble down stairs.  The security didn't even do anything to prevent this. I said something to them and they actually threaten me to leave if we stop complaining about the club. Seriously, if there was a fire or emergency evacution, everyone will just probably die.

You can't even dance in the club because it is so packed. And if you go to Tao Beach (upstairs) you can't even dance there.

The music was horrible. The reason I gave it two stars because we walked right in to avoid the long line (some people had vip and still had to wait), but it wasn't worth getting all bruised up by falling from a crowd. The security guards are jerks, they are too lazy to escort a bunch of girls  from VIP to the bathroom and instead they give you wrong directions to the bathroom and the exit.

We had reservations on a Friday night at one of the hottest restaurants and nightclubs in Vegas. The renowned NYC hotspot and celebrity hangout is now at the Venetian hotel. This restaurant specializes in asian-fusion food and it was fabulous. I've been to both (NYC and Vegas) and would go back again and again if I could afford it. In Vegas, we were seated VIP style in a booth so that we were able to view everything that was happening. We shamelessly ate everything in site in a matter of seconds to include Chilean Sea Bass, Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll with Edamame, Pork Spring Rolls, Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce, Squab Lettuce, Black Pepper Sizzled Filet Mignon with Udon Noodles, Five Plus Five Ingredient Fried Rice and dessert -- Chocolate Raspberry Wontons with Tahitian Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. I guess we were hungry... (BTW, our waiter was great even though he thought us a pig)

I Want It That Way
While we were having dinner at Tao, we spied someone famous walking around. Figured he was famous cause he had that aire about him. Finally it clicked --- it was that guy from the Backstreet Boys. What's-his-name. He was seated next to the ladies room so we got a good look at him. Maybe he wasn't so famous as he had to sit near the ladies room... hmmm. Anyway, found out his name -- Kevin Richardson.

DMV experience at the Tao
Dining at Tao has its privileges. We were able to get front-of-the-line passes (via stamped wrist) to the nightclub. Nice. However, the stamp didn't waive the $25 cover charge. Not so nice. We were able to overcome that hurdle because we had VIP passes that were given by the one of the nice bellman\/valet guy at the Venetian. As an aside, don't ever buy VIP passes from a taxi cabbie. You'll get totally gypped. You can always get them from a nice bellman or concierge or even at a boutique shop. Of course, you have to look like us to get them...

So after dinner, we went upstairs to the club. But we were told that we had to go back downstairs, outside to get a stamp to get back in. Huh? So the stamp that we were given during dinner allowed us to be in front of the line outside. Then the VIP passes allowed us to waive the fee to get another stamp to go inside that club. With me so far? As SFJ mentioned, this is just like the DMV. Sheesh --- all this to get into the fricken place where we were already in (albeit downstairs in the dining area)

It's Getting Hot in Here
The Tao Nightclub was hopping! It was so packed that SFJ decided to jump on the big speakers and dance ala gogo dancer. We peons were on the floor dancing and moving along with the sea of people like a rip current in the ocean. I swear, I was going to beat someone up. In these kind of settings, I'm not the most jovial person because I hate to be jostled, pushed, shoved, elbowed, etc. I guess I wasn't drunk enough too! It surely was an experience though.

In summary, the restaurant get 4 stars and the club gets 2 for an average of 3 stars.",0,1,0

MY girls and I met up with my friends who had hook ups to a table. Thank GOD, cuz we would have been stuck in that long ass line for an hour.

UGH. It was like a cattle call. They told us to wait outside, then come back inside, then go back outside. WTF. Can you say organized?!

Anyway, we finally get in for free (woot) and then proceed to drink it up. After a drink, we were all feeling good. It was Erick Morillo in the main room and he was awesome!! I had so much fun.

However, the main room was so insanely packed that we didn't even have to walk. The crowd would move you along. Geez. I think we danced for a few minutes in the mosh pit before we had to get the F out.

So, we spent most of our time upstairs at Tao Beach. Way better, more chill, but still packed as hell. I think 60% of Vegas was at Tao that night. In order to get drinks, we had to push through a mass of people who were drunk and one guy was puking by the bar. Gross.

Why 3 stars? Well, it's really 2.5, but I felt generous.

Oh, the bathroom situation is a huge PAIN. There are only a few stalls and you have to go upstairs and wait forever in line. I swear, I thought I was gonna pee on myself a couple times!

I had fun though. Just way too packed for me. We left around 230 am and there were still people waiting to get in!",12,11,9

Now that I have been to Vegas a couple more times, though, I will admit that Tao is not one of my favourite places to go.

However, I still think it's a greaaaat place to go if you're going with a big group of boys + girls because guys can get in for free as long as there is an even ratio :) !!  With all the money you're already spending in Vegas... of course you're gonna want to try to cut down the costs.  I feel like most the promoters I know in Vegas work for the Tao Group, and so they can ALWAYS set you up here :)

Once you get in through a promoter, girls also get free drinks for an hour -- sweet!  This is usually during 10 30 to 11 30 or 10 to 11... I'm not sure!  You can only get one drink at once, so what my girl friends and I did was just get a bunch of drinks from different bars, and have our guy friends hold them.   That way -- we all get free drinks :) Yayy!!

The crowd at Tao is older than it is at XS and Marquee from what I can remember.  The music was top 40 I think, but it might change from night to night?  

When I went over the summer, the lines were RIDICULOUS even when we got there at 9.  When I went in November, though, it was way faster.

Ughh sorry I totally jumped from thought to thought in this review...

Definitely let me know if you guys need hookups at Tao!  I know a great promoter who can set you guys up -- butttt only if you have girls in your group!!",6,3,4

I had an OK time. Drinks were expensive and the music was just OK. The DJ on a Saturday was a local radio DJ from LA. Kind of lame. I'm giving Tao 2 stars just for the guy in the purple suit who was dancing over the DJ booth. He danced to every song with so much enthusiasm. He deserved an Oscar.

*Edit: Go really early and it's not as bad. I guess the bouncers aren't tired and pissy yet. Got there with a group of 14, even guy: hot girls ~_^ at 9:30 on Saturday night. We got in as hotel guest (seperate line and they checked for room keys) and cover was free. Remember, dress code strictly enforced. They have guest list too but you have to be in before 9:30, and it helps to be a girl. 

What a rip... they totally try to scam you and show little respect for your business. I understand that no matter what, hot Vegas clubs are going to get business... if not yours someone else's. But really, treat us with some decency as customers.

So I go to Vegas for a bachlorette weekend. We stay at a suite in Venetian, and planned our main dinner at the Toa restaurant and got bottle service for Toa nightclub. We planned all this months in advanced with a Venetian promoter. 

Saturday night hits, we verify our 7 pm dinner reservation by calling the restaurant at 4. They lost our dinner reservations and basically said SOL w\/o any appology or good explaination, saying we can make a new reservation for a 9:45 seating. We opted ditch the restaurant, and to just stay in for roomsevice and invited everyone to the room for food and drinks. 

We hit the club around 10. We had 2 extra guest that we had called in and added on Friday night. The promoter said it wasn't a problem to add 2 more and she would update the list. No go... she didn't update, the bouncer at the door said we had too many people and said if we wanted to get the 2 in we would have to buy a 4th bottle.   O_O...  We argued noting that we had made an agreement for 3 bottles well in advanced and had called in perviously about the additions, at which time, nothing was noted about any changes to the service. Money was not the issue. The attitude and principle of it was. We asked to talk to the promoter we worked with. It took 30 mins to get a hold of our promoter. She didn't even come out to speak with us, and the bouncer discussed things with her by phone. He finally said Ok we'll let you in. It takes another 10mins for him to let us in. 

We get in and get seated. 15mins into it, another host tries to seat another group on the other half of our ""booth"". After the trouble downstairs, this annoied us even more. With our group of 17 girls, there was no way we could sit comfortably in that area with another party on the other side of what was first introduced to us as our area. We noted to our hostess the mistake and she politely talked to the other host and appologized to us. She was the first accomodating person we met that whole nite. 

The rest of the night was a fabulous drunken party and the bachlorette had fun as we tried to shield her from the troubles earlier in the evening. We ended up buying a 4th bottle. But like I said, it's not the money, it the attitude they gave us. 

Yes the layout of the club is a little odd. We were seated at a table up at Tao beach near the pools which was good, at least on the roof there is air circulation, even though it was hot as F in September. The bathrooms were also a trek across the whole pool area(which is quite big if you've never been to the Venitian pools). It is also quite a trek by stairs up to the pool area from the main club entrance and inside dance floor. It had nice lighting and decor. Good looking people. The table hostess was actually really nice. The music is moderate... good beats overall, but a bit too much house for our group's taste... but that's just the upstairs Toa beach area. Because of the flights of stairs and the risk of tumbling drunkenly down them, we ended up not going down to the main club area. 

If it weren't for the bachlorette and the number of people in our group, I would have ditched this place on account of their horrible service(except for our table hostess).",2,1,0

I had to deal with borderline harassment from their security and bad service. There are so many better options to choose from in Vegas, and Tao should really be your last and let me reiterate LAST option. I believe the current yelp ratings comparatively to other clubs speak for themselves if you have to ask me. 

The first time I came to Tao it was for Hardwell on a Thursday night, the weekend before NYE 2012. Earlier that evening my friends and I arrived early for the ladies open bar happy hour. I ordered a drink and one of my guy friends took one small sip from it. Seconds later, two of the security men stormed up to me, grabbed me, and took me into a small room by the back wall without any explanation. 

My friends were screaming and banging on the door asking for them to release me as they were very worried. One of the security guards very rudely explained that because it was a ladies open bar, I was not allowed to have my guy friend take a sip from my drink. 

Ok - but lets be real here - if that were the case did it really require them to take me to a secluded room away from the public and put me in harms way? They could have just told me in the presence of others, as it is not a big issue. I am glad that they released me after explaining, but really, none of that was necessary. That experience left a bitter taste, as it was unnecessary trauma. 

My second experience was more recent. I was at Tao for a joint bachelor\/bachelorette party two weekends ago for Fabulous. Because the couple decided to do a package deal, we had dinner earlier at the Tao Bistro for 15 people. As part of the package, there was dinner and bottle service provided for the group. As soon as we got to the club, we were given a table outside of the main room which was not ideal but that was ok. 

FYI, the food at Tao Bistro is really just mediocre Asian fusion food and not worth the money. 

Now onto the incompetent service. The group was kept waiting for almost 2 hours for the table service because the hostess could not match the package deal to the credit card on file without having the actual credit card that made the purchase. The entire dinner\/club packaged was already paid for and yet there was a problem? Because of the wait, our group just cancelled the table service. That kind of service is unacceptable. At the very least, because of the incompetence, our dinner was reduced in price. 

Most people in the group were only in Vegas for one night, specifically to be at Tao, and Tao ruined this experience especially for the future bride and groom. Honestly I thought my second experience would be better. 

Ironically, for a club Tao is a buzzkill.

Because of the night we went the crowd with Jamie Foxx, the crowd was pretty mixed.  I swear there were a ton of NFL players in the crowd with their entourages and body guards around.  

The clubs two dance floors are nice, except unless you have a VIP area you will surely be bowled over by the girlfriend crews who use the larger one to bowl there way into a *strike* right in the middle of the dance floor by clearing a path.

The majority of our group showed up around 8pm, but the boyfriend and I drove in that afternoon so we didn't join them until almost 9pm. Some of the bouncers gave us a bit of a hard time when we tried to join our friends, but we were eventually able to sneak past them. 

When the line started moving, they actually led us straight up to TAO Beach, which wasn't a bad move on their part. The pool was lit and there were tons of chairs around the place, though for some strange reason nobody was sitting. The bar wasn't packed yet so the friends were able to get drinks rather quickly - they were on a mission that night. However, the boyfriend and I wanted to go inside to check out the place first, so we headed back downstairs. 

I actually quite liked the interior decor of the place. The bathtubs with the girls were a nice touch and the design was pretty consistent throughout the entire club. Instead of hanging out at the front of the place right next to the restaurant, we went straight for the dance floor in the back. At one point, I desperately had to go to the restroom and was appreciative of the fact that the bouncers were incredibly vigilant about keeping guys away from the girls' restroom (which was technically on the second floor). 

The music was pretty decent throughout the night and plenty of people were dancing. The VIP crowd was especially annoying that night because of the supposed Jay-Z appearance so they would constantly make a big commotion as if he were arriving and the entire dance floor would literally stop dancing and stand there staring in their direction. Strange ... Overall, we spent a decent 4 hours there for free. Not bad!",0,0,0

We received a coupon from the bellman when we checked in, so it was even more inciting to go. Located inside of the Venetian, it seems to be one of the more popular places on the strip. We arrived around 10pm and had to wait in line for about 15 minutes, which isn't too bad for Vegas. Once we got in, you were either in or shuffled around like you didn't belong. Almost the entire bar is roped off for people that make reservations or have money. We wanted to get on the main dance floor, but unless you had a wrist band, it was a no-go. We found another dance floor where we danced the night away, but it was also surrounded by roped-off sections with bottle service. There was a bar near, that they closed early. So, my advice if you truly want to enjoy he nightclub, book a party or bottle service.

I had a great experience and will be coming here more often! DJ Vice was spinnin', never heard of him before but def LOVE him now! Had a little DJ crush on him because he was doing his thang and doing it well. He played mostly top 40\/hip hop with a little mix of house. It was just the right amount.  I'm more of a top 40\/hip hop person because I'd rather be body rollin' and booty poppin' to the rhythm of good jams than fist pumping all night so was glad to be here. At the end of the day, I think it's just what type of music you like to get down to. Oh yea, and Too Short showed up randomly....

Got on the guestlist with Mike C. so free entry and we only had to wait about 15 mins. The decor was nice, crowd was diverse, which is what I'd generally prefer, and the place was pretty spacious. They had really cool bathrooms, with frosted windows and the workers at the bathrooms were very nice. Helped me out in my emergency moment. Granted there were usually long lines but thankfully they had more bathrooms nearer to the entrance in the separate old school hip hop room (this was a more spacious room with pretty good music too!). Dehydrated from drinking all day, it was great that the bartenders gave out free water and didn't charge a ridic amount like some other clubs do. 

Downside: 

It was super crowded and I generally like to dance with not so many people up in my grill. It was probably worse since it was memorial day weekend but  from the other reviews, seems like it's always like this. To make matters worse, towards the end of the night, it was more blah. Vice was gone and the dance floor became a sausage fest with creepers trying to desperately find a last minute hook-up before the night ends. There were many thirsty guys; I know you're trying to get it in and all but damn, calm down and learn how to dance. Sidenote, forceful thrusting is NOT dancing.

If you never been I would say it's worthwhile to go once. There's two rooms, one is smaller but roomier and plays a mix of hip-hop. The other room is the dance floor which will get crowd to the point of suffocation. But there's two separate bar area that will give you breathing space. The music now is disappointing, it seems early in the night it will have good music. But later on about 3am they played a lot of techno. Unless you're uber snobby jet set, go at least once.

By the time we got actually got into the club, it was so crowded that we couldn't even find the bar.

About 30 minutes in, our self-preservation instincts kicked in and we decided to leave, dodging vomit on the way out.  The bouncers were less than gracious, even by Vegas standards - and it was evident that they had no regard for crowd control, capacity concerns, and patron safety.

We made our way to the main bar, and started on our free drinks.  We then headed to the dance floor, and as we were dancing, the bouncer asked us to dance on the platform.  I pounded my drink for some liquid courage and we let loose!  

Later on, we were just chillin' by the bar, and one of the hosts came up to us and asked us to go into the VIP section.  They pretty much want the girls to loiter and drink the alcohol from guys who get bottle service so they'll buy more.  Hey...whatever works...I ain't gonna complain about free drinks!

I was standing in line to get outside to look for a friend (outside of the dance area into the stairs area) and some person smoking a cigarette burned it into my leg while we stood waiting for both lines to move forward or backwards. Ouch!

Nevertheless, TAO is great time in Vegas because it's one of the first exclusive night clubs you can actually get into.

Awesome music, think 80's hip hop and R&B...Jacko. There are bathtubs scattered about & filled with American Beauties and flowered water. We danced on one of the tub pedestals, but it wasn't smart, what with all the water & spilled boozey drinks.
There are cozy booths and tables on the sides, separated by velvet rope, of course. Upstairs are the bathrooms, you know the kind, clear glass that turns frosted when you lock it.

We move on to the stamp checker and he tells us we can't get in without a stamp after I just showed proof of my tickets to the cashier.

TIP:  If you are staying in the Venetian you get a fast ticket into the club.  I don't remember the details so make sure you check out the concierge.

I like this club, as soon as you walk in you get a taste of how nice the ambiance is going to be.  Even though it's a pretty decent size club with multiple rooms, it gets packed later on in the night on the weekends.  So I recommend getting there before 11 to get some free space before it really starts bumping around midnight.  But let's be honest, we don't like dead clubs right?

Like any other club, find your promoters so you're not stuck paying an arm and leg to wait in line till 1am.  Of course girls can get in free.  Because yah I""ve seen people still standing in line at that time....Crazy!

The music was great (hip hop\/ dance), go-go dancers in tubs, security were cool and making sure the annoying drunks were kicked out, guys weren't skeezy and partying in this club really makes you really feel like you are in Vegas!  Till 5am baby!  (Or maybe it was 6, lost track of time?)",1,1,2

The fact remains though Tao means nature reigns supreme, but there's nothing natural about the chaos you encounter at this place on Saturday nights.

As we approached this place we knew this wasn't for the claustrophobic. You MUST love people. At 10pm there were about a thousand people waiting in line to get in. Fine, stuff like this happens all the time in LA. Then it became increasingly unclear what the VIP passes they hand out to every mammal on earth mean. No cover? Free access to the top floor?

Apparently the girl who put the group together thought it meant all of the above. The bouncers disagree. They tried to collect an unknow sum of cover at first, then waived it. Then we found out we couldn't go upstairs without the cool ""Tao"" stamp on the wrist, which sets off another round of negotiation. $30 for dudes and free for girls. 

Having waited in line for about 1.5 hours by then, we'd pay our liver to get up there. Guys and girls separated to two different entrance points. Guys paid and got the stamp, girl didn't pay and.... didn't get the stamp.

WTF? So to keep the group together, NONE of us can go upstairs. Negotiation Round Three. 40 minutes later, girls got their stamps, too. Alas, we finally got upstairs!!

And we found ourselves in a un-Tao chaos. People are still pouring in like cockroaches. I don't hate people or cockroaches, but they are equally destructive above a certain density. I swear somebody farted a pungent storm while I was making my way to the bar. Three jaeger shots failed to take the sting away.

And good luck finding your friends inside. I always suspected cockroaches don't recognize their siblings, now I can see why.

It could be a cool\/trendy place to hang out and do your mating dance on a wonderful Tuesday night in Feburary. But then if you don't have a job, this place could cost you your entire unemployment benefit in about 5 minutes.

I had my best night in Vegas at Tao, but I think it was because of the guy I met. I got hit on at least 5 times that night, and didn't have to pay for more than 2 of my own drinks. The bartender, Miss Sam, made me this deelicious drink that tasted a bit like a jolly rancher, but not as sugary. AND, no soda pop, juice or anything. It was as healthy as you could get for a yummy drink. There were a lot of cool people there, and the DJ was good. It does get crowded though, by the time 2 am hit you couldn't move on the dance floor (which should be bigger). But there's a balcony with a great view, and friendly bartenders. 

They had barely dressed girls everywhere either massaging or bathing each other, if that matters to you. The decor was cool, tons of Buddha statues everywhere, holding a bowl with water, rose petals and a lit candle. The rose petals are replaced daily.

Keep that in mind if you wanna be a baller and spend some fat cash. If you go, go ahead of time. The lines can be a pain and you could be in line for over an hour if you come late. I usually go around 10pm at the latest. I love the levels of the club and the different music. You're sure to spot a celebrity almost any night, even the people who work there I have seen on reality shows. It's a great place to meet new friends, even for the weekend.

This was the first club I went to my first time as being 21+ in Vegas and it was probably one of the best nights of my life!

One tip is to BE SURE TO BE ON THE GUESTLIST. You don't want to wait in the long line that never ends. Get there early as well. We went around 1030 and there were already crazy lines.

Walking in, I guess I clearly underestimated how huge the club is. Not sure, but I believe it was 4 stories high? Anyways, it was so nice inside. There are plenty of places to dance, so don't just limit yourself to that one main floor. 

Drinks were exceptionally good here. I loved the raspberry iced tea. I did not taste the alcohol at all, yet it was mostly alcohol. Didn't have to wait too long to get drinks either. Service was excellent!

Tao Beach was also cool. Be sure to check it out. It's the top floor of the club. It's a nice relaxing lounge-y area. Music isn't that loud so it's not really a place to dance, but a good place to chill.

On my first trip to Vegas after turning 21, I had one of the best nights @ Tao. It was during the week of the CES convention in early January so the place was filled with middle aged men from all over the world. We came early so there was plenty of space to dance, the music was good (mostly top 40's and some house) but soon enough the place become a extremely packed turned into a hot holy mess. 

Second time around, six months late in the summer, 3 of the girls with me were stopped by the bouncers after another gf and I already made it pass the entrance. The bouncers were questioning the authenticity of the driver's license used by one of the girls. She was indeed 21, but never updated her license picture. When one of the other girls demanded to talk to the person in charge she was thrown out by some short\/pock-marked\/unattractive asian dude who was obviously on so power trip. In the end, the guy asked for a second opinion on the ID from another bouncer and we were ALL let in. Sadly, all that hassle was not worth what was going on inside. It was so packed that groups of girls had to form long trains by holding onto each other so no one would be lost in the mass. The music wasn't all that great. Some girls got really dramatic and angry when you bumped into them, but what the hell beezy, take a look around and everyone else is getting pushed and shoved. 

As for the last visit this past January, it took a lot of convincing to return to this place and give it another try. I was over it within an hour. The same songs kept on repeating, there were Transformers walking around, there was a nasty ""pork"" smell lingering around, and unless you're a dancer for the club, get off the damn podium you fool.  

All 3 times, my gfs and I managed to get in w\/o paying. It actually helps a lot to meet some legit club promoters you can k.i.t with when you get to Vegas.

To my surprise, when we went to TAO on Saturday night I was not allowed access because the head of security told me that my license was ""no good"".  I find that incredibly surprising when I can get through airport security at Hartsfield International and it is ""good enough"" for a police officer in any state, but it is not ""good enough"" for access to a nightclub.  While we were in line, a security guy or promoter made us group with a few guys, so that the guys could get in the club.  The guys paid $200 in order to skip the line and get in with us.

The food and cocktails were both delicious.  I had the shrimp\/crab\/asparagus role and spicy tuna with avacado role for my entree.  Both were very good, especially the spicy tuna.  I had the orange dragon martini, which was also delicious.  Service was a little slow (even at 11:45 pm!) but the waiter was polite and helpful.

All of the staff we interacted with were extremely friendly, professional and helpful. We didn't have to wait in line, even though we weren't on any guest list. We paid about $30 for myself and my boyfriend to get in, but it was still cheaper than voodoo lounge and looked like a much more well dressed and classier crowd here too. 

The drinks are steep for normal standards, but they are actually a lot cheaper than hakkasan. $14 for a shot of patron silver and $11 for a vodka tonic at Tao VS. $25 a drink average at hakkasan. 

I loved the club's theme and the upscale asian inspired decoration. They had sexy red chandeliers over the bar area in the dance room. The giant Buddha sculpture was a dramatic touch. I think they had about 3 flights of stairs to get up to the dance floor, but it wasn't anywhere near as exhausting as hakkasan's millions of stairs. 

The dance floor was packed to the max, but the perimeter of the club had a lot of areas that you could stand, dance or relax with your date and enjoy your drink. I loved that we didn't have to push our way to get around and we were able to stand anywhere we wanted to without being ushered out of the way like they do at hakkasan.

They require a 2 bottle minimum to reserve a space and if you are a moderate drinker with a small group this place is not accommodating at all!

The nightclub was crazy. If you like getting tight and being touched by others. This club would be the place. There was SO MUCH people. People squeeze in so close to dance. They were quite touchy too. I hated one thing, and it was that they allow people to smoke in there. It really annoyed me.

Oh yea, the restroom was confusing. They only had ""ying"" and ""yang"" labeled on the restroom doors. My friend and I didn't know which was female. Then this group of girls also was clueless, then some of them opened one of the doors and found it was the women side. Then one girl opened the male side and then came back out.

One perk of the night was that Tao Beach was open, which is awesome for cooling down and there's a huge sofa bed to just chill, or get ridiculously bouncy and slizzard.

So which club would said young, Asian group go to?  Well, naturally you would give TAO a chance.

TAO is one of the newer clubs in Vegas and it is really popular.  There are always a lot of people, so if you're the type of person who doesn't like a crowded (and I mean CROWDED) dance floor, this isn't the place for you.  However, being that it is filled with tons of people, there are a lot of cute girls too.  So for all you single fellas out there that are lookin for love (I wouldn't recommend looking for love in a club, a Vegas club no less), then you better force yourself to like crowded dance floors.
If you're going to club just to do the usual drink and dance with your significant other, friends, or even yourself.  TAO is a good place to go.  They play a wide variety of music and have pretty good drinks.  The drinks however, are pretty damn expensive.  But hey, what else would you expect from a Vegas club?",1,0,1

This place may be all find and dandy for some people. A lot were enjoying the DJ and the 'dance' floor, but there were only a few corners here and there where you can actually interact with anyone. While trying to find a place to stay and drink we were shoved away by security saying we were too close to the elevator doors, when it's the only place to stand.

So what did we do? We left and found someplace else. I know it may be unfair since different clubs have different atmospheres, but I just found this place to be nothing but uncomfortable chaos.

And I was offended for Asian women everywhere by the ""Always a happy ending"" posters on every cab and billboard in town with a picture of an Asian girl's bum--reducing all Asian females to no more than massage parlor prostitutes. But this is Vegas, baby, and sexism, hypocrisy, and excess are part of the deal, so with VIP passes in hand, we decided to check it out. 

Turns out the passes only work for women. Guys seriously pay to play in this town--$30 for the green-eyed boy later, we were in. I should note that we have been desperately searching for good house music options while we were here. We did hours of research, wondering why every club website lauded its ""Mr. Top 40s DJ!"" like that's a good thing... ? So, just as everywhere else we'd been in Vegas so far, we were wildly disappointed by the music. Not a single house beat in the Lounge or the main dance floor or the Beach area. The visuals were interesting certainly--two girls fake making out in a dungeon setting at the top of the stairs,  the rose petal-boobied mermaids in the tubs everywhere--but the crowd and music were 100% generic. 

If you are looking for house music, perhaps try Wednesday night and skip the weekends, but I heard from several locals that this club is on its way out. Maybe Tao-goers are finding enlightenment at the bottom of their lychee martinis: ""Dude, I don't know how I feel about my Asian heritage being reduced to the lowest common denominator and sold at top dollar to the masses; what do you say we burn these striped shirts and go somewhere actually cool?""

making up real good time:
MUSIC, KIND OF PLACE AND GIMMICK, DRINKS, CROWD, COMPANY, AND MOOD.
Music: I think it was 70% rave, some rNb's and techno-- but all is well when u get loaded up. i really didnt like it at first but what the heck, 
were here so just ride. Soon as you enter you see the gimmick--these poor pretty sexy ladies bathing themselves in cold petally water. man
this place is really huge-- and hella crowded, for clubs--id like it better if itd give you more space to move. I hated the snow gimmick --there was enough
unsolicited sweat to get from the dance floor. The dark orange lighting clicked for me, it surely matches the concept--with these old eastern empire walls.

Mood was fine-- it was just the same same move and relax kind,, a lot of dudes tonight. But its not the night girls,, coz we got some 2 strict watchmen in tha  house. *pout. party time ? nope, green light has turned to yellow * caution! but yeah i had fun. except for the dance floor i just wish it was bigger, ppl were literally pushing their way around, making it easier for guys to ease up, F. 

 the score was a low three-- and tonight my name was ""A"" and a fake email for this guy time i was losing my sisters.. WHY DOES EVERYBODY keep going up the ladies room, lost my cuz again, had to go back to the restroom and third scorer had a good invitation to a lounge by the second floor
@the back--too bad somebody was waving us to go back now--. **!#$%^*-lost my chance to meet new peeps.

drinks $15 up,, after a while to bring back the mood we got back for another round. it wasnt until this time i realized that tonight was a male bartender night,, 
hmmm...thats good For a change

Add one star for the ladies room. They had these clear doors that cloud up once you lock them. cool. placing  it on the second floor is a crazy idea-- free view for guys,, ??!!
they surely know how to maximize the set up-- there were lounges all the way to the mazy exit if your gropuup wants to get seated. Crazy crowd,, but it sure spells fun.

We had a group of four guys and five girls. We were on a promoter's guestlist, so we skipped the general admission line. It was the longest wait at a club all weekend, maybe 10 minutes, max. The girls were free, the guys were discounted at $30 (wtf is general admission price then for this club?), yikes.

We headed upstairs...we had about 20 minutes of the open bar left. I found an open spot at the bar right away and got a drink. After all of the girls got our round of drinks, we all headed to the dance floor.

The opening DJ played old school music...not like good 90's old school music, but like between 2000-2005, that reminded you of high school dances. DJ Vice was the headlining DJ and he was pretty good. 

People were not joking when they said people are next to each other like sardines in a can. I don't know what it was about this crowd...if the girls here are lightweights and took full advantage of the open bar, or what. But these people were DRUNK. And not even drunk, but ANN0YING drunk. 

The trapeze girl floating above the crowd was pretty cool. It's a nice looking club, but it's WAY too crowded. I'm not quite sure what the hype is about this club...but whatever. To each-their-own.

The DJ that night played mostly hip hop. There were a couple of moments where he started playing a couple of EDM songs and I thought the crowd was starting to gain momentum, but that quickly faded away once another hip hop song came on.

Here with a group of 40 people, we had pre-arranged a group dinner with Tao that included a set menu at a certain price.  We were treated to tons of food served family style including, pad thai, egg rolls, wasabi encrusted filet mignon and the most amazing desserts that came with fortune cookies with hysterical fortunes.  Coming from Miami, the specialty cocktails seemed fairly priced at $13 each.

Several round tables were placed on the second level where we could look down on the restaurant and the giant buddha.  Amazingly, these tables were whisked away after our dinner when Tao converts into a nightclub.

As dinner guests we were stamped on our hands so we could enter the club sans cover charge.  Unfortunately, the stamp didn't give us a short cut.  We still had to go all the way downstairs, exit Tao and get back into a short line, only to go back all the way upstairs to enter the club.

The club had a great vibe with music I could dance to, but it seemed like the way to go here is VIP.  If you're going to wear 4 inch heels then you need a place to sit and the Club offers nowhere to rest your feet unless you pay for bottle service.  Walking around, you can find bar areas that are less crowded if you move away from the dance floor. 

I didn't last too long in the club because it seemed like it was packed with bachelor\/bachelorette parties or prom attendees.  It was a weird scene early in the night filled with tourists who packed their gawdiest outfit simply because they believed you can get away with it in Vegas.

...Okay, don't say you know Brandon. Actually, to tell you the truth, I don't even know Brandon. But somehow, by name dropping some guy I don't even know, I was able to bypass the 2-3 hour line for Tao on Halloween, get in without cover (the guys in our group didn't have to pay cover either) and party it up on the dance floor with a bunch of guys in cow costumes.

(Cow costumes? Wow, that's hot.)

Actually, I was never a huge fan of Tao, even though, both times I've been, I've gotten in without cover. The first time I went, the dance floors downstairs were playing house (not my thing) and I got into a huge argument at Tao Beach. (Yay for drama in Vegas clubs!...Not.) Considering that experience, I was a little apprehensive about going back to Tao again.

Boy, was I wrong - Tao on Halloween was crazy! Like I said, I got to dance with a bunch of cows, the DJ's were bumping great dance music, they had Tera Patrick hosting\/emceeing for the night (although I couldn't tell if she was hot or not though), and it was just good times all around. 

Notes to remember: 
- Do not dance on the furniture (I found that out the hard way). 
- Do not bother going to Tao Beach - it's too crowded, there's really no room to dance, and the bathrooms are ridiculously far away from the general Tao Beach area (as I discovered during my first outing to Tao).

Okay, so Tao might not be the best in every aspect, but it hits every feature you would want. Girls in bath tubs? Hanging Birdcage? Mist\/foam machine? Top 50 and EDM? Check on all counts.

The club is separated into the lower lounge where they serve food and the upper area for dancing. Within the upper floor are tables in more private areas, away from the dancing, and roped off tables in the action, just next to the dancing. They have the bottle service but it wasn't distracting--some clubs have the bottle service every 5 minutes and it gets old really quick.

The light effects are top notch. They have a giant display in the front and displays on the roof. Lasers. A balcony above the DJ. Hot dancers on the balcony. Dancers on the platforms next to the pillars. Glow\/light sticks. A gong sound and mist\/foam to instantly drop the temperature. Smooth, on point song transitions. 

And that's just the features of the club. The people that go there are pretty attractive as well. I'm sure this is hit or miss but if you're planning to go sometime soon I think you'll be in good hands.

A short wait in line (you've gotta get there early and try in any way possible to get on a list), and probably thanks to our party of 5 girls and 4 guys, we were in free on a Saturday night. A first for me, so that was starting off the night right.

The decor of the club is great...I love the recent trend of huge megaclubs with tons of different rooms and areas. The Tao Beach area was a bit strange, because of the TVs showing the Nuggets\/Jazz playoff game above the bar (just felt out of place I guess), but the bartenders were GREAT out there. Keep in mind, it's a Vegas club...but at least you get what you pay for here. Sure, a shot of Patron is $8 or $9, but when it's 1.75 shots worth, I'll take it (both literally and figuratively).

The DJs were great. All the areas were fantastic, and I had a blast. Only downside is the wait times for a drink, but you can't really complain about that in Vegas, right? I'd go back in a second...had a great time.",1,0,1

I am a Vegas local and I have been to almost every single nightclub here. I have heard previous awful things about the club so I always strayed away. However, around Christmas time my brother and his girlfriend were both in town and they wanted to go to a nightclub. Unfortunately, since it was Christmas time every single night club except for TOA was closed. So, I got us and a few friends on the guest list. We initially had a pre-club party in the penthouse suite of the Aria, so we headed down to TAO a little late. Since we were late, they would not let us in. So we tried to talk to one of the bouncers to figure out how much it would be for us to get in since the guest list was now closed. They told us some crazy general admission price, so my brother decided that it would just be better to pay for a table instead. My brother paid $600 at the door for a table, so finally we were let in. Mind you, we were a group of about eight people of color, and the only bouncer that was even willing to talk to us about the table was black. I tried multiple times to get the attention of other bouncers and promoters, but no one would even make eye contact with me. So... we get shown to our table and we are having a good time dancing on the balcony of the club. We ordered a bottle of champagne and a bottle of Grey Goose. The music was OK at first and eventually got better, but the experience got worse! My brother, a 26 year old African-American male, went downstairs to use the restroom when he was accused of stealing the (very nice) blazer he was wearing! They escorted him to a back room where they took the blazer back inside and told him that he had to leave because he was too drunk! While he was in this weird back room trying to explain that he did not steal that blazer, us in the group were looking around for him for about 30 minutes before one of the club promoters came upstairs and told us that he had been escorted out of the club. Everyone in the group left to find him, including myself, but then I went back upstairs because we did not find him outside. When I got up there, I saw him talking with one of the security guards about his blazer. The security guard was holding the blazer still and saying it belonged to a man named Jose Martinez who was at table 14A???!! So I started arguing with the security guard about how this was my brothers jacket, and how WE were the people who were at table 14A! This went on for about another 30 minutes! They made us both go into the back stairwell to ""further discuss things."" By the end of this discussion, there were three security guards and a manager in the stairwell with us. My brother pulled out his receipt again and showed it to the manager (which showed a total of almost $1000 spent at table 14A under my brothers name!) so finally they handed him back his blazer! He really needed to show an expensive receipt to get his own jacket back?!?! After we all left, he told me that he also had to show them the receipt for the table before they let him back into the club! So according to them he was ""too drunk"" but once he showed them how much he spent, they let him go back in? That's BS. They knew he wasn't too drunk and they were just trying to escort a black male out of the club and get a rise out of him by taking his blazer away. If he in fact was too drunk, they wouldn't have let him back in no matter how much money he had spent. I regret ever going to this place. We should have just continued with our party in our suite. That was a disgusting experience and I am very disappointed in the Venetian for allowing this type of behavior and treatment for guests who come into the hotel.",5,2,1

All I could find was the Tao Asian Bistro, which I'm assuming must be attached to the night club. Good to know that there is a separate listing for the night club. 

For the most part, we had a great time at Tao. We got on a VIP list and only had to wait in a short line before being given wrist bands and led inside. Not only did our VIP status give us free cover and free drinks until 11:30 but it also apparently got us a table in the VIP section. Talk about an added bonus! Our group of five girls greatly appreciated having a place to sit and rest our high-heeled feet. We managed to get a couple of free drinks from the bar before it hit 11:30 and then we made friends with the table next to us to continue the party. It ended up being extra beneficial that we started chatting with the other table because our table became overrun with a rude bachelorette party while three of us were in the bathroom. Apparently, the bouncer refused to listen to our remaining two friends that we were coming right back and we basically got pushed out of our booth by these entitled girls who didn't know how to share. 

Instead of fighting, we decided to try the dance floor. Big mistake! The dance floor is tiny and so crowded that you're fighting to maintain your balance from being constantly pushed around. Not my cup of tea at all. I was about to leave when I bumped back into the people from the VIP section that we had been talking to. We told them that we got our booth stolen from us and they invited us back to hang out at their booth. Much better arrangement in the VIP.

Basically, I learned two lessons. 1) Always get on the VIP list and arrive early to get a table and 2) Never let half of your group leave said table at the same time or it may not be there when you return.

My friend and I ate at Tao, so we got a line pass stamp.  That was nice.  When I was in the bathroom, I saw a free admission card that I grabbed and threw into my purse.  When asked to pay the cover, I flashed the card at the bouncer.  Unfortunately I hadn't actually read past the ""free"" portion of the card, so when the bouncer asked me ""Are you really a mother?"" my oh-so-eloquent response was a ""uh...""  It was Mother's Day weekend, and apparently the card was free admission for moms.  Silly me.  Well, the lovely bouncer nicely responded to my less than articulate response with a ""Well, you are tonight"" and let me through.

That's just a taste of what we experienced that evening. We had reserved a booth for 12 guys celebrating a bachelor party.  Once we had reached the floor entrance to TAO (off the escalator), the conventional line was already insane by 10:30-11ish. If you decide not to go with a booth reservation, I suggest you get there early!! or speak to the bouncer in a PROFESSIONAL manner on a payout.  Don't be rude since money does make the world go round in Vegas.  The best man in our party then requested the TAO VIP host and confirmed our reservation (4 bottles). The velvet rope lifted and we were placed in a separate section.  We waited for 5-10 minutes before we were escorted into an elevator.  Our booth was located on the second floor (booth 11 to be exact).  Once the drinks were flowing our booth started to resemble the dance floor. Rammed with many friends we had met that evening which was completely insane!  Music was ""poppin"" in the main room, spinning hiphop & r&b, etc.

From our vantage point, the main room was PACKED! I mean, it really is difficult to get around the club during its peak.  Put it this way, I gave up trying to get to the house room (to visit a friend who also had a booth) but I'll blame that on excessive amount of alcohol I had consumed that evening.

You enter in through the restaurant then go up the stairs to the club itself, so it is somewhat awkward because you see patrons trying to enjoy their dinner while hordes of girls and guys are walking in ready to party.  

Tao is small, so therefore it gets insanely crowded.  If you do not have bottle service you are stuck in the crowd, and trust me it gets very packed, to the point where it is hard to move.  If you have bottle service, you are a lot more comfortable but here comes the question, if bottle service is worth it?  There's an upstairs portion with tables that only people with table service are allowed to go up to.  It is considerably less crowded than the dance floor.

The good things about Tao is that there's open bar for ladies before a certain time and that's why I rounded up my stars. 

Side story: I got accused by the bartender, who was a girl, of passing on drinks to other people, because I wanted to get another drink after she made me one like 5 minutes or so beforehand.  I finished the drink so fast because it was pretty much juice with a splash of liquor but whatever, it was free so I'm venting, not complaining.

The off thing about Tao is their upstairs bathroom.  Whoever designed them really had no clue about drunk people.  So it's a clear glass door that gets frosted when you lock it.  So clearly if you're drunk you might forget to lock the door, which is what happened to a friend of mine.  Luckily we saw that she didn't lock it and stood in front of the door hiding her.  No free shows tonight!",7,6,2

Great location, HUGE club, different levels\/areas, good music!

But, literally a mosh pit when trying to get in, theres no organized line and once you do get in, its the same mosh pit of people all over the dance floors!

I have been here twice and each time left after about an hour because i literally could not be there any longer.  I am not claustrophobic but you cannot breathe inside the club!! its decorated beautifully with long hallways and girls in rose filled tubs and statues galore but DO NOT go here without bottle service!! There is no place at all to sit and all of the areas are jam-packed!! I got stepped on plenty of times and got elbowed\/pushed etc.  all through out the night!  

They also have a VIP roof top pool area (i believe only open on saturday nights) which i love cuz the vegas summer weather is gorgeous at night.  They still have music outside and more bars and people in cabanas.  I like that this club has so much going on, and you can get lost in all the rooms!

Find a promoter and even if you don't get bottle service they are very accommodating to girls, pulled us out of the mosh pit outside, and got us in no hassel.  they even offered us free well drinks with our wrist bands!",0,1,0

It's spacious with multiple rooms and floors. Be prepared to wait in LONG lines, unless of course you're rolling in with 15 hot ladies and\/or know a party promoter.

Guys that flock in all-male groups, be prepared to wait in line and fork over money, which I hear can go up to $200 bucks if a celebrity pays a visit. If you want to step to the front of the line and you have enough people to chip in, I highly recommend getting bottle service to skip the hassle.

Here's another quick tip to get in for free. Eat at the Restaurant (Tao Asian Bistro). Make sure you make reservations at around 9 PM. Once you're done with dinner, you can get in the club through a back entrance for free. Food is descent...it's one up from PF Chang's--they have some pretty good options to choose from.

I can say we have never had a problem. We are 4 guys who show up and get in. The problem is people wait in the guestlist\/VIP line and stand around because they think that makes them important. We head right to the general admission line and 20 mins later we're in. I'm a bartender so I will give you some advice. On your first round make sure you tip big. Next time you go up that bartender will see you and take your order and make everyone else wait. Your drinks will be stronger the second time. The music at this club is just like every other club. They play top 40, some mash ups and then some old school that everyone remembers. Like I said it's a good place to start your trip.",1,0,0

1. The disorganized mess of lines. There were three or four lines wrapping around the entire ""square"" with no clear signs for VIP or Guest list lines. When I asked an employee which line I should get to, the way he answered made it seem like someone had pissed in his corn flakes or something. Attitude much? (See number 5 down below)

2. Layout. Stairs=Not cool. Also, the bathrooms on the ground level: who the hell puts ""yin"" and ""yang"" on the doors instead of women\/men (And no clear symbols either) While waiting for my friend outside, I redirected several guys who nearly walked into the female restrooms. 

3. Crappy music. Benny Benassi was headlining at TAO but didn't show up until around 1 or so. But before that in the different rooms had some shitty remixes.

4. The crowd. I don't know if maybe I went on an ""off"" day or anything but nobody was dancing! What's up with that? Benny Benassi was supposed to be there but it didn't seem like the crowd was hyped up or excited as all. Everyone just seemed like they were standing around ""being cool"". It almost felt like a middle school dance. Awkward!

5. Service\/Employees. After my friend and I decided to leave, I discovered that my id (thankfully just my college one) and hotel room key had somehow fallen out of my wallet. I went back to ask for help but the promoter I talked to was so unsympathetic and rude to me that it made me cry. Virtually every employee I asked questions to in TAO was either rude or not helpful at all (except for the elevator guy, who was just helping out at TAO and regularly works at LAVO). 

Even though my friend and I paid no cover and had the open bar wristbands, it was by far the worst club we went to in our Vegas trip. Afrojack at Surrender was way better!",0,0,0

me and the boys go around vegas looking for a store that sells dress shoes, ended up at rockport at Caesars. bought my shoes, got back in line..possibly a 30-45 minute wait? 

getting in was tough, rough tiny spaces walking up the stairs to the top bar area. If you happen to be claustrophobic, your going to have a hard time getting all the way to the top. nice atmosphere and people, drinks were pretty pricey in compared to other places..but i guess its VEGAS right?!

went back downstairs and there's a line for that too?! that was kinda wack..as i got down, finnally found my friends but sadly, downstairs dancefloor was so packed, it was really hard to move around. also, 2-3 fights occurred..it just made TAO look bad..

It is visually amazing and audibly great but there are a few deal breakers that make my experience more negative than positive.  TAO was once a place that everyone wanted to see and be seen at, now not so much.

The biggest issue with TAO is the crowd.  Its too crowded.  If I go to a dance club its too dance and drink.  When the dance floor is so crowded that when you blink your eyelashes pushes someone ""Houston we have a problem"".  And it is like this every time I go.  Which is why I no longer go.  How can someone enjoy themselves in this type of environment?

Also, when you go to the bar order 5 drinks at a time because you will never get another chance.  I want to drink and dance and those are the two things you cant do in TAO.  Even making your way to the bathroom is difficult and time consuming.  SO don't wait until the last minute otherwise you might pee your pants.  Speaking of the bathrooms, lock the door otherwise the glass wont frost.  Learned the hard way.

The only way I will come back here is if I'm going to TAO Beach.  Now TAO Beach deserves a healthy 3 1\/2 stars.  Under normal circumstances id say 4 but TB is related to TAO and the family name has been tarnished.

The bus boi how ever were really rude. he spilt soy a sauce on my friend and wasnt very apologetic at all. but like i said the other ppl made up for the lack of service from the bus bois.

I've had better, but the saving grace of the eve was having bottle service with a super helpful (and pretty damn stacked) server and lots of personal space to have a haven from the long long long lines and overly packed floor.

All that said....

Your experience at most clubs\/parties in Vegas will depends on two factors: The gender makeup of your group, and how much money you are willing to spend. I found this to be 10x more evident at Tao Nightclub. As a group of guys that were not ordering bottle service we were shuffled around like livestock, barely had a spot to stand, and had ~75% of the club cut off to us. We ended up at the rear bar just so we could breathe.

We decided it was not worth it and dance up on the rectangular stage area inside; it's situated between two table areas.  Even though you are slightly on display and at risk of falling due to drunken stupor, you get your own space and nobody is shoving you around.

When we went, Mario Lopez made an appearance but he hung around one table of blonde chicks the entire night.  How does that work?  Do they pay him?  Does he decide on the table?

The club is stylish and has scantily clad women in rose petal filled tubs out front and dancing on podiums by the dance floor.

although waiting isn't something i enjoy, driving in la has taught me the valuable lesson of being patient. however, i don't believe in waiting in a line for hours so that i can pay some huge door man with some huge ego some huge amount of dough. i also don't believe in shoving pushing my way to get to the happy juice haven. i certainly don't believe in being harassed and vexed by anonying creeps (well, sometimes i don't mind)
 
before having to face the long line, my friend and i stopped at the laides room. i was complaining endlessly that i am too bare and that my mom will disown me if she saw what i was wearing. that's when we met these two cute random promoters who promised us "" free- no- waiting"" entry. although our mamas told us not to talk to any strangers nor to go anywhere with them. we just couldn't resist.

I would too if I always have to wait in line or always have to crowd around with the masses in this club.  I mean, it's PACKED in there, for better or worse.  However, this club is THA BOMB of Vegas, and that's why I can only come here with bottle service.  That, my friends, changes EVERYTHING.

Club itself first:
It's huge.  It's gigantic.  And it's filled with hot HAWT women.  From the go-go dancers, to the half naked women in the bathtubs, to the hostesses, to the servers, and to the clubbers.  This place is just oozing with eye candy.  There is the main dance floor with a bar.  Beware, this dancefloor is PACKED beyond belief.  You got everyone, ugly and beautiful, short and tall, grinding up against you whether you like it or not.  Tough, that's just how it is.  There are areas on the sides for VIP.  Then there's an upstairs balcony with a VIP area too, the sky booth, that is a great place to have bottle service to get away from the crowd and enjoy your own space.  There are rooms along the sides of the main floor for bottle service as well with your own curtain to separate everyone.  Then there's the opium room, which is my personal favorite for bottle service, since you're still on the main floor with everyone, but less packed and more room.  There's a bar there as well as a bar outside of that.  Then during the warmer seasons, there's Tao beach...which is unbelievable.  If you have enough people in your group, be prepared for one of the best bottle service you can get.  You'll have your own private cabana and security to kick out all the uglies that you don't want around your space.

Bottle service:
Now, I've probably only come here once without bottle service, and man, it's not fun.  But with bottle service, it's an entirely different world.  You'll be whisked away by your hostess, taken up by the elevator and lead to your tables.  From there own, try to remember and enjoy as much of the night as you can.  You will be kings.  Bottles are refilled, no one crowding you, and you have your own security.  Anything you want is at your beck and call.  Just ask, and they'll deliver.  With all those bottles pouring everywhere, how can you not have fun.

The best thing about Tao though, are the DJ's.  They have the absolute BEST DJ's on the strip in my opinion, and I've been to many.  Yes, I'm a Vegas slut.  They know exactly what to mix and how to mix and get everyone on their feet.

I was just there on Friday night and was genuinely sad to see what Tao had become. While other reviewers complain that Tao isn't ""welcoming,"" the benefit of that policy was that the guy:girl ratio was relatively close to 1:1 and the crowd was well dressed and attractive. Now, while the drinks are just as pricey, it's become a sausage fest of sweaty, thug-like guys.

The music selection seems to have followed the crowd. The DJ on Friday night was the worst I've heard at Tao in the 5 years I've been going there. Lots of 80s rock ballads. I'm all for Pat Benatar, but ""Love is a Battle Field"" is odd to hear at Tao, especially multiple times over a 2-hour period. It was on heavy rotation in both rooms on Friday. No song stayed on the turntable for more than about 30 seconds, and even then they were continuously interrupted with: ""Everyone in the house from the LA, make some noise! Everyone from the midwest, make some noise!"" Yeah. Maybe that's someone's scene. Not really mine.

If you liked clubs like ""Rain"" or the old ""Ra"" (before it became ""LAX"") then Tao will totally now be your cup of tea. If, in the past, you had a hard time getting into Tao, now is time to try again because the controls have loosened. Tao is still an amazing space, but the town has changed in the last 6 months and Tao has changed with it. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Vegas has the volume these days to support several hot clubs anymore. Tao, PURE, Jet, Bank are all losing their crowds to XS which is about the only place in town with the previous Vegas energy anymore.

The good news is the restaurant remains good. Surprisingly, it's always been one of the best values for a solid dinner in town and it continues to achieve this. The management treats large groups well (reasonable prices, lots of flexibility, comping everyone in to the club after dinner) so if you're traveling with a bunch of people who want to grab dinner and then go out then there's still no where better. The lounge these days, which is free to enter, seems these days to have a better crowd than the club itself (and definitely had a better DJ on Friday night). Finally, Tao Beach can be a lot of fun. It's not open yet this season, but if it can establish itself this year as the best pool party then maybe some of the energy will spill over to the club as the night goes on. That said, I don't know how it's going to compete with XS which has more floor space, more tables, a better pool and a more integrated dance floor.

I root for Tao to regain its former stature but... until the economy picks up in Vegas again, I fear it's going to be a pretty sad scene.",0,0,0

As the time went on, the place got super-crowded. The good thing is, though, that there were a couple of different rooms, albeit moving from one to one took some effort. The Tao beach area upstairs also had a dance floor and some spaces to sit. And it was really pretty. 

The overall decor of the club is very cute and sexy. The dance floors seem to not accomodate the amount of people in the place, though, and the DJ was hit-or-miss-- one moment the was music was great, another moment we wondered what he was thinking.

Tao was my first club visited in Nevada.  On a friday night at 1 am, the wait actually was not too bad, maybe 15-20 minutes.  A friend of ours had us on the list but we missed the time and then the bouncer said he ran out of comp tickets for the ladies. =(  So we had to pay $20, which wasn't too bad, each, even the men.  

On the following night, saturday night, the line was SUPER long.   We were just passing throug the Venetian but we noticed the the line went all around and around and around the front lobby of the Venetian area.  Lots of people dressed up to go clubbing.

The cool thing\/unique thing about Tao: There are bathtubs with flower petals - kinda weird for a club, but it looks really romantic.  Haha.  Not that you're looking for romance at a club...

Overall, it was REALLY CROWDED!!!  Especially on the dance floor- which felt like a mosh pit.  In the middle of the dance floor, it was so crowded that you could hardly move, let alone dance.  

Strangers are pushing you from every direction, trying to dance.  There are bottles and glasses on the dance floor.  The music kept changing all the time.  For example, the DJ played a song for like 30 seconds and then changed again and in between saying ""happy birthday ______blank____!!!""  which was kinda annoying.

Tao club is a 2 story club with a restaurant inside.  There seemed to be more space downstairs, where the bar was at.  Apparently, there's also a restaurant but it was closed.

It was too bad we couldn't go to tao beach!  So, can't comment on the beach.

The Decor is cool - dark and mysterious with asian influences - like statues of buddhist\/taoist statues?

I think Tao closes at 6 am, like most clubs in Vegas.",0,0,0

After you actually get in to the club, trying to get to the dance floor involves going up stairs that are so crowded you move one step at a time completely surrounded by sweaty bodies.  The dance floor is way too small and it is impossible to dance, let alone even move.  All you really do is just stand there smashed up against other people, getting stepped on with stilettos, getting elbowed, getting pushed, getting your dress caught on other girls' jewelry, and getting other people's sweat on you.  SO disgusting.  People say the bathrooms are cool, but they are not even clean!

Okay, I admit it was our fault for arriving late, but the line was ridiculously long. Even though we were on some kind of guest list, we had to wait. By the time I got into Tao, I was sober. I bought three shots, which were $12 each. I was told they were buy one get one free, so I got 6 shots for $36. I handed the chick $40 and she walked away without giving me any change. I was definitely gonna tip her, but the fact that she assumed that it was her tip pissed me off. I definitely wouldn't have had a problem with tipping her if she had the courtesy to give me my change. I cannot believe I paid $40 for shots of weakass juice. Ugh, I still feel so gypped. Plus, it's crowded as fck here with no where to sit unless you get bottle service. After I stood in line in four inch stilettos, I would've liked a place to sit or at least something to lean on!

It's worse than Highland in hollywood and I thought that was the worst club in the universe... (I actually think highland has a better\/bigger venue!)

We were here to celebrate my friend's bday in vegas. I had an injury from before so I couldn't dance (I could only bob my head up and down, lol) but figured I could at least enjoy the environment.

We knew a promoter so we skipped the line and got in without a problem. The line was long so its good to know a promoter and get on the guest list.

We got in, and realized this place has LOT of stairs. Who thought drunken people + crowd + girls in skyscraper heels + stairs is a good idea? 

This place.. is small. Or it might be an ok size, but there are just WAY too many people. I felt like I was a cattle being herded everywhere. We got on the dance floor and it was more like battling off the crowd than really dancing.

Drinks were expensive of course (3 drinks for 40) but that's to be expected.

The hiphop dance floor is ghetto as heck. It's this small ass room with low ceilings (with bunch of unsightly people.) Why the hell would you come to vegas and stick yourself in this small ass place to dance? I thought the point of vegas club was to enjoy the mega club venue?

Also there were bunch of OLD people. I'm not talking about 30's (come on that's not old) here, it was like somebody's MOM old. What were they doing here? I kept on seeing people's moms everywhere.

The worst part was the girl's bathroom.

1. the bathroom is on the floor above the main dance floor. (terrible idea) Girls + drinks + heels + lots of girls = bad ideas for life.

2. The bathroom is not really a room. It's more like a balcony above the club, ie everybody can see girls bathroom. i.e. if you want to ditch a fugly guy by saying ""I'm going to the bathroom"" guess what, you can't because he can see you from the dance floor.

3. The door is clear glass, but when you lock it it fogs up and you can't see through it anymore. Once again, terrible idea. Drunken people do not understand how to lock doors. I saw a lot of pubic hair through the clear glass doors... and everybody on the dance floor can see your hoochie too (or if you are just throwing up all night)

4. The sink is inside of the stall. If you want to fix your make up, you'll have to wait for 10000 girls to pee\/throw up before you.

5. The balcony therefore smells like the bathroom.


It was my friends birthday but we couldn't stay there very long because we hated it so much. We tried to tough it out but omg.

The decor and layout are completely chic and cool.  Was there on a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday night.  Tuesday and Wednesdays were not bad but Friday was ridiculous (see below).
If I was a 21 year old nightclub partier, I might even make this place one of my favorites, but there are three things that turned me off about this place and I will more than likely never go back on a weekend.  For one - the line was insane, and it started early.  I was there on a Friday and I was with two other males.  Forget about getting in w\/o slipping the bouncer a few bills.  We waited for like 45 minutes while many other people who came after us were let in because they had one female with them, not to be mean, but some of these ladies barely classified as women in my book.  I'm in my thirties and that alone is just too annoying for me especially since I usually spend quite a bit when I go out.  I'm just not into that scene anymore.

Moving on, my friends really want to go in, so we put some money together and suddenly the velvet rope opens for the three sausages to be alowed in.  :-)  Walk in, and it was REALLY loud, like too loud, but there was definitely a lot of energy in the place which is good.  Made our way to the bar, and we have annoying point #2, they have like four bartenders serving twenty thousand people, so we had to order a bunch of drinks and hold them or risk waiting another hour for a refill.  I

After a few drinks, we made our way to the dance floor where annoying point #3 reared its ugly head.   Way too crowded and you couldn't move.  I am 6'2"", 230 lbs and I felt like I was in a coffin.  Some people actually danced in this dungeon of a space, so I was being bumped into, pushed around, an all around crappy time at the dance floor.  One cool thing, Mike Tyson was nearby in a roped off area, and I had heard some other celebs were there as well.

I think TAO is probably one of the most overrated clubs on the strip, its super mainstream so everyone knows about it, and because of it everyone and their mom tries to go, AND gets in.

We got there fairly early, just before 12 spent a few mins upstairs at the bar over by the restrooms, just to get a good buzz going. But soon the club began to pack, and we realized our little spot would be the place to stay and dance for most of the night.

First off the club gets obnoxiously packed, to the point you are weaving and dodging people if or when we want to get anywhere. If you want to go to the restroom good luck, the restrooms are located next to the bar and are connected to a smaller space that connects to the back part of the club. It was a nightmare to get through or just exit, security yelling, people standing trying order drinks, trying to use the bathroom, trying to move or exit, a complete mess.

Then if you try and go on the main dance floor, its a joke, they pack you so close you literally have NO personal space, you have someone in back of you, next to you in, front of you. You literally are jumping up and down to the beat because you cant really dance. Security stands at the entrances to the dance floor so as soon as the floor packs, they will deny anyone entry.

We headed to one of the other floors, which was a mission within itself (again to many people), and when arriving were met with the same obstacles as the main floor.  

If you are visiting and want to make this one of the clubs you are hopping around to before you hit another club (you got a deal\/promotion etc.), by all means go to it. But don't make this your one stop club destination for the night because you will be disappointed. 

I love to party, dance and enjoy myself in a great (semi-spacious) atmosphere, TAO will definitely not be on my itinerary whenever I party in Vegas. Ever.",10,1,1

Sorry ladies but after my experience at Surrender with DJ Steve Aoki (Fridays only!), I could NOT stand the top 50 music playing over and over again. Believe me, it was terrible.

Luckily, I browsed through a few reviews and they do play music that I like, like 90s hip hop music. Hm, not bad. I love 90s music.

Anyway, as others have mentioned, this place is too crowded. The two times I was here, it was so packed. The upside was that there's a special platform somewhere near a bar that were ladies only. I think. And that was good. My friends and I hung out with other girls and danced the night away. We also got one wrist band for free drinks for an hour, and 1 more ticket for a free drink. Sweetness right?

I think I love TAO for the free drinks and for letting me and my girls skip the lines. But other than that, I think it was nothing special, and quite honestly I think I will be reviewing nightclubs in Vegas based on my experience, not really on service.

Within a few minutes someone from the club management came to us and said we can't have more than 10 people at our table. That is the most ridiculous thing I've heard. The reason to get a table is so you can bring guests over. Several of our guys had to leave our table for most of the night and hang out by the bar so we could have a few female guests over.

Originally it was a power-player of the high end nightclubs, and now it's kinda so-so...It certainly is NOT an XS, Omnia, Hakkassan type place. But you can eat there (Tao is also a restaurant), and you can drink there, and you can dance your booty off there (although you're not getting some top-flight big name DJ). 

Tao has multiple levels, with the entry level being more restaurant, walk-up bar, and lounge style place.  The upstairs is the ""club"" with a few large dance floors, multiple bars, and the main DJ area. 

- The service is decent, and always has been...though if you don't get bottle service good luck getting the attention of a server or bartender. 
- Same stuff all other bars have...so know what you want, have cash or card ready, or be willing to get overlooked and ignored.
- Mostly decent dance floor, but be prepared to be covered in glitter and smell like ass when you leave.
- DON'T under any circumstances bathe in cologne or perfume prior to coming to the club. That's nasty. Stop that.
- Please girls AND guys...keep your parts in your clothes. Honestly, there's a time and a place for all your junk to come out the trunk and the dance floor, the club, and the public ain't it...I don't care how hot you are, or how desperate for attention you are...save it for your hotel room.
- Drinks are pricey everywhere in Vegas, get over it.

- Try to have fun, relax, don't be up in people's space because they're just trying to have fun too. Make the experience better for you and everyone in your surroundings, don't be that jackass acting a fool and slowing my jam cause you can't handle Vegas.

The whole 1:1 ratio is not that bad unless you can pick up on some girls. This is what me and my friends did. We party Thursday and Friday just dancing with girls luckily I had got this FOB girls number she's Lao's. Those two girls brought us in Tao easily.

Inside Tao it was very nice there are Three floors to climb up to. Second floor was the main floor thats where all the magic happends. There are two rooms in the main floor One very small one and a Huge one if you keep on going straight. Probably around 2am They will start spraying Foam to the dance floor to hype up the people.

Since there were 8 guys in our group, there was no way in hell we were going to get in the front door the normal way.  With that said, I called Tao (the night before we were supposed to go there) and was put in touch with one of their hosts (Danny) who was really nice and got us a table.  The crazy part was that if you wanted a table near the main dancefloor, they were going for $5K and even higher so I said no thank you to that idea.  However, he said that we could get a table for the normal bottle prices but we wouldn't be near the main dancefloor which I was cool with since this place gets too crowded as other reviews have indicated.  So we just got a regular table and for 8 guys, we had to get a minimum of 3 bottles.

So, the night arrives, and we all make our way to Tao.  The waiting area in the atrium part of the Venetian was a freakin' zoo!  The VIP line was packed along the front door area and the security guards kept telling us to squeeze in more.  The crazier thing was that the normal line wrapped around the atrium twice with more people lining up (and this was at about 10PM).  So we check in and meet Danny who then takes us through the different levels of Tao which was filling up quick until we reached Tao Beach where we got a table near the dancefloor and by the aisle where everyone walks by which was a good thing.  Danny was really cool and helpful with us getting a table last minute - props to him and he even came by later in the evening to check up on us to make sure we were having a good time and that everything was taken care of.

Sitting by the main aisle proved fun because we were a bachelor party group and we flirted and teased all the bachelorette parties walking by.  I remember standing with the back to that aisle and some girl walking by grabbing my a$$ and giving me a devilish look.  As for the bottle service, the prices were comparable to other Vegas clubs.  We got a bottle of Grey Goose, Captain Morgan, and Makers Mark with some waters.  All in all, it came up to $1900 with tax and tip but that's not uncommon for this place.

Overall, we had a good time but since we were outside on Tao Beach, the weather wasn't as friendly to us.

Sadly my flight didn't get in until 11:00pm so I didn't get to the club until after 12:30pm and missed most of the bottle service my friends got. We had the hookup through a promoter and had to do the whole ""walk in"" thing. It was a pain in the butt to get me into the club without waiting on a line or paying a cover. Eventually it happened, but I would recommend doing whatever is needed to arrive with your group.

In any case, it was great once I got in. The music was a great mix of top hits and hip hop, like the day club. Our table was decently sized and we had our space away from it all, while still being right in the action. The tables near us were all really close to one and another. That normally wouldn't be a problem, unless you have super annoying table neighbors. This one dude kept sticking his hand in our faces and he eventually got kicked out. I'm sure the hand in your face creep is atypical of a normal experience though. 

Maybe it was because it was the first club of the trip and we were wide-eyed and fresh, but this night club probably the favorite for most of us. Despite a not so perfect experience for me, music makes a huge difference, and in this case it gives this review a jump from 3 stars to 4.",2,0,0

I just wish everyone got a chance to get into the club equally - like they do on the east coast.  But fortunately, we had a connection and we were put on the staff guest list.  No line, no cover - quickly inside we went.  The decor would have been worth it even if we had to wait - especially the little terrace overlooking the strip.  The staff were incredibly friendly despite their authoritative appearance.  The drinks were typical Vegas...overpriced, under-liquored.  You're almost better sticking with beer unless you really like sucking on ice cubes.  The club got packed very quickly - but everyone seemed to enjoy themselves.  The only real issue I had is the number of VIP private tables - they crowd the whole place and you're immediately made to feel like a peon once someone ""important"" shows up.

We were living in Pallazo so we got on the guest list and got in for free.

This place is a cock fest, so be prepared for that, which is weird cause while we were waiting in line, it seems like they were only letting girls in. 

There are half naked girls in the pool when you first walk in, and although you would think it would be hot, its really not. Its actually quite creepy, because they just start at you with blank faces. Looks like they're super high or something. Then upstairs, there are girls touching each other on stage, which you would also think is hot, but is actually pretty creepy, b\/c they are expressionless and seem very robotic. 

Drinks are watered down, bartender was terrible even though I was tipping her hella $$$. 

This place attracts nerdy Asian\/white guys who think they are badass, but theses are the dudes that play warcraft when they're not in vegas, so you know what I mean.

I was pleasantly surprised of how spacious this place was. First time here the lower level is more of a Lounge Area then some stairs up to the main room which was pretty packed which i don't mind.

Cons: 
- DRESS CODE, DRESS CODE!!! saw some people in t-shirts and sneakers. Idk if they are those ballers that can afford a table and get in however they want but dont expect me to get all fancy if your not going to enforce a dress code.
- One of the Bartenders by the entrance was really RUDE! some white blond chick which i asked for a drink recommendation and she just blew me off. Sorry no Tip for you then! 
- That little balcony outside is very tight, i mean i like the view but its small. 
-Once again this is one of those Table clubs, dance floor is small, and gets packed soon.
-OH! and if your dancing outside the dance floor area the guards tell you to stop. Weird!

Pros: 
- The Entrance was themed nice!
- I like the lazers and light setup.
- The bathroom staff was pretty nice.
- The downstairs area is a nice place to come back and mingle\/ relax and sit on couches and plays different music. 
   (They were playing Spanish when i was there).
- I found drinks to be cheap (Vegas Cheap) at an average of $13
- A guy bartender on back of Dance Floor gave me Free water. Thank you! He got a good tip. 
- The music was a good music im more of an EDM head but this place had good hip-hop and Electro mix which i enjoyed.

sooo crowded! They usually play a lot of hiphop which is what I prefer to dance to.. but it gets so crowded and pushy in here you can hardly dance! 

The last time I was there, a famous house DJ performed.. so not only was I kind of bored with the music.. it was even MORE CROWDED.. literally when I went on the main floor I couldn't move.. or breathe basically.. I was sandwiched amongst random sweaty strangers and was literally at the will of the crowd in terms of movement. Thank goodness I'm not claustrophobic.. (not that it was a remotely pleasant experience) 

Sometimes the other room is a good option.. even though the lower ceiling makes you feel more cramped.. its definitely less crowded. 

I love the upstairs outdoor area.. unfortunately midsummer it is WAY too hot! :( But it is much less crowded.. lots of spots to sit and relax.. music is playing so you could dance, but not many people do. Its very pretty. Also, for ladies there is often drink specials if you go early (ie FREE well drinks) 

Bring your fellas, rotate bar tenders and be conspicuous about hand offs & you can get yourself and your whole crew plenty of free drinks!!  All the guys opt for redbull\/vodka but I prefer the Pineapple&Rum or a Margarita. Both fairly strong, but still super tasty, especially for a free drink!

That said, I have complaints about things that go beyond what is normally acceptable behavior or attributes of a Vegas club, therefore I feel like my grievances are justified. 

I mean, I still had fun because I always have fun with this particular group of friends that I went with, but that aside, Tao certainly didn't enhance our experience.  

The annoyances...aite, here we goes:
- We went on a Friday night, and so understandably, the line was long.  My complaint, however, was the fact that we were a group of girls, and we had those comp passes, and the bouncers didn't really care and made that known by their asshole attitudes.  And so, I felt like the line was longer than it really should've been.  Especially for a group of all girls. 
- And that's another bullet-point in itself: the d-bag bouncers.  After standing around in heels for about an hour, we were like screw it, we're just gonna sit down on the ground while waiting.  Which I know girls don't do in Vegas because all the girls in Vegas wear shortass skirts that go up to their butt and would rather stand around in 7-inch stilettos for hours than sit.  We were like, oh whatevs, we're gonna be comfortable and just sit.   Anyway, the bouncer saw us sitting and was like, ""If you're tired, you can just go home!""  And then another bouncer saw that my friend had a bag that was bigger than normal, so he was like, ""You're gonna have to go to the front desk to check that.""  Uh...what?  WTF.  They're on some crazyass unjustified power trip!  This club loses 2 stars just for their dbag bouncers!  Let's see THEM stand around in heels for an hour!
- Once we finally got in, it was crowded as hell.  I mean, that's expected on a Friday night, but it didn't seem like most people were dancing at all.  I guess it's also hard to dance when there's absolutely no room.  Like others have said, you're a sardine.  It makes for a not too enjoyable dancing experience.  Didn't like that atmosphere, so I'm bringing it down another star.

I'm giving this place 2 stars though because at least it looks nice, there was no cover, it's quite large, and they have really awesome and awkward fogging up\/see-through bathroom stalls.  

But man, I've never met such mean bouncers in my life.  That, and the fact that it took unnecessarily long to get in, and you can't dance as crazily as you want  is what brings it down.  

I don't think my review will change anything, though; this still seems like one of the more popular clubs in Vegas.  Good luck if you come here; I hope you get to actually dance and that the bouncers aren't complete asses to you!",3,2,2

However, since we talked to a promoter, who has a booth on the casino floor, the day before, we were able to be on the guestlist which reduced a normally hour wait to a mere 15 minutes (bringing some ladies is a must to get in quick).

Once inside, I went upstairs to the hip-hop floor and straight to the bar. Getting alcohol was quick and easy but moving around definitely was not. The place is so packed, finding a spot to get jiggy with it was definitely at a premium.

I don't know if these pencil neck twerps were picked on as kids or molested by their parents; whatever it is, these lonely and insecure douchebags strive really hard to fit in and are desperate for acceptance.  

Now I know that these claims sound harsh, but it's the truth, I was just there last Friday.  Here's how it went down.  My friends and I are standing in line waiting to get in and as we approach the front of the line, one of the many Jersey Shore flunky bouncers at Tao stamps our hands.  As soon as we get our hands stamped, we skip paying the cover charge and then go to another entrance on the inside of the Venetian.  This entrance is being guarded by yet another good for nothing, image driven bouncer that will never amount to anything outside of Tao.  We simply give him a head nod and tell him how cool he is and stroll right past him and into the club.  

The lesson of this story is DON'T EVER PAY THE COVER CHARGE!  The bouncers here have no integrity, no sense on how to run a business or self esteem, so just let them know how cool they are and you're in.

I guess that I should be happy that I just strolled in so easily, but I've been a bartender for nearly 10 years, and I see the hard work and confidence in the bouncers at my clubs and quite frankly, it's disgusting to see the bouncers at Tao.

Experienced having B.Service on 3 spots of Tao... so far =P
#2. Roof Top w\/ the really far bathroom that you have to travel pass an Olympic sized pool to get too =P  but definitely a good scene to be at out of the 3 because you have AIR! at the same time getting your party on...

#3.

You have a view of the entire party and can definately people watch while getting drunk and having a great time with the people you are with.

#1. Main Floor... ground level where the dance floor is table service, rite smack center of the main.  Good thing about this spot is that its roped off and bouncers enforce it strictly! you are in the heart of the party WITH ROOM! (thanks to bouncers\/security and red rope block).

I honestly only remember vivid times when i was here.

Party of 8 guys, 4 girls. 2:1.
Worst
Ratio
EVER.


To counter the bad ratio, we had 4 guys get bottle service, thus making it a 1:1 ratio with the rest and we all get in!
Getting bottle service was easy, contacted Chris Traer, (contact information is online if you google his name) a week before our day.  Use him as a resource, he'll give you the details how to get into the club.

Line: 
Idk because i was in the bottle service line, and I just texted Chris and he came down to get me and my 3 guys. I told him about the other 8 people in my party, and he found them in the regular line and put them in a faster line.

Layout: 
Bottle service = elevator, regular people = stairs. There are two rooms, the opium room and the main floor. We had our bottle service in the opium room (which is smaller), and it was pretty nice.  I like the layout of this club. I kinda only wish that the main dance floor had another entrance to get into. I really liked the fact that the dance floors are of course packed, but the hallway in between them are just a place to lounge around, so it wasn't that much foot traffic going where you wanted to go.  

Vibe: 
Opium room played a lot of hiphop, while main floor was EMD. The decor is really nice, regardless of how drunk I was, the opium room felt a bit more intimate, while the main floor was like a large party. The main floor dance floor is crazy packed, I eventually had to leave because it was getting hard to breathe at one point. Getting drinks was whatever, I mean except 11 dollar blowjobs (woman friend ordered it, not me). Also abuse the fact that girls get free drinks from 10:30-11:30. Pass around those AMFs, TOKYO TEAS, SILVERBACKS, WHATEVERR.

TLDR: If you want to get into the club faster, do some research. Get there early, so you can stack your pregame with the one hour open bar for women. Tao is a nice club!

I was going to rate 4 stars, but i had to give it 5. All my friends have stories like one of them burning his shirt...HAHA",0,0,0

I'm more interested in having a good time, having a real conversation and making a real friend that's not based on what you drive, wear or consume.

My classmates and I had some dinner here so we could meet up with the rest of our group and get our dance on. Our reservations were for 11pm and we were seated about 20 min later.

Lucky my friend and I split the pad thai with chicken (19)-- it was a decent amount for the price, just a bit bland. 

I've walked through Tao and explored it before, but I never got to actually dance. (My guy friends couldn't get in so they waited for us to check it out)  This time, we got to dance, but I was having the worst experience ever!! First, the dance floor is wayyy too crowded. I could NOT move an inch! And then people started pushing me around. NOT FUN!! And when I had enough, I tried leaving but people were blocking every which way and I had to tell security I wanted to get out, and then he finally shined his little flashlight to make them move. THEN I look at my side sling purse and find it partly upzipped! Someone stole my friend's $60 I was holding for her!! WTH!! Good thing that's all they took. Still though, Tao has gotten so ghetto. I was so mad I got myself a drink, but of course it was so watered down. I will never come back here again!

Our table was blocked off by velvet ropes and by our own security guard who kept people from pushing the ropes and basically held down the fort, thanks! 

A bottle of Belvedere was $475 and we had a $350 credit for anything we wanted, so two bottles of Belvedere it was! So our bill came out to be $811 including tax and gratuity, please keep in mind that they do charge gratuity on each bottle being purchased. Either way it was totally worth it! 

They played good music throughout the entire time we were there, killed the two bottles within an hour and a half and then our girl gets kicked out. BOOO!!! But, it was perfect timing because we already finished the bottles, so it was off to the hotel to drop off the drunkies!

The decor, which was a predictably Asian theme, was different to say the least.  I know the Buddha always looks like a happy guy, but I never envisioned him as a party animal.  Same thought with the terracotta warriors that were lined up next to one of the bars.

It was only eleven o'clock so we thought we were a little early but apparently not judging by the over-crowded dance floors.  It was like trying to dance in a busy NY or Tokyo subway during rush hour.  Yet, you still have some people flailing and stomping around like they're alone in the center of the dance floor.

It was easy enough to order drinks at the bar because we found that the severely overpriced drinks kept the people away.  So, instead of four or five rounds, we had three and went back out to the casino.

I've been to TAO twice since turning 21 and had a blast both times. Our group was always 1:1 ratio of girls to guys or more girls. Oddly enough, us guys got in for free when it was 1:1, and we had to pay $20 when we had more girls in our group. Meh, whatever, probably depends on which promoter you use. The nice thing about having girls in your group (aside from their company) is that they can shuttle you drinks during the ""free drinks for girls for 1 hr"" period. We took advantage of that deal both times, and it makes me laugh at the large groups of guys who paid up the wah-zoo for bottle service, just to have most of it consumed by girls that come to their tables and jet off without so much as a ""thanks, losers."" I got happy-drunk both times, and didnt spend a dime on drinks.

They opened up TAO Beach one of the times I was there, and it's pretty cool. Open atmosphere, good music, and comfortable chairs to sit on while you look at the beautiful people around you. Can't beat that.

Justin took the time to explain everything and answer our questions. (I'd been to the Venetian once before but I was 19 so it was a completely different experience.).

Once inside you walk through the bistro portion (the food looked and smelled fantastic) and then up the stairs to the club.

I was more than happy to tip them with how fast I was getting my drink.

The layout of the nightclub includes multiple bars, two DJs, and a small patio. Our group hopped back and forth between the different dance floors (yes, they did get crowded but who wants to dance on an empty floor).  Also, unlike some of the other reviews I read we had no problem finding guys to talk to.  After a lot of drinking, dancing, and making new friends we decided to head back to our hotel.  As we left they had some free flip flops which were exactly what our feet needed after 5+ hours in high heels.

We had a late reservation (10:30pm).  We arrived early and had to wait an extra 20 minutes.  Reflecting on it, I was initially disappointed we had to wait, but seeing that a group of 14 wanted to eat together and the place was busy on a saturday in Vegas, I guess it was manageable.

Once seated, the server was great.  Everyone was relatively hungry and knew what he wanted.  Within 15 minutes of being seated, we had drinks and the food ordered.

I went with the raw tuna plate which was fantastic.  I wasn't extremely hungry since i visited happy hour at Stripsteak earlier in the day, so this was the perfect meal to fill me up.  the tuna was cooked perfectly.  not overdone at all.  others got the filet, sushi plates, etc and everyone commented on how well the dishes were prepared and tasted.

The kicker with eating at Tao Bistro is that you receive complimentary access to Tao Nightclub.  The group took full advantage of this.  We were given line pass stamps and briefly exited the Bistro and made our way to the club.

The bad part of the night was that the club was ridiculously busy.  almost unbearable.  shoulder to shoulder is not fun in any setting let alone people carrying cranberry vodkas and jumping up and down to music.  it didn't clear out until close to 2am, but by then who really cares if it's busy.  

All in all, i have been wanting to come to Tao for a while.  I'm glad that i finally had the chance too, but i think i'll spend the my time and money at other clubs in Vegas.

Who likes to go to clubs and having somebody constantly tell you to stop this or don't do that or move aside?  We weren't near half drunk yet so imagine if we were completely drunk.  They almost kicked out my friend but found another kid to kick ass (literally).  Drinks were ridiculously expensive but then again, who are we kidding, its vegas!

We sat and we were greeted within a minute. Our servers were friendly and knowledgeable. One of my major complaints is that it is way too dark in the place. It was hard to read the menus, the food, and we started getting tired. LIGHTS! PLEASE!

I remember the food was quite tasty - eggplant, sea bass, orange chicken and some other dishes. I can't remember because I couldn't see them!

I came here on a Friday night, and maaaaaan was it packed! It was rediculously packed. My buddy and I went with his cousin, who is a girl, and two more of her friends and cousins. For some reason the bouncer split us up. I was pissed! We tried to tell the bouncers we were with them, and they same with them trying to tell the bouncers, but they just shoo'd them in and made us wait! It's a pretty well known fact that if you go to a Vegas club with no women, you aren't getting in anytime soon. We continued to wait on for a good 30-45min! I was steaming pissed. I kept my cool though and made a few friends in the line who we just bull shitted with until we got in.

Inside is great. Huge bar in the middle once you pass the girls in the bathtubs and girls dancing\/playing with eachother. We went to the main dance floor area where then we called the rest of our party and finally met up. Best part was when we were all already buzzin pretty good and doing our thing on the dance floor then the light foam starting sprinkling down. I thought it was paper at first so I covered up my drink, but when we realized it was foam I laughed at myself. It was kind of hard to make your way around though with so many people. We tried to take pic but camera's kept on fogging up, LOL.

The music was excellent. It didn't stick to one genre. They played music from all sorts of artists and styles, and they didn't play a lot of the older music like they do here in Bay Area clubs. They were on top of the music department for sure. It went from rap, to rock, to pop, to 80's, and it was just a constant pleasure hearing the music that played. They actually played music that around the Bay Area didn't even catch wind of yet. Coming back home and then hearing it hit the clubs here kind of made me think about how behind and slow the club scene is around here. Makes me want to go back.

The decor is great. Everything followed the same theme throughout and in a unique fashion. Ligting in different rooms attracted us to go almost into each one. My buddy and I actually met a pretty cool bride to be that actually offered US drinks and to sit at their booth. My friend took the liberty in sitting at the booth and chugging down some free orange juice, while I talked to the bachleorette. It was all in fun and everyone was cool.

After about a hour of waiting, we finally got in. The bouncers weren't that nice and neither were the promotors at Tao. Drinks at the bar were at least $15 a pop. The service was pretty slow at the bar but not too bad.

There were multiple levels of dance floors\/bars and all must have been cramped to the capacity because there was NO room for anything. People were literally standing or dancing shoulder to shoulder. The DJ's were okay, not too bad. The decor is heinous and so were most of the dancers.

Sure the DJ's spin great music.  And sure the naked girls rubbing on each other in the bath tubs are hot.  But getting dirty looks from other Asian girls, and hit on by dorky Asian guys isn't so much fun.

I've never been to TAO before so my cousin decided that we should go there on our first night in Vegas. We contacted a promoter and he put us on his guestlist and told us to make it in time for open bar since it was ""ladies night"".

Having been to XS (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/xs-nightclub-las-vegas-2#hrid:5eafLkuYFaYMiOa2BRCeYA) , the mecca of Vegas clubs, TAO disappointed a bit in the decor department but it's very dimly-lit and I loved all the plush, red colors. It's a very beautiful club located in The Venetian, but just a little on the smaller side. There were different levels of the club, but we stayed in the main room. We were going to go somewhere else but I'm so glad we stayed because we got to see Dash Berlin, who was AMAZING! 

Getting drinks was easy and I really appreciated the open bar! The dancefloor was pretty crowded but when you have a big DJ, that's expected. VIP tables are located all around the dancefloor and upstairs overlooking the club. 

I'm glad we spent our first night in Vegas at TAO - between the open bar, Dash Berlin, and the new British friends we made, it was an amazing night! ;)",7,4,7

I emailed Zoe Butler about a week before we came to prepare the ""turn 21 at Tao"" deal for my boyfriend. She was  soo helpful. Speedy in response and answered all my questions clearly and promptly. I have never met her in person or even talked to her on the phone, but she was awesome and I highly recommend contacting her if you know someone who's turning 21 and heading to Vegas shortly after!

She put us in contact with Charles Jennings, who we met at the club and was also a great guy. Super friendly and quick to service us. We got into the club for free with VIP entry, picture op, free shirt, and a free round of drinks for our group of 3, 2 guys 1 girl. Also highly recommend contacting and working with Charles!

We were in by 11 and it wasn't too crowded, so I thought all the yelp reviews I read prior to coming were overexaggerations. Half hour later though the place was PACKED. I felt so squished and i was being shoved all over the place and shoving others also. Doesn't help that the dance floor is the size of a kitchen. I'm not sure why because the club definitely seems spacious and seems like it could accommodate more if it made the dance floor larger. There are also two bars on the other side of the club in two separate rooms which was nice for quickness of getting drinks but seemed a little unnecessary since they were so far form the dance floor. 

What turned me off even more about this club was the music. The DJ was terrible, in my opinion. He played music that was definitely not club music and didn't even try to make it club music. There were no transitions between songs so there would be slight awkward silences. I felt like I was listening to someone's iPod on shuffle. I just couldn't get into it and I was totally not feeling it. Others liked it but I'm sure they were piss drunk, especially the sloppy drunk girls who think they know hiphop. 

Interestingly, there is also an older scene at this club. I definitely saw people who were old enough to be my parents here, and it was a little strange. The other big demographic would be bachelorette parties and large groups of girls. Single guys tho, don't come here because these girls get pulled to the stage and just end up dancing with each other since no guys are allowed up there. 

The highlight of the inside of the club was our bartender, because she was very sweet and friendly much like the other interactions I had with the people who work for Tao. 

I probably wouldn't come here again, especially if I had to pay. Too crowded and the music sucks. If you want to go to a good hip hop club in vegas, check out the Heart Club in Omnia at Caesars Palace.",0,0,0

I was yelled at like I was a man  for not understanding which way to go..... Security guard got directly in my face to the point he spit on me. 

I have never had this bad of an experience in ANY club in any city. I suppose they could care less about people having a great experience since they bring in so many patrons. The guest celebrity host Lebron James, I'm sure would have been floored if he knew how badly people were treated.

My friend is having a bachelor party and the groom's party decided to cough up $1000 for a table here.  When I was informed of the price tag, I was not going to be satisfied with anything less than ""getting high off the table"". Well, we sure did get high, in elevation that is - our table was on the second floor. This is something akin to the emperor's box at the concert hall where you look down at common clubbers below with disdain. Now, for a thousand bucks, you'd think you wouldn't have to wait in a stupid line, but actually, we had to stand in a concise version of the regular, poor schmoe one. 

After getting through the elite line, we were whisked up an elevator to our luxurious mezzanine, replete with women's restrooms.  Restrooms with translucent doors. I exclaimed on arriving, ""are those toilets?!"". Yes, but apparently somebody changes the lighting when you go in to take a dookie so you can't see through them. Must be some European thing...

Our grand table ended up being smaller than my coffee table.  Not even an Ottoman to put my feet up on.  The stupid row seat didn't even have back cushioning across the whole length. Our table attendant was a nice lady in her underwear with an over-sized chest. I dunno about her, but it would be awkward for me to have a polite conversation with strangers and take orders in my boxers. 

I walked downstairs to mingle with the peasants, and see why anyone would spend ridiculous amounts of money and wait 45 minutes in line to get in.  Why anybody would spend more here than at a concert hall to listen to recorded Lady Gaga music is beyond me. Is it for the dancing? Yes, if you think extending your arms out and bending your knees 15 degrees and bobbing up and down is dancing. The ""main"" dance floor is a claustrophobe's worst nightmare.  People pressed against you in every direction, women, men, old, and young, the weight of the world on you. 

I managed to walk the whole club in about thirty minutes. I only found one reasonable room in one corner with the holographic budha heads (throwback to the 70's hologram craze?).  They were playing some nice recorded top 40s music and you could choose not to be pressed by people.  The strangest thing I found were the friends of our table attendant, also in their underwear.  One of them had a mime act going, she was supine on a reclined chair and moving in some sort of slithering pattern.  Another two of her friends appeared to be in a bathtub on stage.

What happens when you have more inebriated men than women? I found the answer to that after returning to my royal level, when a drunk male guest next to us decided to put on a dance show for me. Apparently, he didn't get the message from me when I turned my shaking head away in disgust and decided to do an encore. 

After two hours of this nonsense, I finished my red bull, with enough energy in me to return to Green Valley.  I give it three stars because I can't say it's worse than anything comparable since I can't recall any other club I've ever been to (albeit, not many) being any different.",3,7,2

While it doesn't have all of the glitz and glamour of its bigger and more popular brothers in Vegas, Tao is easily and hands down on of my favorite clubs ever. We discovered it on a whim while searching for nightclubs in Vegas that may play hip hop. Anyone who has been to Vegas knows how hard that is to find. 
Tao plays up on its Asian themes from its ever popular restaurant during the day and transforms into a full-fledged nightclub from Thursday through Sunday. There are old school statues and Asian symbols and letters plastered all over the establishment. 

The actual club itself isn't really that big. There is one main dance floor in the middle of the club. The dancefloor is actually quite small with table after table of VIP sections. You can tell that Tao makes its money off of VIP tables as probably 70 percent of its real estate is dedicated to VIP sections. If you are looking to host a huge party in Vegas this should be your go to establishment. They treat VIPs in style with bottles, signs, and even mobile race cars delivering selected bottles to tables. The light show is on point and there is usually some sort of live act at some point in the night with random girls dancing, river dancing or even a guy in a full mirror suit. It's all to be expected at Tao.  Also expect to be drowned in confetti, fire extinguisher air, suds and foam throughout the night almost to an excessive amount. But this has kind of become the standard in Vegas clubs so you shouldn't be surprised. 

Upstairs are women's bathrooms and even more VIP sections. The main bar is outside of the dance floor and there are some alternative ways to get around the dancefloor without walking through it but people still choose to push their way through the crowded space. Whenever there is a celebrity appearance or guest performer the dancefloor gets extremely packed and isn't even a functional dancefloor. That is really the only downside to Tao. You can also go outside to the balcony for a smoke or breathe of fresh air. Once you leave the main room you will pass random art pieces with statues and sculptures as well as sometimes live action models or giant fish in aquariums. There are two more bars in the back room if you can't get a drink at the main bar. These are usually way less crowded so if you get overwhelmed by the people you can head back here to reset. 
There is a smaller dancefloor near the last bar and some people choose to talk and dance on that floor but it's not nearly as fun or a party atmosphere despite having the same music being pumped into it from the main DJ. 

Let's get to what makes this place amazing though. It's by far hands down the best music we have heard in Vegas. From its guest DJ's to rotating regulars you will always get an amazing blend of current and old school hip hop. There are very few techno interludes and you might even get a backstreet boys throwback once in a while .The people there are always having a great time as is to be expected in Vegas but there is no extra bullshit to deal with here. The hardest part of the experience is getting into the place. Seriously if you are reading this stop what you are doing and find a way to get on the guest list for the night you want to go. If you are a guy stop what you are doing and walk around and try to find free passes to this place. Then line up like 30 minutes before they open and wait for the line to form otherwise you will be in line all night. 

It's a simple setup similar to 1Oak and the Bank but it just does everything slightly better than its competitors. I understand this may not be the type of club for everyone. Some don't like hip hop, some don't like super crowded, and some don't like waiting in line. But really if those are your issues you probably weren't looking at this place at all. Since I discovered it there is no Vegas trip that doesn't include a trip there. The bouncers are even as nice as to be expected for Vegas. 

For everyone one else looking to have an authentic Vegas night with friends this club needs to be on your list for at least one if not two nights of your Vegas weekend. One of the best clubs in Vegas and possibly the world. You owe it to yourself to check it out once.",3,0,0

I went to Vegas with a group of friends a few weeks ago, and most of them have never been to Tao. Since I had a promoter connection, I thought it would be a good idea to check it out; didn't matter anyway since we got in-house passes for staying at the Venetian. 

I'm Asian and I'm offended. 

It was my second time at Tao, and believe me, the experience didn't get any better even when slightly tipsy and with very good company. Like what other people said in their reviews, the layout at Tao is ridiculous. It's all very pretty and rose petally and giant buddha-y, but the first floor with the entrance to the club is reserved for tables only. So when you go in, you're immediately ushered up the stairs to the main dance floor and bars. First floor wasted. And that was where the giant Buddha was! Man, some people would like to have some fun around our own cultural\/religious relics, okay?

Second floor. It's literally a maze because the walkways are so narrow. It's actually quite spacious, but the dance floors are totally blocked off by one passageway with some rose petal dancers lined up against the walls. My friends and I had a bad encounter with a bartender too. Even though we had free drinks bracelets (good for before 11PM), the bartender said, no well drinks only, even though my friend got a cranberry vodka from another bartender. He said this to 3 Asian girls in front of him with their boobs practically dangling out. Geez, talk about not having yellow fever? Don't freaking work at Tao, dude. 

Dance floor sucks. I also feel like I'm squeezing my way through narrow passageways with people's sweat dripping all over me. There is a random elevated walkway\/stage that is also roped off. The bouncers and guards are so much stricter here than other clubs like XS. They're like ""no leaning against the walls"". Mister, don't you see that I was practically pushed against this wall? Not my fault! 

I guess I'm spoiled by outdoor clubs like the ones in Encore, but oh god, Tao is so suffocating because it has no ventilation whatsoever. There is a tiny balcony that 30 people pack into like sardines because it's the only escape we have. Even then, the balcony's used for smokers and all I smell is the second-hand smoke killing my lungs instead of real fresh (desert) air. 

I gave this a two-star instead of one because I'm assuming the experience is slightly better if you have the $$ for bottle service, or if you're a very available, single lady looking to work your way into one of the tables.",2,2,1

Venues alright

But...

Bouncers and security completely straight powertrip. I think our crew of 10 spent around $3000 for bottle service for a bachelor party.  We didn't expect much but were completely mistreated by security.  We had a guard who was dancing and partying as much as we were - grinding up on drunk girls [BEWARE LADIES].  He repeatedly threatened to kick us out because he thought we were ruining his game. 

What a joke right? 

Who was working and who were the paid customers?  Nothing gets me annoyed more when security and bouncers overstep their boundaries. I know they deal with drunk hoodlums all the time but by no stretch was our group classified under these terms.

We were super bummed bc the line was REALLY long. The guy we talked to must have seen the disappointment in our faces because he said nevermind and just walked us in! LOVEEEEEEEE!!!!! The club was packed yet somehow it was still comfortable, as in I could navigate just enough to not bump into anyone and still have my personal space. We got there 10 mins before open bar closed to slam some drinks down. After 11 the bartender recognized us and said she would hook us up for free still. LOVVEEEEE!!! We tipped her of course, we're not super cheap! 

The dance floor was crackin. It helped to have the ladies in the bathtub to look at when I couldn't see any good looking guys LOL. Hip hop music was on blast AND they even played some Bay Area music. LOVEEEEEEEEE! One of the guys helped us up to dance on one of the blocks so me and my girls let loose.... THEN we got taken to the VIP section by this really nice promoter. I wish I knew his name bc I would refer everyone to him. He was so cool, he took a picture of himself on our camera.. maybe ill post it on here. LOL. In VIP we got jello shots and met some cool people. LOVE LOVE LOVE! To think from not on the right guestlist to VIP... the night seriously was way better than we had planned it to be. 

Only bad thing- bathroom long line. Every club should have a bajillion womens stalls to give us that security that when we need to throw up we can do so in private and not in ice buckets. i'm not naming names.... lol but seriously. haha.

To one who is of Hindu \/ Buddhist faith, one can be torn when they see clubs putting deities into a setting where it's all about drinking, dancing, and hooking up.  Almost everything is against these wonderful philosophies that one would believe in. It's a strong sense of disrespect on their faith, but amazing to see the dedication and artwork. Don't get me wrong -  I appreciate the decor and recognition, I just don't know how someone else would feel about it.   It's like putting up Christian symbols in a club, you just don't do it (or I haven't seen it).

Anyways on with the review, I love the architecture and ambiance of this place.  It just screams being in an exotic land. The bottom floor is huge and laid nicely.  Upstairs... a different story.

It's great for being VIP...or lack thereof, but it gets insanely busy and packed. DJs are amazing and the live band is amazing.

The downstairs club is probably 4 stars, GREAT Decor, big dancing area, hot girls posing for no apparent reason, bathtubs with rose petals, very cool decor. The place was smaller than I expected and the dance floor was somewhat oddly shaped.

The upstairs Tao Beach area was ok, It didn't really seem like it was created to be a beach club. The pool was not that attractive & the hot tub area was far from the action, and the floor was PACKED with tables. There was very little space to walk around, dance, and socialize without stepping on someone. The worst was the bathroom thats located a good 5 min walk from the main area. 3 stars for the Tao Beach section. 

So as you read this, and hopefully, you are asking yourself how 3 + 4 Stars gets you 5 stars. The Table Service was AMAZING!!! In bullet point format:
- 10-15mins from arriving to getting seated (Meets Expectations)
- I complained about table location & they moved us RIGHT away & provided several options (Above Average, sadly not everyone does this)
- Kylie our Server was AMAZING!!! I've done bottle service dozens of times in many countries and she was literally the most attentive & friendly server I've ever met. Most places, bring your bottle and only check up on you when that bottle is done (so they can sell you more) or its time to pay the bill. Kylie engaged in conversation with the party, think of it as the Bartender who talks sports, or the waiter who teaches you about the food, or the barber who asks about your kids. You appreciate those people much more, and this is the first time I've seen this at a nightclub.

When we finally did get in, we were essentially walking in a straight line the entire time until we found a bar. We didn't even realize this was the first floor...the layout is very confusing as most people say.

The second floor was overcrowded. We were just standing there waiting for people to move. All the guys stepped on my feet (ladies....rethink the heels in this crowd) and one guy even spilled his drink on me and didn't even apologize. My boyfriend tried to find a place to sit, or even stand, and was yelled at by a bouncer when he accidentally walked into the VIP section.

The dinner food was better than good, it was borderline inspired, which is shocking considering it was after 11 on a Friday night, with several hundred people in utter mayhem crowd control lines out front.  Sea bass, yum.  Filet, pork appetizers, grilled prawns, wow.  Great bottle of sake.  Shabu shabu, amazing but it's a good thing I know how this works because they didn't bother to explain or do the Japanese full service thing where they make your end-soup for you.

Decor was extensive, expensive, and strong.  Both the dining room and the club above are vast, dark, multi-leveled, dramatically lit.  The dining room has huge, color saturated artistic photographs of Tibetan monks and other ascetics -- a little jarring considering the excesses below.  There's a koi pond, a wall (say, 50 X 20 feet) decorated with some kind of antique clay pipes, each in a cubby hole with a pin light.  Tended bathroom.

Service was confident and professional, dramatically good looking waitstaff (ours seemed to be in African garb) but completely overwhelmed by the crowd.  Our meal came 2 hours after our reservation, but it's that kind of place.

After dinner we talked our way into one of the many VIP area upstairs.  Don't remember much about the music, some kind of mashing from the 80s, which is all the rage among club goers who aren't really partiers.  There was a big tub full of flower petals and a mostly naked Japanese-ish girl making bath motions.  Other assorted attractions.  Again, very dark.  Porn stars and their entourages were spending a lot of money on bottles, Johnny Walker Blue, etc.

Bar prices are quite reasonable, far lower than similar Vegas or New York clubs -- $6 or $8 for well or wine (yes, they have Syrah, Savignon Blanc, etc, not just white and red), $9 or $10 for signature drinks.  But it all added up to $135 a person anyway.

The one star is for getting in free, and the potential Tao Beach may have if the weather was warmer. Oh, and because I dont' think they offer the option of negative stars. Other than that, the place was AWFUL.

First off, you have to climb three flights of stairs to get to Tao Beach...come on, even older clubs like PURE knew to install elevators! And you had better hope that you don't need the restroom all night, because Tao Beach itself does not have one. They make you walk over to the hotel pool areas that are closed off , almost a 15 minute walk in heels, 10 if you just take those damn shoes off. The music was kind of soft, but that was because it's outdoors, so I think they should get a better sound system.

So the weather was a little chilly so my friends and I went down to Tao itself. Again with the stairs. And they have people trying to climb up to Tao Beach, so it was crowded. They had to have a kind of cattle shuttling system to coordinate the traffic flow in the stairwells. It was annoying at best. The music indoors was better, but god is it crowded. The decor wasn't all that great either, but there's a bunch of girl on girl action in the corners with their models and naked ladies in rose-petaled bathtubs, so I guess that somewhat made up for the other decor...lol.

There was no way u could move without jabbing at people, or being jabbed at.

He turns around, screams at me being a complete asshole, and tells me no because you went to the wrong line. I told him the other staff member sent us to this line and that's it's not fair. He continued to be an asshole. Finally I said, I don't care I'll pay full price, just get us in, it was 102 outside. 

It was my husbands birthday and he loves DJ mustard, who was at Tao that night. I decided, let's get a table once we went inside. I kept asking staff, who do I talk to to get a table? Sent me all the way to the entrance only to be ignored. Finally one of their douchebag ""managers"" came, looked at me up and down, and said yeah we have one for 1,500 on the second floor.. I said we'll take it, pulled out my ID and card.. then out of nowhere, he left and said hold on. He left us there waiting for 45 min! He never came back. Finally I saw him again and asked him, are you going to sell me the table or what? He all
Of a sudden said he only has one table left for 3500. Really??? I would have taken it if you didn't make me wait for 45 min And the only reason you came back was because I had to flag you down! 
We left and had more fun at the bar downstairs at the casino!

However, a few new clubs have opened since then, including Marquee at the Cosmo that beat it in a few key categories.

Getting in was a huge pain. The line was ridiculously long and moved ever so slowly. We must have been on line for about an hour or so, and this was on a weeknight! The day we went, girls were supposed to have open bar until a predetermined time (can't remember if this was all girls or if we just got that through a promoter). Anyway, I was surprised to see that they actually did honor this as advertised. Of course, as expected, the bar was absolutely mobbed, so the lady friend I was with was only able to get 1 drink before the deadline.

The inside rooms were packed with people. Good music, but hard to maneuver around the dance floor. Very nice decor throughout. My favorite part of the club was the outside section. Not nearly as crowded, and a nice nighttime view of the Strip.

I like Tao more than a few other places I've been to in Vegas (most notably LAX and Lavo), but it's far from being the best place in Vegas.",0,0,0

The seperated floors and different dance rooms made for interesting ventures as we made our way through each room.

A place where you wanna go if you wanna get dressed up and look your finest. 

The interior design was nothing short of amazing. The chic look that exudes from Tao makes you feel like you're from The Hills. The chinese statues that are spotted all over the place and the private booths definitely add on to the experience. The place is huge by the way. So, if you go with a group, expect to lose a few people. 

The smoking patio is breathtaking. Basically a narrow balcony but you overlook the front of the Venetian and bask in all it's architectural glory.

The music, meh. Typical top 40's hip hop crowd pleasers. As the night gets late, they start to get into the house techno for those E droppin' party goers that are pullin' all nighters. But hey, it's nothing I didn't expect.

I am dead serious about getting a receipt! Despite the long line..I didn't wait in line and got in immediately but I did have to dish $20 for cover. After 5 minutes of pure hell and seeing people just standing around looking for Christina Aguilerra or whatever stupid celebrity was supposedly there (I didn't see her btw) I told my friends it was time to leave. They insisted there was a cooler party upstairs where the pool was.. so we walked up there and the pool area was closed! 

I went back to the entrance and asked the bouncer for a refund and with a smirk on his face he said ""Well do you have a receipt?"". What a jerk! So, definitely get a receipt for next time! 

I left this place after 5 minutes. It was full of followers\/posers and there wasn't even anyone dancing.. just people standing around wanting to be seen or god knows what. Pure crap.

 It was a nightmare on my both visits and now forced to say I HATE IT! Complete waste of precious time in Vegas when there are so many other nice clubs like XS and Tryst. The reason to hate this club is due to the overly packed dance floor, irrespective of long weekend or any regular weekend.  

The first time wanting to check out this so hyped club in Vegas is forgivable. The decor is definitely worth giving a look. The huge Buddha statues, lighted candles and beautiful girls inside rose petal bathtubs, gives this place a great sensual feel.  No wonder Tao being my first Vegas club i was completely dazzled. The lounge downstairs is more relaxed, with great hip-hop music playing and the bar too is never too crowded. 

After a few drinks at the downstairs lounge we moved up the stairs to the actual dance floor and from here on things turn into nightmare. On both the visits the dance floor was so packed with people that there was no place to keep our foot. We tried pushing in through the crowd to get to the dance floor a few times, and very attempt was a failure. Got pushed in with the wave of people and thrown out with the crowd trying to get out. In the process got stamped,elbowed and trashed!!! HELL - this is more of a battlefield than dance floor!! 

The revisit to Tao for my friend's bachelorette the second time was sheer stupidity. Wanting to have a good time with my girl friends turned into a frustrating ordeal and had to come out of the club within an hour due to overcrowded dance floor. 

Lesson learnt - END of Tao in Vegas for me for sure! 

Note for the rest:

1. Cover is $20 for girls and $30 for guys. 

2. If you are in the guest list get in before the guest-list closes at 12!! Else stand on the line and pay cover.

3. Visit Tao to experience the beautiful sensual Asian interior. Go early by 9pm when its not crowded and enjoy the FREE open bar for the ladies for an hour, think around 10-11pm. The lounge downstairs is more relaxed, best place to sit, grab a drink and enjoy the music.

5. Upstairs dance floor is the actual HELL pit after 11, so overcrowded that dancing is all about getting trashed!  If you want some leg shaking, go early and grab a spot on the dance floor for your group by no later than 11.

6. If you are in Vegas only for the weekend best advice would be to go to XS,Surrender or Tryst instead where you can breathe, dance and have fun.

Alas--the club has *great* music.  Perfect dance music if you like Top 40 stuff.  It has plenty of dancers who are too short to be showgirls, I guess...and a very interesting display of women in bathtubs with rosepetals glued onto them with oodles of men drooling (which is hysterical since one is surrounded by strip clubs and revues...why not go there for this but sigh....)

The men I found to be thus pretty horned up and grabby--I have never been grabbed so many times on a dance floor and literally pulled across the room.  That's not my scene so that got old after about the 5th time it happened.  

When I figured I may punch the next guy who touched me, I headed for a bathroom break.  The bathrooms are out of the way and have pretty cool doors that frost when you lock them.

This club is my favorite in Vegas. The aesthetics are UNBELIEVABLE! I love hanging out on the balcony right next to the main dance floor and looking out at the strip. Tao Beach is the best place to go at night over the summer, but unless you have a table, have fun waiting 30+ minutes in line for a $18 Vodka Red Bull. The decor blows my mind and the go go's in the bathtubs with rose petals on their jumblies (1997 Austin Powers in reference to Fembots) add a real sexy touch. The DJs here always crank the best hip hop from the last two decades. 

*DISCLAIMER* Call the club earlier in the day and try to get on the VIP list so you don't have to wait in a line that usually stretches forever. You'll have to arrive before 10PM which is super early for Vegas, but if you show up at midnight, good luck getting in before 1:30.

My friends and I almost decided not to go this night, and I know I would have missed out like crazy. First of all, Snoop Dogg was there that night......... How was I gonna miss my man performing??!!! It ended up being our best night in Vegas thus far. 

I noticed that many reviews talk about how crowded this place is and blah blah blah. Yeah, the place is crowded. So is everywhere in Vegas. I mean, it's Vegas. Push through the crowd and stop complaining. We had just barely made it during open bar (like seriously within the last MINUTE) so that started off our night very wonderfully. After our first attempt to push through the crowd, we decided to go upstairs instead and got scouted out by some dudes with a table, why not? Chilled on the second floor and realized the one inconvenient thing about this place....the bathrooms oh my god. They sucked so bad, honestly who came up with the stupid idea for having bathrooms outside and having to wait in a big fat line each time. It was the most counterproductive shit, and it was making me really angry. Another thing was the multiple flights of stairs, how are drunk people supposed to make that trek up and down? I managed but it was pretty difficult. 

The decorations of the place were so elaborate and the way the show was done honestly made up for it all. There were like people hanging from the ceiling and crazy shit going on during the performance that I forgot about anything and everything I had been complaining about. I was literally right in front of Snoop Dogg and the bouncers were super mean and yelling at me for trying to get closer but whatever, I had the most amazing time!!!

One reason I hate this place so damn much was that after waiting in the guest line, Kevin Federline shows up and cuts me. Are you kidding me? It I told you I fucked Britney Spears, would you let me cut too? He's not even relevant anymore.

I have to agree with other reviews that the ""quality"" of the talent has definitely decreased in the last few years, but nonetheless, Tao is still one of the best clubs to go to. With 2 different rooms on the main floor, the downstairs ""lounge"", and Tao Beach (only open during the summer months when it is warmer), there is definitely a lot of room to wander around. I'm more of a fan of going to Tao on Thursday nights (industry\/locals night) and reserving the newer mega clubs for the weekend (as do most other club go-ers).

Overall impression was positive, interesting place, nicely decorated, would come again. 

Got completely packed, however. Also, was a little annoyed by a slow roll-out. Doors opened 10pm, but not much was happening in the beginning, except waitress girls imitating dancing on elevated surfaces. After those went to attend to the tables, became even quitter. At about 11pm the ""decorations"" appeared, I mean girls in tubs. At about midnight, the first two gogo dancers climbed on two big speakers in the corners of the dance floor. Strange timing, as the party did not really need encouragement at that point, as it was already so packed that was hard to walk not to say dance.

Ok so my friends and I have been going to vegas since we turned 21 a few years ago and we usually make it a point to go to TAO especially if we fly in on a Thursday. Well that will not be the case any longer and here is why.
 The last time we went to TAO they would not let me in. I guess they thought that my I.D. was fake or something. Now I am well over 21 and I have had this same I.D. for 3 years. The bouncer was rude and didn't tell me why he wasn't letting me in (although I could figure it out) I am a human being you could have the decency to tell me why you are being stupid and not letting me in with my I.D. Also they kept asking if I had another form of I.D. come on now, how many people really carry two forms of I.D. (and of course I wouldn't be carrying another since the I.D. was my I.D. and I did have my medical card but apparently that's not ok, but come on now why would i be carrying someone else's medical card) When I asked they said I could check with one of the head security guys and if he says the I.D. is ok then I could go in, but he didn't even really look at the I.D. so clearly there is no second chance. I will not be returning to TAO, but I am not disappointed because it's always too crowded and smokey. F*@! you TAO security",3,0,0

It's ranked the #1 club in the nation (not sure what factors are taken into consideration but it boasts the ranking nonetheless), so expect a crowd, even though the place is pretty big.  The decor is breathtaking, obviously Asian-themed, and definitely worth exploring if you haven't already.  But if you don't know someone who can get you in almost immediately, then plan to get there early, and plan to be bored silly until the crowds start pouring in.  When the place does fill up though, it FILLS UP-- people get pushy, so drink fast and be prepared to lovvvve everyone in the club, since that's how close you'll be to them.  I always have a good time though, just secure a walk-right-in entrance before going so you're not cranky by the time you get in!

Ladies, if you want your dancing experience to have minimal groping, I suggest to get on that ""stage"". I don't think anyone that stepped out on the dance floor made it out alive.

Or if you can't get on stage, have one of your cute homegirls catch the attention of some dudes with tables, worked for our group! 

The upstairs area was pretty cool since you get fresh air. I was pleased with the choice of music (outside and in the club), it was mostly hip-hop. I can't dance to that house shit.

DJ Vice was spinning and we were staying at Palazzo.  We booked through our casino host who plugged us into the club's host Robert.  This was my first time at Tao and our group had just gone to Marquee the night before.  People had told us that Tao was now a 2nd\/3rd tier club and couldn't compare to XS, Marquee, or Hakksan.  However, it was one of the few places that did not just have EDM.  We got there and met Robert at 10:30pm.  He whisked us into the club and gave us all of the different table options.  We decided to go all out and booked an awesome table on the main dance floor (right across from the DJ booth).  We were introduced to 3 different servers ( a tad confusing at first) and our security guard Mike.  From that point on, we received awesome service.  Robert hung around for a good part of the night making sure all was good.  The table was awesome and the club was pumping.  The best perk was having Mike escort us to the restrooms.  There were always long lines for both restrooms, but we were ushered right in.  It was even more helpful when the club was in full swing and the place was a zoo.  We had ample space at our table and it was awesome not to be crammed next to 15 dudes (see my Marquee review).  You could tell that Tao could not compare to Marquee, XS, or the other newer clubs were their light\/smoke shows.  But the music was bumping and there were tons of people.  We enjoyed the night actually more than at Marquee.  This was probably due to our awesome table location and the services of Robert, Mike, and our servers Anita and Shannon.

This is one of my favorite nightclubs of all time.  

The vibe, the scene, the decor.  Where do I start.  Everything has an intimate, sexy, appeal to it.  Yeah, I'm not really a fan of the girls who's job it is to soak in a bathtub or massage one another, but even feminist me finds this place to be absolutely addicting!  The Buddha statues, the artwork on the wall, even the bathrooms are cool here.  Rose petals, water, candles, and other touches make Tao intensely seductive and intimate,  yet it has a lot of square footage and plenty of room.   

If you have guys with you and you have to wait in line, I suggest going into Tao restaurant and ordering a drink from the bar.  No, you can't sneak into the club from the restaurant, but you can take your unfinished drinks in a plastic cup outside with you before you wait in line.  One tokyo tea later, *wow is that strong* we were inside the club.  Where does the time fly.... lol

my only complaint is that they tend to play a lot of trance music here, which can get old.  but that's minor, really.

Check out tao beach upstairs, as it is open at night and is a good place to get some air and smoke a cig (if you smoke).  There's also a bar up there if you don't feel like waiting downstairs.

Five stars for my promoters!

This club can get extremely crowded. Changed the layout of the main room so you can see the DJ from most tables and the front entrance. Hip hop room is also very crowded. I wouldn't actually recommend this club if you didn't have a table! 

The bathroom lines here are crazy! Just like any other club, but you stand in line for girls on the second floor and you can look at the crowd below. It's almost inconvenient where it's located and people have to walk by for their tables. Generally not too bad. 

Bouncers here are more strict than the other clubs I've been to, so just beware. 

Decor is darker and red - obviously Asian themed. Lots of girls sitting around posing. The DJ main stage has better lighting and effects now.

I booked a table here for my bachelorette party.  Even though we paid extra for the guaranteed main room table placement, we still weren't in the desirable table area and were pretty much in the hallway, which was annoying after paying so much extra for what I thought was one of the good tables.

The service at the table was great - we got brought in quickly, our security\/ drink pourer guy was great, waitress was very friendly.  

As a girl, I like to wear very high heels.  And at Tao that was no exception - I wore my 5 inch high stilettos and as usual enjoyed attempting to look like I could walk in them while drinking.  TWICE I was brought to the ""drunk girl"" area and told that I am too drunk, clearly cause I was stumbling in my shoes.  They made me take my shoes off, walk in a straight line, and talk to them for a bit to I was completely fine, which I was.

It was extremely frustrating that after paying a shit ton for a table to be carted off and told I'm about to get kicked out for not being able to walk in my shoes, just to twice have them confirm I'm completely fine.  There were nicer, better, and faster ways to handle that situation.

The dance floor was REALLY packed.  IMO I think it is too small as it was almost impossible to move around out there.  I would have preferred a little more room.

Also as part of the bachelorette package, I was supposed to get a cake, and the cake never came.  I complained the next morning and they sent the cake to my hotel room which was nice but it didn't arrive till after we went out for the evening which was annoying

Tao is so dark, you cant even see what's in front of you. I'm just glad the staff were very nice, they guide us with their flashlight. And of course, wimpy guys took advantage of the situation, I felt hands grabbing my thigh as we walked past by. I actually felt sorry for those guys.

One: There were three dance floors and the smallest one i LOVED!  Well all my friends loved.  I guess it was the mid 20's and above room where all they did was play old school rap and 90's r&b...i mean like soul for real run dmc!  it was so tight.  

Two: Diverse crowd.  Everyone was having a fun drunken ass time at the club. 

Three: The really nice bartenders and security guard on the balcony.  I forget his name.  But they were all so very nice and made our stay in the club for the first hour or so pleasant until everyone bum rushed in and stole our hospitality.  But everyone deserves some love right?

the CONS-no stars for two reasons

One: the massive crowd!  even though i had stated above everyone was having the time of their lives, it was so sardine packed in there i couldn't breathe, couldn't get to any rooms without drinks spilling and girls stepping on my shoes with theirs. i think one guy even wiped his sweat across my forehead. i know its not a party without people but damn THAT many people is ridiculous! couldn't dance unless i had my hands in the air and did a jiggy to two inches to each side of me.  i don't think thats very fun.

Two: music!  i mean they had me at hello playing all that cool ass music in the small room then they had to switch it up to tracks to same as the main dance floor.  I guess with the overflow of people they had to play the same music from the main floor since there was literally no more room to move.  getting out of the club was worse than getting in too.  drinks were pricey but tasty.  but never again will i go to such heights for tao.

so i guess its fair.  you can say to yourself that you've experienced tao if you go here.  not really anything unusual than any other club i've been too except the women bathing in tubs in the middle of the stage like a softcore porn movie.  but nowadays you can always download that stuff off the internet.",0,0,0

Well if you can see my old review from 2011...Tao has been around for a while! In fact it's been open for more then 10 years which is almost unheard of in the nightlife industry. 

Tao is still a solid choice but the caveat is...you have to do bottle service. The general admission experience here sucks because the club isn't as large as other newer venues and it gets insanely packed. The good news is that any reputable host should be able to offer you some great bottle service minimums and deals here. Depending on the night, a minimum of $1000 should be able to secure your table in the main room which is where the action is...there are many random tables in the hallways and you definitely don't want to be that far away!

Tao is also promoting their new bottle service concept called ""V.I.WE"" which is a ""shared"" bottle service experience. Essentially you are paying for an open bar wristband but you get your drinks from select table areas with other people who purchase the wristbands. Yes, the alcohol is UNLIMITED (Vodka and Tequila). It's only about ~$100 for males and ~$50 for females so not a bad deal at all.

Tao is definitely a Vegas mainstay and although it lacks the appeal of some of the newer nightclubs, it's still popular. As mentioned, based on my MANY YEARS of clubbing experience...I give it a 2 star rating for general admission but a 4 star rating for table service experience. If you're on a budget but still looking for a VIP experience, Tao is worth a look!

Where should I start? 

Our buddy made a reservation here for dinner so we can get in the club. Note, you have to spend $30 dollars at dinner to get into the club. Everyone has to order something. That's fine...since it's expensive to get into the club anyways. The bad part starts after dinner - You get a stamp on your wrist to get into the club...or so you think. When you get up the stairs to the ""club"" area, the bouncer tells you that's not the right stamp to get into the club. It's the stamp to get in the ""fasttrack"" line to get into the club. Okay... so after waiting in a short line to go upstairs and find this out from the bouncer, we head outside of the club and realize there is a pretty long line to get back into the club and get the ""correct"" stamp. After waiting about 30 minutes of that, its back to waiting in line on the stairs to get into the actual club area on the second floor. Keep in mind, the other line without dinner or table service DOES NOT MOVE. AT ALL. If you think you can just stroll in at its peak hour, you are SOL.

Anyways, we finally make it to the club area - it should be all gravy right? WRONG. There is not an inch of space to move around in this overrated, overhyped, overCROWDED club! On top of that, the bouncers are telling everyone to move all the time and keep the hallways clear...but there is nowhere to move to! The way it's set up, it's a narrow hallway once you enter with the big bar on the left. You have to turn 3 corners to actually get to the dance floor. We never even made it there because we couldn't get through all the people. The bathroom lines are insane because of the overcrowding. It's impossible to get a drink since you can't tell where the lines start and where people are just standing. It's shoulder to shoulder action up in this joint. 

The funny thing about this whole ordeal is, one of the people in our party didn't have a dress shirt so he had to go back and change while we were going through this process. I guess the dress code is pretty strict. When he finally got back 40 minutes later, we were all just about to get out of there and he was pretty pissed lol. I think Alli G. put it best when she wrote:

""If you want DANCE and BREATHE and have FUN, go elsewhere. But if you want to be pushed around and smashed between large crowds of people, while staring at some chic in a bathtub, TAO is your place!

Seriously, if you want to get your dance on, this is not the place. The only reason I can think of going to TAO is to say ""Yea, I've been to TAO.",3,1,1

We got there around 10pm and opted for bottle service after seeing the looooong line of guys waiting to get in.  We figured we would spend a good hour waiting in line with no guarantee of getting in.  

We managed to get three girls to go up to the front of the line with us and got a bottle of goose so we wouldn't have to stay in line.  The bouncers were kind of nice and let us in.  We got escorted up a couple of stairs to our table near the dance floor.  

The club is well laid out and the decor is nice.  Like some of the yelpers around here said, there's a couple of girls dancing in bathtubs wearing rose petal bikinis.

The music varied greatly from Snoop Dogg to Lady Gaga to Techno.  We had a great time and we only had to pay for one bottle of goose ($350 plus tax\/service).  After we finished the bottle, we did have to go to the bar and order individual drinks which they were a little expensive for the amount of alcohol your getting.

The one thing I did not like about this club or this particular night was the amount of douchebags running around.  I saw a guy grab a girl's ass and then run to the bathroom, there were a couple of those idiots wearing sunglasses in a dark club and countless guys trying to freak girls at the dance floor who were obviously not interested in them based on their body language, oh well, i guess its VEGAS..

We went with a group of 3 girls and 8 guys. The doormen refused us even entry to the line to pay because the ratio of guys to girls was too uneven. However, they happily let another group of 8 girls and 3 guys waltz in. Isn't that sexual discrimination? So then we tried to change it up and then the doormen refused us admission again this time because our attire wasn't up to code. However, our other friends already got in line ahead of time in the SAME ATTIRE! Difference? Friends ahead of us were white and we were Asian. Sexual and racial discrimination at TAO.

But I was reminded by a recent article in a SF mag- boasting how great this place was...I tell you it was NOT!  Please bear with me at this tirade of dissatisfaction and disgust.

First we ate at the restaurant Tao- yes the food was very good and the service of our 1 waiter was excellent.  He was funny, informative, and accommodating- and he was the only one.  

Service of the restaurant host- unhelpful.  We were a bunch ladies there for a bachelorette party and just spent $800 + tip on our dinner and requested to be placed on the guest list of the club Tao.  He said that he could only get us on the VIP line; therefore we still had to wait and pay the club entry fee.  A few months before- I was at Tao again for another bachelorette party and that time they comped us our entry and just let us walk into the club, but this was before their renovation and subsequent high falluting attitude.  

Service of the club host- arrogant and insulting.  We realized 10 mins into club Tao the only way we would enjoy our stay there was to do ""table service"". We asked a club worker to please send the host to us.  After 30 mins he showed up and asked us, ""You want a table?"" --- No hello, no thank you for coming to Tao, just ""you want a table?""  We said yes, and he said haughtily that it was a two bottle minimum and its $500 a bottle, we deliberated with the girls and said yes.  He lead us on a maze to another room where they were playing house music and said here was our table- we were a little disappointed because we wanted tot stay in the main room where they were playing hip-hop and R&B, but he said this was all he had, although it seemed to us there were many available tables in the main room- like 15 or more mind you!  With annoyance, he said he had other people to help and did we want the table or not- we said no and he took out the envelope where he placed my sisters' credit card and flicked it in her face- really.

Over all service: in a place where service is everything because there are so many choices- how are you going to differentiate your establishment from the others. Taos choice was to treat their guests as if they should be lucky we got in and not that Tao was fortunate we chose them.

Ambience, dcor, and overall presentation: disturbing.  The name Tao:  Tao n. In Taoism, the basic, eternal principle of the universe that transcends reality and is the source of being, non-being, and change.  Taoism n. A principal philosophy and system of religion of China based on the teachings of Lao-tzu in the sixth century B.  ""The way of life"" according to Lao-tzu (book) --- he would be ""sadden by this tragic perversity.""

With a giant Buddha in the main dining hall- a symbol of detachment from materialism among other things, you are surrounded by opulence.  Candles lighting your dining experience to evoke peace and serenity, you are bombarded with the Paris-look-a-likes and her mother- Mrs. Hilton who truly was in the ladies room talking it up (celeb sighting).  And as you walk to the bathrooms you are exposed to a gallery display of Buddhist monks- people of whom are the epitome of asceticism.  AND when you go up stairs to the club- you have Asian 'girls"" dancing on stage in a ""pick & choose"" line reminiscent of any TV show Investigation like 60Minutes or 20\/20 Special- ""Thailand & Prostitution"".  Have you seen the naked girl in the bathtub?  My impression, she was put there to be enticing but in reality it was depressing.

Irony: I wanted to go to Babylon.  I enjoy my time in Babylon.  And furthermore, I enjoy contradictions which is what Tao is...but Tao doesn't get it right- if your pedaling Asian ""services"" and exploiting their culture,  at least in a Thailand Brothel no one leaves unsatisfied.

You need a fabulous space.

Fabulous people.

Fabulous prices.

And lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.

Tao - was an impressive fabulous space, but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded, but not much was happening) were short of fabulous, we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service, and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.

So overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.

There were two creepy baths, boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. 

With no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.

If you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. 

But if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.

I've actually come to this club on a separate occasion during a Thanksgiving weekend so I kind of knew what to expect.  Asian theme, girls in bathtubs, a packed dance floor, and a crowded bar.  Yup, Vegas.

Being Asian themed, I did see a good amount of Asians, but not so much where it felt like the majority.  The demographics were very mixed and well balanced in my opinion, as I think Vegas is as a whole.  This city is so great at bringing all sorts of people together!

Arriving around 10:30pm, the line was already ridiculously LONG.  Like wrap around the hotel, wait an hour in line LONG.  So make sure you get there early!  There wasn't a special event there or anything; just the fact that it was MDW I guess.  A plus was that girls got in free with the guest list (just talk to a promoter), but because it was MDW and guys wanted to make SURE they got in, the guys in our group bought pre-sale $40 tickets (though I'm honestly not sure if they needed it).

Once we got in, we saw that the dance floor was pretty packed.  We headed to the bar since ladies could drink free til midnight!  We girls definitely took advantage and drank up!  HUGE PLUS since most Vegas clubs will charge $13+ per drink!  So lesson learned: make sure you talk to a promoter to find out what kind of specials are going on.  Even though Tao might not be the most ""happening"" (new) place as Hakkasan, XS, Marquee, etc., I will definitely take free drinks over all those overly busy clubs, PLEASE!

Decor in comparison to the ""newer"" clubs is a little lacking, but still a clean(ish), classy place.  The dance floor does get a little hot and sweaty (gross) though, but that's probably because it's so big and always so packed.

Second time I came here was for a friends' Birthday dinner. Made reservations for 9 30 .. surprise surprise didn't get seating until like 10 30 -___.-. thanks for the compliementary one drink for waiting so long. We missed open bar at the night club at this point. Dinner was okay. the food was good. but not anything spectacular. Lets just say I had a lot better and for less money. The place is beautiful , but its so dark you can't really tell. Thank goodness for nice people who let us in their bottle service. Next time, just go for open bar and leave. They really don't care about you .",1,1,1

I guess living in L.A. for long periods of time does spoil you, with that said it would of took a group headless Samurai chefs to prepare and slice my meat at the table to impress me here but I digress.

The best thing I had by far was the Kobe beef sashimi, this was superb the meat was melt in you mouth tender tore by the chopsticks me and my partner devoured this quickly. For my main 
course I chose the mandarin fried rice with duck, wasabi crusted filet mignon with the blandest tempura onion stack I've ever had.. (ahum) 
This was just pretty much what I expected though, the wasabi doesn't really come thru much at all so its basically just a crusty mess on top of your filet

The rice was equivalent to 1$ Chinese in my book and my partner had the coconut shrimp which I cant stand at any restaurant so Ill bite my tongue now... =)~ Their Lychee martini was slamming though!  Same as for my Sake, cant remember which one?

I liked the decor we sat right  on the upper level directly across from the Buddha with the pond, eye candy for the soul... and its Vegas so you cant help but to love the random drunks screaming at the top of there lungs occasionally while you fine dine Bravo!!",1,3,1

From the minute you want in you are surrounded by gorgeous half naked girls in tubs of rose petals and a dimly lit hall way.  The entrance is their lounge\/bar, but don't bother stopping unless your waiting for your dinner reservation.  Head up a zig zag stair case and emerge into the club full of Asian influenced and inspired architecture, art and ambiance.  The music at Tao is standard for Vegas Night clubs, a mix of pop, hip hop and rock and roll.  Nothing too special, but great to dance too.  The club has a couple separate rooms throughout and a balcony with a view to die for!  The dance floor is a little small for my taste and at peek hours is packed, but what popular club isn't?  There are a few bars spread throughout the club, but the bar beneath the candle lit ""Terracotta Warriors"" is a great place to take a pic.  The drinks are a little more pricey than average, but not bad all things considering.  The bathrooms are on the 2nd floor and please don't forget to lock the door, or the dance floor below will get an unexpected peep show. Tao is the by far the prettiest and most romantic clubs in all of Las Vegas!


My experience with a large group of my sorority sisters:
  My girls and I have been here a few times together.  We've never had to wait in line or pay cover to get in so the night always starts out on a high. The crowd is a little more attractive than other clubs.  There are dozens of VIP tables full of men ready to pass out a free drink or 2 to a group of girls.  Tao is a great place for a large group of it's easy to split up and then meet again at the front entrance without a problem and the best part is the Grand Lux Cafe for drunk waffles after a hard night of flirting, dancing and drinking for free!  I would defiantly recommend Tao for a girls night out, it's easy to get in (if you work it right), easy to get drinks for free and easy to have an absolutely blast!

My experience with my fiance:
 If you don't have a large group of girls to get to the front of the line with, definitely take advantage of eating at Tao before the drinking and dancing.  The first time we went we made late dinner reservations and then asked our waiter for front of the line passes.  After dinner all you have to do is get you hand stamped go downstairs pay a reduced cover and enjoy!  The next time we went we stood in line, but the line is well regulated and we didn't wait long.  (I have to give Tao props on this).  It's a little hard for guys to get drinks, so as usual I have get them, but that's how it always goes, he pays and I order.  Some random guy even offered to pay for me and my fiance if I could get the bartenders attentions and order for him, because he had been waiting for 20mins with no luck.  I did it and got 2 free Grey Goose on the Rocks, just for being a chick.
Great place for couples, so enjoy dinner and get into the club quickly to enjoy a wonderful night!",5,1,0

Cons:  Can't think of any right now

My friends and I went here last weekend and it was pretty cool.  I've tried getting into this place 2 times before with no luck.  It wasn't because of a long line either (i.e. friend's were way too drunk to get in and friends being dramatic).  Anyway, that's a story for another time. Compared to other people's reviews, we didn't have to wait too long because we went here early and we were on a guest list.  

Anyway, Tao is your typical Vegas club.  The decor was really nice and there were multiple rooms.  I don't remember drinks being overly expensive, but I was pretty buzzed so who knows.

The best part, in my opinion, was heading up to to Tao beach.  I heard they do something similar to Rehab at the Hard Rock during the day.  During the nighttime, however, I guess they open it up for people who are in the club downstairs.  Anyway, it was pretty cool.  They have several couches you can sit on and its right next to the pool.  The bar wasn't too crowded either.  The only small problem was it was windy.

Overall, this place is pretty cool I'm just glad I finally got in here after trying twice unsuccessfully :)",1,0,1

If you're going to get a table at Tao, I suggest getting one upstairs in the main room - that's where the scene is (girls in bathtubs, etc).

I celebrated my 21st birthday here a few years ago and had no trouble getting in.

Although we still had to pay $20 to get in, at least we didn't have to wait at all. 

Once inside, it's very dark. It basically feels like a big dark sweaty box with a small crowded dancefloor and  nowhere to sit unless you got a table. The drinks are mixed well and the songs are what's expected at a club, mostly hip hop. Don't remember how I got up to Tao Beach but I was up there for a bit and it was whatevers. Not that crowded but didn't have that club feel like the sweat box downstairs.

My guy friends call me a gold digger if I do accept a drink.. which pisses me off because: A.) I have two jobs and I can afford my own alcohol thank you very much; B.) The same guys also offer to buy or straight out get me drinks. 

So how does the etiquette of free drinks tie in with Tao? Because I succumbed to the peer pressure of my girlfriends and accepted a decent amount of drinks. Maybe it was sheer luck that there were so many guys from UCI that night. Apparently anteaters stick together and buy each other ridiculous amounts of alcohol. I found out that night that the trash cans in the food court of the Venetian have panels that open sideways instead of at the top. Pretty hard to throw up without making a mess that way. Oh, and if you drink a lot of AMFs, your puke comes out an interesting shade of blue.

\/\/\/PROS\/\/\/
- Great space--ambiance (lounge\/dinner floor)--although we did not eat here. Could not get reservations until 11:30--so went to Sushi Samba instead. It reminded me of Tao NY so assume the food would be just as good. 
- I was free (husband $20)--cheaper than SF ($20 each at most clubs w\/out headliner)
- Liked the red light district girls touch--reminded me of Webster Hall (NY, circa 1990)
- Liked the dancers--but no where near as out there\/theatrical as say Webster Hall (NY, circa 1990)--or even Ruby Skye (SF now)
- OK music 2nd floor, main space (electronic mixed with Top--that is until Hip Hop took over)
- We pushed our way through all spaces and ended up to the right of the DJ booth leaning up against a railing above the dance floor. At least we could ""watch"" but as I was there to dance (that was my primary objective for our weekend away) a bit miffed it was impossible. 
- Below our spot were some Dom Perignon swilling rappers with betties dancin' about. No idea who they were (others seemed to) but swilling directly out of a bottle, texting and making out were all funny to watch. They had 4 open bottles at all times available for 5 people--and a corner booth with plenty of space. Too bad we're not them.
- Snow and money cam flying out of the ceiling--cool touches. Funny that most people didn't notice they were bills--which is probably whyTao sent guys out to pick up the rogues. Cool Vegas touch in any event.

\/\/\/CONS\/\/\/
- On VIP list--showed up a little after midnight and the door guys said they closed it at midnight --thus waited in ""a"" line (there were several, uncertain what was what)
- Completely convinced that if I were with a group of girls--I would have gone in. But with my husband--um, a male, we had to wait.
- NO--none--zilch  space to friggin' move let alone dance at 12:30ish on the 2nd floor. The actual dance floor in the main room on the 2nd floor is amazingly SMALL. It is not comparable to say Ruby Skype or 1015 in SF. Both of which I frequented for years with crowds, huge headliners and space to dance. At times I had VIP tables--but they didn't take up the whole damn joint like Tao Club Vegas.
- Unless you pay 1K (no where near the dance floor) or 2K (near the dance floor) you are NOT VIP--and cannot move, get a drink or dance. For 4+ people not all that bad--but for 2? 
-  It took us a good 20 to get the first cocktail--standing at the bar.  The three female bartenders would NOT even look at us. As I have been a bartender at a large club early nineties--service really gets to me. And there was no need for them to be quite to bitchy. Acknowledgement goes a long way. Normally an amazing tipper. Not so tonight.
- 3rd floor electronica not open--even though we'd asked concierge and door guys if Tao was spinning electronica\/house Sat night prior to wasting time\/money. If it was ""so"" busy why wasn't floor 3 open?
- Hip-hop in the smaller dance room on floor 2--but then took over the main dance floor as well (UGH! So left earlier than expected)

\/\/\/IF YOU GO...\/\/\/
- Make sure there is a headliner of music YOU like--then pay for a VIP table near the dance floor. This will enable you to at least get cocktails, dance in place, on tables, dividers and sofas. Otherwise you are screwed.
- But if you have frequented--or still frequent large clubs in major cities--level set your expectations.

\/\/\/WOULD WE GO TO TAO CLUB AGAIN?\/\/\/
- Not unless we had a table near the dance floor with electronica\/house as the main event.

It was not added twice. I edited my review to reflect this.
-----------------------

The service is terrible and slow. The dancing girls are not very good, and they are rude. Everything is crazy overpriced. The lines were so long and we had 12 girls in our group, so we got a VIP table. It was so crowded and our waitress was barely there. There was some other guy who worked there that stayed at our table the whole time trying to be ""helpful"" by shining a little flashlight on us while we danced. The whole time he just kept asking all the girls in our party to make sure to tip him separately because his tip is not included with the 20% automatic gratuity that they add to the bill. That was really annoying!! 

The waitress only poured a few drinks and was not around most of the night. I thought she added a 20% gratuity twice, but one was called OPEN % CCRECGRAT and when I asked her what that was, she told me it was a venue fee charged by the hotel which she had no control over and had me initial it. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and the entire time I kept feeling like they were trying to take advantage of us. So when I got home I looked on the web and it only mentioned that tax and gratuity would be added to the minimum table charge. 

I called the office and asked for a manager. The girl on the phone said she could try to help me. I told her that I wanted an explanation of each item on my bill and she said ""oh, is it the Open % Gratuity?"" She knew right away. She confirmed the venue fee that was on the bill and also the tax and gratuity. I asked her to explain what this extra 20% OPEN % charge was and she couldn't give me a sensible answer. She kept saying different things about gratuity, but I told her that there was already an automatic gratuity on there and then she started making excuses like the waitress probably didn't  know there was a gratuity on there and accidentally charged me twice. Right... That's why the waitress had me initial it. She could tell I wasn't buying it and then said to me ""but you signed and authorized the charges, correct? And you are just noticing this now?"" 

When I asked for the manager's info, she said she couldn't give it out because it is against company policy (how convenient) but that the manager would reach out to me. Let's see if management contacts me. I'm not holding my breath. I plan to keep you Yelpers updated on this.",1,0,0

They let everyone in.  People were wearing jeans, tank tops and flipflops on a Friday night.

In addition, it was so crowded that everywhere I tried to stand one of two things happened:
1.  A bouncer told me to move
2.  Ugly girls started fighting

The music was terrible, and was a mixture of old school rap and top 40 hits.  BLAH.

Most of the girls in there were with bachelorette parties, as I saw at least 20 veils at one point on the main dance floor.

It's smaller than other major clubs in Vegas, but still fun if you want to venture on smaller venues (or just stop by for open bar before hitting the bigger clubs). I had to stop by here being in Vegas because whenever I introduced myself anywhere, I always get the response ""your name is a club in Vegas"" so I thought I had to visit the club that was named after me, just kidding. 

This was my first ever club in Vegas so I was already impressed at how much it is shitting on Seattle's clubs. The decor is cute, classy yet trendy, whatever that means right. I had fun making new friends here that thought it was funny that they are meeting Thao at Club Tao.

We arrived fairly early, probably around 10:30 PM and there was already a line. Luckily for us, we were on the guest list and got in pretty quickly. The entrance to the club was weird. We had to go up a few flights of stairs (& this is a hard task for me since I was wearing heels!). When we got to the dance floor, it was pretty open and we had plenty of space. I swear, once 11:30 PM rolled around, it became SO packed. My bf & I could hardly dance. The majority of the time was spent outside. There were a couple of times I needed to use the restroom but once I saw that the ladies had to go UP another flight of stairs PLUS the wait of the line, I decided that my bladder will have to suffer a little. 

The DJ played great dancing music & the crowd was live; however, I think I could've enjoyed myself at a different club where it was LESS packed and I could actually dance. The drink prices were ridiculously high but I guess I can't really complain about that since we were in Vegas.",2,1,2

Some guy approached us in Rok the night before and said he could get us free entry into Tao and he came through for us. When we got there, there were four queues to get into the place and luckily, although we had to wait for like 15 mins (it was our fault, we should have turned up earlier as the guy could have walked us through the VIP queue), we got free entry, and the place itself, the decor and the music were really cool.

It is very crowded and obviously has a bit of a reputation for being a 'hot' club, therefore the people in there were really pushy, and really drunk (meaning if they spilled their drink on you, they weren't even aware that they did). As for the dancers, it seems to be a common thing in Vegas for clubs\/bars to have women in their underwear dancing on the bar, but still it unsettles me. I just hope those girls are paid well, because the moves they were busting out were borderline on exotic dancing.

In the end we left early, there were just too many loud, obnoxious, drunk and idiotic people in the venue and it wasn't worth getting trampled over by grown men ogling girls barely out of college. The music and the place were very cool, but the crowd was not the type you wanna hang out with. Go to Rok. They have dance-offs and they don't invade your personal space.",1,1,0

This is a really nice club with an asian theme. Love their mix in music and the atmosphere. However this place gets jammed pack!! I was unable to move, dance, and breathe! Tao would be my go to clubs in vegas if it was bigger. For girls, you get a free drink wrist band if you're on the guest list! So hit up a promoter! However, it ends at 10 or 11? We got there a few minutes before it ended and didn't get to use it, such waste! The girls bathroom are upstairs overlooking the dance floor, love the private stalls. Bathroom line can get extremely long, but at least you can still party In line. 



Staff is very quick and attentive. A fight broke out at one of the vip Tables near the stage and knocked over all the cups and ice bucket. The staff immediately handled the situation very well. All the dancers and guards got together to clean it up, and within seconds, everything was back to normal, as if nothing happened. 

Oh, also I love the mirror dancing guy, so unique!

BAD: Too packed.  To the point where you cannot move on the dance floor, so really you're just squirming. 

THEME: Sexual. The entrance is lined with Asian girls soaking in bathtubs.  For Halloween, the girls are variances of vampires and zombies and the bath water is blood red. 

Anything is fun when you're drunk enough.  Come with a group, get some drinks.  A much younger crowd here than at PURE in Ceasars.

Definitely more walking room that PURE, but there appeared to be less bars. But I felt bad for those that had table service, they appeared they didn't really have much sitting room or privacy.
Music could've been better, PURE gets the nod for having excellent DJs. But we didn't get ripped off on our drinks, reasonable prices. For my single male friends, the girls covered in petals in the bathtubs are very attractive. Definite eye candy, but you'll likely be staring with other single guys too, hehe.

Me and my buddies were in Vegas for a long weekend and a buddy from LA had a friend (keep up) who got a table here, complete with bottle service.  My advice to any guy going to a club in Vegas, you NEED a table, otherwise you will be standing at the bar looking like a complete ZERO getting poked with side yabs and percodan hardons from various blowjobs and douchebags. 

Arriving at the Venetian, standing atop the grand staircase outside the hallowed gateway into Tao, my buddy spent the first ten minutes on the phone w\/our connection inside. The line was ridiculous (there were several lines, like trying to merge into the Lincoln Tunnel, lines for the haves and have nots), and we still had to grease our way in - again, we are dudes in Vegas, it is to be expected (and worth it to skip being swallowed up in the mass of would be clubgoers, waiting and waiting, babbling on their cell phones, baying like madmen in the DUCHESS OF MALFI). 

Once inside, you are jostled through the entry tunnel, lined with bathtubs full of rose petals, through the bar area, and up another flight of stairs into the club proper.  The dance floor is ebbing and flowing like a turbulant sea, lights flashing overhead like heat lightening, and there are people EVERYWHERE.  At this point you've just wrecked your perfactly sculptured hair and wrinkled your pressed shirt as you are squeezing through the sweaty throng of nobodies who were either too cheap or too stupid to get a table, as you step on feet looking for a way out of this and saying, ""imagine if we didn't have a table, fuck this!""

When we finally got to our table, it was time to take a well deserved breath of relief and watch as the hot server, done up like a sex slave, pours out the vodka.  Other people with tables included some strange eurotrash dude that resembled a more junked out version of Keith Richards (if you can imagine that!) wearing a crushed black velvet tux with red silk shirt underneath, engaged in a very involved conversation with a hot piece of ass that was no doubt a RENTAL.  Again, dudes, be prepared to spend great boatloads of money to impress the broads here.  It takes more than a good line, you will actually need to LAY OUT the line of coke on the American Express Black to even get one of these harpies to raise an eyebrow.

We were there on June 6 2014. I bought a package for 4 people.  Everything was fine and the area we were sitted at was perfect for a group of 4. Until, a group of 8 females walked in and were sitted next to us. Immediately, one of the woman, Christine or Christina (who claimed to be related to Elvis Presley) started to give us an attitude when we didn't move further down the booth. I asked the waitress if we could move to the corner part of the booth and she explained that it would cost more money. I explained this to the other group. We went along with our night making the best out of it until  Christine ""Presley"" came over to introduce herself to us and she started to call my husband a liar and disrespectful because he jokingly said his name was Pablo. Then she starts complaining to the couple that we were with about how they need to move further down because we were not by our table. To make a long story short, I asked her to please leave us alone and we were  moved to the corner to avoid any problems. Well this christine lady wasn't going to be happy till we were kicked out. She kept whining to the bouncers and waitresses accusing us of being mean to her and throwing ice at her. All of which were a lie. What irritated me was how security handled the situation.  They came and took me from my party, didn't let my husband or friends follow me, and basically held me hostage in an exit hallway. They took my ID and threatened to call the cops over what occurred.  Nothing occurred!! A fight didn't break out, no punches were thrown,& our party  was not paying any  attention to this girl. They wouldn't give my husband any information on my whereabouts. I was held against my will for almost an hour till security could figure out what to do. I have been to plenty of clubs in Vegas and Chicago, never have I seen security pay attention to such childish complaints!! I couldn't believe they were taking this Christine seriously when she was whining about not having an extra 6 inches to herself.   If anything I blame the club for sitting a group of 8 in a booth that only fits 4. Thank you to security for wasting an hour of our night instead of either asking us to leave or letting us go down to the dance floor. If it wasn't for the fact that they had my ID and my husband's cc we would have walked out. I thought Tao's VIP was suppose to be classy instead they allow little girls playing childish bs games and give them too much attention. What a waste of money and time! To that Christine girl I wish I would have given you something to really complain about because you obviously have never encountered people who will give you a reason to get security.

Dammit Lil' Wayne!!! ------------------------------

I woke up with this song on my mind. What better place to jot dem' lyrics down than Vegas' sinful tabernacle we come to know as: ""Tao""? 

It's Friday! Get your twerk on!!!!

Okay so, screw the other reviews, I don't at all care for clubs but without so much as questioning things: TAO is the ONLYYY club I'd be willing to frequent. Located within the ever so swanky Venetian Resort\/Hotel, this 10K sq. foot club affording MULTIPLE floors for dancing is open a mere 4 or so days a week (Thur\/Fri\/Sat\/Sun) from roughly 10p to 5 or 6a (unheard of) and it goes without a need for stating that this place is OFF DA' CHAIN!!!!

(pauses........)

Lawd' have mercy! The sh!t that goes on inside of Tao!!! I had to leave and request a new baptism. 

NOTE: Hot girls,... arriving in groups (not to be confused with the fugly posing hot girl wannabe's) tend to get in free as a method of promotion. They're offered free drinks from the bar as well (fellaz' if you want a free buzz, send your hot friend over to grab the cocktail for you). 

The depressing downside to this is that, inevitably......hot chicks tend to attract D-bags in droves and I personally witnessed a number of women being groped, ogled and dayum near assaulted for simply looking too good.

LADIES: Pack your pepper spray and lotion your knees. One ""pie-yahh"" to his baby makers should just about take care of things leaving you free to further enjoy your evening.

To further it, the dress code here is STRICTLY enforced. 

Sorry fellaz'. Sneakers and t-shirts are prohibited but for what it's worth, I possess the utmost regard for protocols such as this. If\/when in doubt, it deters the hyenas and prevents them from straying too far into the Pride land. 

My last session out was with a group of 10. Further indicative that it pays to know folx', somehow, someone was enabled to get us into V.I.Peezy. Little did either of us know that Snoop D-O-Double Geezy was there and let's just say........ it was an ""interesting"" night.

That kat' is plausibly the coolest guy in the industry and this completely set the tone for not only this visit, but those to come.

Having returned since then, I was able to view on Tao's website that packages are sold, enabling guests to dine within the adjacent ""Tao Asian Bistro"" offering a 3 course meal, VIP table and booze with mixers. Perhaps we partook in all of this within my 1st visit; I don't know. I didn't pay.

Come to think of it; maybe I did pay.....Perhaps I was just too 'turnt up' to remember any of it.

Daah' well. 

Catching all of us completely off guard were the oiled up, naked hot chicks 'bumpin' and grindin',...within the confines of a rose petal filled tub. The fact of their wearing nothing but rose petaled ""nip nip covers"" and....... a smile, was a prompt reminder that we weren't in Kansas any longer. 

Ken-Dizzle (my Snoop given name) is hardly the one to judge. If you wanna' get your Ellen DeGeneres on in public, MORE POWER TO YA'!

* * * Tao, ladies and gents- is ------THAT TYPE OF PLACE----- and I can only begin to fathom the fornication that goes on without pretense once this club reaches capacity.

And, wouldn't cha' know it? Joe P. anDDD Alex P. have both been to this place as well and it's also obtained their seal of approval. 

Last but certainly not least. In the odd event my point hasn't become crystal clear: HANDS DOWN (to continue a session of twerking) - do I bow......to Tao!!! 

See you guys soon.

However, TAO on a TAO ""Worship Thursday"" during EDC weekend for ATB (who was SICK! ATB! ATB!

Like what Lauren L. states... TAO is unfortunately very small compared to the newer clubs like XS and Marquee, and management doesn't mind packing everyone in like sardines. Additionally, the bouncers treat you like shit unless you've purchased a table\/bottle service. Also, bathrooms are sketch... the doors have a weird lighting effect controlled from outside that allows those from outside to see whats going on inside, and the doors don't lock properly (be warned of possibly getting locked in or being walked into whilst mid-business -_-)...

This was my first Vegas clubbing experience, and everything was set up ""perfectly.""  It was my first time back in Sin City after over a year, I was seeing some sexy people that I hadn't been around with, and I already had a few Jack & Cokes to start off the evening.  Not to mention that Miss Jaymie Lynn S. was able to get us some free passes for some of the fellas.  No cover?!  Thank you Mr. Bouncer.

For the guys, TAO is hella strict, so you better dress to impress.  Besides, why wouldn't you want to show off that fresh, clean look to the (often) crowds of Asians that frequent this place?  There's also the nearby Miracle Mile where you can buy a pair of slacks for less than $40, which I totally didn't do before heading in.

So how does the club itself rack up?  Pretty damn good.

After you get in (and the line could be long), you head on upstairs to the first dance floor with plenty of go-go dancers and lit up bars.  Dance floor space was a bit limited, so we headed to another room where they had roped off a couple of couch areas for bottle service.  Meh.

The ladies tonight had some kind of deal where they got free booze for an hour or two.  Needless to say, I didn't pay a single dime for the four... five... six(?) AMFs that I had tonight.  It was one blue drink after the other (holler to Jaymie Lynn S., Nina Y., and Kathleen W. for having my back!)  Drinks were decent, but it's to be expected being a packed-ass night club like TAO.  If you gotta pay per round, a drink will set you back around $15, so make sure you bring some dollars to tip the bartenders.

DJ was on fire tonight.  I'm a sucker for Top 40 and Hip-Hop, but more-so the former just cause it gets EVERYONE riled up.  For my first time clubbing here, I definitely approved of the music selection.  Or at least I'm sure I did.  I do remember having an AMF in my hands for most of the night and going all out with it, so I'm pretty sure the music was poppin.

If you get hot, there's a balcony area where you can go take a breather- or you can go straight to TAO Beach.  Small dance floor, but a good way to escape the sweat inside (even though I'm sure it's just as hot outside as it is inside).

Bathrooms were a bit hard to find outside, and I only remember there being any on the floor with the go-go dancers.  It's easy to get separated while inside, so make sure you have a cell to call the homies up.

Also, doesn't matter how drunk you are- but make your friend doesn't start running away and your drunk ass starts chasing after them.  Got into a bit of trouble with the bouncer inside... but damn it was fun.

TAO- you were aiite.  I had a lot of fun, and I'm sure I'll be back for some more.",2,3,1

I was there for my bachelorette party this past weekend. I had only been there an hour and only had one drink. I went with my girlfriend to use the restroom. I couldn't find her when I was done. The security guard outside the mens bathroom yelled for everyone to keep moving. I moved to the side to text my girlfriend to see where she was. The security guard grabbed me forcefully, pulled me down 3 stairs, and pulled me about 10 more steps. Then proceeded to yell in my face that he told me to move. I could not believe he would grab a girl like this. Especially since I was not causing any problems or being threatening to anyone. I am not confrontational but this really upset me. I yelled at him for grabbing me like this. He put his hand in my face and told me he was going to call the cops and tell them I was trespassing. I told him to go ahead and I will show them the marks on my arms. I ended up walking away since I was there for my bachelorette party and wanted to enjoy myself. Looking back I wish I would've let him call the cops. He could've just tapped me on the shoulder and asked me specifically to move. I had no idea it was such a big deal. 

About 30 minutes later I was with my friends at a VIP table. A different security guard tapped my guy friend on the shoulder and told him he had to leave. My friend who bought this $10,000 table said that he could stay. The security guard said no and pulled my guy friend out. Once again my guy friend was not causing any problems.

As for the drinks, stick to shots. Regular mixed drinks are pretty disappointing. My ketel one-tonic was like 95% tonic. If you're in for the long haul, go for table service so you'll have strong drinks + somewhere to sit and rest the tired feet.

We were jammed up against 3 other tables, packed in there so tightly that the server spilled boiling shabu-shabu liquid on my sister's arm trying to get it onto the the table. She was fine, and the management kissed our ass for a little while, but did not apologize for the shitty table, or overcrowding, and he certainly didn't comp us anything for the trouble. 

The club was a different story--I was expecting a hassle after reading the reviews, but it all went pretty smoothly. It's like getting into the goddamned White House though--be prepared to confirm your reservation up to three times, and make sure you track down the VIP host to take you up there--the line outside was atrocious. Even though we were already in the restaurant, we had to go back outside with the host, check in with the bouncer, and then go up to the club. 

The club is beautiful and the music was pretty good--mostly current Top 40 kind of hip hop (which, face it, is what you want to dance to after 5 red bull and vodkas).  The table service was excellent, we had 2 servers who were very nice, helpful, and attentive. Yes, for $450 a bottle they should be, but given how uppity the staff are about this club, it was a surprise to have such friendly servers. 

I would avoid the tables around the dance floor if you can--it's an absolute zoo. We were in the hallway when you walk in, which at first I thought was lame, but the main room with the dance floor is like a cattle pen, you'll appreciate being able to get out of there. 

Bonus entertainment: the working girl at the table across from us with the two old men.  It's Vegas--I love it!!",2,0,1

If there's anything to admire about it, that would be its tasteless and unapologetic exploitation of women and Buddhism.  No points for originality there, but well done exploitation, we'll give it that.  Models in quasi-meditative poses adorn various wall niches and hallways, and they rotate out frequently, giving the place a surreal endless-museum quality because they've changed by the time you come back that way.   Rose petal bath, always a favorite, although any religious reference is lost on me.   I think they should let drunk clubers sign up to use the bath; that would be even better.  

As a bar or dance club it pretty much sucks.  Music was loud and fast although I did not observe any space large enough for normal people to dance.   Drink service was hostile and expensive but that seems typical for the see and be seen category.   That's all Tao is, apparently; a place for spenders and celebrities to be admired in the dark while drinking the same spendy champagne and talking to the same people they talk to everywhere else.  

Not even close to worth the long line.  When I visited, the line was hours long, close to filling the lobby.   Fortunately (and uncharacteristically) I was connected that day, and was able to skip that line, check it out, and make room for some sad sightsuckers who had to wait and pay.",1,2,1

thankfully, we got passes to cut the line because when we got there around midnight, the line was ridiculously long...we got in quickly and headed upstairs to the 2nd floor because it seemed like the first floor was pretty quiet. 

we really liked the decor alot and headed for the dance floor but it was SO crowded. over crowded. we danced for a while, but were getting pushed and shoved so much that we decided to head to the bar and make our own dance party! that worked for a little while, but then we were getting hassled by some swedes (one of which attempted to mouth kiss me after knowing me for about 2.5 seconds....not cool). that was our signal to leave...free drinks were not worth being accosted...if tao were a little less crowded i think that my review would have been MUCH more positive.",0,2,0

First of, the food here is pretty damn good! There hasn't really been anything that disappointed me. 

Definitely try the Lobster Wonton Soup if you get the chance. The wontons are very meaty and the soup is the perfect balance.

The Orange Chicken was a little sweet but really hit the spot, good portion size too.

Buddha Chicken may sound a little racist but holy god!! It was some of the tastiest chicken I've ever had.

*If you dine here, you can get your admission comp'd for the nightclub (requires order of entree over $20)

Lastly, the club itself is in another league of its own. Very big and so many different aspects, levels, and traits that I haven't even ventured to all of them. It's so big, vast and EASY TO LOSE YOUR GROUP because it's always crowded.

Here's a scenario for you, you're on the dancefloor having a good time, surrounded by friends and some beautiful girls... you're definitely feeling the music with every beat and you're just fist pumping the night away. Then a dazzling female acrobat comes swinging from the ceiling and dances around while a shower of faux snow comes falling down and trickles on everyones hair and you keep dancing and just go with the flow of the night... then BANGGG!

So a friend of a friend, who works for Tao group, was giving us the hookup when she invited us out to Tao with her Dec. 2 (Thursday.) We got in free with the VIP stamp, and just walked right in with her, and we had full access to an open bar. Who can complain about free everything?! I'm a fan of free!

We got in about 10:15 PM and immediately headed upstairs with the three other girls I was with. The girls that lay by the staircase weren't out and neither were the bathtub bathers - which for me, is a-okay. We went to the bar for our gratis drinks; I happened to have a very tasty amaretto sour (the only mixed drink I like) sans a marachino cherry. Thank you Tao for saving me $11!

The dance floors were deserted in the main room and we sorta just walked around and hung out on the balcony for a little bit before dancing for maybe 30 minutes. We were approached by some girls taking pictures of guests who they had given Holly Madison's new Hypnotique shots (gawd, Hypnotique is gross) so we did that, and then they came back and wanted a second shot, so I posed and gave them back the shot - I like being sober. 

After that, we headed to the lounge room (whatever the smaller dance floor is upstairs is called.) There was maybe 6 girls just dancing around (one was way drunk.) Luckily, some guys made it to the dance floor - oh wait, no, only one did, and he was dancing with me. Ha. After about 20 minutes some more guys showed up and the floor started getting filled up. 

Some guys I had noticed earlier were now in the lounge and one of them got stuck on me. Oh lordy, he had on Crafters (those rectangle glasses featured in every freakin' Lens Crafters ads) and so I got separated from my group and just chilled with him on the balcony after wading through the crowd gaping, with cellphones raised, at Holly Madison, who was hanging out at a private table (have these people never seen a prostitute before? It's Vegas...)

The balcony is really nice, and the bouncers make sure it doesn't get too busy. It's really the only place you can have a conversation and truly hear what the other person is saying. When this guy was telling me how he charged $2,000 to a 40% interest credit card to come on this vacation, I was literally already in the process of walking away but alas, it was a joke -  if I had been inside the club, I wouldn't have heard the ""it's a joke"" part and the night would have ended very differently (which would have been good for me and bad for him.)

Let me just say that I'm not Bobby Brackins; I'm not lookin' for some love in the club. I have no desire to hook up with random fools on vacation looking to bump or get as close as possible to doing such, but you will find a ton of that in this club - either in business suits (tons of business men) or So Cal Asian cool kids. 

After hanging out on the balcony, this guy, Mike (the one with the Crafters) was really pressuring me to go back to his suite with him because he saw (from reading a text message over my shoulder) that my friends had gone home after not being able to locate me. I held out and we went back to his table he bought with his suite mates. Um, yeah, I wouldn't spend that sort of ridiculous money for a table, but if you want to dance without being in a cattle car, find a guy with a table. The velvet ropes keep the drunk wild dancers out, and there is room to breathe. There are a zillion attendants making sure the table drinks and condiments are filled. There is a huge Kentucky Derby-like cup that holds ice. After being offered a drink from the table, and me declining, I was told to at least have something, so I took an ice cube. Ha. Not bad.

Mike was dead set on us ""taking a walk around the shops;"" out of towner club guy translation: ""let's go to my suite."" (There will be a review about this. Don't worry, I didn't do anything! Bleh!) so I relented and we walked out of the club. On the way out, I got some snazzy (yet too small) flip flops. These are the real deal, not some cheap-o pair.  Nice!

Overall, Tao is great when stuff is free and you don't have to wait in line. I don't know if I would have had a nice time if I had to wait in line and pay like everybody else, but my experience was pretty fun!",3,2,4

Oh yes I had a great time standing still while hordes of people passed through me walking to god knows where. You call this a club? I liken it to a sardine can and a fire hazard too. 

The venue itself looks more like a really dark warehouse with a few couches and tables sprinkled around. Oh and you'll notice the use of live 'manikins' posing in provocative and sexually suggestive postures, consider them as nothing more than wall decor. 

If you do decide to go and 'dance,' save yourself hours of wait time and eat at the restaurant first, they'll let you move to the front so you can join the rest of the cattle herd for slaughter.

The dance floors were crowded, but mostly with people standing around. It was kind of weird to dance next to a bunch of people who were just standing and talking to each other.

We requested bottle service, and had a small table on the first floor which is basically the retaurant\/bar level.  The actual nightclub is upstairs.

What I liked:  The service was superb.  Our waitress, and bouncer were both extremely polite.  The guy waiting on our area told us if we ever want to leave the table and mingle to let him know.  He put out a reserved sign for our table, and pulled our bottle\/mixers to store in a kitchen area.  When we came back to the table, he brought everything back in seconds.  The placement of the tables was nice.  We talked to a bunch of girls around our area, and drank the night away.  The music at Tao kicked ass.  Their DJ spins a lot of hip-hop which is nice.  I'm so sick of hearing Katy Perry dance mixes, so it was nice to hear some Young Money.  The music at Tao gets 5 stars.

What I disliked: The actual club is super crowded (what club isn't crowded - but this was unbearable).  Trying to navigate that dance floor without spilling your drink is completely impossible.  Not to mention I started sweating as soon as we walked upstairs.  The layout for the club isn't the best - poor design.  I recommend getting a table downstairs like we did, and then once it's past 2AM, go up to the main club and start cuttin a rug.  It will still be crowded, but it's much more manageable.    

Price: $450 for table, one bottle, free-entry, line pass, etc.  Add tip, yr lookin at about $180 a man.  This was the price for a table on the first floor.

This could probably be a 5 star review if we had a table off the main dance floor that was elevated, and over-looked all the talent.  Considering our group was only 3 people, the options were limited.  In a town where cash is king, if you're willing to spend the money, you can probably have whatever table you want.",3,0,2

I had a buddy in town for a bachelor party. When I met up with the crew, I was a bit hesitant about having dinner here, but realized that it would be my easiest way into the club. (I've been to the club a few times before this).

Dinner was dinner. I had the duck fried rice which was tasty, but being the food nazi, I realized that the rice wasn't of the highest quality. Kind of a shame when you consider the prices. I also noshed on some of the other items that were on the table such as the tender steak, which was also tasty.

Before we got our check, a club person came around and stamped our hands. Then we had to go back down to the entrance, and get our hand stamped again before we could actually go into the club.

Once there, it's your usual club shenanigans. Models in scantily clad gear that pet eachother while sitting on couches. $14-$18 cocktails. 

There are two dance areas, the smaller is the ""hip hop"" room and in my past visits, this was the only place to hang because there as breathing room....not this time around. This time, we ahd more room in the main area. 

It's easy to socialize and meet people here. Be careful, because if you meet someone, you might find yourself alone and detached from the rest of your group. This place really is that busy.

When I was at the bar near the entrance, I saw a ""coolio""-looking individual. Low and behold, later in the night, when Fantastic Voyage came on, Coolio indeed took the spotlight and threw down one of his two hits. He of course, followed up with Gangsta's Paradise.

The music is always pretty good and the crowd is usually really cool.  Guys, if you're looking for very good-looking women who are cool to dance with, Tao is your place.  It's gotten to the point where I'm hostile to my friends when they want to go anywhere else and, quite honestly, they could leave me there and I'd be totally cool with it....that's how much I dig Tao.",0,0,0

However, the second time I was kicked out for being ""wobbly."" That would have been fine, had they handled the situation better..

Here's what happened:
I was wearing high-heeled boots that were a bit small for me, and my right hand was in a cast from breaking my right wrist a few days prior. I went upstairs to the bathroom with my friend and asked if she could assist me since I had troubles (since I only had one useable hand). The bath attendant said no, and apparently reported to the bouncers that I was ""wobbly"" whatever that means. I basically couldn't get the damn clear doors to lock and then had trouble walking down the stairs with said hand in a cast and not to mention it was packed. So as I reached the bottom of the staircase, a bouncer pulled my friend and I aside and said we needed to go with him. Confused, I asked what was going on and he said he had received a report saying I was wobbly and that I needed to leave immediately. 

I was in a group of three: myself, my female friend, and our guy friend. The bouncers told my girl friend and I to come with them and would not let the guy friend of ours come with us. All of us involved insisted that he stay with us and we would leave. However, the bouncers picked him up and put him back inside the club (mind you, he's 6'4"", not a small guy..) and then lead us out through this strange passageway through the hotel and left us someplace. We had no idea where we ended up and it turned out to be quite a struggle to  find our guy friend after that. I have never been kicked out of anywhere before and I was definitely not pleased when they would not let him come with us, since he was our way of getting back to our hotel. 

The way the bouncers handled the situation was bullshit and not to mention not very safe since they led us out to a place we weren't familiar with and would not let the other member of our group go with us at the very least. 

I don't plan on returning to Tao next time I visit Las Vegas, after the way we were treated. Not to mention it was extremely packed.",0,0,0

- love the one hour open bar
- hate the rude people (i swear to you, they're ruder here!)
- love the music variety
- can't understand the never ending, winding line to get in

I'll keep this short and sweet.

This is my 3rd time back to TAO. The 1st visit was incredible. 2nd and 3rd - awful. Everytime I go, I get angry and vow to never return. Somehow we're always back here.

This trip, we visited because we had free entry due to wristband's. In Vegas, you'll take free when you can get it.

The bouncers are BEYOND rude and have no qualms yelling at you, even when you're NOT causing a stink or being rude. I was simply trying to join my friends in line and was not allowed because if he let me do it, everyone else would to. Get over yourself, Mr. Bouncer. I wasn't attempting to squeeze 15 people in line. It was just me.

They pack patrons in here like sardines. You cannot dance let alone move.

So okay first night in Vegas we're like let's go to Tao. It was Halloween night so a lot of people were all dressed up in costume. We walked into the side of Venetian and there's a big line. This was like 11 something because we got there a bit late. We stood for like 10 minutes and the line didn't even move at all. And being all anxious as we are, we're like forget it let's just tip the bouncer. The club was packed so they letting one person out and one person in. Anyways tipped the bouncer like $100 and he hooked us in. Pay another $20 a head at the door so it's like $200 before we did anything. 

Okay so we got inside and I thought it'll look nice like those pictures I saw but damn it's so damn dark inside. It is so dim you can barely see anybody face to tell you the truth. The club is huge, but there's also a narrow walk way to another room and a few other smaller room. All I got to say is most of the times I'm just trying to squeeze my way around because it was so damn packed. And in Vegas you get to smoke inside so I was trying to avoid getting poked with a cigarette. They have an awesome system and played great music though. When we had the chance me and some of my homegirls dance for a bit. I just hate going any club when it's packed period, I like to be poppin' but room to walk and dance.

We had made reservations by the suggestion of my sister who lives in Vegas and loves the food at TAO. My sister usually has pretty good taste so we went (+the gf loves clubbing..)

The place was packed as it always is in Vegas. The line to the CLUB was all the way to the escalators of the Wax Museum outside. We checked in at our reservation, which had a 20 minute delay which was not bad at all considering how crazy it was in there. We got in and were served promptly. The waiter was great. I did not like the drink he suggested (Sake-tini...tasted like a cucumber that was blended and watery) and brought me out the sure fire favorite (Grey Goose Martini) immediately. Great waiter! I ordered the Thai chicken which was good, but really citrus-ey! Gf got the orange chicken which was quite possibly the best orange chicken we have ever had. We then got stamped, and proceeded upstairs to the club which was not a long wait at all(btw guys, if you eat at TAO and get an entree for each person, you get into the club for free and you bypass the main line! Though wait until I tell you about the club...)

The decor at TAO has a really great feel. Typical to what the name is...""asian"" feel all over. The look is really nice. Now to the important stuff. The place was packed to more than capacity, everyone was herded like cattle...there was no room on the dance floor, let alone the walkways. There was absolutely no place to really go without being elbow to elbow with someone else, or rubbing up on some sweaty person near you. I am sorry, but if I go to a club, I do not want to two-step, I really want to dance...also, the music...SUCKED! You can hear the music in the restaurant, and we heard the same songs quite a few times. TAO beach played an Usher song and everyone went crazy...OMG...get it? Then we went down, filed like cattle, into the main room again, USHER-OMG...all the place went nuts...I am sorry...but play some REAL music...if your playlist is about 8 songs...you disappoint most people with half a brain.

TAO gets two stars from me because of the obvious violation to fire safety, the lack of music, oh and I almost forgot to mention. We met a guy outside of the club who said he paid one bouncer 40 bux...another 40 bux...and the entry guy 40 bucks...to get in...and leave at 2AM...WTF!?

TWO STARS FOR THE NIGHTCLUB

Therefore, you get a THREE.FIVE STAR AVERAGE

-----

Let me start with the positives:

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here.  I had the Grilled Red Snapper with steamed veggies topped with a ginger kaffir lime vinaigrette.  The snapper was really fresh, flakey, and sweet.  All the flavors just blended so perfectly together.

My boyfriend had the Crispy Coconut Shrimp with spicy Thai peanut sauce.  Need I say more?  It was delicious!

We had a party of 7 people celebrating my baby's birthday.  Our waitress was awesome!  She was patient (thank God! We just kept ordering drinks!!) and attentive.  Awesome service.  

One thing I will mention though, they did not offer any complimentary birthday dessert.. That was a bummer, but we still ordered a HUGE cream\/custard filled fortune cookie for him :)

And!!!!  You can avoid the crazy line outside for the nightclub and get in for free!  I guess that's a perk..

Now to the negative:

The club itself is a nice venue.  I've been here on numerous occasions, and it's just jammed packed every time.  I'm talking about shoulder to shoulder.. ""I can smell what you ate for dinner""-type packed.  It's insane!  You can't move.. you can't dance.. you can't even get a drink!  What's the point then???

I remember last year for Halloween,  Ashley Greene and Kellan Lutz from Twilight were there.... OMG.. I have never experienced such a crazy bombardment of people.. INSANE!

Alright, well if you're a girl.. and you are there with a group of girls.. given that you are dressed nicely and look presentable.... some of the promoters will invite you to the VIP section.  You do get free drinks.. and you can dance on a little platform if you choose.... I guess it's not SO bad if you're there with girls.  

Music wise.. it's mostly top 40 with some house\/electro sprinkled in... they are definitely not house-focused (meaning they rarely - actually I don't think they ever have - host DJs for their performers like Marquee or Surrender).  

Overall, it's not my first choice when it comes to Vegas clubs.  However, their promoters do a pretty good job at what they do, so it's easy to get in for free most of the time.  But.. there is always that dreaded line...",5,3,6

i probably would rate it 3.25 stars overall. 

the first couple of times i went here they had the standard bottle minimums for tables.  it was different last weekend. we were told that for our group of 12 there wouldnt be any bottle minimum, but rather a standard price. it ended up working out pretty well because some of the group just ordered drinks all night and the rest of us got bottle service.  at first i wondered why they were doing a $ per table minimum. that is until i walked in. the club was popping but there were a lot of empty tables.  even in the upstairs where the girls dance in the bathtub there were more empty tables than i would expect for a weekend.

the music was good. a pretty standard mix. and obviously different on each level. and there is something about watching half naked girls dance in bathtubs and massage each other that makes the music even better.

the service was good. standard for most clubs. (definitely not as good as the service at moon).  

so bottom line is that if you are in vegas for the weekend (thursday-sunday) would probably go here. if you only have a couple of days to go out i would suggest other places (tryst or moon).  tao is popular so there are going to be a lot of people there. it is big and there is always a good variety of music playing. the layout is a bit weird and the stairs get a bit crowded (especially when drunk people are attempting to trek up and down).",1,1,1

The best kinds of clubs are the ones where you can go in, order your drink, and get your groove on.  With any clubs in Vegas, unless you've ordered a V.I.P table, have a lot of cash, or you know someone that works in the club who can just get you in, then it's really not that fun.

As I approached the club, inside the Venetian Hotel and Casino, all I could see was swarm of people lined up and dressed up ready to paint the club red.  The line almost looked like it would take a good hour and a half to two hours before you reach the front door to be let in.  I can't believe I waited in that line just so I can see what all the buzz was about.

Finally, my foot reached the floor of Tao.  Luckily, i didn't have to pay since I'm local.  But, for those who had to pay, it cost about $40 just to get in.  As I entered, the darkness set in with a candle lights and water falls to decorate the hallway.  I walked past the restaurant\/bar where there were lounges and seats for people to relax in.  After walking a little bit more, there were a set of stairs I had to climb in order to get to the club itself.  Before I could enter the club, I had to present my stamp that I paid.

As I entered there were two choices left or right.  Choosing right, I ended up at the bar where the statues of Buddha and candles to decorate the bar area.  Next door was another room where people just wanted to sit and relax, laugh and talk.  I call this the chill room.  If I chose the left side, I would have ended up where the huge dance floor is at and a place where you can go outside and smoke.

It's a huge club and I like the atmosphere.  Only thing is the dance floor is so crowded that it's hard to dance in.  But, that is how it is at good clubs.  The DJ was good and spun good hip-hop music.  He knew what songs to choose so we could vibe to it.  Another good thing is that I was able to order my drinks very easily and didn't have to wait so long for service.  The price of the drink was an average of $14.00 per drink.

A great place to go take a break when you just can't keep going. We then go upstairs to get to the actual dance floor. The whole place had an Asian theme to it, calligraphy decor, and little laughing Buddhas everywhere.

The music was pretty good, they would actually play some older songs too, instead just the ten songs that are beginning played over and over again on the radio.   The light\/sound balance was also perfect. They would ring a going every once in a while, which sounds gimmicky, but perfectly matched up with the way the music ramped up.

The bottle service was great.  The server stood next to our tables constantly, so whatever we needed, ice, cups, napkins, etc... she would give to us right away.

Luckily for us, we planned ahead of time to save some money. On the website bestofvegas.com we found a deal for two day passes that grant access to both TAO and LAVO night clubs. For women the cost was $30, for men, $50. Not sure if it's much of a deal but as I explain my experience, you will see where it was beneficial to us. 

We arrived at the site of TAO, the Venetian, another hotel filled with gambling, food, attractions etc. We took a cab from the MGM costing us a reasonable $10. TAO was located on the second floor and to our amazement there was a massive line wrapped around the elevators. Seeing as to how alcohol inside was likely to be ridiculously expensive, we purchased a bottle of sky vodka at the gift shop right next to the elevators. Unfortunately for us, $25 is still expensive for a medium sized vodka bottle. As we made our way to the proper line (there had to be three to five different lines) we noticed a handful of security guards patrolling around the area ensuring safety and preventing drinking in the area and prohibiting bringing in any drinks to the nightclub. Luckily, there was a cool security guard who gave us a couple extra minutes to down the vodka before having to confiscate our drinks, right on sir.

Our planning ahead came in handy as we were directed to the proper line to enter TAO. With our proof of purchase vouchers, we quickly advanced to the entrance within 10 minutes of lining up whereas the other lines progressed at a very slow pace (another temporary line forms near the entrance with groups of chicks being let in-assumed to be hookers or bride to be). As soon as we made it to the counter, we showed our vouchers, received our wristbands that were good for two nights for two clubs. 

We made out way past the first floor of the building to the stairs to gain access to the upper levels. As we walked up, we noticed the music getting louder, more peopled, girls in lingerie using objects to caress one another and bars all around. 

TAO is a massive nightclub. There are three floors which you can hang out on, with bottle service available on each one. There's a dance floor on the second level and the third level has pools (sorry, you can't jump in it) and an open area to hang out in. There's several choices of music as each floor has different rooms with DJs spinning different tracks. The bars as you would suspect are pricey with $13 per drinks that have alcohol in then and beers for $9. I didn't use the bathroom but appeared tricky to find. There is a nice patio to hangout in in case a breather is needed. On this particular night (Thursday) there were a lot of people but not to the point of where it's so crowded you can't move. Luckily, if your tired on the pool level there is a small area where you can sit if you get lucky.

TAO was a great experience and we got our money's worth. It's worth checking out and if you do go, you should invest in the vouchers for a quicker entrance.",1,0,0

We never been to both Tao and Lavo in NYC so this was definitely something we were a little reluctant to do since there are many other nightclubs in the area....

So let's start off from the beginning, the moment we got down from our suites, there was huge lines at 10.30pm!! Luckily the bouncers put us on some VIP lines (maybe he saw us holding our printouts), so we got in in about less than 10minutes. 

The place is really cool, gives you the wow factor. Few bathtubs on your way in, into the the dinner area, there is a huge buddha... and up the stairs, more lounges areas and buddhas.... into the club, that's where the party starts!!

The have a big bar area near the dance area, very CROWDED even at 10.30pm!! Drinks are similar to NY price, so i wasn't surprised. Crowd was weird, i know it's vegas, so most people are wasted when we got there..... and yes i know it's vegas, but does every man needs to hit on you the second your man walked off to the men's room (and vice versa)?? creepy!!! 

Anyways, we were here for Dash Berlin, and he came on around 12:30am-1am.. His entrance was accompanied by a showgirl dancing over the top of the dance floor (yes she was FLYING from one corner to another!!) pretty fun for the drunk crowd! They also give you glow in the dark sticks or something that you can use to hit people who are on your way! Nice touch to the party

Lastly, they have lots of douche bags bouncers, who would not let you take pictures or limit you to 1 picture... lame ass... and the best part of the night is we got our way all the way to the front of the DJ booth and got a superb view of Dash Berlin the rest of the night....

Specifically, Tao's kind of annoying because there are obviously a few hotspots (and not even necessarily just the dance floors) that are ridiculously packed and make people want to throw some 'bows like Laimbeer in '90. The only place that can get worse at times is XS, but anyone of normal stature is cool there since most of the other patrons are 5'6"" or shorter.

Tao's experience could be significantly improved if they would just add a few more attractions to certain parts of the club to draw\/disperse adjacent overcrowded areas. 

Take for example that awkward bar\/curtained table section that's directly on your left when you exit the main dance floor. All you'd need to do is throw in another 2 girls massaging each other on antique Asian furniture to ease overcrowding. Or throw in that weird American Indian dude from the Black Eyed Peas who always seems to be around (last weekend being no exception). 

Actually, since this part of the venue is rife with either old dudes blowing Camel smoke everywhere or younger wallflowers leaning on that random wallshelf near the bathroom, make that 4 girls or 2 BEP members.

See? Problem solved. I'm like the third Asian Waits brother.

P.S. To the girl whose head I poured straight vodka on three or four times over the course of last Sat\/Sun:

The issue with that argument is that it's pretty standard for a night club.  If money is an issue, pre-party elsewhere and come in a little drunk.

Second issue is how crowded it is.  Yes, it could get pretty crowded in there... maybe too crowded.  Here, Tao could control a little better, but they are greedy too and want to milk as $ as possible.  But, if I had a choice between few people versus very crowded, I would pick very crowded.

I was at Tao this past Friday night for a bachelor's party.  Had a table reserved (for 8 guys total) with $1350 minimum.  Got there around 10:40, and was promptly walked in, and escorted to our table.  In the end, we all had such a good time that the total damage with everything included was a bit over $2800.

Yes, that's a lot of money... but if you are willing to shell that out (and it's really not too bad if you do the math), you will have a great time here.  I felt that the service was excellent... everyone from our server to bus boy to security.

For a group of guys, definitely get a table.  You can't go wrong... you'll end up spending that much in alcohol anyway.  Plus, you don't have to deal with getting in.. and the club takes good care of you.  If you would rather not do the ladies hunting, then just tip the security guy $20-40 and see what he can do.  You'll be surprised.  Small tip goes a distance.

For group of ladies, no need!  Just go in, find a group of guys, and party it up!  They should be providing the drinks =D",3,1,2

Security was not in your face. We had bottle service reservations here for Friday night. Everything went as planned. Showed up at the door. Huge wrap around line. Skipped the line. One problem. All 3 guys still had our bathing suites on. Dident even realize it. We came straight from dinner. The host was nice. I told him. We're going to run back to our room and change quick we will be right back down. He gave me the number of the head guest list guy. We hanged came back down. The guest list guy was nice.

We ordered some drinks and hung out. Jermain dupree was DJing. There was a lot of twerking going on. I'm not really into crazy chicks so I just observed from safety. The girls next to us invited us over for drinks. I never drink anyones drinks but my own. I'm sure it was fine but... I don't mess around. This chick hands me the drink then grabs my hand and starts grinding on me so hard. I was politely trying to get her to stop. She was gone. And in the zone. I wanted to leave. Then my friends started to dance. So I told them I'm heading back to our area. On the way back another VIP table decided to make it rain!! Haha. Right above our area. There was a tub with TAO girls in there. That kept me content. My one friend asked if the girls were naked. He was shocked that girls who worked at Tao do the tub stuff. He had never really been to a club before. It's Vegas. 

So drinks here were reasonable. $12-14 for house vodka drinks. Cheaper than Manhattan. Bottles were comparable at $475-$500 for goose. The club is a bit more hazy than the NY TAO. I don't know why. A lot of international girls around. 

Overall it's a good choice. Fun atmosphere. The door was nicer than NYC. This was my first time at TAO in Vegas. I would come back here and get the VIP again.",5,4,4

Over the past three years, I have had some incredible nights dancing away at Tao.  I can even claim title of ""last one on the dance floor"" on two separate trips.

But on my most recent trip, I was disappointed to find that Tao has fallen victim of the classic club-life-cycle.  About a year ago it hit maturity, and now it's just plain lame.  I'm not a snob (I promise!), but I wouldn't spend an hour getting ready if I did not expect a certain level of selectiveness at a club in Las Vegas.    

This being said, the DJ is still good and the drinks are still overpriced.  AND, we were able to get a mixed-gender group of 20 in with no problems and no cover.  We would not have been able to pull that off two years ago, so maybe I shouldn't be complaining?",2,0,2

If you require people to get there before midnight, you should have the coat check set up at midnight.

Door Service: disappointing to say the least. One of the head service guys certainly took our money earlier in the day promising special service for our private table and bottle service, but the follow throw was lacking. Overly busy, forgetting us, and seeming overwhelmed -- he often tried to pawn us off on his co-workers who didn't do any better. A certain level of disorganization and waiting is expected at most Vegas clubs even when getting bottle service. This was way more than expected -- especially since we got there early in the evening. We waited a good 30 minutes and had paid for table. 

Bottle service: our waitress was excellent--friendly, fun, and attentive. We got two bottles and lots of fixings for an average price. The red bulls and other nicer mixers were extra -- common though some nightclubs include them. 
The bars were packed so it was totally worth it for 9 of us to get the table. We especially appreciated the bouncer escorts to the bathroom but likely would not have been necessary f they didn't let in too many people and have an awkward club layout. One of my party was asked by the bouncer for a tip afterwards -- not classy. 

Atmosphere: most people were having a good time. The DJs were spinning well with some good remixes of rap, hip hop and rock. There were a good bit of dancers perched around and they had talent. 

Space and clientele: the Buddhist decor was tasteful (though I suppose not tasteful in regards to hedonistic pleasures superimposed around them). The clientele was dressed well and I saw a few people turned away that were dressed too casual. Vibe was shiek club in general. The physical space was large but yet far too many people crammed in. Literally packed like sardines. Hard to get to the dance floor and quite a few people pushing and getting physical when their friends or sig-o's got smushed. Many of the bottle service tables were poorly positioned too with awkward flanking of bathrooms and elevator far from the dance floor. 

Takeaway: I was excited to see the hype and felt it was fun often in Tao, but the overcrowding\/letting way too many people on combined with poor door service and bad space for tables will keep me from returning.",5,0,0

People are packed in like sardines. I dislike using generic similes, but unfortunately this phrase is a scarily accurate description of the club. The entire expanse of the gigantic venue has people PACKED IN LIKE SARDINES. Or cattle.

Between the lounge room, the huge central area, Tao Beach and the dance floor on the first floor, traffic control is a pain in the rear. To get to the bathroom, you have to go out the door, down the hall, past the bar, up the stairs. To get to the exit, you have to go down the stairs, around the corner, down some more stairs, jostle past random dancing hos, past the line and out the door.

When requesting for bottle service, you get a condescending ""Sweetie, this is Tao on a holiday weekend you're looking at a 3-4 bottle minimum."" A table would have redeemed it all, I wanted one so bad. Unfortunately, a group rolling 5 deep and saddled with a $2000 bill does not equal acceptable! 

I hate Tao!!

PS. Drinks at the bar are CHEAP!! $12 for anything you can name: Bellini, Grey Goose\/Cran, Jack\/Coke, dirty  martini. 

For bottle service, the cheapest offering is Ketel One Vodka for $450, which is about $75 more than the average club price.

Hotel guests have priority at the door. The organization of entrance policy should be considered an art form.

If you avoid the main room with the capacity problem, it should be a decent night. That, or getting your own table.",4,3,2

The second time we flew in Thursday night and went to Tao for Industry Night. We probably arrived around 1am and just walked up to the doorman. He asked us if we were on a guest list, we smiled and said no and he let us in (prob a combination of us being girls + industry night).

The inside is Asian themed which is a little weird for me since I can actually read the Chinese characters pasted around the club. From what I remember there are 3 floors. We were on the second floor the majority of the time at a table. The table set up is a little weird because there is a velvet rope separating the dance floor with the table but it just gets annoying because you have to go all the way around to get to the other side and people just kept on pushing the rope around. 

The music was a good mix of top 40, house, hip hop...although there were some old creepers lurking doing some dance moves from the '70s.

Because it's an asian-influenced kinda club I guess? I never understood this... Tao club is the club for the Venetian, which is a hotel that clearly takes on the whole Europeanesque\/Italian theme. Then in the upstairs corner... it's like a China town WuShu temple karate kid nightclub with little asian figures and sculptures all around the place. 
The place is huge, but let's just say the max capacity here is 1,000 people. They try to pack in about 30,000 people. Well, at least that's what it felt like. Funny thing is, even though it's this packed, when we stepped outside, the lines were still insanely long. Workers are constantly yelling& telling people to not stand around where people are trying to walk. But the problem is, there's no where to really walk. You're just constantly shoving & pushing & bumping. When my gf & the girls would have to use the restroom (located upstairs), the guys would have to wait about 20-25 minutes. No joke.
There are girls who get paid to just lay around on couches and bathtubs, scattered around the entire place.
Luckily, we didn't have to wait in line & after much struggle with the bouncers, one bouncer allowed us to get in free even with a 4:3 guy\/girl ratio because we all had room keys and a couple of us were on the guest list.

Day 2 ended with a visit to this hot spot. Tao is both a restaurant and a nightclub. We had reservations for 9:15 and a good thing we had reservations because this place was packed and a long line for the nightclub had already formed. We marveled at the fact that people were already lining up before 10 pm. 

RESTAURANT REVIEW (the nightclub review will be below)

After waiting a few minutes, we were seated along the side of the restaurant  with corner bench seating, which I loved because we had plenty of room and a good view of what was going on. Or at least we would have had a good view if we could see what was happening because it was one of the darkest restaurants I've ever been in. Dim lighting for romantic ambience = good. Only candles for light when you need to read the menu = bad. The table next to us was prepared and a guy pulled out a flashlight and accidentally blinded my friend in the process when he wasn't too careful with the beam of light. 

We wanted to start with cocktails and appetizers, but oddly everything came all at once. I particularly loved my cocktail, Lemongrass Cooler, which is made of citrus vodka, oolong tea, and lemongrass syrup. It was light, crisp, refreshing, and utterly delightful. It's the perfect summertime cocktail. The sweet potato tempura was delicious. The batter was crispy and light and not at all oily. 

For my entree, I had the soy glazed salmon with udon and spinach. When the waiter didn't ask me how I wanted my salmon, I was a bit concerned. Either the restaurant firmly believed that there was only one correct way to serve cooked salmon (medium = good) or they were so used to tourists' unsophisticated palates that they're very conservative with how they cook it (well-done = bad). Guess what I got. *sigh* Overcooked dry salmon on top of overly soft, overly cooked udon noodles. 

Although I could be talked back to Tao for drinks and appetizers, I'll do dinner elsewhere.

NIGHTCLUB REVIEW

After dinner we decided to check out the nightclub. I was starting to get annoyed by the pretentiousness of this place. If you eat at the restaurant, you can skip the ridiculously long line and the cover charge. But in order to skip the line, someone stamps your left wrist with ""Line Pass,"" then you leave the restaurant to go stand outside in a line, albeit much shorter, in order to get another stamp on your right wrist that says ""Tao."" Why can't you just give us our ""Tao"" stamp right at the table? 

BTW, coat check is $5. 

At 10:30 the club was already packed and hopping. This was the most crowded club that I've ever been to, regardless of the time, much less way before midnight. It was unbelievable. We were packed in on the dance floor like sardines. The official crowd capacity is 1300, but we're pretty certain that it was over that. I hate to be at Tao if there were a fire. I'm sorry, but that place is a death trap with so many people and narrow points of entry\/exit. 

What's it like partying in Vegas at Tao, the hottest spot? Ho hum. I guess it's great if:

1) You're under 25. The crowd is awfully young.
2) You're a guy over 35 with low self-esteem so you can only handle a silly young thing.
3) You think Jersey Shore\/B&T (Bridge and Tunnel) is the height of fashion. No one looked sharp. Most looked really trashy. Quite frankly most the people would never make it off the line in New York or Miami.
4) You've never partied in NY or Miami. 
5) You (girl) want to be molested.
6) You (guy) want to be emasculated in front of your friends, which by the way the fastest way to achieve that is to grab a girl by her waist from the back, catching her unaware, and start grinding her. If that girl is a p***ed off NYer, she'll rip you a new one. 

I do have to admit that the music was great. The DJ played a really terrific selection and mixed them creatively. 

When we left a few hours later, the line to get into Tao was a labyrinth around The Venetian. As for me with Tao, show me ""the way"" out of here.",15,8,9

The restaurant is over-the-top delicious, they've got great desserts and a festive drink menu.  After dinner, you can choose to visit the TAO Lounge, head to TAO Nightclub or TAO Beach to catch some fresh air and escape the stuffiness of the club. 

The decor is Asian inspired and very cool, eclectic and classy.  The restaurant during dinner is not the best place if you're looking for privacy, a quiet atmosphere and private conversation because the music is pretty loud and there is so much going on. They do have private dining areas, but those are usually reserved for the VIPs\/celebrities who are appearing at TAO Nightclub that evening or you can call ahead of time to inquire about this part of the restaurant.  On the plus side, after you've had dinner here, you can let your server know you want to get into the club and you'll be personally escorted to the entrance.

Although people may complain that the club is ""sooo 2007"", one thing to remember is that clubs may come and go in Las Vegas, but TAO continues to be a force to be reckoned with when it comes to delivering top-notch celebrity driven events and world-reknowned DJs to its venue.   A few reviewers have mentioned that people have left TAO behind in favor of other nightclubs such as Marquee, but for those who don't know, Marquee is owned by the same team who owns TAO which just reaffirms the fact that TAO has paved the way for some of Vegas' hottest clubs today.",3,3,3

Once inside, you can't help but drop your jaw- what amazing decor, and what a big space. The main part was super crowded, you couldn't really get through anywhere, but the music was great. The bar was also full, but we were still able to get drinks easily. 

There are multiple rooms here at Tao, so explore! The other room was equally crowded and slightly claustrophobic. 

The crowd was a lot of fun, all sorts of people, different ages, looks, really was a super fun night, I would definitely come back. 

Tao Beach was also open at night, and that was really fun as well. I would love a nightclub like this in New York, I might even be inclined to pull myself away from the New York bar circuit and into the club circuit if we had something that resembled this HUGE space.

sometimes, it's not so easy convincing everyone to shell out $250 per head for just 3-4 hours of drunken debauchery. especially with many very happily married men in the group. but when the bachelor is a close friend, guys band together. background aside, i was expecting decent service for my group. 

tao started off ok even though we weren't in the main room. i had been here a few years back during the restaurant\/bar hours before they converted it into a nightclub. i had neither a positive or negative opinion of the place prior to this experience. 

the music, frankly, i thought was better than at marquee, which i had visited the night before. lots of 90s hip hop (dre and snoop dogg before he sold out), which was really fun to groove to. service was a little slow at times. but it was all good. 

however, when our table was moved to the main dance floor into VIP with some girls some of us had picked up on, things flipped. the security guard started grooving with the girls we were grooving on. 

one of my buddies who brought a specific girl over with us had to grab that girl away from the guard a few times because he was dancing with her. didn't react then. 

guard separated (cockblocked) me from a girl. didn't react then. 

the main man, the bachelor (pink sash and all - couldn't miss it), was trying to dance with a couple of the girls. no inappropriate contact. the guard had a nice little conversation with him for a good minute threatening to throw him out. then proceeded to grind with these girls himself. 

THIS pissed me off. first, you don't mess with the main VIP. the man we're celebrating. second, you don't dance up on the girls you're supposedly trying to protect so you, an employee of the club, can mack on them and cockblock your guests.

i approached the security guard and told him he was getting a bit too personal having seen his closeness to the girls (see pic). he said the girls didn't want to dance with the bachelor. ok. legit reason, if that's the case. but we were all respectful guys in our 30s. even when drunk, if you politely tell us to back off, we'll oblige. we're not kids. the explanation, needless to say, did not sit well with me. 

since i did not want to escalate the situation with security dude, i requested to speak to the manager, who i won't put on blast by naming here even though he wouldn't give me the security guard's name and refused to do anything on the spot. the least he could have done was assign the ""freaky"" security guy to another post and assign a new one to our area. hell, take those girls to a different area too. granted, it was 3am, but the gesture would have been appreciated. instead, i was advised the situation would be ""dealt"" with and that because he was an employee he shouldn't reprimand the guy in front of us. ""legal"" reasons. he did offer us a few free drinks at the bar, but by then the sour taste was already in our mouths. i declined. 

i will never go to TAO again. completely unprofessional and a buzzkill (obviously, if I remember this many details so clearly, it was a literal buzzkill). thumbs down. oh, and someone jacked my jacket here. 

if you're a group of guys looking to get a table in vegas, look elsewhere.",9,2,1

We made a reservation for dinner because they have a deal that if you eat at the restaurant, you get into the club for free and after seeing the ridiculous line outside, it sounded like a steal. Our reservation was for 11:00, we checked in at 10:45 and the hostess gave us a beeper and said she'd ring for us in 15 minutes. Reasonable. We sat down on one of the white couches they have but this was part of the club also so it was really loud and you couldn't hear a single person.

Waiting, waiting, waiting.

The club is getting more and more packed. It's 11:20 by this point and our beeper still hasn't gone off. I'm calm and decide to wait a few more minutes. Until I start seeing people who came in long after me getting seated right away. I go up to the hostess and ask her nicely when we're getting seated next. She says we're her next table of 5, so it'll be like five more minutes max.

I wait twenty more minutes and see a group of 5 get led to a table right next to where we're waiting. I walk back up to the hostess and calmly inform her that we've been waiting for 45 minutes for our reservation and if we're not going to be seated soon then she can cancel the table. She looks horrified and starts apologizing profusely, seats us immediately, and even offers my entire party a round of free drinks.

That's more I like it.

Before we ordered, we asked our server about the free admission to the club and he said in order to get that, we had to buy an entree each. We were a little disappointed, but he promised that if we just ordered at least the Filet, he would get us all free admission. We agreed and ordered the vegetable dumplings, sweet potato tempura, Chilean Sea Bass (I died), Filet Mignon, Pad Thai Noodles, and someone might have ordered a roll, but I can't recall.

Their food was amazing. That alone was about to redeem my already lackluster experience at TAO.

After dinner, we had to exit the restaurant and then get back into another line where they checked our IDs and purses. We go upstairs to where everyone seems to be headed and it's disappointing to say the least. The decoration was nothing special (except for the upstairs bathrooms. The doors are clear glass, but when you close them it becomes translucent.

The dance floor is extremely small. Like EXTREMELY. They roped off a different section, claiming it was VIP only. We decided to get off the dance floor and dance a little ways off, but the bouncers told us to keep moving. The bar is in an awkward set up -- right in the middle of the club, so traffic flow around the club is just slow and frustrating. After about twenty minutes of trying to dance and feeling claustrophobic with that many people in there, my best friend and I decided to call it a night.

I talked to the same friend who recommended TAO after I went and she swears that I just went on the wrong night, so I'm willing to give it another shot the next time I head to Vegas.",0,0,0

1)  Tao Lounge:  2-3 stars:  Very cool vibe with a nice seating area if you get there earlier in the night.  Basically, you should be there around 8\/8:30pm if you want a chance to enjoy the lounge.  Drinks had the asian-fusion vibe to them (duh) and my saketini was pretty damn good.  Unfortunately, our waitress was a big turn-off -- you could just tell that all she wanted was a tip.  No conversation, no friendliness, no rapport -- just business.

2)  Tao Nightclub:  3 - 4 stars:  We ate at the restaurant and got in without paying cover or waiting in the MASSIVE line.  Basically, come here early if you're not a hot group of girls or expect to wait forever.  The line here was unbelieveable -- it seemed to be the span of a few city blocks and lapped around the escalater area in front.

The club itself was pretty cool though it was PACKED.  People are basically packed in there like sardines.  If you want to relax, come early and stake out an area, or drop for bottle service.  This is a massive club with a few bar areas, and a balcony.

It's basically what you expect in a Las Vegas nightclub.",0,0,1

The music was decent for the night.  It was all hip hop but unknown random hip hop songs that you can dance to, but it's not as fun when you don't know what the song is.

Drinks: G&T and kamikazes go for $10, long islands for $12 to give you an idea of the price range.  I suppose it's not really that much different from other places.

Floorplan: Relatively small dance floor and lots of VIP areas.  Thank god ""normal"" people who can't spend hundreds of dollars a night have access to the large square bar and another bar off to the side past the outdoor balcony.

That balcony was one of the best parts of the night.  I got to get some fresh air, talk with friends, and even met some nice people while I was there.

cover was $10 for the night but then again, we got there at 10pm to avoid the long wait.  Didn't leave until 4am though, so I definitely had some fun.

good location inside the Venetian
cool bathrooms for the chicks with shadow forming door panels - a naughty cool indeed

Lots of fake boobies. More for show than touch.

Medium hungry group of 7 guys and just two $45 bottles of sake and the bill was $500.  The club was alright, but didn't live up to the hype really.

1. I can't comment on the line.  We skipped the line and walked right in :)
2. I LOVE all the little buddhas. It supports the asian-theme of Tao without being uber tacky.  The rest of the decor is awesome too.
3. I didn't think it was THAT crowded. It wasn't to the point where I had to squish my way in between people.  However, I must say this: people need to watch wear they step cuz if my toes get stepped on one more time..I'm gonna flip a b****.

PROS: 
- AMAZING décor for the club. Absolutely love the zen vibe along with the giant red chandeliers. 
- There are two dance floors with two different DJ's spinning different types of music. 
- One dance floor is a smaller one with a more intimate vibe (located on the left side once you've made it to the top of the stairs)
- The main dance floor is huge and surrounded by trendy looking VIP tables
- The DJ's are always spinning incredible music, making it impossible not to dance all night long. 
- Love the confetti and soap bubbles they blow out over the dance floor about every 30 minutes, makes it fun and exciting. 
- They have a nice balcony to go out on for some fresh air while you overlook the strip. 
- Sometimes Disco Dave is there (a human dancing disco ball)
- The lady dancers are good at keeping the crowd pumped up. 

CONS:
- Super crowded nightclub because it's so popular. 
- Sometimes it's tough to get in, even if you're on a VIP guest list
- The bouncers aren't particularly friendly. 

The stellar music, outrageous atmosphere, and extraordinary décor all keep me coming back for more. Definitely one of the best clubs in Vegas!",4,0,1

Ok so, again thank to Mike Nagar, TAO promoter. Got me and my friends on the list and we didn't have to pay. Just stand in the line and they ask who's on the list and I say my name and how many ppl and bam! That easy. You walk in or out. I can't remember, but you will see girls swimming in a bath full of rose petals with pasties on them and of course the guys looking at them as those they've never seen a half naked girl,.... for FREE that is.... ummm we will just leave it as that.

The decor other than that is nice, Asian fusion influenced. Dark inside. The inside is fairly small and crowded!

You can go up to the top and theres the outside section. Basically TAO beach at night. They have it sectioned off. There is the bar and a good dance floor there, hard to find places to sit and so watch out for when ppl leave. I like it out there, nice and opened, not so cramped as the inside is. However, be careful coming back down, esp those in heals. The downfall is the trek to get to the bathroom, a bit of a walk.

Music is decent, you know the trendy stuff, if you don't mind that. Does get the crowd going. 

Speaking of crowd, its okay, I didn't really talk to anyone. LOL I just kept with my friends. But as I did look around, some good looking people. A younger crowd comes here, around 20 slight 30 somethings.",0,0,0

If you are a group of single girls, you should have no problem getting in and free.  The trouble starts once you are in and some really dirty guys are all up in it.  But how you choose to deal with that situation is up to you.  Some girls like eurotrash and Saudi kings in Vegas on vacation.  No problem, you will love this place.  
It is truly ginormous. (OMG, that passed spellcheck, is ginormous really a word?)  The atmosphere was unique and fun and I appreciated all the different music areas. While the drinks are pretty good at the bar (pricey of course), avoid the shot waitresses that come around.  Those things are straight pucker and only 8% alcohol.
Bottom line, if you are a group of single girls.  You can just show up (getting a VIP pass ahead of time is a good idea) and have a great night dancing and bouncing around to all the different clubs.  However, if you are with a group including guys, it might be worth getting a table.  Quite a hefty price tag but some of the tables in the place are in stellar locations for dancing and watching all the action.  Others are more removed and not worth whatever they cost.  The Vegas club scene is not my favorite way to party the night away, but it definitely is for some people. Spend some serious money and have some serious fun.",1,1,1

This was actually my 4th or 5th time eating at this restaurant and I have never been let down. Here's the deal. If you need a place to eat then party, but are on a budget, this is the place to go. Take your typical Vegas night. If you were to eat anywhere, you would spend about $25+. Add a club then you're looking at waiting in a line plus a $25+ cover charge. EAT AT TAO, and you will end up paying about $30-$35 if you order an entree and water, PLUS you get the pass the line stamp (meaning you don't have to stand in line) and do not have to pay for cover. all in all, eating at tao, you will get the entree into the club for free and save yourself cover, and the hassle of a long line. 

I've read the reviews where people had to pay cover after eating at the restaurant. ASK YOUR SERVER\/WAITER or even ASK THE HOSTESS BEFORE you come in and sit down just to make sure. I have not been let down each time I've ate at this restaurant. I'M ALMOST 99% SURE you will get in for free at the club if you order the minimum of an entree per person by eating at the restaurant. 

Now, for the restaurant review. I made reservations. They accept reservations on opentable.com. However if you have more than 8 people in your party, you will need a credit card to hold the table. I requested a table on the second level and away from the crowd. I also let the restaurant know that we were celebrating a birthday. I LOVE THE FOOD HERE!!! IT IS AMAZING! The food here is $25+ an entree. Ive had the coconut shrimp, the kung pao chicken, some noodles (can't remember which one we had), and the new york steak with potatoes. all those dishes are DELICIOUS!! my friends had the swordfish and the lobster and they also enjoyed their dish!!! Our servers name was Nate. He took great care of us!!! He was very attentive. The other servers around the area were also attentive. They were refilling our waters and emptying our plates from the table. All in all the FOOD IS AMAZING and I highly recommend this place if you want something upscale and trendy. 

A downfall for some people about this restaurant is that the music is loud. It has the new york upscale trendy bar\/lounge\/restaurant feel to it so expect it to be loud and dark. 

NOW THE CLUB. After dinner, our waiter had this girl come and bring us stamps. We had to go back to the front of the restaurant and go through the security. After getting our stamps into the club, we had to go through the restaurant (again) just to get into the club. THIS WAS A LITTLE RIDICULOUS! I remember before we entered a different way (through the elevators). But maybe this is a fire hazard now or something. Anyways, there are two rooms .The main room is your typical top 100. IT IS CROWDED. Prepare to get run into and have little space as possible to move around. The patio is SMALL. a quick tip to get to the other end of the dance floor or the patio is to go through the hallway right before the main room on the left side. its a small hallway but hardly anyone goes through this way and it'll lead you directly to the other side of the club without the hassle of dancing people. The second room is to the left of the top of the stairs from the restaurant area. Its smaller, but it has good music and more space to dance. 

Another tip, LADIES if you need to use the restroom and do not mind climbing the stairs, GO TO THE RESTAURANT RESTROOM!! it's faster than waiting in line for the club restroom. =)

Hope this review helps!!! =)",6,0,2

My group arrived extremely early (around 8 pm) and the lines were still ridiculously long. When we got in.. the place was so packed, there was no room to dance! We decided to leave after a hour because we weren't having a good time. As we were making our way out of the club, there  was a longer line to LEAVE the club! So it basically took one hour to enter the club and another hour to depart the club. A little absurd.

As we reached the entrance while leaving the club, the bouncers were distributing complimentary TAO flip flops to the ladies! How convenient! I'm giving TAO another star because of this! Too bad I didn't stay long enough because my feet weren't even hurting at all to wear them. They are super comfy by the way! 

So if you plan to leave the club early, you may be lucky enough to cop a pair of flip flops for your stroll to the taxi. They should have a complimentary incentive for the guys. Possibly TAO condoms? Ha- Ha.........",4,8,1

One of a kind interior, Asian influenced with the most amount of Buddha's in an interior as I have ever seen.

My friend had the prix fixe which was a great deal but way too much food for me, especially after AYCE buffet for lunch.

One that is more hip hop, pop, top 40's and the other is more of house music. When summer comes, Tao Beach will be open, and then there would be another level to go dancing! So three dance floors during that time! The view is spectacular! 

This is my second favorite nightclub! But you have to make sure that you find a promoter and get on the guest list! My promoter Chris hooked me up and my friends. I love that he took care of everything! He is definitely the best! =) Females have open bar around 10:30pm to 11:00pm now...I know they changed from 10:00pm to 11pm, but that is ok! The bartenders definitely hook it up for the ladies! Males usually have to pay $20 to $50 (can get more pricey if there are celebrities) depending if they like you or not (men and women)...I know politics....Hate it...But yes, people tend to be shallow, but you will definitely have fun at this nightclub! 

The nightclub definitely gets packed around 11pm so remember to go early!!! Trust me! The line can get ridiculously long! They tend to let female groups in after 10pm, so males...good luck! 

The bartenders are very sweet and nice as well as the servers! 

There isn't much sitting room except when you go to the front of the club, then there is like two benches. So ladies, if your feet hurt from your heels, this is the spot where you should be!

They really took care of me and my friend with waters when we needed and yummy drinks when we wanted.

And thank goodness for the giant fans, because I think people would be dying of heat exhaustion without it. Standing outside on the balcony was warmer than standing in the building. Crazy stuff.

It was cool to see a mixed crowd. When it gets packed, it is PACKED. It was rather difficult to maneuver through the crowd.

I had a really good time here and was sad to leave because I got separated from my friends and couldn't find them anywhere, panicked and just left.

But not after walking through the whole place and getting a feel for each and every room. I can see how the vibe might not be for some people, but I rather liked it.

It was near 1am.  We kind of thought we weren't going to get in (because of how late we were) but we did.  The place was still pretty packed inside; I didn't think it would be since this place has been around for awhile.  Good thing it was packed because dead clubs suck.

Since we were late, we stayed at the bar and bought rounds of shots until we lost count.  Once we were done fueling up, we hit the dance floor.  It was so crowded there.  There was really no dancing space.  I don't think the music played was top 40s.  It was more like hip hop and trap music.  Although it felt like urban night, the crowd was mixed.

Like any nightclub, there were cheesy girls who were practically naked and cheesy guys EVERYWHERE. There were a lot of bachelor and bachelorette parties... plenty of opportunities to get into big trouble here.

The best part was the terrace... it is perfect on a warm breezy night. I needed a break from the craziness inside and spent some time out there talking with some rando's. The view is magnificent!

On a serious note, the naked girls in the bathtub right next to the huge Buddha is kind of insulting to any Buddhists visiting the club. Also, the club has a billboard along the strip that reads: ""Always a happy ending..."" WTF??? No we will not love you long time!!!

We were dancing on the second floor, but I missed out on seeing the ladies with pasties, dancing in petal-laden tubs. Sad face... Lol.

 Downsides . . . . . 
- Drinks are the usual $10-$15
- Extremely long lines, if you get their 30 min before opening, expect to be there up to an hour after they open
- if your a guy and aren't accompanied by a group of ladies, then you'll wait even longer.
- No room to dance, dance floor to table ratio is about 15% dance floor and 85% tables. When I say dance floor that includes the hallways and isles. 
- music is just average in the main room, not bad, but not great. Music is much more diverse\/slightly better in that one small room
- staff seemed friendly,

Reason to go . . . . . 
- its Vegas, why not try it
- decent guy to girl ratio, even though they seem to let in 5 ladies for everyone guy, it doesn't seem that way inside
- slightly above average ratio of better looking ladies to uglies
- women in bath tubs (little over rated though)
- the waitresses looked better than most of women there

Tips 
- go early unless you like slowly losing your buzz in line for an hour or two
- if your a guy, bring women even if their slightly ugly or you don't know them, saves a ton of time in line
- if you plan on going and drinking @ TAO with a large group, get a table & a bottle.
- get on the guest list
- get drunk @ the bar next door w\/that subway inside or pick up a handle @ CVS\/walgreens to the left",0,0,0

I was there Saturday night with my sister, her fiancé and my boyfriend and we had a great time. I would definitely recommend to get on the guest list which we did. You always have to worry about cover fees for men in Vegas but luckily they were able to get in for free because we had an equal ratio.
 
We were told by our promoter to arrive early so that us ladies could take advantage of the open bar wristbands, which lasted an hour. He even gave the guys a couple of drink tickets which I thought was extremely nice. We waited probably a minute before getting let in and we were escorted to the club area upstairs (The restaurant is downstairs and it is extremely beautiful in there I would like to check that out next time) 
The DJ played a little bit of tunes from the early 2000's along with some top 40. The club was not extremely crowded and you didn't have security guards on top of you all night telling you you can't stand here,you can't stand there or ""keep it moving"" which is a major plus in my book. 

All in all we paid for one drink, paid nothing to get in and had a nice time. It is definitely one of the smaller and more chill clubs in Vegas so if you don't feel like partying like an absolute rock star then I would definitely recommend checking Tao out.
We stayed for a couple of hours and continued our night gambling and barhopping.

But Tao was dope

After going to the wedding of a dude that I barely know, his boss paid for a table and 5 bottles. Standing in line, paying a cover, and not having this dude spend $2500 for all our drinks would have put a damper on my experience, but still... great club. I'd spend a couple hundred bucks to go there once before I'd spend 50 bucks at 4 different places. 

The girls in the bathtub were lovely.

My minor beef is that the music was terrible. This is true of every club in Vegas, and I didn't even care at the time. But they must have played In Da Club 15 times. Plus some ridiculous shit like remixes of Sweet Home Alabama. Get a real DJ. Whatever, not a huge deal.",0,0,0

I had a blast coming here with my friends on a Friday night and another great thing was that we were able to get in for free, thanks to my promoter Mike Nagar =)

Since we were on the guestlist, we came here a little before opening, got in after like 15 minutes, and we were lead to the Tao Beach area. Omg... the stairs to go up to the club was soooo tiring... I wish there were elevators. But it was okay... a great thing was that it was open bar for ladies for 2 hours, so me and my girlfriends totally took advantage of that, and gave some to our guy friends as well. The drinks were good and strong too.

The Tao beach area was a cool place to chill and talk with other people. There are some couches to sit and and multiple bars. We later went to the main room and started dancing the night away... I can't really explain too much about that experience because by then I was really super drunk, haha. All I remember was that it was crowded, good music, and blurry visions of the area. 

Overall, I had a blast and me and my friends can't wait to go back. I only took one star off only because 1. it was really crowded and 2. The stairs to go up to the club and 3. they X'ed me as I was leaving because I was really drunk haha. Thank you open bar.",0,0,0

But it's not their whole fault.  We called in at 5pm and they gave us a 10:45pm reservation.  When we walked up at 10:30pm, the group in front of me said that they had to wait over 30 minutes after their reservation.  I thought ""Looks like we're going to have to wait a while."" (party of 6)

And I said it's not their whole fault because two years ago we made our reservations 3 weeks in advance.  We made reservations at 7pm and we were seated at 7pm.

The hostess at the front was great!  I'm surprised she could talk to me with a smile during the craziness that goes on here at Tao Restaurant!

The food here holds up my stars.  I had the rare tuna with bean sprouts.  I've never thought much about bean sprouts but their bean sprout salad had this fresh, sour sauce that made me finish my salad before my tuna!  

We took the dinner route like we did two years ago because we wanted to get into the nightclub.  Everything was going well until the bouncer did not let one of my friends in because he wore a T-Shirt.

When I go for a weekend in Vegas I always want one night at Tao, preferably the first night, to get myself in that ""let's f*cking party!"" state of mind.

First thing you gotta be ok with in this place is that's it's gonna be really crowded, but if you're there for the right reasons you won't care.  The wait for a drink is not bad at all if you walk up to the bar, it's just moving around the place that gets difficult.  I think the crowded aspect might bother you but you just gotta get over it because that's all mental (real talk).  So get over that aspect, get your drink on, put your elbows out and get on the dance floor.

If you don't dance, don't bother coming here because you will be miserable.

I can definitely see why people hook up at Tao though. YOU CAN BARELY SEE IN THERE! Get drunk and Im sure everyone starts looking hot in there eventually. Eww.. hahaha. You better not get too wasted in there people.

Line issue. RIDICULOUS. You better have a VIP host or get bottle service if you're coming here. (Even then it's a pain...) 
Otherwise? FORGET ABOUT IT!

Have a cock and no chicks around you? Find another club to try. hahaha. Im not being funny! I am serious! There were people everywhere trying to get more girls into their party so they can get inside. It looked like everyone was working their tail off!

Step 0: Go to Vegas as a group of 6 hot 20something girls
Step 1: Find a promoter's email online and get added to the guest list

Step 3: As a group of 6 girls, get pulled out of the line and given wristbands (open bar til 11:30)
Step 4: Have the Vegas gods smile on you as the promoter tells your group that they'll be giving you an empty bottle service table, until the paying customer shows up
Step 5: Be amazed that you are led to a special elevator to your table
Step 6: Acknowledge that the table is in a weird location, but jump up and down excitedly 
Step 7: Grab some drinks from the bar, take them back to your TABLE, and dance the night away

The drinks: Incredible. I asked the bartender to make me something good and he delivered! He made me a fruity concoction with a kick. The bar service was quick and super friendly! Definitely made me more inclined to leave a good tip.

The wait was really long, but thats expected. But what made this such a unsatisfying experience is the amount of people they let into the place. Dancing was impossible and no amount of alcohol can help you ignore the ass-bumps and grinds, shoving from people trying to get in and out, or the suffocating heat.

Had dinner reservations for 3 at 9pm. Arrived early to the restaurant, notified the host and went to the bar. The host was kind of an asshole. He made sure we closed out of bar tab before we got to our dinner table. The drinks were blah, typical vegas prices. Now onto the food. My girl friends and I ordered small bites to eat (before we went to the club). The food arrived barely warm and it was just mediocre. I think would've gotten better quality and flavor from a restaurant in Chinatown. As we were waiting it out til 10pm (when the club opens), we ordered another dish, the pad thai. It was unflavorful and filled with mostly bean sprouts. We wrapped things up around 10pm, got our bill and our server forgot the pad thai (score!). He stamped our hands for our free entrance (and line skipping) to Tao that night. Trey Songz was hosting at Tao that night and my advice is if you want to avoid paying for the club and standing in a ridiculously long line, get dinner reservations here, so you'll surpass the line and get into the club without any troubles.

Tao had a mixed crowd and the music was on point. It got a little crowded, but that happens everywhere. Waited and waited for Trey Songz to make his appearance, but nada. Oh wells, off to another club we went.......

Pay money to get into a room that is way too packed and too loud that it needs to be?  Pass.  But in Vegas, it's almost a given that we have to go...so at least with Tao, it didn't cost as much as it could have!  

In order to avoid eating somewhere and then coming back to a line, we ended up eating at Tao.  Beyond the convenience, it saved quite a bit of money too - rather than wait in line, you can go straight up to the club after exiting and then immediately re-entering so that they can check ID's.  No line and no cover for our party of 12?  Not too bad.

The meal wasn't anything spectacular - okay, but pricey.  However, since paying for the meal was essentially the cover, it kinda made up for it in a way though.  Kinda.  I wanted to load up on some carbs drinking and ordered the Lobster and Kimchi fried rice along with the Angry Dragon Roll.  Pretty boring, I know.  Overall, the food was pretty lackluster, especially given the price.  The roll tasted fine, but it was like what you could find at just about any decent Japanese restaurant.  I thought the fried rice was lacking in lobster meat and  flavor, but the kimchi satisfied my craving for Korean food (could have been a bit more potent and spicy though).

As for the club, it takes up a lot of space, but it wasn't exactly spacious.  The decor is nice and they have go-go ""dancers"" around to liven up the place.  In the apparent main room though, the VIP section is almost right in the center of everything, so navigating around was difficult with all of the people.  At least they had a couple of bars going so that we didn't ever have to walk too far.  As more people started filing in though, we ended up going upstairs and spending the rest of our night outside by Tao Beach.  Despite being a hot summer night, it was still cooler outside than it was inside.

Yeah yeah sorry for being a tourist first. We wait in line for 25 mins in the general admission line and its 20 bucks each.. Me and 3 girls equals 80 bucks WTF. I think tao doesn't know there's a recession or maybe doesn't care. I should have seen it when they walk 12 girls in and 2 mins later they all walk out. If I was with the guys I would have followed them instead going inside. What are they thinking, hot girls never want to pay cover. I did see some guy get in with the laced vans though.

when we get in its a huge cluster f#*k as usual. No room to dance or do anything. We go and head to the bar. 4 drinks were 67 bucks plus tips. At least the bartenders are fast and courteous.

My friend decided he wants to ask his girl to marry him, so my wife told the folks at Tao to sit us in a nice table.

We ordered 3 bottles so we could get a table on the inside instead of Tao Beach (which is still nice).  And I really liked our table location being in the side room rather than the main room, because it made it much easier for us to get to\/leave our table when we wanted to use the bathroom or explore the club, we still had plenty of room to dance,  and the music in our room was an excellent music of rap, hip hop, white rock music, I think the only time we didn't like it was the short 20 mins of techno or so..which stopped as soon as we made a complaint about it.  

  Bottle service is definitely the way to go.   From the moment we stepped up to the club to check-in we were treated like rock stars.  It was by far our best clubbing experience ever, and well worth the money.  
  Service: Our waitress didn't check on us too much as she mainly just came by refill our glasses, and clean up the table when necessary. BTW if it matters, our waitress (for the guys) was hot! (pictures will be up soon).  Our table assistant Jeff was by far one of the coolest people I've met and he was constantly checking on us to make sure that we were having a good time, bringing us random sh*t if\/when we needed it, and helped keep spirits high at all times. Our bouncer Ron was awesome as well, he was also constantly checking on us..and if necessary would walk our girls to the bathroom to skip the bathroom line (which I know for girls can be nuts).  Lastly our VIP host Larson did an excellent job keeping us updated on anything, and answering any\/all questions (which were plenty) that we had.  Although I found it quite weird a different host walked to us our table named Paul...but he was cool as well.

  Environment:  The decor in Tao is quite nice, it definitely got crowded in the mainroom as the night went on, but as you read above, we didn't visit the mainroom too often..so that wasn't a factor for us. Most of us stuck right around our table with enough room to dance, a closer bathroom to access, the music in our room never even made us debate leaving other than to check out the other parts of the club.  I like the gigantic BUddhas, the theme of the night club was cool, and of course the half naked girls dancing, standing in hallways, massaging each other, and sitting in a bathtub was quite cool to take pictures of.  BTW there are BOUNCERS everywhere in this club, if some dumbass tries to start something...I would recommend setting your ego aside and letting it go..because i'm pretty sure you'd get your ass kicked 10 times and thrown out before you even knew what happened.
  
    I can't compare bottle service from Tao to other Vegas clubs (yet), but I will say we don't regret anything. The bottle prices were pretty standard from what research I did..$425 for Kettel ONe and Cap'n Mo, $450 for Grey Goose (so you might as well stick with Grey goose). If you can afford it, bottle service from start-finish is the best way to go. I'll admit I was at first a little worried after reading all the other reviews on Tao before setting up my Table reservation (regarding long lines in the club\/bathroom and being super crowded), but we didn't have any of those problems. We all had an amazing night (We were there from 10pm - 3 am..add another hour considering it was fall back daylight savings time), and I can't give this place any less than five stars.

The first time I went to TAO was back in 2008, and I was freshly 21. I remember first going to TAO beach and climbing a butt load of stairs to get to the roof. I also remember the crowd being pretty easy and letting me nudge my way through to the bar and getting my orders in before other people who were obviously waiting forever. Oops, sorry.

TAO itself was lots of fun until I got myself and my group kicked out for being too rowdy. Lol. 

Fast forward to the last time I went to TAO. Maybe it was a bad night, but the crowd wasn't fun and I wasn't feeling the music too much. It was so crowded that I was pushed up against people on all sides, and I was literally swept up by the crowd and moved about 3 feet over. Hahaha.

It was a Thursday, which I was told the best night since its their first night open during the week. I was with my girlfriends and some had their boyfriends with them; but the ratio of girls and boys in our party was 7:3. So there's still a good chance we'll get in front of the line plus some of my friends were locals and that's added bonus! 
We were waiting for our ""VIP"" friend who was not yet there so we had to wait for her to get there. Then this group of guys came up to us and told us they've got connections and they can get us in in no time. Well, we got connections too but she was no where in sight yet so we grab the next best thing! 
We got in, got stamped, and ready to party...without paying for cover!
After like 3o minutes our VIP friend arrived and got us in the circle of VIP - literary a circle. It's this circular space in the middle of the club (right where the tub with two naked girls was). Strictly ONLY for ladies, so my friends who had their boyfriends obviously were not in this circle. But man, this VIP was awesome: there were countless bottles of Grey Goose, the club that night was soo crowded you can barely have a place to put your drink down so it was nice having an actual chair where I can rest my feet from dancing. I had a little talk with this VIP chick who got us in, and lo and behold she was the girlfriend of one of the co-owner of that shit! That's when it all came together and made sense to me  ...  why in the world when we went to use to powder room, even those 'bathroom ladies' know her and even there, we were in the front of the line! And for the first time, I felt bad for those standing in line, because I really didn't need to go, but because I have this bathroom fetish (I sometimes judge a place by its restroom) I had to go. Evidently, the service was superb!
The crowd, DJ, drinks, was everything I need it to be. I definitely had a blast! To keep it simple: I loved it!

We skipped the lines on a late Saturday night by the power of a great smile.  As we moved swiftly through the 'tunnel' of rose petal-filled bathtubs, we emerged into the first room right outside the restaurant of Tao.  On this floor, electronica was being played.  Not a whole lot people hung out on this floor when we were there.

Moving upstairs, we walked into the main floor.  This time there were hot girls with hot bodies working the stage from above and the bathtubs below.   It was a bit crowded for us, so we moved into the other room where we found some cool people who were more than willing to give us drinks and take part in our 30th birthday party celebration.  We like fun people who don't mind sharing!  After getting all sweaty in there, we moved back into the main room.  Finding some space in the middle, we were able to shake out booties and enjoy the fun crowd.  I must admit, the people we met were pretty cool.  Of course, there are always those pervs who just work their way up to you and start bumping against your ass.  (What happened to asking first?)  

Overall, hanging out at Tao on a Saturday night (once you bypass the crowd) is pretty cool.  I guess it all depends on the company!  I can only hope you're lucky to go with such fun people!

Reason #1 : 
As a female I did not have to pay to get in but my male friends had to pay 30 bucks! Now looking back I wouldn't pay 5 cents to get in! 
Reason #2:
After about an hour the club started getting full to the point we couldn't move and the stupid bouncers kept telling us to move because we were blocking the way! We couldn't move because there were way too many people everywhere. 
Reason #3:
The DJ sucked..playing little snips of top 40 hits..lame.
Reason #4:
Unless you reserve a table do not even plan to sit down and rest or have a drink because there is absolutely no where to sit.
Reason #5:
Our group got separated and my sister was given a date rape drug here..when she finally found a bouncer to help her he picked her up, carried her to the side of the strip and left her.   She couldn't get up and walk due to the drug she was given.

I came here for Halloween. We had dinner before hand and met the owner's brother, who is the manager of the night. He got us into the club afterward and gave us a bunch of free drink tickets, which was very nice of him. 

The theme and decor is tasteful. You can see a lot of time went into choosing every fascia, from the bathroom sinks, to the bathtub hall. There is a heavy Asian theme but with the name Tao we shouldn't expect anything else. Asian accents throughout the entire club. Dark walls and flooring accented with red museum lights and Asian accents.

The downstairs dance floor was packed but oddly, not full of douche bags. Don't get me wrong, douche bags were in attendance as they always are at clubs but the ratio of douche baggery wasn't high. Kinda unexpected. especially for a club in Vegas. Girls in attendance were beautiful and the bartenders and hostesses were even hotter.

The electronically activated frosted glass bathrooms surrounding the dance floor is a nice touch. Although don't forget to lock the door or the glass stays clear! I'm sure the girl peeing for everyone to see can attest to that.

The upstairs pool area is where this club really shines. Coming up to the pool area from the hot dance floor, we are greeted with open skies and even more dance floor. The music was great all night and everyone came out for a good time. Low douche bag ratio, high spirits, and outstanding decor is what separates this club from the rest. Tao has set a new standard for the mega club and should be a benchmark here on in.

But the guy directing people to the lines made us go in the wrong line so we waited for 30 min before realizing the dumbass's mistake. We walked passed the line and scurried in.

Holy shit, can we say sardine can? Totally packed packed packed. What's a danceclub if you have no room to dance? The main dance floor was ESPECIALLY overwhelming. Even the bar area was crowded. The crowd was so-so, there were some gorgeous people but that was countered by a surprisingly high number of fuglies.

The decor was beautiful, stunning, I loved it. Dark and zen like feel with some hot girls parading all around in lingerie. Naked girls with petals covering their boobies in bathtubs.

O yea, we saw Seal perform his new song, he was awesome! I think heidi klum was there too.

Its sad that so many guys get hassled for what they wear. I saw so many girls in the club wear these stupid shirts that read ""its my birthday!"" Or ""getting married bachelorette party 2008"".

You serious? You're wearing a stupid shirt and you made your whole crew where them too. They all stood our like sore thumbs since I saw some hot girls wearing some sluttty dresses. Hey its Vegas, baby!

However, Tao gets extremely packed and at times it can be overwhelming. Essentially if you are looking for a club with hip music and a trendy vibe, Tao is the place to be!

Some suggestions would be:
- Try to get on the guest list earlier that evening. Free for girls and reduced admission for guys.
- Have a 1 to 1 guy-girl ratio. Tao tends to be very strict on this. However, if you are a guest at the hotel they tend to be more lenient. 
- If you are a guest at the hotel, I believe you wait in a separate line that moves much quicker.
- Girls on the guest list receive open bar for 1 hour, at least the times I've been! So stock up on those drinks and pass them to your guy friends!

Once inside, the DJ was mediocre at best, club was so crowded you could barely move, and the only way to be able to take a seat anywhere is if you buy bottle service (which one bouncer told me costs about $3,000, so no thanks). I get it, it's Vegas and clubs are crowded and drinks are overpriced, but being told that you can't sit down at an empty table in a row of empty tables just because you didn't order an entire bottle of alcohol is like a cruel punishment when you've been wearing heels all night.

A neighboring VIP table had people coming to our table pouring themselves drinks and trying to snag our champagne. Are you KIDDING me? Where's my hostess? Where's our host?

I write this with a particular bias:  I am OLD.  When I say old, I mean no longer willing to stand in lines\/be cold\/be shoved around\/wait 30 minutes for a drink OLD.  

Tao was freaky in the first place with nearly naked prepubescent Chinese Olympic gymnast rejects climbing over each other in tubs and on tatami mats.  I knew it was going to be a very long and disappointing night from that moment forward.  

Even though our party was VIP, we still stood outside in the cold waiting to get in. That entered as Strike One in my book:  too many people in one club.  The next was that we were herded up to the cold-ass rooftop and huddled under heat lamps trying to figure out the most efficient way to get a drink (Strike Two).  Follow this up by ridiculous crowding on the inside, lots of pushing and general unrulyness and you have Strike Three for me. I all of a sudden became ill and that cemented the deal that I had to get the hell out of Dodge.  Plus the music was subpar by my standards and the drinks were both pricey and disgusting.  Never again.

The next day, my friend's girlfriend (who hadn't gone with) asked how the previous night was.  In the interest of not sounding like a total killjoy, I said 'twas okay.  My friend quickly follows up and says tell the truth, it was painful......I'm glad a male agreed!",1,2,1

My experience reads just like so many other negative reviews of Tao.

I ate at the restaurant and the food was fine but not fantastic. The price of the food however was what you would pay for amazing food. I had no problem with that however until I experienced the night club. I guess since they are considered one of the strip's top clubs (which is totally undeserved) they feel like they can have terrible attitudes. Maybe they even think being rude adds to their desirability. Whatever the reason the staff didn't know how to treat anyone and the club was so crowded we could barely move much less actually dance. 

Still I didn't have a huge problem until a large guard got overly aggressive with me. This man was literally about 4 times my size and got in my face when I called him out for being rude and speaking to people like they were dogs. When he got in my personal space and I still refused to back down he called over the real cops like a whiny little punk.

That's not happening.  

Why?  It's not the obvious. The staff were great.  The club looked good. Everything was lined up for a good night.  We got in around 11, and things felt a bit slow... But nothing out of the ordinary for that early in the night.  Figured we'd have a couple drinks, then hit the dance floor.  

That didn't happen either.  

Oh, we tried.   We drank those drinks.  And when the DJ sounded a bit rough, we drank more drinks.  When that didn't help, we drank MORE drinks.  What we lacked in initial enthusiasm, we certainly made up for with dedication.  

But it didn't help.  The DJ just got worse.  We stood there as a crowd, staring at him, motionless, silently urging him to play something, anything, we could dance to for more than 15 seconds.   There were brief glimpses of hope... A track with a beat, a mix with a hint of promise... And then the inevitable slide into seated frustration when hope was dashed by yet another weak transition out of the decent part of a dance tune into the boring part of an overplayed single.  

We stuck around for far too long hoping it would improve.  4 hours later (as we joined the crowd in yet another moment of motionless boredom waiting for the DJ to pull himself together and realize he'd completely lost the audience for the 50th time in an hour) we decided to throw in the towel and give it up.  There would be no dancing.  Better and drunker people than us had tried this night, but the DJ was adamant:  He was not going to play anything the audience liked, let alone anything they wanted to dance to.  

Maybe, just maybe, if this had all happened on a Tuesday evening, I'd let it slide.  Everyone needs space to work out new material, try different approaches, and, surprisingly, I do have better things to do with my time than write negative reviews.  

That's not what happened here.  Tonight was a Friday.  Friday is not a day to pull your back bencher and halfass a set.  Friday is the day you put on your A game and blow the roof off.  

TL;DR:  Service was great, ambiance was decent, but that can't save a dance club from weak DJs.  I've never seen a room full of loud music and drunk people so still and unmoved.  Even the bachelorettes were bored.  Hit a different spot or just throw a lightswitch rave in your hotel room and save yourself the cash.",1,3,1

Jake, a really cool promotions guy, approached Lindsey and I on the street early last Saturday and asked if we wanted to get VIP entrance into Tao at 10 pm and have an open bar.  So, after thinking about this for 2 nanoseconds, we eagerly agreed.  We had dinner reservations at Tao for 11 pm, and figured that we could have a few free drinks before being seated downstairs. 

After calling Tao to confirm that our promoter was legit (although I wasn't too concerned, since Mama taught me how to disable taillights when trapped inside a predator's trunk), Lindsey and I brought our sexy selves to the Girl's Only VIP line.  We received our wristbands and were quickly ushered in - past at least one hundred clubgoers in waiting (some people wait all night and are never permitted entry).  

At one of the bars (there are 3 on the main level and a few on ""the beach"" upstairs) the bartender sadly informed me that the best I could get with my free drink wristband is a Skyy and Red Bull.  Expecting a slap in the face from my high-maintenance friends, instead, he received squeals of delight.  Obviously, he isn't aware that we're girls who prefer top shelf but are just as happy shotgunning beers at a tailgate party.

After a delicious dinner at Tao (review to follow) we effortlessly re-entered the club upstairs.  There are three dance areas:  The large one on the main floor, one in a side room, and one upstairs at ""the beach.""  Beware of the single man that groups of guys send out to find cute girls and drag back to their table lair caveman style.

Being in a female-only group (although a male co-worker of mine was running around this place like a kid in a candy store) allowed us to receive the ultimate VIP treatment at this sexy ""see and be scene"" club.  It's nice having men in suits repeatedly request your presence at their special tables & VIP rooms with curtains - but not when the men's faces resemble that SNL skit where cousins breed with each other and spawn deformed offspring.  Also, the married men who were there to prove they ""still got it"" proved to be a little trying.  Come on, guys, do you think that we don't notice you keeping your left hands in your pockets, excusing yourselves to the restroom, coming back and gesturing with a tan-lined finger?  NiceGirl rule #84:  Don't do the nasty with guys who are taken.  Period.

Note: the restrooms are marked ""Yin"" and ""Yang.""  A little tipsy, I mistakenly wandered into the Yin room and saw a guy's Yang.  Not advisable (unless timed strategically after consuming copious amounts of high-proof liquor).


My favorite part?  ""The Beach"" upstairs.  Poolside setting (which is actually a hot place for sun and fun during the day), sexy environment, and a cool breeze to help you feel relaxed.

The motto of this Asian-inspired place is, ""Always a Happy Ending.""   Wow, that's gutsy.  Take with this what you like, but right around 4 am, Lindsey and I were forced to make a hasty retreat when the lights slightly brightened and the 4 am ""bed partner"" scramble began.

My friend's and I were on the guest list for a Friday night (6\/30) and went through the line smoothly. We made our way through the club and to the middle section were a bouncer waved us to a table. It was ladies night from 10:30-11:30 so we were able to have a few drinks at the bar and sit down until table reservations started to show. At the table we were approached by an employee and he went over the bottle service option if we wanted to keep the table past 11:30. We weren't into paying $600 for one bottle so we politely told him we'd pass. He then offered us a deal for $50 a person we could do a shared table option and drink whatever we wanted and that we would only have to share the table with others. Which for us was fine. We were there to party and socialize anyway. We proceeded to give him our cards and leave the spot we were currently in to line up at the entrance for the table upstairs. After waiting for what seemed like forever, my friend noticed that the charge was actually $101. She flagged down the waitress and asked her why the price difference, and she informed us that she didn't know why we were told $50 but that it was $79 plus tax & gratuity. My friends and I were a little irritated but still decided it was a decent deal considering it's Vegas and we just wanted to drink and sit down. So we accepted, but did want to mention to a manager that it shouldn't be the responsibility of the customers to pay for the mistake of someone who works there and that his employee shouldn't go around giving incorrect prices and information. It would have been good customer service to honor the price given. But the manager was a dick. He was extremely rude and even accused my friend of ""assault"" for touching his shoulder. Really jerk? He proceeded to argue with us about the information we received being incorrect even after the original employee came forward and admitted that he had given us the wrong prices. And the fact that we were still willing to pay the $101 should have warranted some kind of decency. Nope. None. He continued to argue with us the whole time. We just decided to say screw him and try to enjoy the night. But we felt there should have been some accommodation for the inconvenience and wrong info. We ended up sitting and a waitress came and informed us that the only drinks we could order were Vodka (ugh), Gin (bigger ugh) or champagne. AND AGAIN ANOTHER PIECE OF WRONG INFORMATION. We were originally told we could order what we wanted. We had all been drinking dark liquor that night and didn't want to get sick by mixing.That was the last straw and we decided to get a refund on the table and leave.

First, I had no problems getting in as I was a guest at the hotel, unlike some other posers who had to wait in line. Once inside, I found it to be a bit disorganized, with small dance floors scattered here and there, none of them with enough room for the amount of people they were letting in. Going from one place to another is a pain in the ass, since there are tons of people and as another reviewer noted, lots of bottleneck locations. 

The bar is by far more disorganized than the rest of the club. There are so many people crowded around that it's almost impossible to get a drink. Think Dave and Buster's on thursday nights, times 10. I really do not like having to wait in line to get a drink when I can be on the dance floor having fun. Of course you can't do that because there are so many people, so all you end up doing here is pushing and waiting until you're tired and convince yourself that it was worth it.

No matter how many times I go to TAO (most recent visit was on Thursday, 7.29.10), I still, to put it lightly, HATE IT! The layout sucks (stairs everywhere which is a no bueno for clumsy drunktards like myself), it's ALWAYS packed like sardines and it gets so effen HOT that it feels like you're doing bikram yoga standing still.

HOWEVER, I'm bumping up my rating to 3 stars for the following reasons:

1) The Music! I love clubs that play Hip Hop and Tao is the only cracking club in Vegas where the main area plays strictly Top 40s and Hip Hop w\/o getting ruined by house music being mixed in. (Tao Beach upstairs plays Trance\/House and The Lounge downstairs area plays House w\/ some Top 40s thrown in).

2) OPEN BAR on Thursdays from 10 PM-11 PM for Ladies (well drinks only). You need to get on the GL for open bar and there are normally promoters lingering around the Venetian or Palazzo to sign you up or you can sign up on their website (7 days in advance). Make sure to check in under GL even if you're a hotel guest b\/c you will need a wrist band for the open bar. 

3) Free cover for Venetian and Palazzo guests and the line for hotel guests are never more than 10-15 minutes long. (Cover is $20 for girls and $30 for guys.) 

4) Drinks has gone down to $13 from $17 for top-shelf liquor.

5) Security was nice and let us sit downstairs in the lounge area. We only had to move if someone booked the table. No one did till 1:30 AM, so we got to chill there until then. 

If you have only the weekend to party, please don't waste your time at TAO and go to XS, Surrender or Tryst (avoid Thursdays though unless you enjoy Geriatric night) instead. However, if you have 3-4 nights to party OR if you get bottle service (bottles start at $425 w\/ a 2 bottle min.) at one of the Sky Boxes overlooking the craziness, then DO IT! Without bottle service, you are highly unlikely to have a good time b\/c it gets so crowded that you have nowhere to dance, much less move or breathe. I don't care how drunk you get, there's nothing remotely fun about getting shoved, elbowed, stomped on, or having sweaty bodies rubbing against you. 

After one visit to Tao, you'll realize the importance of Personal Space and will be willing to shell out $$$$ the next time around for bottle service. And, if you're a group of shy guys getting bottle service, no effort is needed to hollar at girls; the leeches will come flocking in swarms to you and your boys. So beware...",10,8,7

He most likely didn't see me cracking up, cos it was dark and he was trying hard to impress me with his dance moves. 

Three tequila shots=$40.00 bucks which is the price of one bottle of Silver Patron=many many shots. All the clubs in LV were extremely overpriced. $13.00 a shot of tequila???? (profanity words).

As far about the club by itself, was ridiculous, we had VIP passes, they made us wait in line for like 30+ minutes. They had arranged three lines, VIP, guest-list and the regular. Didn't make sense to me to wait since e had the VIP passes, especially outside on 110F. The bouncers were cool though, didn't have the LA attitude, (at least not to us).

One thing I super love about Tao is the entrance, first it's like a cave, then there's a nice long hallway and stairs and you're able to view the restaurant below. In fact, Tao was my favorite nightclub in Vegas for quite a while. 
The only thing I say that knocks Tao down is that it has become too popular if that makes sense. I say that as in it became a destination. I had so many people from out of town always keep asking and wanting to go to Tao  it ended up becoming too oversaturated. Even more so than other clubs on the strip.

Over-packed on weekends, ridiculously expensive, but hot crowd, awesome Asian style decor, and fantastic go-go dancers.

It looks like they raise the cover fee every time I get there, last time it was $35 w\/o guest list and $25 if you're on. It's Vegas so don't expect to save money. And make sure not to wait in the wrong line at the door. Drinks are average $15 and are served in several bars throughout the club\/lounge.

The Asian theme makes the night club very unique, there are (almost) naked girls playing with each other in the main hallway (guarded by security), and the main dance floor also hosts a tub 'filled' with two sexy bikini girls.

Awesome decor. I looooove everything Buddha, and the feel of this club is awesome. The little bathtubs filled with water, candles, and rose petals is really pretty. The humongous Buddha on the side of the club is so rad.
And the fact that there are like 4 different rooms\/clubs within this club make it even better!

I've been to TAO many times before and have always enjoyed myself. I went 2 weeks ago and had the best time yet. We had about 11 people and ended up just getting a table and bottle service. 2 bottles of Grey Goose, 1 bottle of Macallan 21, and a bottle of Rum. And all the mixers we needed. The area we had was really quite big, and we all had room to comfortably sit down if need be. But we danced the night away :)

I guess there are parts of the club that close earlier than others, because our section closed around 3-4am? Whatever time it was, it closed and we moved to another part of the club. This area was just as fun, but we didn't have a table. We continued dancing and having a great time. Then from the ceiling comes confetti :) and about 30min later dry foam comes out. Way fun when you're wasted lol

Everything doubles - population, prices booked rooms, douchebags.  

A tip of advice, walk around the casino and guys will come find you to put you on the guest list. Even the Guest list can sometimes be a long line but better than paying to get in and standing in the 11pm line. My girls surprised me with a trip to Vegas for my Bachelorette party in November. We got wrist banded since we were in there early, were set up with a table and $2.50 drinks for 2 hours.. There was 5 of us, perfect to be sitting and dancing around the table while a foot away,everyone else was on the dance floor. It does get crowded on there.. and unless you're gonna pole dance on the platform or get down with 7 other people surrounding you, be cautious.

It's a fun place, but don't get me wrong..I totally agree with a few other reviews on the ages in there..It fluctuates and sometimes has a younger crowd, but dang in some tables, old (40 and up) guys, buying bottles to attract 20-somethings, girls. Don't blame them, cause it works..There were never empty spots where bottles were present.

It gets super packed in here. I didn't spend much time inside, and the wait to actually leave the venue might test your patience. 

Again, talent is on point, and a good amount want to hear that you are a real life Christian Troy. I told them the truth, that I am a "" Wealthy Yelper"" ...That's how you close deals ; ) 

All in all here is your Tao handbook to do it right.: 

* Bottle Service. 
* Get an outside table
* Hopefully get the waitress we had
* Do not allow grenades to drink for free ( I escaped one that was trying really hard, she almost devoured me )

Club - SUCKS

We ate dinner at Tao on a Saturday nite and marveled at the decor.  Food was delicious (chicken satay, shrimp and chicken low mein, pork fried rice and chinese broccoli were awesome).  Our waiter could not have been more pleasant.  Which is tough with a bachelorette party who is giving each other nasty Barbie doll names and playing with the 6 foot pecker accompanying the bride to be.  We had called ahead and were told that we would receive complimentary admission to the club (and should considering we dropped a G on dinner).  Once there we were told that we were only entitled to a line pass and that we would need to pay $20 for admission.  Since everything else in Vegas would be at least $30, we decided to pay it.  

The ambience was beautiful but the host and the clientele destroyed all beauty in this place.  We walked in observing bathtubs filled with rose petals.  Once inside the main room, beautiful Asian women in black lingerie transformed a buddhist meditation palace into a Bangkok brothel.  After having our feet stepped on too many times, we decided to get a table with bottle service.  The host made us wait 45 minutes before taking us to a table in a completely different room playing music we didn't like.  When we told him that we wanted to be in the hip-hop room, he threw my girlfriend's credit card back at us and said that he didn't have anything for us.  What an asshole!

Great mix of music, multi level of hanging out, large and somewhat spacious dance floor. I found that even my friends who didn't like clubs came here and liked it.

After dinner, they gave us a ""complimentary stamp"" to go upstairs to their nightclub. Considering we spent some good cash on dinner and drinks, we figured this was pretty standard. They told us to go back to the front and simply show our ID's and they would escort us upstairs.

Not the case. First person we went to told us to go to another bouncer, who then told us we had to go outside and get in the ""VIP line"". They made us stand there for 10 minutes, only to turn us away telling us it was the ""table service line"" and the VIP line was ""over there"" with no other direction. There was no VIP line. Should take care of paying customers, or at the very least treat them with a little more respect. If you want to go to the club, don't bother eating here. They'll just send you back outside and make you stand in line behind 60 drunk people who can barely stand, act super rude in the process, and make you regret you ever came here.

wanna get in for free? call the club and get on the guest list then line up at around 9:30pm.

want free drinks? bring women. the ladies i was with got wrist bands for an open bar from 10pm - 11pm. so, they got drinks for free, gave them to me and the fellas, then got some more for themselves!

we waited in line for 30 or so minutes but there was no cover and all the guys got free drinks courtesy of the ladies! the ladies themselves got free drinks too! hell yeah! *fist pumps* gwahahaha!

i liked the crowd here. more sophisticated\/decent than jet night club which, we went to the next night. go read my review on it after this!

one last thing, is there seriously just one freaking dance floor? my gawd! our group of 9 kept walking around...

single file and holding hands! cause it was crowded as fahk!!! XD

(i felt like i was in elementary school on a field trip to the library)

...looking for another dance floor only to find another room full of couches and shit. no dance floor at all in that area.

i heard people here on yelp talk about tao beach and to just go upstairs. well, we tried that and i guess the ladies with the wrist bands were the only ones that could go. not the fellas. why didn't y'all tell me!? btw... fuck that guy at the stairs! fucking douche.

With the Asian themed decor and gorgeous looking waitresses, TAO is one of the best night clubs in Vegas.  Only Pure at Caesars would rate better IMHO.  Getting table service here can get quite expensive depending how lavish you like to party.  A table on the main dance floor will go for a few grand easy and your party better be one of an equal ratio of male to female cause they will give you problems if you plan on bringing in a sausage fest.  I also recommend that you handle the table details before getting to the club to save yourself from any headaches.  When partying in Vegas, don't go cheap.  Get a VIP table for your friends.  It's the only way to go cause you don't have to wait in that long ass line and you get to have a place for your crew to chill at and sit.

But because of this imposed ""Man-tax"", you will find many attractive women inside TAO so perhaps you like many others will find that ""Happy Ending"" that this place advertises.  I know I have ;)

During the summer time, they open up the TAO beach area which are VIP tables located outside in a patio which has a view of the Vegas strip.  But I'll leave that for a more detailed review.

The club itself is pretty small and shares space with Tao Restaurant. It's also extremely crowded during the summer on weekends. You won't have much room to move.

One of the most important factors of whether Tao gets a 3-star or a 5-star rating is whether Tao Beach is open. When its not, you're stuck on the 2nd floor of the club and it gets bland.

Everyone makes a pit stop here and we sure enough did that the first night of JC's opening day party.  After my experience at Tao Beach, it was pretty much returning to the scene of crime where I was served cheap booze at the open bar and basically passed out in my room.

Fortunately in the back of mind I was slick enough to set my alarm to 9PM and wake up on time. I woke up still with a pounding headache, but somehow managed to shave, shower, get into a nicely ironed shirt and blazer (dry clean your shit before you leave and toss it in the car!) within the hour. I don't remember who I took the cab with to the Venetian, but I found my way there. 

At the doors of Tao it was complete mayhem as always. But when you got the JC free pass, there is never a line and no worries. I walked up to the clipboard host and told him my deal. He got me in this side line with like 4 or 5 people.. opposed to the other line which had about 100 people and maybe 60 of them are scantly clad hot women in their club dresses. haha Sucks to be them spending all that time getting ready. 

So within minutes I roll into Tao and as usual I have to walk my way up through the restaurant with the weak ambient music. I get up to the club level and saw my favorite girls in the bathtub and washing themselves. Nice! I wonder why the petals never fall off the nips.. how do they do it? 

I got with my boys and open bar was yet again ON and cracking. I looked at the vodka, and sure enough it wasn't the cheap stuff. It was sky..so I decided to tear it up again. Not to mention this time around they were hooking up vodka redbull. So about  an hour goes by f'in around with the boys and I m super hammered. I went to bathroom and I came back and pretty much lost everyone. I managed to find Cody.. one of D's boys and he was like ""hey where did everyone go?"" I just told him.. ""forget them, lets just follow the asses and it always leads you to where you need to be"". He just agreed and tagged along. 

So we saw the bottle service girl, and she had a great ass. We followed her up the stairs to Tao Beach, and sure enough she led us to the JC table with Nassau. Everyone else was there already partying it up. I see MysticalSavage busting moves from Saturday night fever. He worked it in very well with the house music of today.

There is also another club type scene at TAO Beach, which you have to take an elevator to get to from a different place at the Venetian.

My appetizer of spring rolls were huge! For a foux-foux place like this, i thought I'd leave still hungry. I got full over the appetizers. Clearly it was meant to share! When my entree of filet minon arrived - geez! Medium-Rare it was. At this point I realized that I honestly can NEVER go vegan! I really enjoyed it. Dessert: the chocolate eggrolls. Oooh! Dark chocolate with a Calamansi dipping sauce. :) I love how the sweet chocolate meshed with the sourness of the calamansi juice.

I came to TAO on my last night in Vegas with a group of friends. My friend is a promoter there his name is Andy, hooked us up with a really nice table. Huge booth right in the middle. We came here for my birthday celebration. Got bottles of Hennessy Privilege and champagne. There are girls with pasties sitting inside a tub and girls on ropes in the air. We got in fine with no problems with excellent service. The waitress was fantastic. She stood around the table waiting on us to see if we needed anything else. When it was midnight all of a sudden Confetti and smoke and sparklers were everywhere. The waitresses came with a huge bottle of Dom P. and a plate of cake pops and fruits. It was a birthday SURPRISE! I was so shocked! it was fantastic! I also loved the music! It was hip hop mixed into trance! 

there are cubbies that are hidden where the girls can put their coats and clutches if needed. The only thing I didn't like it the bathroom was all the way upstairs and a long line.

By the looks of how hard it was to get in, you almost thought that the president of the United States was inside.  Even though we were there in line at 9:30pm and was on the guest list it was still not a guarantee we'll get in because of their 1 to 1 guy to girl ratio rule.  What kind of crock is that?  What's the point of being on a guest list if they have that rule? 

In any case a friend of mine went scouting for girls to join our party and told them we'll get them in for free and they won't have to wait in that long line since we're in the front.  Worked like a gem.  We still had to wait until 10:30 to get in but I guess that was alright.  

The bars only had about 2 bartenders each and was so crowded. By the time you order and receive your second drink your buzz is probably wearing off and you might need another!

We arrived at TAO for dinner per our reservations at 5pm. They would not seat us until everyone in our party was in the restaurant. Two minutes later everyone was there. However, after assuring us our table was ready, we were not seated for 15 minutes. Irritating!

We were seated under the huge goddess in the middle of the restaurant which was very exciting until five children nine years old and under decided to spend the next 30 minutes playing in the koi pond under the statue, one foot from my chair. Irritating!!

I understand mood lighting but dark in a restaurant is not conducive to reading the damn menu! Irritating!

We were told there was hooks under the table for our purses and shopping bags. Which was all fine and dandy until we got up from the table and couldn't get our purses off the ""hook"". Every female had to take extra seconds to finagle their purse from that hook. Irritating!

Now on to the food! We had nice appetizers. The seafood wontons\/dumplings, ribs, sea bass kabobs and squab lettuce wraps.. all were delicious!!

Our entrees were seriously just plain bad. Their signature miso sea bass was good, but the veggies underneath were not edible as were the peking duck egg rolls and filet mignon. The orange chicken was not good either. The fried rice with peking duck had water chestnuts ... who the hell puts water chestnuts in fried rice... how yeah... Tao Restaurant does. Three fourths of the plate of fried rice was left on the table. The side of sweet pea greens were tough and over cooked.. also left on the table. Oh yes, we were a table of nine.

Lastly, as mentioned we were a table of nine seated at a table for ten. I had to tell three different servers\/bus boys that the seat next to me was empty. Three times! ""There is no one sitting here!"" They never cleared the glass of water. For all of the hoopla in this damn restaurant you would think the staff would know to clear the setting for an empty seat.

this place is the most amazing club i have EVER been to (and i go out a lot, in vegas as well). we chose to spend out new years here in the venetian, and it was the best decision we made all trip long. 

first of all this place is SICK inside. we walked in intending to spit game on girls and just had to sit there speechless for about an hour taking it all in. they have upwards of 6 different bars around the place, all absolutly amazing. they are beautiful, well lit, well designed, and overall unbelievably choice. there are multiple different rooms, each with a unique flavor, but all with ample space. 

we went and they were walking around with the best sushi\/asian appetizers on the face of the planet. they had dancers in the upstairs who were hot, and in general i have never seen that many women who were that hot in one place in my life. in case you havent noticed i f**king love this place.

you can't say this place is expensive, because every place in vegas that is half decent is expensive. pure, studio 54, and light are all very very nice and are all the same price as here. we also had an open bar until 11 which was both good and bad: good since it was top shelf, but bad because we drank ourselves silly.


NOW the good part.

new years: pamela anderson was there. then usher made a surprise appearance. then so did jamie foxx. and ever seen vegas vacation? rusty was there too. in the main room, there were TWO bathtubs (beautiful ones), filled with water and rose petals on top, and 2 amazingly hot girls sitting inside them the whole night. my jaw dropped instantly. the place also had 4 dj's who were all amazing, and i would go back here in a sec (paris hilton hosted here last year).

Came here w\/ one of my best friends for her bday, where we met up w\/ my cousin and his friend.  Luckily we knew one of the bouncers and got in faster than everyone else because that line was ridiculously long.  I think we would've never made it in if it hadn't been for a connection. Tao already looked like a lot of fun based on how many people were waiting to get in.

We got inside before 11pm, so for girls sky vodka drinks\/shots were free (w\/ wristband) til then.  It was really crowded on the dance floor, the bar, the bathroom, etc. but I'd say that's the sign of a popular night club.  The drinks were good and the bartenders were really fast at getting our drinks.  The music was good and the dance floors were pretty big.  

You know in the bathroom they have all those little bottles of perfume, lotions, gum, etc for you to use?  Usually when you use something (1 or 2 items) it is customary to tip the bathroom maids (who are basically staring you down as you use those products.) My only little complaint would be that they hover over you and when you take a tiny drop of lotion they demand a tip from you. It's a little rude to be demanding tip AS I'M PULLING MONEY OUT. Just wait a freakin minute and you'll get your tip, woman. 

Besides that, and that's really only a small complaint on my end, Tao was a lot of fun and I've been back since and will continue to visit when I'm in town!

That night, we were told explicitly to be a the door at 9 to get to our table. When we arrived at 9 we were told to come back at 10.

Finally, he led us downstairs to an additional bar that was tucked away behind the restaurant. There was our table. Not really what we had in mind. Our table waitress was also very friendly and attentive through the night. We got comfortable, poured a drink and decided to make the best of it. 

The area we were in ended up being awful. There was no dance floor, no real designated place for people to mingle, which left an odd crowd kind of just hanging around. After a bit, we decided to go upstairs to check out the scene. Yet, each time we tried to step foot on the dance floor a large bouncer asked for our wristbands. We didn't have any. We were left very confused. We had paid for a table and bottle service, yet we never even danced for one minute the whole night. Once 4am rolled around, we couldn't wait to leave.

I really dont see what all the hype is about. Even the upstairs couldn't compare to many other clubs I have been too. I seriously suggest passing on this one.",3,1,1

Went with a group of friends this weekend for the open bar mostly. Guys got in for 20, which isn't that bad. Bouncers were a little rude for cover, not cool. 

TAO is really nice, appearance wise. Walking though the restaurant before going to the club did make me hungry. what a tease. 

Went early enough where there wasn't any issues of space. Our main goal here was drink, so we didn't get to explore the other dance floors, but that's okay, maybe next time. While most of the drink were aight, they made some pretty bad basic well drinks, and the wait to get a drink was long. Like come on, messing up a rum and coke? and waiting as much as I was dancing wasn't too hot either. But hey, was feeling really good after we left, so I'm not complaining too much, The music wasn't that bad too. Too bad we didn't know that dash berlin was playing that night. Well, bad that we didn't get to hear him play. good because we left before it got ridiculously packed.

They took my ID, and then walked me out of the bar, with no explanation.  After trying her cell, my friends went to fish her out of the bar, and found her absolutely wasted, even though only 10 minutes passed.  She was definitely roofied by someone, and the bouncers deliberately separated us.

Second time there were more bartenders acting rude and even tried to get my friends kicked out for a misunderstanding.

Las Vegas is a standard in itself so anywhere else this club would probably be a 4 star. Came here on a Saturday night and it was PACKED.

Pros:
-Neat girls dancing in a little tub and another duo giving each other a massage on your way in
-Very cool bathrooms- 5 stars for the bathrooms (womens only and apparently the men ones aren't as cool). What's neat is the switch off on it whereby you can see into the bathroom and when you lock it, it ""fogs"" up or whites out. Pretty neat effect!
-Open Bar before 11pm (all right this isn't for everyone and you got to be a woman on their guest list and it only works for tap drinks and not all liquor)
-Free admission for men and women by getting on their special guest list
-Great music 
-Neat decor, truly unique in its own

Why did I knock down two stars?
1. Too crowded. Small bar area and AN EVEN SMALLER DANCE FLOOR. What's the point of going to a night club if you can't even move or dance without trampling on someone else or falling down (I didn't personally commit to either but saw some folks around me trip and fall onto people).
2. Small outdoor area. Granted there is a view of the Strip (small view) with a view of Venetian, the view was limited and not that great. Again, so crowded that I could barely move and some folks -- well I'll just say they are not polite to say the very least.
3. If you are a devout Buddhist, this place might actually offend you.
4. Drinks are $$$. this is normal in Vegas, but wow $14 bucks for a drink and that's not including the tip.
5. No place to sit. There are slight mini ledges or you can lean against the wall by the small dance floor, but frankly there's no place to sit unless you pay for bottle service and VIP seating area\/booths. Otherwise, you are left standing. at least they aren't as strict as pure (ceasar palace) and make girls keep their shoes on at all times without the ability to even drop their heel down for a second because those 4 inch heels that got you in the door are killing your feet.
6. Not really that ""upscale"" compared to some of the other Vegas clubs. Feels like a younger crowd (early barely 21 ish) so a bit on the younger side. 
7. NO COAT CHECK TILL 1130PM. If you are going to bring a coat and the door opens at 9:30pm, you are stuck holding it for the next two hours. Coat check was suppose to be at 11pm. 11pm became 11:30pm. By then, I decided to save myself (what was told to be $5 bucks to check in the coat) and just hold it for the rest of the night.

Yes, the place was ridiculously crowded (I can't tell you how many times we lost our friends or were squished like sardines on the dance floor, pushed up again strangers' sweaty backs).

But eventually, we found our little niche in some corner between a wall and a table's booth, and danced the night away with our giant light sticks. I'm pretty sure we stayed there dancing for a good 3-4 hours continuously. The table we were dancing next to asked us to join them later in the night, so it was even better dancing on the booths, sipping on free bottled waters and alcohol provided by the generous table!

if you plan on dancing at all, i recommend you come right when it opens, boogie your butt off on the dance floor.. then bone out before the bouncers start packing the place so tight you cant even turn around. all clubs in vegas pretty much become way over packed later towards the night, but because of tao's small size, it happens way quicker and it can really ruin your night. ive had some awesome nights here and the crowd is definitely asian if thats what your into, but the overcrowded scene always turns me off.

i definitely recommend tao if you plan on club hopping and this is the first place you hit.. but if you'd rather just stay at one place for the night, i recommend going to XS or Tryst over this place, you'll have a way better experience and fun for a lot longer!",3,3,2

I always think if you're not improving your game, someone else will move in and do it better, this is especially true of clubs in Vegas.

I still think Tao is doing great being as old as it is but I think it's time for a re-invention. The girls behind the glass and in the tubs used to be cool but it's not so much anymore. What also isn't cool is Ludacris being the headliner for the night. I felt like I was in the A.T.L. circa 2001. Not somewhere I wanted to be back then and certainly not now.

Anyway, I got in for free so I can't complain too much but seriously that smoking patio is just sad. Sometimes I like a bit of ""fresh"" air but it's so crowded out there it's just annoying.

We were also approached by a promoter and was able to get on the guest-list - vip style too! No waiting in line, escorted right to the door, no cover, and we had a wristband allowing free drinks from 10-11. 

What we wanted to do was drink for an hour and head over to another club we wanted to check out at (XS). However by 10pm, TAO was packed already, and of course, we were def. taking advantage of the free drinks. Well leaving at 11 didn't happen, and we ended up staying at TAO and had a great time. They played great music, and there are so many different levels to go to. We walked up to Tao Beach and that was really nice too, they played music there, and it was outdoors right by the pool, so we chilled there for a bit to get fresh air.

Saturday  we decided to go to Tao nightclub.  We arrived at the Venetian and were ushered into one of two huge lines, (a  guest list line and a regular line) like cattle, well, decked out scantily clad anorexic cattle.  After slowly moving to the front of the line which wrapped around the building, we were not found to be on the guest list and had to pay the 40$ for guys and 20$ for girls cover!   You can get on the guest list ahead of time by visiting the web site well before arriving.   Then we are ushered into a maze of dark hallways (still packed in herd formation) but now we are inside and you could start to tell there was little ventilation and experience  'second hand breath'.   

We stopped at one of the first dance floors and wanted to try to find a place to sit .  I asked one of the security\/ushers and I got a - HA! Good luck, I guess you can try to sit in the tables until the VIP's who reserved them arrive.   I didn't realize this was a privilege to sit.   I have only come to Vegas on non weekends before so being a Saturday night on Memorial Day weekend was a completely different experience.   

So we decide to get a drink.  The 'line' to get a drink was like a bee hive pack of people several layers deep which you had to just keep pushing your way to the front as each  club goer emerged with their drink.  I decided to get something simple since it seemed there was no muddling going on for my picky taste in martinis.  I got the feeling if I had asked for a lemon drop I would have had a 'soup Nazi' response of NO MARTINI FOR YOU. The bartenders seemed to want to get you out of there as fast as possible.  I ordered a vodka cranberry and my boyfriend his Jack and Coke. I figured my 20$ would cover two single well drinks.  Not!   It was 32$ for a small bucket type glass.  Paid my tab and tried to protect my precious cargo as I made my way out of the bar line\/swarm.  

We walked over to the dance floor and it was just packed and I was getting overwhelmed with the recycled breath and asked where is it less crowded.  Thankfully someone told us to make our way up to Tao Beach.  As we ascended the stairs, which were like office building type stairwells surrounded by red painted walls with an occasional photo or directional sign on them, we could start to sense the fresh air ahead.   After several flights of stairs we finally made it to the rooftop open air Beach.  It was a totally different atmosphere!   Very open and airy, lots colorful lights and VIP cabanas lined the perimeter.  There were very few people up there at that point.  It was around 10:00 or so, so we enjoyed having a huge increase in personal space and to move and breathe freely.  We  found a table \/ wicker couch\/bench type thing with a few pillows that was unoccupied in the middle area of the club.  This was a major score as my  boyfriend,  with great fashion sense and taste,  had just got me a  super cute pair of 5"" gladiator heels - which I decided to wear \/ break in that evening.  I would have made a different decision on wearing NEW shoes if I knew we needed to get a loan to sit down virtually anywhere we went.  

Still nursing the overpriced well drink, we looked at the menu on the table for the fee for bottle service,  thinking with one shot being 16$ we may be better off with bottle service.   The cheapest fifth of Vodka was 600$ for Skyy I think it was.  We decided to just have one or two drinks here, soak up the atmosphere and drink for real back in our room or somewhere else.  We did enjoy people watching from our comfy albeit temporary spot.  There were no cocktail servers that would come by, there seemed to only be there for the VIP cabanas.  Several cocktail servers, guys dressed in all black and more girls in fishnets and burlesque type outfits,  were parked on the perimeter .  The music was good and we actually got to relax and have fun there. 

 After about 45 minutes or so we were asked to move as the group of 6 or 7 young guys arrived who had reserved the table.  By now it had become more crowded and twice I was bumped into by a waiter swishing by carelessly trying to rush through the crowd (to the VIP cabana's).  I was pretty irritated to lose 5$ worth of my drink in each elbow bump!  That is when I decided  -  I am going to Yelp this! - and that it was time to go.  

So based on the amount of people they packed in, lack of fresh air, the overpriced drinks, lack of seating and lack of cocktail servers for regular people, that earns -1 stars.  The Tao Beach atmosphere was the only positive for me.  The fresh air, lots of lights, decent music, and laid back mellow atmosphere earns a couple of stars back.   I still would not want to go back  nor recommend going unless you are a VIP - so, as a regular person,  I ended up with the 1 star rating.",2,1,0

I actually came here for my 21st birthday making Tao the club that popped my clubbing cherry. Back in the day, before I was even 21, Tao was definitely the spot along with Pure. I think Tao and Pure really upped the game for Vegas night clubs. And Tao has been able to keep people coming in, but unfortunately Pure has not since it closed a few weeks ago. If I'm not mistaken Pure is going to go through a rejuvenation process with the Light group, we'll see what happens? And who could forget Tao being Kim Kardashian's spot for her birthdays and what not. Anyway, the last time I was here was last summer and I was expecting it to be less crowded than what I've experienced before considering Light and Hakkasan just opened that summer. BUT NO, the main floor is still super packed. I think this is a default place for a lot of people considering how easy it is to get on a guest list. That was also our reason, our group couldn't get anywhere else without the guys having to pay. None the less, the music on the main floor was pretty good from what I remember, but unfortunately we couldn't hang considering we felt like sardines in there. Most of the night if not all was spent in the hip hop room. We wanted to go upstairs to Tao beach, but we were told that area was close. Oh darn, that would of been nice just to rest our feet just for a few minutes and get some fresh air. Considering that Tao is still a decent club and easy to get into, I would recommend it to tourists who don't want to pay to get into the more popular clubs. Tao is still nice with the Asian\/Buddha inspired decor, a fairly large size club and plays good music, you certainly can't go wrong.",2,1,2

This is vegas, this hotel is full of cameras, go watch him walk in with the jacket, that just so happens to match his outfit perfectly, seriously?

-We ""squeaked in"" without paying cover by having a friend put our names ""on the list."" I was not impressed by the triaging of guests into three lines by burly guys trying to look like the Secret Service. 
-Finding the club itself was like a scavenger hunt. I can't speak for fellow ladies, but four flights of stairs is not easy to navigate in heels. If you've never been, save yourself a headache and just have someone escort you, or better yet, carry you.
-The club was much smaller than the website would lead you to believe. High ceilings do not a hype club make.
-The prices! Oh, horror! The prices! I KNOW it's Vegas, but $10 for a Bud Light? If you're ready for a laugh, check out the preposterously overpriced bottle menu. We were lucky enough to step in on ""open bar for ladies"", which is limited to ""mixed well drinks"" (I know I'm using a lot of quotations, but stick with me here). I ended up paying full price for my drinks, because the inattentive, often dismissive bartenders seemed to have mixed up the well liquor with gasoline.
-Oh, and those nice couches? Don't get comfortable. My party was moved several times to make room for people who wanted to pay $900 for a bottle of Grey Goose.
-The cherry on the top of this hot mess was the incompetent DJ. Bless her heart, she really tried, but any DJ who's worth their salt knows that a party is created with beat-mixing popular or power songs. This poor little girl did little more than drop in one song after another, often on top of off beats. My professional DJ husband was near tears by the time we left.

yea that's Tao alright once you get in there on the weekends.  saturday is especially hard although i was lucky enough to have a connection (neener neener neener..!)

having been in a few Vegas club venues, i thought Tao's asian-isque decor was pretty cool.  there are the near-naked gals (i'm not complaining here) who basically tease you with whatever they are doing (doesn't matter what they do, it's a tease), whether they be in a tub or at a dimmed corner fondling eachother.  drool.  sucks being a guy i tell ya.  the music wasn't too bad but i guess it's hit or miss depending on who and what your tastes are.

now i wouldn't mind giving this place a 5 star, but there's one thing that bothers me quite a bit, aside from pricy alcohol (guess it's the norm in Vegas), is the fact that it's extremely crowded during the weekends..., to the point you can barely move.  if you have some telepathic powers knowing when nature will call, girls especially, better move it.  GO! GO!

I chose to do the Kobe Beef Steak...a $90 plate.  Very let down.  Yes it's American Kobe and I knew it was not going to be at the level of some Kobe I have had outside the US, but this was just bad.  I have had marinated skirt steaks that cost $15 that were better.  No one in my party was overly thrilled about any of their food, just not worth the money.

Part two...the nightclub.  After dinner we were given free passes in to the Club and I have never seen a place so packed.  I guess that's a good thing if you are looking to literally rub all over people and push your way through crowds to just get a drink.  Get Bottle Service it might be worth the $800 for the night just so you get your own space.",0,0,0

SO SO crowded that I didn't have that great of a time. I'm sure I would've loved it on a less crazy night, if that existed at the Tao...

We got approached by 2 promoters who said they'd put us on the guest list, but when we got there....well, I guess we got tricked or something. But the big man with the clipboard was nice enough to let us in anyway (thank you thank you!!). Lucky for us, because even though we got there early, between 9 and 10pm, even the line with the pretty ladies had to wait for a while. The regular line....I wasn't even sure where it ended! 

Got in for free and got our wristbands for free drinks, but the bar was so crowded we literally had to push our way to the bar.

Tao is a beautiful venue. I love their decor with the bathtubs and rose petals. The music was pretty good; they had their resident DJ, which the guys at front said they have every Friday. The place is pretty big, with more than one room, more than one dance floor. But it was so hard to get around!! Both dance floors were packed, no room to dance whatsoever! Seriously, if I didn't have such high heels on, I prolly would've gotten stomped on all throughout the night!! But then again, my feet killed in those shoes, so I guess I paid the price anyway. And there's no place to sit :(",1,0,0

I'm really not a fan of the crowd nor the over-crowded dance floor, but the perks of being a pretty girl here are everything you could ever want. Tao USED TO BE place to be a few years back before XS + Surrender opened up, but judging from the crowds it looks like it has no problems still raking in the dough. Now that it's a chilly 40-50 degrees outside in Vegas... I've been here twice over the fall\/winter season just for the perks + the sake of being indoors, haha. Read on... 


* Location - At the very front left side of the Venetian if you're coming from the Strip. 

* Parking - Valet at the Venetian is free (+tip) or self-parking at the garage in the back.  The walk from the garage, is ~5 mins through the Grand Canal shops... even while stumbling drunk afterwards. 

* Venue - It's a restaurant as well as a nightclub so there are portions blocked off all evening for those dining. 4 stories, but only 3 of them (ground floor lounge, main floor + upper floor) are open for the club, which means there are stairs to climb. The main floor has the dance floor to the right + a smaller room (the Opium Room) + more bars to the left. When available, the Tao Beach  pool area is a more chill spot to actually be able to breathe. High ceilings + Asian-themed decor (rock gardens, statues, candles) make it a classy establishment, but it's the nearly-nude models in the rose petal bathtubs http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ECOkEVUodMLUxvI0PMI4gQ?select=fe4REZb402x0LYYSL1zePQ + lounging on beds that really grab one's attention. 

* Cleanliness - With dim lighting + dark decor, who knows how clean the place really is... but I have noticed quite a few attendants sweeping up spills quickly. The bathroom was kept quite clean as well.  

* Crowd - I haven't been to Tao as a nightclub during peak season... but compared to the attractive clientele of Tao Beach during the Summer, I'm not a fan of the people I mingled with here recently. It's a mixed crowd in every way, + even though I have a creeper radar on high alert, I still can't get over the times some pervert would try to cop a feel when squeezing by. Gross! And the fact that it was just TOO CROWDED for comfort doesn't help. I'm one of those girls who likes going up to dance on raised platforms or stages if possible just to have the space to do my own thing without having to worry about unwanted attention from guys... http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ECOkEVUodMLUxvI0PMI4gQ?select=pD2bvCivQ5Bwixh-P6sErA But if you're just here to get plastered out of your mind + ogle the voyeur models, then the crowd doesn't matter too much anyways.  

* Music - Other than being too loud, I didn't notice really what was playing. I have yet to experience a bad DJ in Vegas so whatever mix of hip-hop, top 40's, dance beats, etc they had playing is good enough to get my hips swinging. 

* Bar - There's at least 4-5 of them so everywhere you look, there's a bar... along with a thick throng of people crowding around it for a drink. 

* Drinks - I don't have first-hand knowledge on the prices since I haven't had to pay for a drink here, but they're your typical Vegas prices that start a little under $10 for beer\/shot + then over $10 for mixed drinks. For the ladies VIP open bar hour, only simple well-drinks are available, but the bartenders make them strong all night long.

* Bathroom - Upstairs in the main room above the dance floor is the women's bathroom that everyone talks about where the glass is transparent while vacant then fogs up to become opaque when occupied, but the line for this is ridiculous since each stall includes its own sink so girls take more time doing their thing. Do yourself a favor + use the normal, less-crowded bathroom to the left of the bar in the Opium Room. The doors say Ying + Yang on them... women's is on the right. 

* Price - Guestlist doesn't mean much in Vegas because you'll still be in line forever + cover price can still be be something like $30 min for guys. GIRLS, get in contact with a Tao promoter + the only money ever leaving your hands all night is tipping the bartenders. They hook you up with the VIP wristbands http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ECOkEVUodMLUxvI0PMI4gQ?select=kJ9qbdfhN7nyoY4WO1MeKg  that not get you escorted you to the front of the line but also open bar from 10 -11pm Th + Fri, or 9:30-10:30pm Saturday. Talking to the right people can also get you free drink vouchers to use all night...

I came here with a bachlorette group of 5 women and we were lucky to be on the guestlist due to one of the girls in our group. The club looked interesting as there were plenty of nipple-stickered-thong-wearing women in what looked like to be a glass box and plenty of bath tubs. I got curious how much these women got paid to sit in a bathtub getting oogled by creepy ass guys.

Even with bottle service people will WALK ON YOUR TABLE to the back of your little cozy sofa chair thing and dance right behind you (which I did to some group and I'm feeling totally sorry for that. It wasn't my idea really). Then as I  got up I took a quick glance around the club and this is what I saw. A completely packed dance floor where every square inch of it was covered with a body. I looked up and saw a whole flock of lined men peering over the balcony looking for top-boobs. Then I look towards the door where I came in (after going up a flight of stairs) where I saw people shoving. SHOVING others regardless of gender to get in. Wtf? seriously. This was my FIRST time clubbing and I absolutely hate it. 

What the F is this really suppose to be about? Worst part is this is one of the 3 clubs I went to on the same day. Ugh...

Horrible. I wouldn't recommend going here unless you're 1) Ballin' out of control 2) Looking for a one night stand 3) Here to show off your not so good skills at human interaction.

Waiting in line...

Fellas - go find a group of ladies and offer to buy them drinks inside (you will need them for getting you in)

Tao is so strict that if you roll with all dudes, you will get kick out. 

Don't even try to trick the security by spliting up. 2 guys or even single, you will still get kick out for being an idiot and a loser.

Last Friday, me and about 5 guy friends did just that and it did not work.

Anyways fast forward, we were able to find a group of girls and got in free.

The bad thing about this place is that it's gets way too pack, I think couple of times we were stuck in the middle of the crowds for 20 mins

It's a pretty cool club with different areas and music in parts of the club. Since we got there early it wasn't crowded and my wife and I were able to chat with the bartender. 

TIP: Since drinks can be on the pricey side, tip your bartender well and early to get good strong quality drinks...we stumbled out of the place...but that's another story.

The music in the large table room was awesome but beware, when the tables get reserved, you will be asked to leave and there's little room to sit elsewhere in the club. That was okay because my wife wanted to shake her fine booty on the dance floor. If I came here with a group, I would opt for a table which i hear can be pricey.

Speaking of which, the dance floor gets crowded fast so either practice your vertical dance moves or avoid it altogether. My wife had a minor altercation with a female patron trying to get her ""freak"" on. I guess she got too close to her dance ""expressions"". Behind is the outdoor balcony which overlooks a portion of the strip and gondola ride...which was nice to breath in some fresh air with cigarette smoke rather than straight smoke.

As we were walking from Encore to Tao, it was like the whole world was walking the opposite way. I'm assuming to XS. It was like I got the wind knocked out of me as I rode up the escalator and saw the hordes of people waiting to get in.

They pack this club to the point where it is literally a struggle just to walk from the bathroom to the bar. We went to the main dance floor upstairs but it was so packed we couldn't even move. We went to check out the other rooms but it reeked of BO. The odor was making me nauseous, I had to get out of there. There was even a long as$ line to get upstairs to Tao Beach!

I think the best place to stay at is downstairs where you first enter into the club. It doesn't get popping until around 1AM, so just stick around at the bar. Every time I've stayed down there, it's never been insanely packed. Also, there is never a wait to use the bathroom where the restaurant is at. Easy access!

I'm not sure why I keep getting suckered in coming back here. It's not all that great anymore. I didn't even get to see my friends because they got kicked out for allegedly starting a fight.

He asked my friend and I for our ID's and I let him know that we already got IDed by the other bouncer and we have a ""TAO IDed"" stamp as well. He asked again, I thought he didn't hear me over the music so I repeated myself. He asked again in a stern voice so we gave him our ID's. He let my friend in and then called her back AFTER he stamped her and asked to see her ID again. He let her go and called her back AGAIN asking to recheck her ID. He checked her ID a total of 3 times and then pulled her outside and threw her out. He then came back and said to me she's not coming in and asked if I wanted to go in. WTF

I went upstairs to get my friends that were already in and told them what happened. We tried to explain to the bouncer that my friend spoke limited english and maybe there's just some sort of misunderstanding between them. No explanation. No excuses. No reason.

The decor and interior was luscious, not quite a surprise, let's say, it was as expected. We dined and then went to the club, so this review will be for both.

The service at the restaurant was bar none, thanks to our enthusiastic waiter. They kept our reservation, and opening late for dinner until 1am is a huge plus. The food was surprisingly good, being asian, eating asian food in Vegas. I liked that it was not greasy, which is more important to me than authenticity. Their service was prompt, and they had a good selection of less expensive wines. 

The club -- 
Pros: great people, good eye candy, way crowded which can be a plus or minus, good energy.
Cons: the space: it wasnt very big, one main room, so you'll have to tolerate the music if you aint feeling it. the music: it was the weekend, so top 40 and hip hop with the occasional sprinkling of rock. 

I would say the crowd, dancers and energy is what makes Tao, Tao. Definitely no turn off guys groping around that night, which kept it classy, and girls all decked out ready to party, priceless.",1,1,1

I promptly reported it to the security guy in front door, and he was like oh you lost it!! I was like no stupid, it is stolen and not lost!! Anyway, he didn't care and even he didn't report it to others! He said comeback tomorrow!! I went inside and asked for their manager, and they sent me another security guard, she asked me to fill out a police report and also asked my ID. I asked them to check their security cameras, but she was like they are on operation, so we can't do it now, come back tomorrow!! however, my flight was on Friday's noon, so it means I can't come back to check it. Since then, I'm calling them EVERYDAY! If I call after 4pm, they tell me I should call before 4pm, and vice versa... It means I couldn't talk to anyone yet to follow-up whether someone is investigating my case or not, which I assume NOT!! They are a BIG LIAR, and even I think they have their gang to steal your belongings inside the club because someone else's phone was stolen that night, too!! 
Watch out guys!! Vegas is full of nightclubs better than this one which is full of thefts... Try somewhere else to be safe and also have fun! If you want to have an enjoyable time instead not just watching your belongings, I recommend GO Somewhere else with more hot girls and safety!!

Pros:

Cons:

Tao is always considerably more crowded than any other club in Vegas. It's impossible to move around inside of the club, so moving to and from the bar is a pain. The line to get in can be ridiculous if you don't plan ahead and get on the VIP list.

I've been there about 3 times so I can affirm that the vibe and crowd is pretty consistent.    Good music and lots of room to frolic around. 

What's funny is when I went to club Tao on 09-13-08, Jamie Foxx was hosting the party.    He was pretty annoying though as he kept interrupting the DJ's mixes and adding his own rhymes.     And his 'hype man' (ass kisser) kept interrupting as well:  'Jaime Mothafuckin Foxx is in tha house!'  - expecting all of Us to holler in jubilation.

The bouncers also took care of their business at the entrances. There were these girls dancing up on the elevated stage thing, and the VIPs told the bouncers that they wanted to dance on there so the bouncers told the girls that were dancing to get off so the VIPs could dance on the stage haha.

Ass asian decor,color,statues. Very nice. Restaurant is great, good food. Waiters are kinda lazy. But I enjoyed it. Yes, the club does get super crowded. But honestly what else do you expect. It's Vegas! I'm not sure about you people,but I'm from LA. To be honest a crowded club is far better than an empty club. Yes, the gorillas in suits aka bouncer,security,doorman,waitress, can be assholes. But, you gotta put yourselves in their shoes. These are working people who day in and day out. Deal with drunks,fights,theft,spilled drinks on them,and so much more. Sometimes they just have those bad days. Were only human. Shit happens. Yes, drinks are between 10 and 20 dollars. Once again were in Vegas. It's not your home town. With happy hour or whatnot. Expect to fork up some cash. If not drink up before you get it. It's not that big of a deal.

I've read about dress code complaints. Really? Come on. Look I love dressing as comfortable as possible. Sneakers, jeans, a casual jacket. A t shirt or long sleeve. But honestly I don't mind throwing on a blazer or some slacks to go to a club. It's only a for a night. Plus you don't have to worry whether the bouncer at the door will second guess what your wearing. Ok as far as music goes. Yeah they can work on better dj,s. Or rotate music from hour to hour. It does kinda suck. 

One thing I'll admit that is extreme, is prices for bottle service. Although I know it's vegas and I'm sure the prices stay around the same range at other various Vegas nightclubs. I'm not sure this is worth it. I'm not saying you have to be a millionaire,or a CEO of a corporation to get it. But the thought of spending a grand and up is disturbing. Yeah it's not for everyone. And I'm sure people even save for stuff like this. Bottom line you get what you pay for.",4,3,5

There's also an area outside, where Tao Beach is, and it was beautiful (though smaller than XS).  I love Tao because of the really unique feel there.

The models\/dancers are an interesting addition, they're very scantily dressed -only having little flowers covering their private parts. 

With a promoter, you'll never have to wait in a long line, especially if your group consists of a majority of girls. You can go up to tao beach if you want to escape from the crowd and relax.

We went to the club the night before Halloween.  The crowd was awesome and the costumes looked like most skipped the costume store and went to Frederick's of Hollywood.  Sweet!!

But we got there early and there was already a long line.  Even though we were on a guest list many others were on one too and the line was still long.  The ladies were supposed to be free we were informed they had to pay $20.  The guys were supposed to be $20 and had to pay $40 anyway.  

The bouncers were rude while we were in line. And told us we had to coat check or throw away parts of our costumes that weren't allowed in, another $10.  I left the line to check the items, then stepped over the line rope to rejoin my group.  Another bouncer unhooked the rope and  told me in a stern voice, "" I need to talk to you."" He then took an aggressive stance and asked sternly, "" What's the situation here?"". I told him I had to leave the line to coat check items and was just rejoining my group. He just said ok rudely and let me go back to my group ( no need to apologize for a misunderstanding) in fact a tap on the shoulder and asking me why I jumped the rope would have worked.  Screw that guy.

Once inside $23 for a beer and a cocktail.  The place was so crowded you could barely move through the club, let alone dance. We were inside 2 hours max before we couldn't rake it anymore and left.

We had bought our tickets online so the wait was short. The bouncers had blank expression were very short with you and didn't put up with anyone's shit (to be expected from any bouncer in any club). What I read from some of these reviews is people feeling entitlement, bouncers aren't there to be your friend or to be nice, that ain't there job. I felt as if they were treating everyone fairly, and you have to understand these guys are dealing with rich snobby people all night long so obviously they aren't going to put up with the slightest attitude, if you don't respect them then leave. 

When we got in it was beautiful, open bar, buffet set up (I have never seen some shit like this in my life), I'm 22 so this was an epic night out in Vegas and one of my first exciting club experiences. 

The staff is extremely friendly, the bartenders are busy but still nice (you just got to be patient, they're making hundreds of drinks a night). 

The club was very diverse and filled with slightly more women and had people of all colors and shapes, never did I see anyone discriminated against or picked on by a manager or bouncer. 

I think people now a days are a little to sensitive and take things too personal. TAO does an amazing job at running its club for the amount of traffic that goes through it and snobby pricks it needs to deal with.",1,0,1

Came here because my companion's company was having some sort of party to end a convention thing. Waiters were walking around with trays of food and I was starving so I spent the bulk of the beginning of the night stalking waiters, trying to get food. The food was decent but nothing special. I had a few mini burgers, skewered fish, and some other unmemorable stuff. I couldn't partake in the chicken sate because I'm allergic to peanuts (but that's my own fault). There was an open bar for the party so I took advantage, pounding some diet cuba libres (rum and coke) and tao-tinis (dunno what goes into this drink but it is powerful and delicious). We took a little trip out onto the balcony but it was way too hot, so we snapped a couple pictures and then it was right back into the much-needed air conditioned area.

There was plenty of seating, little private booths with tables as well as a bunch of U-shaped and L-shaped sofas in the bar area. The music was decent. The DJ played a lot of mainstream stuff (and stuff that I find is too overplayed). A few of us were trying to convince him to play some house or electronic music but he was a coward who was afraid that his crowd would lose interest in the music and deem him a bad DJ. He did drop a few of my favorites later in the night, so I'll give him credit for that.

Anyway, once the club was opened to the general public, it got nuts. It was so freaking crowded, I hated it. I got spilled on multiple times, not even by sloppy people, but the sheer volume of people rendered it impossible to hold a glass without spraying the contents all over innocent bystanders. The party people had booked a private spot on the balcony, which was nice, but that got messy too because drunk people do NOT know how to NOT spill (double negative meaning, drunk people spill all over the place). I mean, granted, it's a club, not a museum, and of course, it's Vegas, but c'mon people. Let's have at least an ounce of class and grace.

Worst part of the crowdedness was the bathroom situation. Boys are lucky because boys pee quickly and there's good turnover in the male restroom. Sucks to be a girl because instead of one large female restroom, there were 5 or 6 individual bathrooms with a toilet and sink. It was cool at first because the doors have that special fog stuff where you can see through the door when it's open, but as soon as you close it, it fogs up and gives you privacy. However, once the line started to get long, it was horrible. And of course, all chicks take a thousand years in the bathroom because they have to pee, wipe, wash hands, check makeup, check hair, make sure their outfit is still in tact, etc. I wish they had an express line or something; like a bathroom without a mirror for people who just wanna get in, do their business, and get out.

I can't comment on the pricing because I didn't pay for anything all night but I can't imagine that this place is cheap. Boys, prepare your wallets, and girls, pump up the charm to score some free drinks.

All in all, it was a v. two-sided experience. Fun at first, disastrous at the end.",0,0,0

The Venue - Freakin awesome. When all is said and done, you have three levels. On the first level you have the lounge with a ton of couches and a big bar. Not many people dancing though - you also do not need to pay cover to get in here. The next level is the main club level with two separate rooms. One plays hip hop and the smaller plays ""Dance"". There are bars on every side. Last but not least, Tao Beach is upstairs. Seating, heat lamps, big bar, POOL - its all there. There is also so great decor - YES I DO MEAN BATH TUBS. 

So that was the good, onto the bad: 

The line. WOW. I get that this is a hot spot in Vegas but the line gets nuts. I have seen it wrap and twist around around the whole outside area. There is an easy fix to this - go have dinner in the amazing restaurant and get a ""line pass"" stamp at the end of your meal. It will fill you up, save you some time and cut the cost of cover! 

The bars - can you say freakin expensive for not the greatest value. Yessir, my Henn was $16. I'm not even a Henn guy and it was still $16. LOL If your a dude, you also have to find a female bartender cause the guys will barely come talk to you if there is any type of crowd around. I almost had to flash a little areola to get a drink. 

The space - yes this may be the biggest club I have ever been to but it is too effing packed. Like so packed you can't have fun. It amazes me that there aren't a ton of fights in here. I had no room to dance and less room to even walk. Tao Beach is cool upstairs but its COLD in November.

Impressively, it even managed to steal Pure's thunder.   And while it is a favorite among Asians, despite the hype and the initial wow\/glamour factor,  you'll soon realize that Tao may be bit overhyped.  I certainly have had my bad experiences here (see below) and have yet to really truly enjoy clubbing here.

Honestly, the club is very nice inside, visually, with a strong ""urban"" zen feel.  The hot babes in the bathtubs at the entrance and inside are certainly a crowd pleaser and welcome distinction.   But it's dark as fuq inside to the point you can't really see anyone, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your situation.  If you're trying to meet up with friends already inside or you're lost, good luck finding them.  

The dance floors are nicely sized, but like any Vegas club, it's packed to the brim and you can't really move around on the dance floor.  Plus the annoying stupid idiots who try to shove their way through the dance floor really ruin the fun regardless of how many expensive drinks I had... I guess this is just how it is in Vegas :\/  On the other hand, the Tao Beach club at the top is really cool and gives you a gorgeous view of the Strip and The Venetian.  It feels like Cabana Club in LA.

But really, beyond the glitz and glamor this place tries to hype with its sensual and exotic Asian theme, I've had more fun going to Pure.  But if you've never been, it's worth a check out...if you want to wait 2-3 hours, or grab bottled service\/table.


**Bad Experience 1:
The first time I went, I was denied entry by the bouncer due to my shoes and was forced to go back across the street to change, despite inquiring the club in advance about the dress code.   ""Jeans and white casual shoes are fine - as long as they're clean"", my ass.   Yes I know I'm in Vegas, and yes I should know better to dress my best, but personally I hate wearing nice expensive dress to clubs since  A.) They're probably gonna get scuffed inside; B.) They're uncomfortable to move around in  C.) Who the hell would want to dance in dress shoes?  You certainly don't see people playing sports (Yes, dancing is considered a sport) in loafers.  

Really, you should be allowed to wear shoes you are COMFORTABLE dancing in.  It wasn't like I was wearing basketball shoes - I was wearing my casual wheat\/gray Sketchers.  ""But the lady at the club told me they're fine earlier..."", I complained.  ""I don't care,"" says the Bouncer.  Anyway, after 30 minutes, I made it into Tao ONLY to discover a bunch of white guys inside wearing plain T-shirts and white basketball shoes...WTF?!  DISCRIMINATION!  Oh and then I had to spend a good 40 minutes searching in the dark for my friends.  Fun times

**2nd Bad Experience:
On my most recent trip this past summer, the DJ was absolutely horrible!  Possibly one of the worst DJs I've ever heard, which really killed the clubbing mood.  My GF was also pissed off over the bad DJ and also with the amount of pushing and shoving that went on inside.  After 2 hours in the club, our group just left.  Yes, it was THAT bad.  At least this time, we got in fast as we stayed at the Venetian and got the VIP treatment.",1,0,1

First of all, I need to give Tao props for hiring sexy bouncers (and I'm not usually someone who is attracted to a meaty and muscly person). They were eye candy for me all night. I believe for the first time in my life I entered a club with more attractive men than attractive women, and I'm not just talking about the employees. 

It was definitely hectic on the main floor, but the Tao Beach portion was perfect. There was a heavenly warm breeze and gorgeous men everywhere. And of course they need women to keep them company. 

Well besides my opinion on the attractiveness of the bouncers and clientele, all I have to say is that the woman's bathrooms were cool.

Why do I say this? Well as a dude I am privileged to consistently experience horrendous treatments at clubs everywhere, Vegas clubs especially. The women really got us by the balls don't they fellas? We have to pay $30 to stand in a sweaty, crowded space and get pushed around by assholes with earpieces. Sounds like a fun night to me.

But I will give this place some props because I could have gotten my ass kicked ten times over the night I went recently, but the bouncers were chill enough to spare me that experience. What did I do to warrant such a potential beating?
- I'm pretty sure I stole some drinks from a girl who then complained to the bouncer. I think it was on accident ...
- When I was asked to clear some space for a walkway on the balcony I refused to move and actually held a clenched fist up to the guy (I didn't realize he was a bouncer)
- My lady and I somehow wandered into the ""Employees Only"" area and were walking around there for about 5 minutes.

I'll separate my reviews between Tao Asian Bistro & Nightclub and TAO Beach (even though they're technically one in the same). This is strictly for the ambiance, DJ'ing and Dance floor.

It was red, dark, yellow, and hints of purple. Getting groped and grazing every single body part possible is the name of the game. Going through TAO was like navigating through a sea of zombies, except they're wearing sexy (or slutty attire) depending on your alcohol vision. Douchebags weren't that big of a problem when I went and the bouncers were actually pretty chill. 

The DJ played non-stop mash ups of Top 40 and drum bass song every 10 minutes in his set. As far as having space for you and your friends to dance. Girls have to actively utilize the Spartan cock-block formation (ie: guys serving as the shields of to barricade shape of said dance area for the women in the center to lick, grind, and pop their pancake booties like no other, for your own pleasure in viewing).

I probably experienced five minutes of blue balls with the rest being nothing but fist pumping (or karate chopping if you're Asian) win. So you're probably thinking, why the imperfect rating?

1) Couldn't see as much worthy eye-candy (again due to lack of popularity with its competitors)

2) Limited dance area= A whole less grinding and a lot of unnecessary body bumping (I think the ratio of receiving and giving unintentional sexual harassment was 5:3 with me on the losing end).

3) Spent $50.00 to get myself and the birthday girl to get into this spot (never spent so much on clubbing cover in my life).

1. Wrapping the line all the way around the plaza is a sleazy tactic to make the club appear in-demand.

3. This place is dark as night. I understand that you're trying to create a certain vibe, but a little bit of light won't hurt.
4. Too many narrow walkways.

Dressed up and ready for action, we took a short cab ride from The Wynn to The Venetian Hotel. There was a crowd already there, but our group was able to skip the line and in we went at no charge.

It's pretty dark inside, and we first noticed a bunch of Buddas when we first arrived. Next we saw 2 glass window boxes with lingerie clad models writhing around inside.

On the floor, there were bathtubs filled with rose petals and more models wearing nude body stockings ""bathing"" in the tubs. The club was already packed and DJ seven spun the typical club music ( yawn )

We were taken up above the masses into private sky boxes. Our group had 3 of them reserved for us. We were treated to European Bottle Service. This consisted of large bottles of Grey Goose and our own personal waitress who sat with us, mixing our drinks at the table. There were decanters filled with various juices, as well as 7-up,red bull, bottled water and a large bowl of ice.

Throughout the night, I counted at least 9 bottles between the 3 tables. I can only drink that sort of stuff for a limited time before I get some major heartburn.
I wanted some Kahlua & Milk to go with my Grey Goose, but I didn't bother to ask.

Our waitress had a bitchy look all night. The best was when one of the guys drunkenly tried to get her to dance hehe. She politely declined, too bad maybe dancing would of removed the stick from her ass.

The bathrooms were super cool. They were individual stalls with sinks and mirror right in with the toilet. The doors are clear, but when locked they frost over.

The music was very loud. The dance floor packed. We did not even try to go down amongst the masses. People danced by our table. Above the Dance floor a girl swung from a trapeze, and metallic confetti came down 

Another cool feature was the back of the booths had a flip top chest where you can stash your purse. Genius !

I hung out here til 4 am, at that point the novelty had wore off, the smoke was bothering me, the DJ was starting to recycle ""Sexy and I know it"" and I was over dull conversation and watching people drunkenly attempt to dance, grope and hook up.

Tao was fun because of the VIP treatment on someone Else's dime. I can only imagine what the bill was like when it came.....but near the end of the night I was bored and ready to leave. My gf was still having fun so I left her with some co workers and conventioneers and off I went.

I took a spin around the lounge on my way out, then had a very nice stroll home taking photos and stopping to buy Bailey's Irish cream at 415 am

The music in Tao is worse than most of the clubs in Vegas. Obviously you should expect to hear Top 40, Techno, 80s Hits and a little bit of Hip Hop but damn...

Our food consisted of Kobe beef sliders, egg rolls, sushi and all the drinks your little body could handle. All of it was awesome! The Kobe beef sliders were the item that stood out the most. They were juicy, meaty and packed with flavor. The bartenders serving up the drinks were super courteous and delivered them quick, fast and strong. 

The only issue we had for the night was the security which is why I'm giving this place a 4 star. As with many night clubs, security has always been a pain with me and this night was no different. When simply asking these guys where the bathroom is and your get a response filled with attitude, I don't see why that's necessary.

Sure, you'll hear some good music, see some gorgeous ladies in their best clubbing dresses, and, along with everyone else in the club, watch the ladies dance in the line upstairs next to the glass wall that overlooks the main dance floor, (are they dancing because they're showing off their milkshake for the crowd?  Or do they just have to pee?)  but you'll see some people at their worst.  Rude douches, girls pushing past you and stepping on your GF's toe, aggressive security, (although sometimes, they kept the crowd moving, but was I really causing a scene by unbuttoning my shirt with a tank top underneath?) and the music wasn't that inspiring.  I heard a better dance mix at Hash House A Go Go the next morning . . . 

You might be able to find some interesting people to have a conversation with (Hi Nadine and Natasha, I apologize to all Germans and Spanish\/Germans on behalf of all Americans for the scene) but the combination of belligerent drunk chicks, drunk dudes, bad house music, and overly aggressive security would lead me to recommend you look elsewhere.  Or maybe don't go on a Friday (when we went) or a Saturday.  And I'd only go if you get in free from dinner at Tao, which we did.  It was definitely too packed.

I LOVE LOVE the music and the club itself, but damn they really need to improve on their bouncers and the amount of people they let in. The bouncers are all assholes, and even though I can see from their point of view how they feel since people are trying to get into TAO without following the rules (1:1 girl\/guy ratio, black shoes, etc), I still feel like they need to lighten up. Whenever I am in line for TAO, I feel under pressure and like I am trying to pass boot camp to get in.

Also, it is WAY too crowded inside. There is literally no open space whatsoever. You literally have to squeeze through people just to walk around the club, and dancing is very difficult to do.

I don't know why they just don't control the amount of people they let in. Cause come on, the club is actually really really big inside. But even as I walked out at 2AM with the club being already overcrowded, there was still a huge line outside and they were still letting people in.

arrived with the gang around 1030? free bottles because we were staying at planet hollywood + no open container laws in sin city = getting shmammered on the way to the venetian.

NEVER have i seen crazier lines outside a nightclub...
going down the corridor that runs all the way down the entire length of the venetian?

TIP:
 **GET THERE EARLY, STAY AT THE VENETIAN, OR BE READY TO TIP THE BOUNCERS FAT TO GET IN*** 
fellas, meet up with a random group of girls, get atleast 1:1 and get the money out for the bouncers and you're good to go.
met up with some randoms who were staying at the venetian, went with them through the hotel guest line and probably saved ourselves 2hours+++ waiting in line. used the voucher we copped off of the sketch-city promoters so it was 20 a head for the fellas. (of course free for the ladies)  i hate paying cover but 20 bucks was the same price as our jay-z tickets the wednesday before and he killed it.

SCENE:
inside was nuts, crazy crowded.. probably just because jay-z was hosting but who knows.. TAO is the infamous 'girls in bathtubs getting massages club', go-go dancers everywhere on stages, with poles, etc. ONLY girls are allowed in the elevated VIP table\/stage located around the middle..  they played mostly HOUSE music, some TOP 40's, and a grip of JAY-Z cause he was hosting..

(((so it sucks when some random hottie wants to work it and brings you up there but only she gets in because we have different reproductive organs! SMH..)))

""just recieved word that jay-z has entered the building"" was blasted by whoever was on the mic, followed by some throwback HOVA song. throughout the night. he finally arrived with young jeezy, and a gang of NBA players.. although he arrived late, i coincidentally was right next to his table and shook hands with HOVA.. i aint complaining!

DRINKS:
expensive. its vegas though, what do you expect? beers 10+, shots 12-14, amfs 16ish? shots are usually generous if you treat your bartender right.. mixed drinks aren't too worth it, IMO but at that point I was already dunzo! didn't get bottle service here because it was a last minute decision to even roll through but i suspect its worth it as long as you don't get one of the ghetto tables.

VENUE:
the TAO setup isn't too smart, IMO. downstairs the bathrooms are ridiculously crowded, theres plenty of mini stages for their go-go dancers equipped with sharp edges that every intoxicated person stumbles upon. so the following day all the ladies wonder where those bruises came from? the middle stage area isn't too big, it gets crowded, and people liter the hallways. there are several bars located throughout TAO which makes it easier to get a drink whenever, wherever.  TAO staff is constantly pushing through the crowd to get bottles\/mixers to a certain table and I know its frustrating, but pretending your a running-back and mobbing through the crowd won't solve anything.


TAO BEACH is upstairs, but you have to climb a staircase from section to section which is a buzz kill and is a drag when you're trying to get the mack on. upstairs is the pool area\/lounge which is perfect after getting your swerve on downstairs. climate controlled heaters, plush sofas, another bar, a DJ, and security all packed into one. perfect place to gather yourself, return missed calls, texts, and bbms, or check the facebook hahaha.  I assume they have the same policy as XS, fall in and get wet = kicked out asap.

CROWD:
its las vegas people.. the girls are GRADE A certified silicon-injected, botox laced, scantily-clad females. and fine! BEAUTIFUL waitresses, a decent mixed crowd of all peoples although mostly asians which is a plus for me.



TAO is by far one of the best clubs in the world. although it seems as if each newer club is established to out-do the previous champion\/title holder, give TAO a visit, because it DEFINITELY still has some fight left in it!",1,1,1

Whenever I go to Vegas, everyone wants to go to this nightclub. So I really end up going to please others. I mean it's a nice club but it's so crowed. It is not worth the visit especially if you don't have a table. 

Whenever I go here and I have a table I have so much fun. There's more leg, arm and dancing room. However, whenever I go here on a whim without a table I never have that much fun. The crowd is random. Some nights you can be crowed with creepy men and some nights you can be crowed with cuties. It's all so very random. 

I have been here on nights during EDC weekends and weekdays and let me just say this... stay away. I literally felt like crying because of the massive amounts of people crowding around me. And on top of that, the table prices during EDC are totally unreasonable.

We took a stroll around- food looked good, decor was really nice, adequate number of bars. Unfortuantely every one and his aunt Susy was there that night and how the pushed and they shoved with little utterance of an excuse me. 
That really put a damper on our moods. Then went up to Tao beach. It was way smaller than I expected. The pools at MGM are like 8 times the size of this area.

But like many Vegas clubs here, it gets SO busy, that you have no option, but to continue to move up the different levels.

And move up we did...up and then down, up and then down.  My poor legs and feet thought I was going through a Shaun T insanity workout...wahhh...

This up and down trek through the stairs was not by choice.  We were actually trying to get out and asked a few security guards the direction to get out.  Each time we were told something different and each time we ended up having to wait in a ridiculous line.  Were we being punked?? It took us a good 1+ hours to get out!

First impression of the night club is that it is absolutely beautiful. The main room is massive and gives you a lot ways to party.
Unfortunately there seemed to be only 1 men's room which definitely hampered the night.
My table was in one of the side rooms which was great. The bottle prices are fair and I felt like we got a good deal until we started to see our service.
Started off great but then when things went complicated our service took a hit.
Here is what happened: one of my friends started ordering beers to accompany the bottles we had. They brought them all opened with no ice so we put them in our bucket with our bottles of vodka. The bus boy kept taking them out and putting them back on the table which was really annoying. I told him to stop and instead of explaining that it was a health rule( which I found out much later) , he took my big bucket of ice off the table and brought back one that would only fit our bottle of vodka. I asked him to bring me some ice for the beer and he refused.
I called the server over and started to get heated about the service of the busboy and she took it as I was yelling at her. She called over security and I had them get a manager. Neither wanted to address my issue and just took it as I was disgruntled.
No one was thrown out because no reason too but I left there extremely dissatisfied. There are way to many clubs and bars in Vegas to accept bad service. I had an even worse experience at there beach party which I will be reviewing shortly and tell everyone to look around Vegas for well reviewed places based on there service. Everywhere in the desert is beautiful but the best in my opinion is based on service.",1,0,0

Not only did we have to pay the $22 cover charge because we arrived after 1 am (our fault), we were asked numerous times to move from certain areas by the security staff. If you don't have a VIP table, there is basically nowhere to stand or sit. It's insane! We first stood against the wall near the bar because there were no places to stand elsewhere and the security came over and flashed his bright-ass flashlight in our faces and told us ""only men"" can stand there because the wall was supposed to be the line for the men's bathroom. Yeah, okay jackass.

So we went upstairs and stood against the rail while they played some good music. Literally a minute later, just as we were starting to enjoy ourselves and get comfortable, the security guard comes over and tells us, we can't stand there because everything in that area is reserved for the VIP guests, who by the way were sitting down 4 feet away. Why even let people go upstairs then??!

Busta Rhymes was the guest that night and although I like him, he spoke way too much and was wasted during the performance. I'm so mad I paid $22 for this place. It was not worth it at all.

Headed back to the main dance floor after we let our drinks do their work, the dance floor is unbearably small and packed. We could barely move, let alone dance and enjoy it. Tip fellas: swaying your hips about 3 feet each way is NOT an appropriate way to dance, especially when it is super crowded. The music was just ok as well. I guess I was expecting more for a Sat. night.

We ended up leaving the dance floor and found a spot along the wall in the 'entry' hall and danced there. Surprisingly the acoustics were actually better there anyway, and we didn't have to worry about being felt up by the crowd.

We sat in these long, curvy leather couches since there was 45 minute wait for a table because we didn't have reservations.  It took a while to find someone to take our drink and appetizer order.  The food is mediocre at best; my friend had chicken satay skewers and I had the tao salad.

Why?

Because I didn't get in...and there was a fight outside!

We were on the guest list and took a cab from across the strip to get here.  I was dressed nice, but had on white sneakers (white\/cement Jordan IIIs).  For this reason alone, I was not let in.  

However, we noticed several other dudes wearing torn up canvas sneakers.  The explanation we received when my wife asked was that they were not white (I guess khaki colored Vans are okay??).  The doorman wasn't budging, so we went on our way.  

As we were about to leave, a fight broke out within a few feet of us.  A guy punched security and then just stood there talking.  He could have walked away at that point because security was so slow to respond.  Then after a few minutes he started getting swarmed by waves of security guards.  They hog tied him, and then some random dude came up and kicked the tied up dude in the face.  Security did nothing to stop the kicker, and seemed incompetent in general.

It is hands down one of the best clubs in Vegas. I have lived in Vegas for two years and am always on my computer and phone telling people where to go and I say the same thing every time. I suggest different places different nights. It also depends on the group of people and whether you want bottle service or not. 

If you are a group of guys I would suggest getting bottle service because this place will get super crowded and it's nice to have your own area. One last thing gents! Tao is strict on dress code. No t shirts or gym shoes unless you have nice jacket. Jeans and a button down are acceptable.

Same goes for Tao Beach pool party on Friday from 12-5. The food here is amazing. The staff is the hottest and most unique at any pool party. The vibe here is more intimate and then gets crazier as the day goes by. This isn't a knock from Rehab or Wet Republic which sometimes has reputations for being gross.

The club itself wasn't bad.  Upon entering, we walked up the stairs since the first area was a dining area. The drinks are pricy, like any place in Vegas.  The bathroom for the ladies required us to go up yet another flight of stairs, but our view while waiting allowed us to look at the crowd below.
The night we were there, it was all hip hop and r&b music so I had a blast. The dance area is pretty tiny (or what I saw from this night, maybe there is a bigger area for friday\/saturday) since most of it is roped off for table service.

After trying a few different approaches that all failed, I finally gave up, I understand our co-founder had a good time, but after the behaviour of the door and security staff at Tao, they will be reconsidering future events hosted there.

Fee-I can't remember exactly but I think it was free admission and drink before 12am. ( I went in May)

Layout- This place is HUGE and extremely nice.

Music-Top 40 and a lot of good music. Some old school, some techno,...a little bit of this and that.

Well, since I've pretty much been to every superclub multiple times now, I figured I would go check it out...as something new. The irony lol.

Considering that my meal at Tao was the absolute worst experience I have ever had EVER in all of my 26 years, and my VERY FIRST IMPRESSION of the city of Las Vegas, it is a wonder that I ever came to like the city enough to move here. We had the worst, most obnoxious, most condescending, snottiest, meanest and awfulest (that's a word now) waiter in the history of the profession. I believe his name was Davey. I wonder if he still works there?!!

When good ol' Davey asked us what kind of water we wanted, I asked for a Diet Coke because I was super thirsty (it was our first night in the desert, after all) and he cut me off rudely with the classic line, ""This is WATER TIME."" We were consistently pressured to spend more money on crappy food (there was one thing that I liked, some kind of fried sushi roll thing with rare beef inside? I guess the one star is for that) and drinks than we had any desire to. We were spoken to in a manner best suited for dealing with small, mentally challenged animals. We were given long, unnecessary explanations on what certain foods were like (I guess he thought we had maybe never eaten below-average Asian fusion before and didn't know what ""ahi tuna with wasabi cream"" is??? ""THOSE WORDS AREN'T AMERICAN! THIS MUST BE FANCY!"").

You see, Davey figured out very quickly (probably immediately) that we were not typical club-goers and immediately decided that we were a couple of dorky Midwestern tourists worthy of his scorn. We WERE a couple of dorky Midwestern tourists but we are deeeeffffinitely not idiots and we were and are no strangers to fine dining (much finer than Tao) and, thanks, Davey, we know how to use a credit card.

Yup. At the end of our torturous meal, he actually explained to us how to use a credit card. Like, ""Now I'm going to give you this receipt back, and you sign on the line, and that authorizes me to charge you for the amount indicated.""

My only regret is not that we ate at Tao, because honestly the whole thing was pretty hilarious and walking through the club portion gave me a quick education on what, exactly, a club is and why I never want to go to one, ever, but that Timothy paid for the meal with his credit card and thus was afraid to not leave our pal Davey an actual tip, when we SHOULD have left cash and like, a pile of garbage instead. OH WELL.",5,4,1

Came on a Thursday night with 3 other girls, didn't pay cover since a promoter found us that day at our pool and invited us. Received a couple of free drinks too from him. Drinks are the usual, $13 average for a vodka drink. Dancing was a lot of fun but like everyone says it gets so crowded so you wont have much space of your own. I was drunk so I didn't care much.

Second:  The place is pretty large, has a few different levels with music styles.  The decor is stunning and that makes it fun.

*sigh*

I used to like Tao.  Used to.  Past tense.  
But the reprehensible and abysmal customer service we recently encountered on numerous fronts border on cataclysmic.

Ill Communication... (Beastie Boys, 1993)
10 days prior to Vegas, more than one person in our entourage attempted, valiantly and persistently to secure guest list accommodations, all to no avail, no recourse, no reply, no acknowledgment from Tao staff\/management.  Fine... it happens.

The Tipping Point... (The Roots, 2004)
So, uncertain of our status on the guest list, we made a conscious effort to arrive early to stand in line, arrayed in a 16 girls to 6 guys ratio, the ladies looking delectably hot and the gents dapper smooth (or at least passable... meh!). For over an hour prior to opening, we stood there (at the front of the line), as did countless others behind us, until a security\/bouncer announced, ""regrettably"" of course, that they had over booked the guest lists and no general admission guests would get in.  Hmmph...  Frustrating and a ridiculous, considering those guest-lists were in circulation all night and some idea that they were over-booked should have been evident much much sooner.  But fine... that kind of thing happens too, I suppose...

By All Means Necessary... (Boogie Down Productions, 1988)
At this point, KT, in her most tactful and professional demeanor (... and a vivaciously flattering top...), set out to see what could be done.  We were told to go ahead and just get in the guest-list line.  Then told we weren't on the guest-lists.  Then directed to speak with ""that guy""... who told us to talk to ""this guy""... who said to KT, ""Sorry, there's nothing I can do, try another club"".  Wow, really?

Stakes is High... (De La Soul, 1996)
During the horrific menagerie outside, three friends, assured we would get in, threw down the $grand for table\/bottle service and were awaiting our arrival inside.  Aghast that we were turned away, they negotiated for 7 of us (5 girls, 2 guys) to get in; the other half our crew had gotten in by just walking up to the counter as-if they were on the guest-lists (Bum Rush The Show... Public Enemy, 1987).  As it would turn out, another doorman would demand that we purchase another bottle @ $300 for the admission.  Hmmmm, really?  Your bottle service, as it were, allots 3 guests per bottle and there were only three people inside with three bottles.  Ludicrous.

Tougher Than Leather... (Run DMC, 1988)
So, we walked away... no club is worth that much stress, drama, and runaround.

Yeah, I used to like Tao... USED TO.

loud music. sweaty people. many rooms. many bars in different locations, different music depending on the rooms, and upstairs... wow! i loved it. it's on the rooftop, it's outside so the smoke doesn't bother you as much, and you can hear people talk.

conclusions i've reached based on no scientific research: 

rooftop is for the older, generally with more talkative people who are already getting laid or don't care too much about one night stands, etc. and are comfortable with where they are in life (generally).

downstairs are for the hornier younger kids who are confused and don't care about STD's or burning people with their cigarettes or developing a hearing problem.",1,3,1

Came here on Cinco de Mayo for a bachelorette party. A group of us 9 girls booked a table for the night to have a place to sit & chill while we party it up. At first, I was a little sad when I saw that our table was actually at Tao Beach and not inside the club itself, but that turned out to be a good thing because it felt so nice out there! There weren't any sweaty people up in your bubble. Lots of space for you to mingle and dance. 
Since we had a table, we also had our own private ""butler"" (ThomAs was his name, and damn he was foiiiine!). Our table also came with a bottle of Goose w\/cranberry and pineapple juice.

For the first time, I actually didn't make my way to the main dance floor that night.. but that was okay 'cause there wasn't a celebrity guest there and the DJ at Tao Beach was playing all the good hip hop cuts (which I was hoping for).

It's a nice club, nice layout and design, but if you're with a big group you could def. get lost in here. Music was mish-mash... wasn't really a fan.

the venue seems large enough and the decor is well done, but for some reason they seem to reach capacity early on in the night and continue to let more and more and MORE people in.  i don't know about you, but when i go to a club i like to dance and apparently the only room to dance here was on the stage with the go-go dancers.  we did manage to find pockets of air here and there to breathe.  

the bathrooms were also interesting, located on the second floor so you can overlook the dance floor as you wait, its out in the open.  the only privacy is a glass stall door that only fogs up when you close and lock the door.  i must admit i felt a little exposed!  ;-)

getting in wasn't a problem, since we got VIP and our group consisted of 4 girls (always nice to be female) =).  the massive lines outside were a bit out of control though and apparently groups of guys will try to solicit groups of girls to join them so that they can get into the club.

We arrived at the club close to midnight before it hit our real birthday. There was a huge line right in front of the entrance and immediately I thought, ""Crap, here I'll be in line celebrating my 22nd Birthday waiting"". Luckily for us, one of the security guards told us that we had to get on the Guest List line on the other side of the entrance. Apparently, I didn't get the memo that they only allow Hotel Guests from the Venetian to enter the club. I freaked out a bit and another security came up to me because I was visibly upset. He said that he could get me in the club for the cover price of us all paying $50 each. So for a second I thought, Screw it I'll just take the offer because it beats trying to find another club nearby. A few other people seen him negotiating a deal with me, but who cares I got in less than 15 minutes lol. He called the Tao Club Owner to meet us by the ATM machine and therefore we were greeted to the front of the line with our now ""VIP Tickets"" in hand. Yeaaaahhh Boy! 

So let me just say that once we got in the main floor upstairs, it was SUPER SUPER crowded. There was hardly any room to walk with people literally being elbow to elbow. So, we instead went to another room which was pretty small but good enough for us to find an area to dance. The room was pretty lively and there we were set off to dance. The drinks are what you expect because most drinks in Vegas at the bar are above the $9-$15 range. We danced and this dude bumped into me pretty hard. I guess he thought I was going to hit him or something do he extended his arm to give me a handshake, lol. We exited out of that room since they closed it pretty early. Got back to the main room and met a couple of people. The drink servers were pretty friendly as well, so they got a few good tips from me. Then here comes the motherload! The security tells me to step aside for a bit because someone was coming through. So happens it to be Ron Artest which I thought was pretty cool. He wasn't there for that long and maybe stayed there for like 30 to 45 minutes. The crowd was dying down around 4 and we left as the Club was heading to a close.

So far, I would say theres probably way better clubs out there than this one. It was way too many people and not much room for dancing. Maybe if you find like a more open area you will have a good time. I had a pretty good time, but overall the Air Bar in the Stratusphere was well worth it. Maybe because we stayed in that Hotel. Not a lively atmosphere as Tao, but we brought out the liveliness to the Bar. Super Fun!! I think I should start my review on that one.

Located at the Venetian, the entrance to the club is on the second story, just above the casino entrance leading from the strip. The line can get long later in the night, so the beat time to get in the club is around 9 PM. 
You can call ahead and make reservations. You'll want to have an even ratio of guys and girls, or have more girls in your group in order to get in faster. My buddy is cool with security here, so we got in without the line nor having to pay cover. Otherwise, cover would have been $30\/person.
The club is located upstairs, just above the Tao restaurant. Once you're upstairs, you'll walk into the main dance floor. There are multiple cages and platforms where go go dancers hang out all night. The DJ sit opposite the entrance. The bar is straight ahead once you walk in.
When taking a smoking break or going for some fresh air, the patio offers an outstanding view of the strip.
The patrons here are awesome. I've met people from all over the world. I've made friends from Europe, Canada, South America, Asia, and Africa. Talk about good networking!
The music is great here, and the dance floor is always popping! The lights and sound are well coordinated. The drink not too pricey considering it's Vegas, and they are pretty strong. Bottles of water run about $7, while a pair of mixed drinks run about $35 excluding tip.

1) When hot girls dance on a girls-only pedestal of the main stage.  I can't even talk to you if you're not on the main floor, so get down and let's rage.  The whole reason you came was to meet me anyway, duh.

2) Married females in bachelorette parties...if you aren't single, why are you in a club of all places???  It messes up my flow.

3) Girls who rag on security because they tell them to put their shoes back on.  Let's be honest, you don't want to see me with my shoes off (even though my feet are sexy).

I get a call from my friend that they wouldn't let him in line anymore. He is also a local and the time was at 10:50pm.  First they tell him ""Only guest list and locals"". He replies he's a local then suddenly its now ""Only guest list"". Now things have just reach its point of ridiculous. To treat locals so poorly is mind boggling on a night which is designed FOR US.

Like moths to a flame, gaggles of raven-haired ladies wearing Gucci & DG bling wait behind the velvet rope while guys with silk-collared shirts & gelled up do's burn out the batteries on their cell phones near the escalators, trying to get some hook up from ""their friend who knows a guy who's married to the sister-in-law of one of the brothers of the club manager at TAO"".   And that's cuz, none of them are on ""the list"". 

[Locals - feel free to take this moment in the review to laugh & point at the noobs.]

Let's get this one out of the way:
-- GIRLS:  Call 702-234-9380 for guest list access for your group.  4-to-1 girl to guy ratio.
-- GUYS:  $100 will get you & a friend in the guest list line through a bouncer, but the problem will be initially getting a bouncer's attention.  
...if you wait in line, cover's $30.  Good luck getting in before sun up.

Here's everything you need to know about Tao:

1)  TAO REALLY IS A BUDDHIST TEMPLE
No joke.  It's true.  The club owners moved an actual Buddhist temple across the Pacific block-by-block to create Tao.  So in a feat of incredible irony, a religion founded upon peace, minimalism and freedom-from-desire is playing host to one of the most chaotic, hedonistic, sin-charged clubs in Vegas.  And a really lousy, price-gouging, American-bastardized sushi restaurant at that.  But never mind that.  Party on, bitches... and pass the ""Philadelphia Roll""!

2)  SERIOUSLY, WHY THE @#$% ARE YOU HERE?
You really need to ask yourself this question.  Is it to hook up?  Is it to dance?  Is it to see & be seen?  Is it to hang out with your friends?
-- GUYS:  If your answer is anything other than ""TO BLOW HUGE ASSWADS OF CASH ON ALCOHOL THAT'S BEING SERVED FOR FREE IN THE CASINO"" then you're probably better off getting' your rocks off elsewhere.  Sorry blue balls.
-- GIRLS:  If your answer is anything other than ""TO BE SO CLOSE TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR THAT I MIGHT POTENTIALLY GET MY ASS GROPED BY A GUY WHO COULDN'T AFFORD BOTTLE SERVICE"" then you're probably in for a real treat!  Good times, chica!

3)  THE DANCING... WILL SUCK.
Movement will be minimal here - bank on it.  You will be asscheek-to-asscheek from velvet rope to balcony spilling your drink all along the way, and if it's not, it means you're there on either vinyl or industry night (Wed\/Thur) when the music is going to suck.  Friday has more current stuff versus Saturday which has classics... but it doesn't matter because there's no room to move to the beat anyway.

4)  THE BAR... WILL SUCK.
The house vodka is Skyy, which is utter swill.  Order something decent like Chopin or Belvedere and you're lookin' at a 10 minute wait.  And there is so much chaos that no bartender will remember your tip - even if it's bigger than what you tipped to get past the velvet rope in the first place.

5)  GUYS?  BOTTLE SERVICE.
I hate to say it, but at this club:  No bottle service, no play.  Women have the curves, men have the coin.  That's the law of nature.  And the ""coin"" equates to 4 people per bottle, 1 bottle an hour, minimum $350 per bottle not including tip.  Pick your poison.  Got that?  And it needs to be reserved in advance - call 702-343-1422 for reservations.  If you can't swing at least $350, start steppin'.

6)  GIRLS?  GOOD LUCK.
There's lousy dancing.  It's hotter than a camel's armpit in the Sahara.  You're probably gonna get groped.  No one's gonna see your hotness in this light.  And if you're lookin' for that glimmer of hope that you might run into a sugar daddy here to take care of you, good frickin' luck.  This isn't a place where roller's hang for the most part:  All of them graduated to PURE or Ultralounges - and that includes the ones with yellow fever.  Sorry ladies.  

CONCLUSION:
Don't get me wrong:  This is a really HOT-lookin' crowd and that makes up for a lot when you're young and stupid.  Dress to impress, party people.  Guys - if you've got the cash to blow, great.  I'm glad you sold all that Goldman Sachs stock short.  I also hope you're either Asian or you've got the yellow fever because that's what you're gonna see.  Girls - if you really wanna have fun, not to mention a place to sit and kick off the Jimmy Choos, I hope you know some of those guys that shorted that Goldman Sachs stock.  Otherwise it's gonna be a long tough night for both of you.  

If you're a guy with cash or hookup, or you're a girl with decent hotness or a Goldman Sachs boytoy...

4-Stars.

It's not fun being forced to brush up against someone and walk away with your arm dripping in their sweat (true story) or having stiletto heels jabbing at you every 2 minutes while you're trying to shake your booty. 

It does have 3 levels but being herded by the bouncers down the narrow staircases and having to wait in line to go up\/down is a buzzkill.

We still had to wait in line, which was about 30+ minutes. Not too bad, I guess. However, I missed the open bar that came with my wristband because I kept going to the wrong bar area and by the time I got to the right one, it was over. Real convenient, guys.

Tao is overrated and the lines are unusually long. Let me list a few of the reasons why:

1) Bad DJ - Who mixes Jay-Z with Tammi Terrell? I don't want to hear ""Ain't no Mountain High Enough"" or ""Twist and Shout"" in a nightclub ...

2) Poor 3\/4 Naked Girls in Dirty Bathwater - I felt sorry for the girls who were acting psuedo sultry in those gigantic bowls of water. I'm not sure how that was sexy ...

3) Overcrowded - Unless you go into the other rooms, the main dance floor is jam packed with people. So in addition to having your personal space violated you get to smell everyone else's sweat at the same time. Mmmm delicious.

4) Weak crowd - If I had a nickel for EVERY time a guy used the line ""Ni Hao Ma"" or ""Konichiwa"" to pick us up ..... gah, forget it.

5) Long cab lines - The lines for the Venetian were super long, it was easier to walk down the street to catch a cab.

The appetizers, especially the sliders were yummy.

Pretty asian themed decor.  Is that why it attracts so many AzNs??

Why are the girls' restrooms upstairs??!!  We have to push our way through the sardines packed dancefloor crossing our legs so our alcohol filled bladders do not burst and then climb upstairs to wait in a long line while boys from downstairs can look up our dresses.  I don't get it.

Tiny smoking patio outside, but you get a nice view of the strip.  Typical club music, hip hop gets you bouncing off the walls.  Overall, fun club that I wouldn't mind coming back to.",3,2,3

The first time I went here, years ago, I was blown away.  I'd never seen anything like it.  Hot women with nipple covers in rose-petal bathtubs!  Hot women in cages and beds rubbing each other!   The club decor is really nice and the music is good.  The place is huge with 3 rooms and you can go into Tao Beach too (maybe this is only in the warmer months though).  The typical top-40, hip hop, and 80s rock music.    

But over the years, I've grown to loathe this place.  It's mostly an early-20s crowd and a lot of Asians.  It's crazy packed and the main dance floor is small.  I've had drinks accidentally spilled on me on several different occasions.  The door men are jerks.  They don't keep up the dress code.  I've seen chicks in capri jeans and flip flops in here.  Not the type of crowd I like to surround myself with.  The bars are so packed, it takes forever to get a drink.  And the bouncers will not hesitate to kick you out in a second if you act even slightly drunk.

I don't go here unless I have to or am getting in for free and I highly recommend a table because it's so packed.  A table is the only way you'll have breathing space and a place to rest your aching feet.  But that's pretty much the way it is at most of the Vegas hot spots.

Okay, so the first time I came here I absolutely LOVED it!  I mean, what's not to like?  Right when you walk in you see half naked girls in tubs filled with roses and as you proceed upstairs you see more hot girls on beds\/couches promoting lesbian tendencies. Good so far right?  The dance floor is relatively big too and it seems everyone is having a good time.

However; after the first visit it just went downhill and stayed there.  Maybe it's just my luck but it gets too crowded and quickly becomes quite unpleasant.  The line for the bathroom is painstakingly long and the bouncers always shove you against the wall telling you to get the hell out of the way for ongoing human traffic.  The last time I ever came here I felt disgusted it felt like a sweaty cock fest sauna, no lie.  I don't think I'll ever be coming back because I prefer outdoor clubs where you can actually breathe over these death traps.

If you haven't been clubbing here before try it at least once.  You might get lucky with a good experience who knows.

Funny story: I got kicked out here once because I needed to throw up and couldn't find a trash can. I kicked open a random door by the bathroom and just yacked all over the floor...when I looked up I saw an entire staff standing there staring at me in disbelief and horror.  I said oops and proceeded to close the door real slowly as if nothing happened.  The bouncers kicked me out a few seconds afterwards.",2,11,0

We bought front-of-the-line passes online, which cut us ahead of everyone, but it didn't look like it would have been THAT long of a wait, which would have been a lot cheaper. (Our couple ticket totaled about $95.)

The decor here is crazy Chinese, and there are tons of naked or near-naked girls all about. There were a few lazying about in the rose-petal tubs, some dancing in lingerie on stages, and lots of other setups that cannot remember.

There were definitely lots of people from my hometown, as another reviewer mentioned - and lots of Asians and Filipinos. But I see nothing wrong with that! 

The music was pretty upbeat and easy to dance too, though nothing compared to the DJing skills of Steve Aoki at Prive that I experienced the next night.

The downsides are that the bars are always super busy and crowded, it was really hard to get an order in. Plus, they didn't know how to make a bunch of things that are fairly well-known. (Tangerini, Superman) Also, the security is pretty strict, and got upset just when I took my shoes off - I didn't have my feet on the floor, I just wanted to stretch my toes real quick. I'm not used to cramped up heels.

But I'd say it was a really fun experience despite the negatives I mentioned above. I suppose being a popular nightclub has a lot to deal with.

I also loved being greeted with a ""Happy Birthday"" every time someone checked out my ID - even though it was a day belated. I didn't get that kind of greeting at Prive the next night.
Plus, it just seemed like a lot of the people here were just plain more friendly. People were actually starting conversations with strangers and trying to chat around. Prive was all dance, mainly with everyone who knew each other. It was way harder to hear above the music there.

The music was also ok (hip hop, top 40). The free drink wristbands were fucking awesome. The problem was that it was way too crowded, hard to even walk around, and too goddamned stuffy in that bitch.

WINNER WINNER :D Most of my friends want to go to XS, Surrender, etc. but I can't seem to stay away from this place. Even tho it's not the newest or trendiest place anymore, it is still one of my favorites. 

The line here can get REALLY crazy  especially on a Saturday night.  This is a great spot for girls. You can get through the line pretty quickly if you're on the guest list or staying in the hotel. Guys usually will have to pay cover (unless you're staying at the hotel), but honestly, the cover here is so much less than some of the other places in Vegas. Plus, like at Lavo, girls get open bar here.  The drinks here aren't nearly as strong as the ones that they serve at Lavo, but whatever, they're free! GUYS:Make nice with the girls....or make sure you've got girls in your group; maybe they'll share their drinks with you :D

The promoters are all pretty nice. They'll do their best to get you in as quickly as they can. Sadly, the bouncers aren't always all that nice. They're pretty chill with a group of girls. But they can be total assholes to guys. 

It can get pretty packed in the club, but luckily, it is pretty big. There are a couple rooms and 3 bars. The wait at the bar can take a while, so learn to get a little pushy and squeeze to the front. 

The bathroom is CONFUSING. I do love their decor...but is it really necessary to label the bathrooms as ""Ying"" and ""Yang"" Chances are most people are buzzed or DRUNK. I really don't like having to think about which bathroom to go into! Sometimes they have a bouncer stationed right outside to direct traffic, but sometimes they don't.

We did the dinner\/vip package off a recommendation of my sister in law who had a great time. This was our first time at this club and I will say my LAST. 

Dinner started off great, service was good, food was good. Even when a waiter dropped a whole tray of dishes right behind us and I got sprayed with chili sauce all over my arm and face and all over the back of another person in our party. Mamagement came over and was very attenative and offered to pay our dry cleaning bill, or our bill, or drinks. We had already paid for dinner so we took the round of drinks . No biggie there. 

We finally get escorted up by Nick  to the line where we were then handed off to another person who walked us into the club to our table. We were placed at a table that was in what our hostest called  the ""Opium"" room. Everything was going well, we were having fun till they started moving all the parties from that room over to the main clib area. Our hostest and security guard would come up and say okay they have a table for you and are gonna move you now... than another party would be moved. This happened the whole night till we were the last table in the opium room. Seriously, tao come on. When someone pays for vip service you shouldn't treat them like they were just someone who hasnt speant as much as we did.. 

After a bouncer came over to see what the issue was and me and him getting into it we finally got moved. They stick us in a booth that clearly other people had just left and they didnt bother to clean up. There was liquid all over the floor along with drink straws. They didnt wipe the table or thr benches down. My best friend was wearing a white dress and sat down in something that got all over her dress... 

I complained again to our hostest who said she was going to get the manager. Yet the manager never showed up. Never did any busers or anyone to clean up the mess at the booth. Not til my best friend tweeted and tagged tao in her post about how dirty the booth was and how unsatisfied she was with our experience was did we get people to clean up the booth.  After that we never saw a hostest, security, or person from the club.  I tried to forget about the troubles from earlier and just have a good time.

But if you want the fun Vegas clubbing experience, this is an excellent place to go.

Also love the naked girls sitting in rose petal baths near the entrance. I really don't have anything clever to add to that, except that I couldn't keep my eyes off them as I was leaving at the end of the night. Perfect ending to a fun time at TAO.",2,0,0

Already at 10 the line and crowd was huge. Once again, I walked right up to the host, gave them my name, and in we went. We were escorted to our table in the main room- amazing. Instantly we were introduced to our waitress, bus boy, and security guard. Within 10 minutes of arrival we had two bottles on our table and every mixer you could imagine. You ask, they give it to you. (My friend wanted to drink vodka martinis so they brought him vermouth, olives, and martini glasses) I'm from Boston and you don't get service like that here.  

We had heard that Tao treats its VIP tables the best and I have to say its true. Our security guy was our personal escort to the bathroom all night. Do you have any idea how awesome it is to bypass a line of 25 girls who have been waiting 30 minutes to pee? Its pretty farking awesome. Anything we wanted was ours. Not having to wait in line to get in, get drinks, go to the bathroom- that is priceless. And when you work out the math it only comes out to be a little more or the same than what you would pay if you got the drinks separately from the bar. The dance floor at Tao was SO incredibly packed that you are forced to grind with whomever is around you. Having your own table and space is much, much, better than being herded like cattle. 

So while yes, it is expensive, it is worth every penny.  You pay for much more than drinks.

Update:

Another great bottle service experience at Tao.  I booked a table for 12 of us for my birthday and when one of my friends had his flight canceled they were really great about letting us drop it to 9 and having two girls on the guest list.  My friend and I walked right into the guest list line and right in with no cover.  I think we waited all of 4 minutes.  Fantastic.

Once inside we were able to meet with our group easily and we had a great spot in the corner just as I asked for.  My husband was on crutches from an incident the previous night and they were very nice and accommodating!  Our waitress was great and our personal bouncer was as well.  I feel bad that the last time we took our friends to Pure because the service at Tao is just so far above that at Pure its laughable.  It was probably packed in Tao, like it always is, but we had no idea because of our corner location.  

Again, the best choice for bottle service in Vegas, hands down.",11,0,3

Unfortunately, my own personal experience at Tao didn't change my mind about what I had read. Though we were on the guest list (which you pretty much have to be on just to get into anything in Vegas) the line was long and confusing. The roped line next to us was opened up to female-only groups, which we were, so we switched. However, we were then asked whose list we were on. The gentleman could tell we were confused and was nice enough to give us a name of a promoter so we could get in the expedited line. We were allowed in after only a few minutes and with no cover charge and given an open bar wristband for the next hour. This was definitely the biggest plus of my experience. 

That aside however, the drinks were terrible! Not only were they weak (to be expected when they are free) but poorly mixed. My long island tasted like sour pucker with a little bit of soda. After leaving the tiny bar\/dance floor area, we made our way up to the pool. For whatever reason, it was closed in the middle of July! In addition, the largest area to dance and sit in was closed off to VIP. Though we were able to sneak our way in, there was still nowhere to dance let alone move.

I know Vegas hot spots are crowed, but I see no reason to stand in a long line, pay a cover, buy over-priced and poorly mixed drinks, and proceed to stand around awkwardly because there's no comfortable place to dance or socialize.

As a female who was just punched by a grown man (clearly stunted mentally) I fell to the floor and he stood over me and punched me two more times before someone stopped him. Mind you I never touched him once through all of this. I just curled up and tried to save my face from getting hit again. I got up yelling and was escorted out by security while he stayed with his friends in the club. When my friend told security that he hit me their response was ""I didn't see anything"". I guess the scratches on my face weren't enough for them. Surely I will never come back to a place that allows a man to put hands on a female. It is disgusting and horrible business practice.

- super long lines
- being herded like cattle
- getting pushed around inside the club
- a lot of smoke

So it was my friend's 22nd birthday and she wanted to spend the night at TAO, so of course, we all had to go. Even though we had gotten on a guest list, it only guaranteed that we didn't have to pay, which was nice, but the line was still really long; it looped around the walls not once, but TWICE. 

After waiting for over an hour, the guys in charge of the line moved everyone around in groups and kept telling us to move closer together or into random corners. I honestly felt like a cow the way they were herding us.

Finally, we entered the club and immediately had to go to the bathroom after standing outside for so long. First of all, the bathroom doors had yin and yang signs. How the hell are we supposed to know which one is for men and which is for women? Also, while we were sitting in front of the bathroom doors waiting for the rest of our group, one of the security guards near the bathroom told us we had to leave because we weren't allowed to ""hang out"" in front of the bathroom. So why were there chairs there?!

So we decided to go upstairs and dance\/drink a bit. The first thing I noticed after getting upstairs was that it was PACKED. Attempting to get to the bar was so incredibly tedious. The bar area was also a smoking area, which I think is a terrible idea because all the smoke just hangs in the air because of the lack of ventilation. I felt like I was choking the whole time.

When we finally decided to go dance, the place was just so packed we could barely move. Don't even think about dancing because I couldn't move at all. I was right up against other people and getting pushed all over the place because people were trying to move around and walk through people and OMG it was just horrible. 

After only about 45 minutes, we just decided to leave. We were tired, not from dancing, but from standing in line for so long. Nobody could dance anyway and the drinks weren't anything special but pricey, as with any other nightclub.

The music was really great, but what I hated was the layout.  The ""dance floor"" was some carpeted area (dangerous!) with a VIP area in the middle. That made it really difficult to walk around.  

Didn't end up staying here long, which I suppose was a good thing because I felt like I was going to pass out.

Ill start by mentioning that its 3 levels with several different sections to hang out at and many bar's.

The club itself is a lot bigger then some of the clubs ive been to and is packed to the extreme.  The night I went (Saturday) it was even more packed then usual b\/c it was Jamie Fox's B-day and P-Diddy was there chillin with him. I got some prety good pics of that!

The drinks are typical Vegas priced at around 15 ish per.  The bartenders are cool if you can get them to remember you.  I actually managed to get a free drink from one just by mentioning to him a drink he had never heard of before.  

The crowd is full of good looking people and has a relatively diverse group of people. I noticed a lot of asians there the other night though but im not sure if thats the norm there. Either way, im hooked and had a great time.  

VIP at Tao is crazy expensive. 1200 dollars for 2 bottles that will accomodate 6 people.  Crazy huh?  That price includes gratuity and tax. Not to mention the bottles there START at 450.  Getting into the club can be a pain if you are rolling with a lot of guys and very few girls. 
I suggest getting in line before 10 to insure entry if you are a bunch of guys.  If you want instant access then you need a big group of girls with you. Probably 5 girls for every 3 guys to be on the safe side.  

Overall the club is great and can lead to lots of good times for those looking to have fun.

So to break it down....

VIP is expensive.
Getting into the club can be a pain.
Drinks are good but pricey.
Good looking people.
Great Location.

Obviously at any club you're going to get a dose of d-bags with bottle service, but this place was classy about it. They had tables for service and places to sit for those who didn't (unlike other clubs I went to during the weekend).

The dance floor was poppin', the drinks reasonable considering it's Vegas and it never seemed too crowded, rather it felt just right.

I read other reviews and I felt bad for those who didn't have a good time or had to wait in long lines, I wouldn't doubt it sucked for those people so I'm reviewing based on my luck of a good night there.

We started off the night by pre-partying in The Venetian suite, so it was very convenient that Tao is already located in the Venetian because we were buzzin' and in very high heels. We met someone earlier that day that randomly gave my friends and I VIP passes to get in for free, and for my guy friends; reduced admission, so that helped make the night awesome as well. We went around 11:00 or 11:30 and the wait time for the line was no more than five minutes. I felt bad for the girls in the bathtubs right when we entered, they were super hot but who wants to get paid being pruned up all night and probably being touched by douches pretending to like it? That's not important. Anyway, my friend was up a couple of bills earlier than night from playing three card poker so buying drinks were a breeze. Wasn't feeling the lower section of Tao, just a bunch of really cool people at their tables drinking, being too sexy, and people watching. Second floor was way better, I came to dance and that's exactly what I did with Dirty South DJ'ing that night. He played really good hip-hop and R&B then transitioned to house which isn't my favorite, but it was towards the end of the night when I already hit maximum on my inebriation bar so at this point I could dance to anything.

To make sure you have a good night at Tao:
- Get ahold of a VIP pass, go be sexy somewhere and someone will find you to give you one.
- Have money! Bottle service and a table isn't even necessary in my opinion, but it would probably be a plus so you can sit. If you're a girl dress sexy and be classy.. people will buy you drinks for sure.
- Hopefully you go on a night with a good DJ! The type of music is really important to keep your mood going good.
- Remember when going to the restroom YIN is female and YANG is male, that tripped me out at first.

Hope this helps, have fun (:",4,1,1

Tao was definitely an experience.  The restaurants design consisted of bold reds, tiered dining levels, Buddhist inspired statues and and overall Asian fusion inspired theme. Oh, and the joint is massive.  I mentioned that I was dining with a friend however, the following evening I was invited to join a large contingent of company folks for a corporate dinner so I double-dined Tao.

My close friend from the first night was fairly familiar with the establishment so we picked from her list of favorites: lobster shrimp dumplings, spicy tuna roll, sweat potato tempura and Peking Duck.  I have some distant Chinese heritage and my family has been enjoying Peking Duck since before I could even say ""Peking,"" so I was pretty skeptical.  Even when the dish was served and everything looked in order except for the over-sized tortilla looking pancakes I was still questioning the notion of enjoying such as cherished dish at a hyper-trendy Las Vegas eatery.  I was not disappointed.   Actually, my Peking Duck experience was actually a tragedy of sorts - this restaurant has chosen to remove the thick layer of fat from the skin still preparing the dish in a traditional manor.  What results from this choice is the flavor and fun of Peking Duck without the sometimes gut wrenching experience of swallowing down pure duck fat.  I'm sure a million ethnic Chinamen (and women) are probably screaming out in dismay at the sacrilege; but for me it was like getting an ice-cream cone on a hot day that never melts - a miracle.  I'm actually frothing at the mouth thinking about that dish right now.

Again, as with the rest of my reviews of last weeks dining and debauchery my memories are not so sharp.  I would have to sit down with the menu to recall the three or four other dishes that we sampled - all of them as good as the rest.

Sadly, my second night of dining was with gentlemen (and one Lady) that were more preoccupied with drinking and boasting than experiencing the offerings of this great and trendy restaurant, so the host relied heavily on the opinions of our server, who had similar tastes to my dear friend with whom I dined the night before.  Naturally, I enjoyed two evenings worth of Peking Duck, shrimp and crab dumplings and more tempura than I could handle for one night.  Even sadder still, I and my Chinese friend who joined us for dinner were the only ones that dined on a double serving of ""the duck.""

My last comments go to the strange yet beautiful display of opium pipes arranged individually in rainbow-lighted cubes; covering an entire wall of one of the many rooms named after rooms in a home (i.e. the den, the study, etc).  The theme for Tao is ""Religious Dining"" and I couldn't help but consider how un-religious opium is\/was and what a tragedy was so forcefully shoved onto China by England who dumped massive quantities of cheap opium into the population.  During the 1900's, the British crown was the largest drug dealer in the world.  These events have served to properly alienate China and to this day an heir of resentment and paranoia still persist as a result of the opium tragedy from what now seems a time long ago.

The place has a hip hop room, but when I was there sometime last month, it was closed off.  When I go out, I like to dance, not stand around.  That's nearly impossible to do here due to so many people.

The workers who work here think highly of themselves, just the same as the people waiting to get in.  Some of them were rude and not helpful at all.

I actually like this place for the dancing experience and the look of the place. It is impressive to look at and the music was really good. However one thing that got to me was the price of drinks seriously almost 30 bucks for two goose and tonics that are served in the tiniest glasses with way too much ice...Im sorry but for me that is a killer. 

I didn't wait in line long so I was happy and I tried to pay cover and the cashier just handed me back my cash so that was a win...the people here I reallly didnt pay much attention to, I could sense the douchebags and what not but came with awesome people to that is all that mattered. I had way more fun in the upper level that played house and dance music then i did in the RnB room...

So maybe it was our own fault for rolling out to the clubs later then suggested, but I kid you not when I say that this line was 500 people deep.  The reason for their lack of stars is not that there were so many people (although imagining all of them inside made would make for one cramped space), but there was no organization what so ever to the lines and no one really wanted to clear that up for us.  There was a line out in the main lobby, there was a line on the terrace.  We were on the guest list and there was a separate guest list line, but all the lines kept crossing and all the bouncers were just hanging out chatting and not helping anyone.

We opted to get dinner at the Tao restaurant next door. They offer some sort of VIP pass so you don't have to wait in line, I recommend you do this so you can skip the line of 1,000+ asians. The club itself is on the second floor, so you will have to climb some stairs. Once inside, get ready for some sardine action!

What I mean is that you will be packed like a fish in a tin. Literally. They stuff em in this place, and that makes for a lousy night. The club itself was beautiful, and the music and dance floor was perfect, but it's just too small for the amount of people they let in. Drinks were expensive and the bar was very hard to get to, and the bathrooms leave much to be desired. We didn't do bottle service here but I imagine it would be very expensive. 

Aside from being a hotbed of asians, there were also lots of creepy dudes watching chicks dance. These were 50+ year old sausages just standing on the sidelines, getting their jollies watching an ocean of asians dancing the charleston. So yes, at times it can be a sausage party.

Aside from getting one of my heels stuck on the stairs a few times the dance floor wasn't too far away on the 3rd floor. 

Got into the VIP section but the dance floor was PACKED - literally couldn't move an inch. So we left and decided to give Tao Beach a try. It's on the roof of the club which was refreshing (except for the smoke). However, we found it disappointing with a not-so-great DJ and majority of the people up there were sober and not dancing. There isn't much room up there to dance as majority of the space are sitting areas so any open space is a walkway. I'd suggest them to set up a dancefloor over the small pool they have up there to add dance space - the pool was blocked off anyway. So after not really enjoying the roof much either, we were disappointed and surprised to find there was actually a LINE for people to leave the roof...

The fact that it's been years and it's still popular does prove that it's still a happening spot.

The bathrooms upstairs are interesting though annoying at times...the main dance floor is super tiny which is a mistake on their part...but the beach upstairs (which isn't always open) is beautiful and more spacious.

Hands down worst club experience of my life. I was literally lifted off my feet by a sea of sweaty party-goers and had multiple drinks spilled all over my dress. Glad I had on my Forever 21 party frock rather than something more expensive. I was soaked! 

I've been back when it's not AS crowded, but long-lines, a less than elegant crowd, crowded dance floor and hackneyed tunes have proved consistent themes at TAO.

So this club is the second floor of a restaurant so you have to walk through the dining room to get to the stairs. This is cool for those heading to the club but I am sure weird to those dining. 

There are 3 rooms upstairs and then another set of stairs that leads to the rooftop pool. Couple things... I went for Kaskade so the majority of people here wanted to be in the main room to catch him so everyone was stuffed, yes STUFFED, in here at an uncomfortable rate. So the other rooms were much more comfortable but you didn't want to be away from the action. Also, the other rooms have TVs of the DJ but they were terrible quality, really terrible. 

So head upstairs to enjoy the pool on a gorgeous evening but they weren't even streaming Kaskade's live set that was just downstairs so that was pointless.

Headed back to the main room and checked out the ladies bathroom... here is where it gets even more weird. Head up the stairs where you have to wait in line along the balcony for one of the 3 people working the bathroom to lead you to one of the stalls. Now, get ready for it, there are NO LIGHTS inside the restroom. Some have candles, some do not. Those working use flashlights to check them and then you are left to fend for yourself once inside. I saw some girls using flashlights but then you could see in the stalls... your best bet is to let the club lights flash randomly and hope you don't slip. Yep, it's real ladies and gentlemen. I think they were going for ""sexy"" but this is just straight weird and I was stone cold sober and was worried I would pee on myself. 

So the sound quality is great so that is awesome but for the amount of people they allow in, wow... not sure it's worth it. Luckily Kaskade played an extended 7 1\/2 hour set some most people were gone by 5am and after that it was incredibly enjoyable and we rocked till 8am. 

Overall just super weird but I would check it out again is K played or no famous DJ was playing.",6,6,3

http:\/\/shop.vegas.com\/clubs\/calendar.jsp?club=44

We were a little skeptical doing this, but we showed up to the club around 1AM on a Thursday night and there was a long ass general admission line and bottle service line and went up to a dude in a suit and asked him where the wrist band line was and he guided all 11 of us dudes with no girls past a velvet rope and we got to cut in front of a bottle service group full of girls straight to the cash register and the cash register chick gave us all our wrist bands with ease and bouncer dude stamped all our wrists, so we were good to go for Tao and Lavo for the whole weekend.  We all felt like VIPs cause everyone was looking at us like WHO THE HELL are those guys cutting in line with no vagina with them.  Plus the bouncers at Tao do some major line controlling, so if you're trying to get in general admission or on the guest list, you better be with an equal ratio or more girls if you all expect to get in with no problemos.

But yeah, if you're rolling hella dudes deep with not deep pockets, then purchase those wrist bands.  They work.  And if you're with someone who didn't buy a wrist band, just have them go in behind with you and they'll just have to pay whatever cover is for the night, but then they won't be able to get in again on Friday or Saturday night if you guys try to get into Tao or Lavo again since he won't have a wrist band.

But yeah, club is pretty poppin.  Really packed and hard to move around.  The bouncers do a good job with keeping dudes out of roped off bottle service areas, so if you throwing down for bottle service, you probably won't have to worry about random dudes walking through your area.  And from what I've heard, it's best to get bottle service here for the best time, since the bouncers let all the hot girls into your bottle service area if you ask them to hook your crew up.

Tao is very creative, when I walked in, the first prop I saw was an actual person- seemed to be a common theme.

Back in the day, this club used to be the bar that every other club measured itself up to.  And even when new clubs like XS, Marquee, etc. took the spotlight, this club was still 'okay.'  However, it could now really use a face-lift.  

The Opium room is where we were initially sat.   I'm not sure why or since when this was the case but they closed down half the room.  So now it's just some tiny box.  Hardly the experience you're looking for when purchasing table service.    Perhaps, they wanted the club to 'look' packed so they sealed off half that room.  Listen up guys, the consumer doesn't want to be packed in a sardines can.  The open concept of XS and the ability to still walk around in a crowded club (Omnia) is what makes those latter clubs so much better now.

Tao positions their table service even in the HALLWAYS\/WALKWAYS between the Opium room and the Main room.  The only thing worse would be how Tryst sometimes puts table service OUTSIDE their club right by the stairs (lol).  So now there's tables, servers, people gathered around those tables which are blocking the walkway making it a push and shove experience that we all love, (yeah right).
Just more of that in the main room.  

As far as service goes, the hosts were not friendly or personable at all.  When I arrived with my wife, we told them we had a table.  We were escorted past the lines and about to be taken up the elevator to our table but decided to find a restroom first.   We asked for the bathroom and were pointed to the bathroom on the first floor.  We returned to the elevator momentarily, and the host kicked us out, stating we had to walk up the stairs, even though we were with a table.  Is that how you treat your customers?

Now as far as music goes.  You'll hear your standard hip hop stuff in the Opium room, some mix of that and EDM in the main room.  There are far better DJ's elsewhere though.   Because of the lack of professionalism and rudeness of the vip hosts, I wouldn't take my business to them again.   Let me know if you guys change your ways.. or your club. ;)",6,6,3

We had stayed before and were looking quite forward to our stay.  This was short lived.  Though the property is as well maintained and as beautiful as ever the customer service at the hotel has gone down to zilch.  We had no issue checking in as the front desk clerk was really very nice and helpful.  The security guard at the elevator banks where they are supposed to check room keys was basically asleep at the wheel the entire time and ignored most guests going through.  The real issue with our stay came when we went to TAO Nightclub.  Within minutes of arrival my husband realized he had been pick pocketed.  So we immediately left and went to speak with security.  After reporting the theft we decided to call it a night and went back to the room only to realize that my wallet had also been stolen from my purse.  A few swipes of the finger on my cell phone told me that my credit cards had already been used at a gas station off the strip even though it had been missing half an hour.  This was a pro thief.  Went back to TAO only to be told there wasn't anything they could do and sent on our way with little concern.  Went and found a security guard who advised there was nothing he could do.  I begged and pleaded to get some sort of report to present to police to file a report because I knew they would need something from hotel. It is important to note that the first thing the police asked for was an incident report from the hotel.  The security did not want to help us.  A manager came out and got involved and was also less than helpful.  We were never asked to sit down or taken someplace private to discuss our situation.  We were never offered any assistance, information or otherwise to aid in dealing with the issue.  We were not provided with details as to how to file a police report: where to go, who to call, etc. After spending well over an hour we weren't even offered so much as a glass of water. That night I spent until 5am calling credit card companies. Then I had to spend 90 minutes holding to find out the address to file the report only to taxi over (20 min) and then wait 2 hours to file the report and taxi back... The hotel did not get in touch at all after the incident to offer an apology or make sure we had obtained the necessary paperwork.  Not another thought was given.  At the police station I learned that 40-50 people per week come in and file the same reports from TAO Nightclub and TAO Beachclub.  Obviously, this was very distressing to hear.  We are careful to protect our belongings.  We utilize the hotel safe because it is recommended by the hotel. We would have heeded the same warnings had we known theft was a huge issue in the nightclubs.  I feel that the hotel didn't do their due diligence in informing me as their guest, of what I needed to do to properly unsure my safety.  I also feel extreme disappointment that the hotel showed such a lack of concern for what to us, was a very distressing and debilitating situation.",1,1,0

Or complain that a club is 'pretentious'... because wake up, 99.9% of clubs ARE. 

Or ESPECIALLY those who complain about being turned back due to their poor dressing habits. I can thank the Bouncers for turning you away, because that's one less grubby kid in the club. When you go clubbing, it's not rocket science to realize that you have to adhere to a dress code. I mean, you don't go to church without wearing your Sunday best. You don't go to work without dressing up in business casual. Why is it people are in such a state of shock when they are turned away when they don't adhere to nightclub etiquette?

If the scene is not for you, there are plenty of other places in Vegas you can spend your time at instead of bitchin' and moanin'. Don't be a downer. There's Margarittaville, a plethora of lounges in every single hotel, etc. Go to those places instead. 

Now that I got this out of my system, Tao is still one of my favorite nightclubs to hit up in Vegas! Even after a few years, it's still just as glamorous and I totally dig the asian influenced decor. If the loud music is a bit much for you and you want to cool off a bit from inebriation, Tao Beach upstairs is a chill place to hang out. Tao Beach upstairs is also a fun place. I always have an excellent time here with my friends.

The only disappointment about this place is it is always insanely packed. Since it is one of the most popular clubs in Vegas, it can get very crowded, so it may be difficult to find room to dance. But when you do, it's fun because the people here are pretty smokin'.

Some group pushed and shoved their way in and we told him to chill.  When he didn't, he wanted to throw down!  WTF!  We just told him to calm down!  I almost wish one of us punched him so we would've had a valid reason to leave Kim's bday before we even got to see her...

But we left the main floor and checked out the other areas.  The area upstairs by the pool was really chill.  More spacious but no real dance floor.  We chilled there for a bit and decided to look for the other floors.  We eventually found one and it actually had space to dance!  Sweet!  But in just a matter of 5 or 10 minutes, the crowd came again.  And again, more male ass to my ass which was not a very good experience for me.  We eventually left, before Kim got in.  Even still, it was freaking ridiculous trying to leave the club.  We had to go through another dance floor and it was just annoying at that point.

I'm giving this place two stars just because they really do play good music and it really is a pretty sweet place to go clubbing.  But man, limit the amount of people who go in!!!",1,1,0

It was a big disappointment and I don't think I would ever go again. My friends and I got on the guestlist and even with the guest list it was an hour wait time. Luckily all of us girls are able to get in for free. There was free drinks for girls on the guest list from 10-11pm but since the waiting was so long by the we got in all the free drinks were gone. Drinks there are about $13 a piece and they were not very strong. So needless to say I think the drinks there are a complete rip off. I enjoyed the decor and the dancers but it was much too small a space for all the people they let in. The big dance room was completely filled and you literally cannot move in there. My friends and I spent most of our time in the small dance room but it was also crowded in there because it was where the reserved seating areas were. The space in the small dance room was really awkward because random sections of it were ropped off to people who reserved it. It wasn't good use of space and the music was not very good. I think I could find better nightclubs in vegas than Tao.,0,0,0

I was originally supposed to go to Hakkasan. I was staying at the MGM Grand and for some reason my peeps and I thought we'd get in for free because we were staying there, but no. 

The cover fee was $100 dollars for guys and $40 for girls!  So if you want to go to Hakkasan make sure you buy your tickets months ahead of time. 

Anyway, we were still able to get into the guest list at TAO. We paid nothing! The line moved pretty quickly. I thought it was going to be empty, but it was packed! 

It was so crowed I could barely walk and I smelled so many arm pits. Ugh! Even that wasn't as bad as the bathroom. The bathroom was so nasty. I saw pee all over the floor the toilet seat was wet. I had to squat over the seat.

 The bathroom attendants call every person in line individually and nearly shove them on the toilet seat. When I was called I was rushed into the nearest available toilet then nearly pushed in. 

The bathroom attendant leaned in and told me that they only work for tips so if I needed anything I should let her know, with a face the gave me a vibe that she might be there against her will. 

Shortly after that awkward moment I went down stairs to get a drink. The drinks were a little on the tame side. I could not taste the alcohol at all, which was kind of strange because I'm a total lightweight. 

Before even stepping foot in the club I had two shots of tequila and a mojito. Then I order a jagger bomb, sex on the beach, I think another jagger bomb, and I still had no buzz.

As I said before, I am a total lightweight. I get drunk off 2 cans of beer so how was it even possible that I was walking straight and not slurring my words? 

The only reasonable explanation? They water down their drinks. Seriously, I could not taste the alcohol at all, and I'm a whimp when it comes to alcohol. 

Finally after waiting 30 minutes for a drink I ordered 2 patron shots and a vodka cranberry cocktail. I was getting in the mood. (To dance, ya' dirty pervs!) 

But, the music sucked! At that point I was like, ""TAO, I'm getting real tired of your shit."" I wasn't the only one who felt that way. I was with a group of 6 people all we all decided that we'd have a better time blasting music on our iHome in our hotel room.",12,9,1

I don't mind hearing a DJ spin some tunes, but the technio-babble beat of TAO will quickly make you wonder what made you decide to enter in the first place. 

The only saving grace of the place is that the lounge doesn't charge a cover and the staff are EXCELLENT and extremely nice.

Great looking venue, great looking crowd, great experience.  I generally feel most clubs are the same and how much you enjoy it depends on the people you go with.  While that can still hold true at Tao, the place itself definitely sway my opinion.  

When you first enter if you enter through the main entrance, they have girl in bathtubs with rose petals in it and nothin but rose petals on.  Come on now, what guy can possibly not like this place already?!  They have a main dancefloor downstairs, and another one upstairs (Tao Beach) next to the pool area.  

The reason this place doesn't get five stars is first, the downstairs dancefloor is super super crowded.  But what can you expect from a poppin Vegas club.  If it's not that crowded, you probably don't want to be there anyways, a la Pure at Caesars (haha that's another review).  Secondly, they have a super strict rule of wanting an even ratio of guys and girls or they wont even let you get in line.  The group I went with had a few more guys than girls and apparently they were being a-holes when my friends tried to get in earlier.

The music is good (top 40 mashes) with no house \/ trance junk.  So if you are with a group of friends and aren't concerned about spitting game to baby boomers you're in good shape.  Seriously I saw people that looked 10+ years older than my dad (no disrespect)...and they were asian so that means the actual age was really 20+ years older!

Things to know:
1. 3 lines.  If you're a guest of the hotel always go in that line even if you're on the guest list.  They will check that line first and let you in much faster.  
2. Guys can get comped for free so plan ahead
3. They give you a free voucher for Tao Beach
4. They may have open bar from 10:30 - 11:30 for ladies (we went on a saturday night non holiday weekend)

My boyfriend had the Kobe Beef ($88) which was just delicious!

On the bad side, I'll start with the not-so-bad and make my way to the most horrible things about the club. 

1) CUSTOMER SERVICE: Real talk, just waiting to get inside the club the bouncers are real creeps as they try to act macho towards girls they have no chance at getting, please stop you're disgusting .... and customer service is lower than average even from those who arnt bouncers

2) HARASSMENT: If a bouncer trips over your friend, your friend might get accused of being ""too drunk"" when he was not even moving ... the bouncer will keep pushing on your friend saying ""let's take this outside"" when your friend still hasn't said anything to warrant such aggression ... the bouncer is just clumsy and fell over himself

3) FAUL PLAY: the same bouncer will wait for your friend to come out the restroom and lie saying ""people said you threw up"" just to fabricate a story to throw your friend out to get back at your friend for the 10 minutes earlier when the bouncer previously tripped and looked like a fool ... he then throws your friend out and turns around laughing at the matter (Friday)

4) DISCRIMINATION: bouncers here will throw you out for being transsexual\/transgender and using the restroom that you assign yourself to (transgirl got thrown out for using the ladies restroom) ... once again the bouncer laughed at such a matter as he threw her out ... this one is for bald Joe who runs security at the club, who finds it funny to openly discriminate against LGBT ... (Thursday) 

And if management realizes they did something wrong they will say ""just get back in line and pay another $30-40 to get back in the club"" ... as that's the best of an apology you will get at TAO

We asked if he could take a picture of us to which he quickly refused because he wasn't allowed touching private property, which is understandable but he didn't have to be rude about it. As we are getting ready to go inside the same bouncer that rudely denied taking our group photo, denies the birthday boy and another one of my friends entry inside the club due to them being too ""drunk"". 1. It's Vegas and everyone is drunk. 2. Not one of the people in our party had anything to drink. 
I asked politely to please check them again, to which he rudely again responded "" they are not getting in"". 
Host that walked us in assured me that they he would personally walk them in a few minutes after we got settled at our table, of course after they were going to charge me and the inform the couldn't get them in. Next they tried to charge for two bottles not the one they had originally offered with the second free. Tried talking to hostess and she was of great help. I walked up to the host who assured me that my friends would get in and he walked me up to the head of security, of course it was Mr. Rudeness. I asked politely if there was anything he could to which he disrespectfully replied ""they aren't f**king getting into the club"". I Called my friends to leave TAO and take our business elsewhere, and had a great night at Tryst. 
I understand that there is protocols to when people are intoxicated but when someone has it out for you and it's one of your bouncers it's not gonna end well regardless.

You disappointed me. 
Well actually I kinda knew you would disappoint me .. because I have been hearing how LAME you have become, but I still wanted to give you a chance. 
( You were kind of affordable too )

It was a thursday night near the end of August. I came to Vegas for the Magic Week, and I wanted to enjoy Vegas for a day with my friend. Since he did not want to spend much money on Clubbing, I only had few choices. 

10 Dollars for Girls, 20 Dollars for boys. Waited on General Admission, and we got inside after 20-30 minutes. 

My friend first hesitated to go to Tao because "" Tao - "" is something he likes in Buddhism. I was, you know... trying to tell him it's just a theme they chose... but damn ... I was surprised. I was wondering if  any Buddhist would take this place offensively. Its very cool interior to me though. I really enjoyed their decor regardless of some ignorance towards Buddhism culture. 

People on thursday were nothing impressive.
Couple cute girls, ( None of those girls can beat their go-go dancers though. ) and mediocre-looking men... ( nothing special.. sigh..) Maybe I am little spoiled by LA-club scene. I am not saying LA club scene is awesome, but they do have lots of Actor \/ Model wannabes. ( = More eye candies ) 

I shall definitely go to Other clubs next time like XS.
I would probably never come back unless they would have an amazing DJ.

I guess when it comes debasing Asian culture, it is perfectly alright.  Whorentialism displayed by Richard Wolf and Marc Packer, the owner of Tao, is disgusting.

This is also why I don't like Hollywood culture.  All the celebs thinks this place is so cool.  I guess you can't blame them, when they jump from one religion to another like a whore, 

My next club is going to be call Confession Box it will pimped out with crosses of Jesus and Bible verses in the bathroom.

Also, I'd like to add that as a person of Asian decent, I am really astonished and disappointed by all the Asians that I see walking out this place.  I mean ""ain't anything sacred anymore"".  I mean - a white man is whore your culture out and you pay him to experience it.  Not that if the owner was Asian will make it right.",4,7,6

The fact that they allowed men to wear their blazers comfortably in the club and force us women to check out coats is not okay. Why should a female have to be only in her dress while men get to walk around wearing anything they like? I brought the issue up to one of the door man and he immediately kicked us out.

TAO is located at the Venetian but once you go inside you'll see a huge lounge area and restaurant seating for guests. The actual club and dance floor is located upstairs, so you'll have to climb dimly lit stairs to reach it. Decorations were awesome but my problem with the setup of the club is that everything is so tight here. The smoking balcony, dance floor, and bar are all aligned with each other almost in a horizontal line so there's people constantly moving past each other to get from one place to the other.

Despite the setup and the tiny dance floor, I love everything about TAO. People here are a lot friendlier than at other clubs and it's a more interactive dance floor.

Upstairs was a whole other story! The cabana\/table that we were seated at was just big enough for our group (about 15 people!) and there was still room to dance in there.

Paid $900 for the VIP Bottle Service.  We went in a group of 10.  We were treated so very well at beginning and at the end,they basically acted like they did not know who we were. They talked to us by name the entire time.  I was tossed out because I felt sick, went up stairs to the bathroom and threw up.  It was so hot and humid from the fully packed people.  People were literally dancing on each other on the dance floor.  I wonder if they even have a limit capacity. 

 Anyways, a bouncer escorted me up to the casino floor, told me that they had found my husband and that he would come out to meet me at the entrance.  15 minutes later, he never showed up.  Asked one of the bouncer by the door to see if he knew what was going on.  He said to ask the other guy which turned out to be the guy who took us to our VIP booth and accepted our credit card.  Asked him if he remembered who I was, he said yes.  I told him that the other bouncers told me my husband would meet me by the entrance.  Showed him, my ""X"" on my risk cause I couldn't go back in.  His face totally changed and acted like he did not who I was and said he has no way of helping me.  Really? He was the guy who took our card and escorted us.  My party was literally looking for me all the place.  They asked the clean ladies upstairs by the bathroom and they said they never saw me.  LIARS!   

Trust me, they are just after your money.   Once you are done with the drinks from the bottle service, they are done with you.  No need to tip their waiters and waitresses.  They are so fast to clean your booth and bring in a new group. They brought new ppl to our booth while my party was still their.  Their VIP sucks so bad.  They put 2 parties in one both.  There's no separation between you and the other party.  If you request, they'll just have a bouncer to come in between.

It was fun.  I don't drink but surprisingly I was able to hold my own in spite of taking 5 shots of whatever it was at the pre-party and then getting unlimited free drinks for the women.  We only got as far as the second floor.  Too bad my companions were too drunk (?), too tired (?) to stay longer and move to another part of the club.  

I got groped, I got grabbed, some dude started dancing with me, I finally decided to sit behind the guy friends who came with us but it was still fun.  Did I wish I slapped the guy who grabbed me?

First, I don't know what the connection between the Venetian and Tao is but it seems a little inconsistent.  The themes clash and well... I just don't get it.

I don't go clubbing much anymore, as I was just there for a bachelor party.  The good thing is our didn't have to go through the line (and that rarely happens) due to a connection.  I don't care how poppin a club is, I HATE waiting in line.  The music was pretty much on hit.  All the bangers, even a couple rock songs, which was surprising, but it was what you expect for a club.  For a such a cavernous venue, the room acoustics were pretty good.  The DJ must have had some good monitors to hear himself... But then again, DJ's nowadays using mixing software for beatmatching and use MP3's.  (Yeah I'm a purist)

Decor, was great.  Asian themed.  

The place was definitely poppin'.  We got a skybox and not once did I jump into that sea of people jumping up and down, pogo-ing and freaking and all that.  I just took it all in, drank a lot and enjoyed the scenery. 

The surprising part was that our host kept random people to our box to join in the party (mainly girls) and now I just realized the flip side of how girls get in and get free drinks and all that.  I just witnessed it.  But it was all good fun.  A little crazy at times.  Being from SF, where clubs usually end at 1am, I wasn't used to partying past my bedtime, so it started to take a toll on me.  The bathroom had ushers to keep people going in and out in a timely fashion.  The stalls had TVs!!!   They were playing Akira.  I thought that was kinda cool.   Moments later, I took a quick nap and next thing I now its 3am!  And there's still people coming in and it is as full as ever. That's Vegas for you I guess.

Now here is where I start subtracting stuff.

Since we were pretending to be big ballers in our tight ass skybox, we were required to purchase 2 bottles (bottle service) which is a new concept to me, complete with all the extras like coke, red bull, OJ, cranberry juice and what not.  Totally cool.  The prices... NOT COOL!  My jaw dropped looking at the price of $400+ bones per bottle.  And to top it off, we were required to by six.  I don't even want to do the math.   It basically equals = BROKE.  I guess that's Vegas for ya.

I don't want to get into any other details, but basically, it was a one time deal for me.  I don't think it'll ever happen again, but it was definitely an experience.

Note:  Lil Jon and Jaime ""Mutha fuckin"" Fox (he kept on referring to himself as) was in the house...",3,3,3

Drinks were strong, especially for it being open bar (for girls) till 12:30.  Dance floor was packed, but there was still a lot of room to move around elsewhere.  Music was great.

Tao is overrated!! I'm just glad I'm a girl .. which always helps when trying to get into a nightclub. One of my friends was crying after a mishap in line and a bouncer asked what was wrong. We told him she was crying because ""she was so upset we were waiting in line so long"" and he let us in! SCORE.

But the downside.... My group of 8 girls could barely stay together with the massive number of sweaty clubbers pushing us on the dance floor and separating us. The drinks are expensive, the lines to the bathroom are long, and if you're under 21, don't even think about trying to get in. They're strict and will even make you write your name out to see if it matches up with the one on your ID.

I suppose it was so packed because it was friday night, but i still like to be able to walk around a club without drinks spilling on me and people groping each other next to me.

I know everyone says it's way too crowded in here but I think that's what makes this club awesome. This venue is HUGE and the fact that they can pack it from Thurs to Sat nights is wowing in itself. I came here twice and I've never had to pay cover which is awesome. Thanks, Tao. Drinks here are expensive but you can always charge it to your room if you're staying at the Venetian\/Palazzo. Dangerous but WAY convenient!

When I came here in the summer, they had opened up the Tao Beach area to party at. Extra bar, tons of table seating, and the closed off kiddie pool. We definitely came out here for a breather.

I came back here again this past weekend (in December) and the Tao Beach area was closed off. I think that's good since it was about 35 degrees out. Chillllayyyy!! The dance floor was packed as always and the balcony right next to the dance floor should be your getaway if you want some fresh air. Also, the view of the Venetian is breath-taking from Tao!

Although this may or may not be atypical of the Tao experience, I want to share with you our night so you understand why I have rated this club so wonderfully. 

We started our Vegas trip at Hyde in the Bellagio and upon exiting, we were approached by a fine looking gentlemen who offered us free admission and free bottle service at Tao on Thursday night. After no thought at all, we accepted and were escorted into the club to our own couch with two bottles of vodka and four kinds of mixers. The waitresses were friendly and efficient and the service was exceptional. 

The club itself:
-Asian\/ Buddha decor really stood out, gave the club an exclusive feel
-Girls with rose petal boob coverings dancing in bathtubs, yup. Girls suspended over the dance floor doing flips, uh huh. Good music, check. Nothing much like this in Michigan.
-Very crowded around peak hours between 11:30-2:00am. Dance floor was packed and I found it difficult to walk around the club. This problem was solved by having our own area as leaving to dance was not necessary. 
-Great mix of people, no complaints about overaggressive men or pushy security.

We got placed in the bottle service area, without having to pay, and said we could stay there until the people that had paid for the table showed up.  So, I kept the drinks going (pretty much every 10 minutes, because hey, they're free) and took advantage of being able to SIT.  Heels in Vegas for a whole weekend does tend to take it's toll.  

No complaints about the bartenders, they were fairly nice and quick.  The crowd isn't the prettiest here, and I wouldn't dedicate a whole night to this place. But, they had some amazingly beautiful girls dancing in the tub that was right behind us, and we were able to climb on the walkway above the dance floor to dance.

Part 1 Review: Restaurant

So if you have had a chance to eat here, it isn't too bad.  The food is a little bit salty, but when you are way wasted (which I was at the time), salt is good.  It is typical Asian fusion with your obligatory sushi rolls.  I had some grilled sea bass and a sushi roll which was decent.  Besides, ordering dinner here was a decent and quick way to get full and get into the club.

Part 2 Review: Club

As I mentioned above, I have been to Tao a lot of times.  It all kind of blends together, from raiding a bachelorette, to meeting Jesus and the Apostles hanging out with the 300 Spartans (it was one of the Halloweens I was at.... or maybe bits and pieces of two different Halloweens???), to being hungover as soon as I walked in at 11:00pm because I drank all day and then stopped for a couple hours.... you get the picture.  I have had a lot of fun fun times at Tao and it is definitely a go to place for me.  Even though it can get UBER crowded all the time, when they open up the Tao Beach area for night time (my favorite place), it is awesome.",0,2,0

We were a group of girls so we got to the front fairly quickly. There are girls sitting in tubs surrounded by rose petals as you walk in. It was kind of scary because they don't always move. They are pretty, though.

Cover is steep, but that's to be expected. The dance floor was insanely crowded and I couldn't enjoy gettin my boogie on. The bathrooms had those weird doors that you can see through, but once you lock the door, it changes color and becomes solid. I still didn't trust it.

If you're coming with a group of friends, you better hope that someone else is the banker.  It's just easier this way.  Like many clubs, there are different sections, each with a different vibe.  Downstairs is more of a lounge where it's ""quieter"" by comparison.  Upstairs is a sardine can-like dance floor that's 2 drinks away from being a mosh pit.  Expect more men than women and table service is not going to attract women.  Enjoyable but that's because I had low expectations to begin with.

Total damage?  $700 for a group of 7.  [Original Visit: November 4, 2010]

I kid you not - I heard some loser utter this lame line to the girl he was trying to score on.  The lame-ness of that statement sums up my entire experience at this club.  Here's my beef:

1)  The music just is terrible.  It doesn't matter which room you're in - neither area plays new, current music.  Hearing stuff from the 1990s is great once and a while, but not for a whole set.

2)  Small dance floors.  Compared to Pure, these dance floors are minuscule.  Lots of people + small dance floor = dancing in walkway.  The only way to have room to dance is to shake your booty for some guys who have a table.  No thank you.

3)  Girls as decorations.  If you're going to do this, make sure they are hot.  The bathtub girls were hot.  The weird sexual position girls were not.  

If we hadn't gotten in for free and with no wait (we ate at the restaurant), I would have given 1 star.  I'd rather shake it at Pure or Prive.",1,1,1

What took this experience down a notch for me, however, was a snotty female bartender. It was 3:30 and my girl friend and I needed to hydrate. She asked for a soda and I asked for two bottles of water. The bartender looks at both of us and goes, ""Really? That's all?"" as though we had insulted her by not ordering a cocktail. Yeah, bitch, really. Not everyone who comes to Vegas does so to get stupid drunk, although had I been either stupid OR drunk, I would have like you a lot better.

However, I would say this is one of the places in Vegas that if you get bottle service, you will definitely have a better time. Why? Cuz this place gets crazy packed. A table is definitely a commodity that most females enjoy and would sit at your table. The great thing is that you can tell your waiter\/waitress for the night to shoo away people from your table if you don't want them there.

One of the things that is good\/bad about this place is they pretty much enforce ratio. Even if you're a hotel guest. Means there are plenty of females, but hard for guys to get in (unless they get bottle service). There are times I've slipped through, but most of the time, I've had to find some females to help me out.

1st floor is a bit dark and can be crowded. I usually don't stay in this area long and head upstairs. 

2nd floor is always packed to the gills. I don't know how people dance on the main dance floor. The little room to the side is a BIT better, but not by much. Honestly, if you don't like super crowded dance floors, probably not the place to be.

The place was pretty big with a decent sized dance floor, but mann, this place was suuuper crowded when we went. Pretty crazy dancing sooo damn close to folks that you didn't even know...

Also they had bars in different locations, which I usually like because I hate when clubs have only 1 bar and it gets suuper crowded and takes forever to get a drink. But the smaller sized bar here was on the other side of the dance floor, and the only way to get to it was by walking through the maze of clubbers getting their groove on. It was horrible.

My boyfriend at the time and I were staying at the Venetian so we got express entry and no cover.  We were very happy about this because the line outside was really long and wrapped around the staircase\/escalator area and back through the door to the outside area.  

I like how Tao is multi-level and every level has a different feel.  Most of our time was spent dancing in the main dancefloor on the second level.  I did, however, like the decorations on the first floor, but it seemed more like a lounge area down there.  On the second floor where we were dancing, it was EXTREMELY crowded.  There was barely any room to dance, but I didn't mind being pressed up against my guy; the part I DID mind was being pressed up against someone else too.  I felt like part of a sandwich.  Other than that, the music was danceable, Nas seemed to have a good time as well, there's plenty of areas to step outside to get fresh air, and the service at the bar was pretty timely.

However, Josh approach my group (all girls) and asked if we wanted to get in for free (YES!) and stated that there open bar till 11:30pm (awesome!). We waited for about 5 minutes with Josh in a rope off area until his friend walked us threw the club's doors. Then, we proceeded upstairs and noticed to the right was the dance room and to the left was a lounge area.

Since it was early, we got drinks and hung out in the lounge area. That was when CJ, one the security team, came up to us and asked if we would like to sit down in the table service area. Throughout the night, we took advantage of the open bar and Olivia (our shot girl) for coming back with more shots for us to take!

Our ratio was totally horrible (5 guys, 3 girls), but with the proper hookups we got in VIP with 2 complimentary drink tickets\/person (guys $15 and girls free).

Straight to the dance floor!

++The Venue++
 Decadent decor for those who want to sit and admire the scenery.  There are 2 rows of random sinks when you enter the club.  Use these to wash your hands after touching too many people, lol

++The Dance Floor++
- Young, hip crowd (mostly Asian)! 
- Well ventilated dance floor and spacious enough to maneuver through
- Good use of aerial space: there was a woman who floated over the crowd, go-go dancers lining the walls, and bubbles falling from the sky!
- The bouncers were kind enough.
- The DJ on the main dance floor that night could have been better. He covered the Top 40's, sure, but if you know anything about DJ-ing, it's all about smooth transitions between songs.  This guy used ""PUT YOUR HANDS UP"" and the blaring police siren sound clip transitions WAY TOO OFTEN.  It totally sends your ears ringing and sounds terrible.
- TOO MANY guys trying to grab some ass here. 

++The Bar++
I ordered some fun drinks, a margarita and sex on the beach, with my drink tix. Quick service and the bartender was always down to hand me a glass of water.  A nice fellow bought me a vodka-redbull ($16) and that drink packed a punch!  I couldn't even finish it.

It was WAY to crowded. I wonder if they are violating fire code regulations on maximum occupancy? It was hard to move, and if you danced, it would get so hot immediately that you would sweat. The cover charge was $20 and the drinks were expensive. I ended up spending $70 on just drinks alone. The decor is asian of course, but it seemed to be trying too hard. I believe it was a blatant disrespect for using religious icons for decor for a nightclub. I wouldn't do the same thing with Christianity for a nightclub.

The line for the men's restroom was awfully long abutting against the side bar which was extremely crowded also. The music was mixed from rock, oldies, dance, and some hip hop to please the masses.

Since we came after 12am, we had to pay full price, which is completely understandable. They stamped our hands and let us in. Sometime during the night I had left the club to use the restroom and the bouncer wouldn't let me back in. The security attested to the fact that they directed me to the restroom and that I had been in the club. But even with that, this particular person, I believe his name was Justin (this caucasion male), was adamant that I could not come back inside the club because I didn't have the stamp on me. I did in fact have a stamp on my wrist from when I first paid to get in, but he claimed he couldn't see it. Then he went on to say that it could have been an X, which would mean you couldn't come back in the club. So he couldn't see my entrance stamp, but he could somehow make out an X on my wrist? That was when I knew there was a racist tint to his claims, and that he just didn't want to let me in the club because I am an African American women. The scary part was when I told him I just wanted to contact my boyfriend who was in the club, who had my ID and my phone and all my other items that I needed him to carry for me. The bouncer wouldn't let me get to him, 
(he wouldn't even go with me to get to my boyfriend) This man was so racist that he didn't even care and told me just to leave. Thank God for the African American security gaurds who let me use their phone to contact my boyfriend, who then came out. But, it's just scary to know that people are still so racist. I will never ever go to Club Tao again and I will encourage all my friends to avoid this club at all costs. I will post on facebook and twitter, and youtube and let everyone know how racist and horrible this club is. I went to Vegas to have a good time not to be literally directed to leave a club because the racist bouncer didn't stamp my wrist hard enough. I have never experienced this at XS or Drais or Mariquee or any other club. All the racists need to be fired. 
If I could give this a zero star I would, but it doesn't go that low. 
I am going to post a youtube video of this experience and that Justin guy so people could see what actually happened. Thank God for Iphone recorders.
Oh and also, one last thing to add, this club attracts that nastiest perverted men who literally pull out their dicks on the dance floor. Why can't bouncers protect women from sexual harrassment and molestation on the dance floor instead of having innocent women sent out of the club and hotel to walk the streets of vegas without their boyfriends, without their phones and without any money? Most normal bouncers and doormen want women to be safe, and they will usually help them if they can't reach their friends in the club. I'm still angry thinking about this. This racist club needs to be shut down!
All minorities be ware!! And if they stamp your wrist coming in, make sure you tell them to do it over so that it shows up darker on your wrist...they will mistake it for an X when they are trying to prevent you from coming back in after you use the restroom.",0,0,0

There's been a lot of hype around this place, and almost EVERYONE in Vegas has come here at some point. This is likely the introductory club for most people.

I suppose the hype was worth it. It's fairly large with 2 rooms mixing two kinds of music - lots of pathways with interesting things to see - girls bathing in bathtubs of rose petals - rooftop beach lounge (Tao Beach) where you can just chill outside - bar room lined with 100 Buddhas. 

Although this place is once again hella expensive. Spent $70 on 4 jaggerbombs and a cranberry vodka. Never again, never again.

The line for this place gets pretty tremendous, so get here early or don't get in at all. Bouncers don't care about you or your ridiculous circumstances, unless you're an all female party. This applies for everywhere in Vegas -- so just get in early and wait for the crowd to build up because it definitely will. 

Overall, I'd come here again if others did, but it's kind of like -- been there, done that. I'm very indifferent. Although for everyone else: this place is worth seeing at least once.

HA, what a load of shit, just like the millions of others that are handed out on the strip.  They do absolutely nothing but put you in a different line to twiddle your thumbs and wait wait wait.  The best thing you can say about them is that they make you wait about five minutes less than the poor schmucks coming off the street w\/ absolutely nothing.

The best way into the club?  Simple, find a group of chicks (preferably hot), that outnumber the amount of guys 5:1, and say you're all together, and they'll let you in.  If you're a couple or 1\/2 a guy over the amount of girls in a party, you're going to continue to have a nice  view of the escalators and stores while the girls go in.  Understandably so, as this is the general rule of all Vegas clubs.  More girls, more fun.

the club itself is really pretty, and has probably the hottest bartender I've seen in Vegas in the bar downstairs before you take the stairs up to the club itself.  the Asian decor is nice and the layout somewhat organized.  Ever since they opened up the outdoor section on the rooftop, they've allowed more people in, creating more chaos.  It can get so packed that you really aren't dancing, as opposed to just  being crammed up against someone else's booty.  The music on the main floor is OK, they seem to pump it loud and add more bass just to make it sound better, however it's not really all that great.  The hip hop room on the side is much better, although it's very boxy with booths and tables in the way.  The general dancing feel of the place seems to be like dancing in aisles as opposed to a dance floor.

However this is a club experience in a restaurant, what can you really expect?  It's pretty happening and you do get quite a crowd here that's always jumping around.  Drinks are astronomically priced, but that's nothing new too.  If you're a girl, you got it easy, have the guys buy.

1. A huge dance floor. When you really wanna get down, you gotta be able to move freely without having to worry about getting an elbow to your chest or face.

2. Bar. You also gotta make sure the bar itself is pretty big and the area around it should have ample space as well.

3. Easy acces. Why the hell would you have to go up  a set of stairs just to have to make it to the main dance hall? You got female club goers all dolled up in their stilettos complaining that their feet hurt just making the journey from their car, waiting in line, and then stairs to deal with. The worst time is when its time to go. You got blisters already just from dancing (that is if you had any kind of room whatsoever), AND if you are drunk, you can easily be on youtube the next day.

4. Have plenty of bathrooms. It's bad enough you have to wait to get in to the club, but you have to wait in line to go take a leak as well? Yes when you drink alcohol it gives you an awesome feeling. Only problem is, it goes right through your system. So alleviating that should be convenient and not time consumming.

Music, DJ's, bouncers, and bartenders should always be givens. From what I saw these were very good.

Overall, I would rather go to a club that was not as popular cuz at least you can walk around somewhat freely and have enough room on the dance floor to be able to do ""The Dougie"" or the  ""Gangnam Style"" dance. Im pretty sure some fire codes were violated based on the zombie like overcrowding. Im surprised there are not more fights and\/or lawsuits resulting from pushing, shoving, and groping. 

So if I had a couple million in my back pocket, I would build my own club and call it ""The Warehouse"". LOL.",13,14,7

I went here with some girlfriends in September for a bachelorette party, and we had a great time - the best place to get your groove on is on the roof next to Tao Beach.  The night before we went here, we tried to go here with all of our significant others, but two of the guys weren't wearing the proper shoes so it was a no go.  I'm secretly (er, I guess not so secretly since I'm yelping it) glad that we decided not to go with the guys after all, because it was more fun just us gals.  And the go go girls were hot.

Forgot to add that I'm still recovering from the restrooms.  On the second level, along the balcony overlooking the dance floor, is a line of individual restrooms that look out onto the dance area.  What makes these restrooms different is the fact that the doors to the individual restrooms are clear when unlocked and when you lock the door, it frosts over to give you privacy.  For the first time in my life I got pee shy because I could see the shadows of people walking along the balcony just beyond the door, and I was absolutely convinced that they could see me peeing (ok I was a bit tipsy by this point, because I'm sure the door was opaque enough to give me some privacy, but it's still a little nerve-racking).",1,0,1

The place was divided up into a bunch of small rooms with a bar, each had unique decor and different music playing which was pretty cool.  It operates on 3 levels, the main floor which is chill and has the restaurant, the second level which has the stage and other smaller rooms and upstairs where TAO beach (TAO Beach was better) is on the roof.    

We went to see Public Enemy and the downside was that the entire place is all about VIP seating and booths and if you aren't VIP you are constantly shuffled around like a farm animal AND if you paid to see a show on a tiny stage, you wont see it very easily because the only standing room is the line to the bar and back out, unless you pay for a place to sit where you can view the stage. Also as others have pointed out the people there don't really seem to care about the music they came to see either....just a brainless crowd that acts stupid. 

The drinks are way overpriced and small for what you end up with.  I was in heals and not being able to sit down really pissed me off (just sayin).

Dinner was excellent (in my opinion I would rate dinner a 5 as always). We enjoyed a fixed menu that was being offered during the month of September. The food was delicious, the martinis excellent, and the dessert to die for. What brings my rating down to a 3 was most definitely the club following dinner. Given the special weekend, LMFAO was invited and made the club a disaster. Nothing personal against them, but I got pushed out of the way by a bouncer and had champagne spilled down my back when the bottle for the band was opened.

I dined at Tao tonight for the first time. I went with 3 other people and we all loved it! First of all, the atmosphere is very trendy and I immediately fell in love with the restaurant's beautiful decor- 5 stars. Also, the service was excellent. Our waiter knew a lot about the menu, did not keep us waiting long and sporadically refilled our drinks. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and, overall, everything was delicious:

-spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice: Basically the same spicy tuna on cripsy rice that you can find at almost any sushi restaurant. Since I generally love this dish wherever I get it, I thought it was very good. 

-satay of chilean sea bass with wok roasted asparagus: This is the appetizer-sized version of the miso glazed chilean sea bass entree. I usually do not care for sea bass, but the waiter highly recommended it and called it Tao's signature dish. Since I love miso glazed cod, I figured I would like this dish too. If you love that miso flavor then you must get this dish. It's delicious! 

-lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth- another dish that the waiter recommended. The wontons were very good and the broth had a very good flavor. 

Lobster and shrimp spring roll with spicy pineapple sauce- Pretty good. It definitely is spicy but not too hot. 

coconut shrimp with spicy thai peanut sauce- Excellent. Probably one of the best, if not the best, coconut shrimp I've ever had. 

sand pot lobster, shrimp, and scallops with black bean sauce- very good and flavorful. 

crispy orange chicken- probably my least favorite dish of the night but still pretty good. 

pad thai noodles- just okay. the noodles didn't really have much flavor.

mandarin sizzled fried rice with roast pork- good. it basically tastes the same as a pork fried rice you can get at any high end asian restaurant. 

Dessert: Mochi tasting- If you like mochi than you will love this. There are about 6 different flavors of mochi and they were all very good. The mango mochi was very refreshing and definitely the highlight of the dish.

We walked over on a Friday night, on one of the busiest nights of the year - St. Patrick's Day - and not a SINGLE person was in line. We thought it would be easy to go in for an hour since we were already in the Venetian gambling and weren't trying to get crazy the first night. My friend and I walk up to the front and ask how to get in - he points to the VIP line. Not that it mattered because, like I said, nobody else was there. Off we go. Now my brother and his 3 friends come to join us in line - which is when we start getting harassed like I've never experienced before. ""ARE YOU VIP? DO YOU GO TO THIS HOTEL? THEN YOU CAN'T STAND IN THIS LINE."" Cool.

Now I'm annoyed. I go back to the front to see the original bouncer I spoke with 35 seconds prior, and we sort it out. I go back to my fav bouncer, who now decides she wants to make our night miserable and starts up questioning us about our VIP status again, except this time she turns up the condescending tone. 

Don't worry guys, after several minutes of making us feel like pieces of trash, she still let us in the VIP line!!!! Thank god, we felt so special!

Long story short, this place is a complete joke. Power trip bouncers who are bored because nobody wants to go to their old club.

The lounge area when you first walk in to this beautiful locale is great.  It's a perfect spot to soak in the lovely sights and enjoy some drinks.  If only the whole place were like this.  Unfortunately once you're in the lounge, you're only a few steps away from the epicenter of the douche universe.

Yes the decor is magnificent, but besides that this place reeks of mediocrity.  On the weekends, they allow way too many people into the club.  It gets so packed that getting to the bar and around the dancefloor becomes a nightmare.  

As far as the music, expect to hear your standard mix of hip hop and house.  The sound system is pretty impressive, as bass and trebble shake the floors all night.  

Vegas nightlife on the strip best suits the wealthy and connected.  If you know someone here, or you'rea large group of girls, your experience will differ.  Buying expensive bottles and having a table for your group is the way to go if you can afford it. Otherwise, prepare to wipe off the cool water cologne and hair gel, since you'll be getting bumped into by the douchiest people in Nevada all night.  There are other clubs in town that do not feel as packed, have better music, and provide a better experience.

I wish I could rave about this place just because I have so many great memories here, but the greatness had nothing to do with the venue. This place gets too crowded too fast, the dance floor is the same size (maybe even smaller) as Incahoot's (Fullerton, CA) -- and that ain't nothing to be proud of. The drinks are pricey, the bartenders are smiley and accommodating, the security team inside are nice dudes, and the ladies bathroom upstairs is pretty legit with those trippy doors. TAO would receive more stars for the roof top bar area, but it's not always open.

What i can tell you is that, if you have asian fever and looking for a tad more asians at a club this is the place for you. It does have a mxture of people but more asians. For the guys at the club make sure you get to this club really early if you don't have bottle service or you can expect the bouncers to make you pay alot more than your supposed to. But if you get bottle service then they'll treat you like your somebody. I've gotten bottle service at tao twice and both times they treat you like your special because you get what you pay for. Entrance is easy with bottle service and you can come at anytime. They also have really hot girls working at your tables making sure you have a good time. Anyways during the summer TAO opens the upstairs which makes the club better. The lower level of this club is really crowded, if your trying to walk around looking to dance well you can expect to be shoulder to shoulder with someone, and if you want to walk trhough the crowd well be agressive or you won't be able to move. I  enjoy the smoking area at TAO because it has a nice view and people are pretty nice outside. One thing TAO still has that other vegas clubs doesn't have is the beautiful women in the bathtubs with barely anything on. It is a very lovely scene both for guy and girls to see. The girls in the tub also act really sexy so beware, you will get turned on. The upstairs of TAO, the tao beach area is more roomy-er and you can breath much better.

To the Venetian,
 
On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I was shocked and now am increasingly disturbed by your advertisement billboards for ""Tao"" nightclub.  Frankly, as an Asian American woman, I find the ""Always a Happy Ending"" message paired with an image of Chinese writing on a naked woman's back deeply offensive.  This sort of message feeds directly into the stereotype and traumatic history of sexual subordination of Asian women.  How is it possible that a reputable establishment could be so insensitive?
 
Please respond to my inquiry.  I would be very interested if different Asian American organizations and media groups would agree with my concerns.  I am also afraid I can no longer recommend the Venetian to my friends, co-workers, and family members.  
 
Sincerely,
Mima

Update with their response (2\/21\/08):

We are in receipt of your letter and are very sorry that you have been offended by our ad.  We take our advertising quite seriously.  In fact, we always conduct a reasonable amount of market research to ensure that we avoid a reaction such as yours.  We take great pains to avoid offending any particular nationality, religion, gender or otherwise.

We at TAO have nothing but the highest regard for Asian culture.  In fact, from our point of view, TAO is a celebration of Asian culture, cuisine and design.  While our ad campaign may be construed by some as provocative, we believe it to be nothing more than a play on words that is consistent with many other campaigns in town, most notably, ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.""  Furthermore, we respectfully disagree that we have perpetuated any stereotypes or are guilty of racism in any way, shape or form.

We value our customers' (past and future) concerns greatly and welcome any and all comments.  We thank you for taking the time to express yourself and hope that you can recognize that, as with anything, there is more than one point of view.  Unfortunately, in this instance, your point of view and ours are not mutual.  We will certainly keep your concerns in mind for the future.

Sincerely,
TAO Management

The music never disappoints and there aren't any repeats throughout the evening. Mostly hiphop mixed in with some old school beats too, but not some crazy funky sounding mix. The bouncers here aren't as uptight as other places and I like how VIPs get walked in through a seperate line outside. It feels nice to avoid the crowds outside the club. At times, the crowdedness becomes a bit unbearable, but I'm on such a high in this place...I don't want to leave...until my shoes totally give out. THEN, it's time to go.

Crowd is dominantly Asian, around early 20s-30s. Quite a bit of eye-candy and not too many pervs. If you want to dance in a less claustrophobic room, go into the smaller bar area. They still play top 40 hip hop music, with a lil bit of house too.

And the bathrooms are neat-O! The opacity of the glass doors transform when you turn the lock. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU TURN THE LOCK BEFORE TAKIN CARE OF YO BUSINESS. The only bad thing is the wait. That always sucks. Remember to say hello to the rose petal covered girls inside the bathtubs when you walk in. Oh, and if you see 2 almost naked girls inside giving each other massages on the beds, they're not drunk. They actually work there.",1,1,1

In fact, the shortest way in was if you supposedly stayed at the Venetian. 

When we finally got in (please don't sit on those mini pools in the entrance, it's not stable), the area was crowded. We were stamped and directed to head upstairs to the open bar area where we were able to find a nice non-crowded area with an available bartender at all times. Overall it was pretty nice (granted it was about 10-11:30pm). It wasn't until later in the evening that the area became more crowded and it was hard to even squeeze through to the restrooms.

if i had to wait in line AND pay the cover charge to get into a club...wait, there's no ""if"" because that'd only happen over my dead body!!!

thankfully, amex concierge service put us on the guests list of the hottest club on the vegas strip, so we cruised through a mile-long line and got to the front in a second.  we debated whether it was worth paying $20 cover, but decided to just pay the due, get drunk and dance our night away.

first thing first...empty our bladders so we can drink more.  the ladies bathroom was on 3rd floor and while climbing up the stairs, several of us thought our bladders were about to explode.  the club was packed...butt to butt, boobs to boobs jammed to the point where moving an inch was nearly an impossible mission.  

finally, after our deeds, we approached the 1 big rectangular bar to get some drinks.  after 30 minutes of our furious attempts, we gave up.  at this point, we realized that getting to the dance floor would be almost as dangerous as getting thrown into a lion's den.  we inquired about getting a table (minimum charge was like $1000 if not more...f*cking ridiculous) in order to avoid the chaos, but none were available (HA!  some people were just as insane).

this club is in serious violations of fire hazard codes.  totally illegal and immoral of them to charge us the cover knowing how crowded the club was!!!  i could see the appeal of this place if girl on girl were my thing (girls in tiny tubs together, massaging each other).

not wetting our dresses + inhaling b.o.'s + failure to accomplish our missions (get drunk and dance) = $20 and 30 minutes

Another impressive point on Tao.  But when it comes to the spacing of this place, its quite crowded.  To actually dance on the dance floor was just ridiculous, no space.  I couldn't even squeeze between people, just no where I can go.  Maybe the club should think about expanding the dance floor so more patrons can actually dance versus being squished like a sardine in a can.

One of the best thiings about Tao (for me) is that even BEFORE you get in, they demonstate that they are a super (or, somewhat) organized club, setting up lines for people..hotel guest, guestlist, normal admission etc. MUCH BETTER than say, oh, LAX and PURE where you ahve to push your way to the front thenfight for attention like we were in the stone ages.

however, if you get bottle service, it's not bad because you get your own little area and it's a lot calmer. their decent bottle service is what prevents this place from being just one star.

First off, we were notified through our ""promoter"" that guys would be free upon entry, if on the guestlist and present before midnight. I was first in line by 11:30, and even had a ratio of 2 girls to 1 guy. What's worse? The almighty guestlist checker, clipboard holder couldn't even get his prices right when he tried to mumble that I had to pay ""twent--no forty dollars"" just to get in. Not to mention he couldn't even read the time on his own non-digital watch. 

So I paid the cover charge, whatever, don't call me a cheap a$$. I get in, go upstairs to the hip-hop room and start to get my drank on. Everything's okay, even though I still hated the atmosphere of the place I was trying to enjoy myself. 

However, I had to take a phone call out of the hip hop room, for obvious reasons and what do I find out? That another meathead of a bouncer decides to block the room off with the all-exclusive velvet rope and tells me I can't come in cause the room is now closed. Are you kidding me? It wasn't even 1 o'clock yet and you're trying to tell me it's closed? I don't even like EDM so why would I waste my time staying in the only open available room. 

Essentially, I wasted an hour of my time plus $40 bucks to go into something I already knew I would hate. Thank you TAO for confirming how much I hate clubbing and how much of scams clubs are in general.",0,1,0

I got my stuff and LEFT I was not going to spend any more time there.

I came here once for my 21st birthday weekend a couple years ago, and it was horrendous. The line to get in was egregiously long (luckily we jumped into the VIP line and got in that way), and the crowd was disgusting: Asians of all shapes and sizes as far as the eyes can see.

The music was mainstream, and ugly, fat chicks were dancing on top of the tables and chairs, drunkenly screaming and flailing their limbs around.

Now, before you write me off as a judgmental bitch, just know that I do a fair amount of clubbing, and for LAS VEGAS, the nights at TAO are simply unacceptable.

(Although let's keep in mind that I'm not reviewing their daytime activities.  I hear that's a lot better than their nightlife, so this review in no way analyzes that experience.)

For one, it's a nice club.  For some reason I felt like I was in one of those clubs where the bad guys from Rush Hour 2 chill after a long day of murder.  They also got girls in what looks like fish tanks (not cages) dancing.  I found it more funny rather than enticing.

There are two main dance floors, a big one for house, and a more intimate setting for hip hop.  And for the first few hours, they sucked.

However the hell their DJs are need to no longer be hired.  The hip hop room plays bottom 40 non-hits from decades ago... in other words, undanceable... and the house room was inconsistent with ""drops.""

Luckily, with some patience, things got better.  Both rooms started to get hella crackin, and I guess it gave the DJs hard-ons or something because they suddenly clicked.

Why 2 stars?  It was almost too crackin.  So crackin that you'd see trains of guys headed to the dance floor followed by one girl... an old girl at that.

Since Tao is popular to EVERYBODY, it means old people are there too.  And guys.  Lots of guys who think they got game.  *shakes head*

To make matters worse, WELL cocktails are $15-25 each.  Horrible.  I'm just not going to make a big deal about that because their bartenders are hella chill people.  I actually bought the blonde chick at the hip hop room a drink for being somebody cool to talk to.  (But yeah, if you're striking a conversation you can actually hear in a HIP HOP room... that means it wasn't crackin in there.)

Again.  Probably the most overrated club in the history of Las Vegas nightlife.  Oh yeah, there's hella stairs.

If you go around to the bars without a table it can get very expensive and you may wait a while.  I would come here once a month and do the same thing if I could.

They have a 1\/1 ratio so 2 of our guys still had to pay. The guy who checked my name off was nice I guess, which is very unusual because all of the Vegas bouncers I've come across are complete assh*les for absolutely no reason. It's like they hate their job and believe they have to be d*cks to everyone to make a statement.

Anyway, the little biatch (Tall, skinny, Asian, dark hair, wish I had asked for her name) at the register was so rude... again for no reason. I get it, you have a long line and  you deal with idiot party people on a nightly basis, you hate being the cashier at a nightclub, but that gives you no right to be such a bitch to people; it's called customer service. Find another job if you can't handle your ""long line"".

Inside its ridiculously packed; but that's expected from a popular LV nightclub. Girls got free drinks for an hour, the bartenders were all females, very nice, and made very good drinks. Had AMFs, Long Islands, and some Red Bull Vodkas. Could not get on the dance floor because we literally did not fit. There was absolutely no room to even attempt to walk through people; such a hazard. We had to stay pinned to the walls because we didn't fit on the dance floor and you are not allowed to stand around the walkways... so we didn't really know what to do. 

Besides my thirst for customer service before you enter this place: the drinks were free and got the job done, the music was dope, I give props to the performers, and I had an ok time. I won't say I had a blast though... it was too packed to dance anywhere. 

So we took off in the middle of the night and went to the Ghost Bar at the Palms. I've also reviewed them on my experience. ;)",2,2,1

We go up this elevator that's red and dark.. borderline creepy.  It was like we were going down to hell or something haha.  We make it to the next floor and we have to follow this bouncer to some area that is ""VIP"" and he tells us to sit at this table that no server comes over to.  He just leaves and doesn't say anything.  So we're just sitting there for a good 10 minutes waiting.. the other 2 girls leave.

It was the strangest thing ever.  So we just get up and go over to the bar.  Open bar is basically well drinks.  Gross.

We go to the dance floor.  Teeny tiny.. some sketchy little guy is stalking us and won't leave us alone.  Go to the bar near the dance floor, bartenders are rude and drinks are awful.

When we left, we went down these stairs that brought us into the restaurant.  There was a humongous crowd outside waiting in line to get in.  Not worth it.

A few[1] young women and I had no problems getting past security. I didn't receive nor witness any undesirable behavior from the bouncers[2]. A local friend of mine got us passes so the $20\/girl cover was waived[3].

What an event! I had just as much fun as last time. Figured it was going to be a laid-back Saturday night (for Vegas, anyway), but I was wrong; it was bat-shit crazy inside[4]. A friend of mine from LA had a table, and generously shared drinks with us[5].

Table service was excellent. Server Joe (unsure of his name), offered to check on a member of our party who looked a tad inebriated, all-the-while keeping our waters refilled. Later that evening, server Tiffany approached me, pointing to a couple snogging in the corner of our booth (and doing a wonderful job of it, I might add). I assured our server that they were with us - the girl was, anyway.

Note for you shutterbugs: unless you're photographing for Tao in an official capacity, ""professional cameras"" (read: DSLRs) aren't permitted. Leave them in your hotel room - or bribe management for a press pass[6]?

Tao is still a fun venue to get your freak on, and if you have yellow fever, there's always a load of Asians there.

While strolling up to escalators to go wait in what seemed to be a never ending line (at 9:45, before the club opened) a pleasant young lady approached us and gave us some sort of promotional flyer. We presented the flyer to Bouncer A, who directed us to a different line. We thought we were being funneled out, but to our surprise we bypassed the wait and paid reduced admission. Make sure to try and get these passes; the lady was standing at the escalator handing them out to random groups.

There are clubs that have different rooms and floors with different music, but if you're like me and you usually go with a group then it's hard to stick together because everyone likes different music. Some of us like hip hop and some only like to dance to house music, which makes clubs like Hakkasan and Marquee difficult to keep your group together because everyone gravitates toward their preference. But here they played a good mix of everything and no one was disappointed.

We had bottle service, which was great because the place was packed. I like that the bottle service here was raised up from the dance floor instead of being connected to it because it gives you and your group more space to move around amongst yourselves instead of being forced to remain in your small bubble or having people from the dance floor spill into your area because it's so crowded.

Surprisingly the bathroom line wasn't as crazy as we were expecting it to be. I don't think we waited in line longer than 5 minutes, which is saying something.

All of the staff was friendly and accommodating. There's really nothing bad to say about this place except for the fact that the drinks were really expensive, but that's to be expected in any night club in this area.

I have been to Tao the least out of all the nightclubs in Vegas. This can mostly be attributed to their music format which is the hip hop heavy ""open format"". I am more of an edm\/house music fan so that generally keeps me other places.

I was a winner of an Absolut vodka contest and was able to experience the club from the prime vip area in the middle of the club. Table setup is similar to others albeit the seats are rather worn out. The waitresses were nice and along with the male bartenders, as on top of things as other Tao Group venues. 

My main gripe is that security was letting ladies into the area that did not have VIP wristbands...bottle rats. They were just there to try and mooch off the tables. 

Granted most of us in this section were a part of the free party so it's not like we paid, BUT there is a thing called class that anyone male or female should possess.

This was a great place to go for my very first Vegas club experience.  Got the wristbands online for $50, which came with access to a very short line that took us about 10 minutes to get through (as opposed to the regular line which I've heard can take up to 2 hours).  Best part about the wristbands was the fact that they came with unlimited access to Tao Beach and Lavo for the weekend (although we skipped Tao Beach completely).

Pretty standard stuff once you get inside, and as advertised, there was women in tubs wearing nothing but flower petals and lots of Asian-inspired statues.  Also as advertised, the club was obscenely crowded, and yet, unlike with most other places, ""crowded"" is not necessarily a bad thing.  It was a bit difficult to navigate the top floor, but after a few spins through, everything made sense.

Not sure who the DJ was that night, but he did an okay job, minus the fact that he seemed set on playing ""Like a G6"" as many times as possible through the night and ended up playing it about six times in the course of 4 hours (seriously, eff that song).  They also dropped confetti the one time that ""Party Rock Anthem"" came on.  Pretty cool stuff.  Also, while the dance floor was very crowded, it wasn't too difficult to navigate.  The women were fun and good-looking on this particular night, most were not of the overly stuck up type (nor were they accompanied by muscle heads with spray tans), but of course, I'm sure that this depends on the night.

I've heard that bottle service is the best at Tao, but I think it really depends on whether you know what you're doing.  Our group didn't pay for bottle service here, but a friend of a friend was having his bachelor party here and their group had reserved bottle service in advance.  We joined them later in the night and it was fine, except that the table was located on the first floor in a packed away corner.  If you're going to do bottle service, be sure you get in a good spot or I would have to say that it's completely not worth it.

I'd have to say that I've mostly had less than stellar club experiences, but this was quite easily the best.  Despite the fact that there are literally dozens of other options in Vegas, I would be more than willing to come back here again.  And soon.",1,0,0

I met a promoter that works there at the pool I was at that day.  His name was Darko, if you happen to bump into him definetly tell him you've heard good things and take up his offer.  He told me that I better not show up with just a couple guys, so we showed up with the 2 of us and 5 girls.  Myself and my buddy got hooked up with 2 free drinks each (top shelf long island, please!) and the girls we were with got open bar Kettle drinks until midnight, hard to beat that.

The downside was that this place isn't much of a club, at least on Wednesday.  I talked to the bouncer about it and he said its basically a club only on Friday\/Saturday nights, otherwise usually just a lounge.  Without the free drinks I would have passed the place up, the service was a bit on the slow side.  Took 15+ minutes to get a drink when I had a seat at the bar.

The decor is amazing, I will definately go back and remember to hit this club on a Friday\/Saturday.  However, its a great place to go on Wednesday until midnight for the ladies, have a few free drinks and hop into a cab to Pure, for example.",0,0,0

1. We were led up to Tao Beach at 11PM at night, I do not know why, it was about 40 degrees and I was wearing a hoochy mama dress.
2. By the time we got up to TAO beach, I was too tired to be excited. You try climbing up a million flights of stairs in 4 inch heels!
3. We decided to go back downstairs in which there was another line to get to the stairs that take you down.
4. Another million flights of stairs down. I guess I shouldn't complain - I probably burned off all the bread I had at Grand Luxe 2 hours prior. 
5. We were walking through the crowded dance floor when all of a sudden I felt myself slipping on ice (aren't there supposed to be ppl that clean up this stuff??)...all I could think of was how embarrassing it would be if I fell..so I tried to catch myself a few times but in the end, it was inevitable, and I let myself fall...the slowest fall I have ever endured. I instantly knew my ankle was messed up and had to take my heels off. We walked to a less crowded area and it was there that I realized my knee was dripping blood and my ankle was swollen =( 
6. A security saw and grabbed my hand and took me to the back where there was a paramedic to clean up my knee which had been sliced by something (I think glass)
7. Security made me put my heels back on so I hobbled back to the club to try to enjoy the night. Realizing that there was no way I'd be able to stand in those heels any longer, I took a cab back to the hotel by myself..

Tao was not too overcrowded, music was decent (although no big name for that night). We liked the small balcony for a bit of fresh air, you can also smoke here. Our biggest complaint was that the drinks we ordered were terrible tasting- they tasted like just alcohol.

No, this isn't an error. Yes, Tao is where all the celebs go to party in Vegas. It was also the same restaurant Scott Disick shoved a $100 bill down a server's throat.

However, if you're not a celeb....be prepared for:

- A packed dancefloor
-Lame music.
-Ed Hardy Douchebags.

Okay, seriously. What's it about Vegas and the dresscode for dudes? It's like all of them had a mandatory orientation when they got there telling them they have to look like a busted version of Pauly D. High emphasis on BUSTED, because I love Pauly D. But then again, what do you expect...it's Vegas! So that part can slide.

I must admit when I first went to Tao I was really excited because HELLO it's TAO! I was also excited that a random promoter for the club approached my gals and I for VIP Tix and when we arrived too  late, they let us jump the line. I felt like a SOCIALITE!

The decor is cute, girls getting paid to sit and look hot while they bathe in the rose-petal mini-tubs or mini beds along the wall. The Buddhist theme is cute, however I'm surprised noone's ever complained that it was offensive. The billboards promote this place as a ""religious experience"".

Anywhoo, after being mesmerized by the theme, I was hit with the reality that this place is NOTHING special. The main dancefloor was so packed. No joke. It was like everyone was grinding with eachother. There was really no point in dancing either since the music was whack.

The other room is more spacious, but the music is whack too.

I've been to this club on three different occasions. My first time left a bad-taste in my mouth, the others got somewhat better. The plus about this club is IF YOU'RE A GIRL GET THERE BEFORE 11PM FOR THE OPEN BAR!!!! Okay so basically it's any vodka drink with a mixer but really...who cares? 

I have been here for dinner and it was pretty good. It's pricey but the dining experience is great.

Unless you fancy. My advice for the ladies is to go here to pre-game then hit up the other clubs nearby like XS, Pure, Tryst or Jet. You'll be nice and toasty and you won't have to make the same mistake I did and buy that $18 glass of champagne at the aforementioned clubs.",2,2,2

I was pretty excited my first time going. Me and my four hot girlfriends got in instantly. Bouncers were chill. Didn't have a problem with any of them. My first impression entering was DAMN, this place is dark. I can't see SH*T! How can you tell whose hot or not?! Or if there's a creeper behind me? 

TAO is beautiful inside (even though it's dark), but you can just tell. It was pretty creepy when I was walking through and I saw these two model girls practically naked and fanning themselves. They were like statues, but watching you and the only movement you saw was when they brushed their fan or batting their eyelashes. Creepy, but I guess creative. 

The bathrooms are kinda cool. The doors are glass and you can actually see through it, but when you go inside, the bathroom maid did something, I don't know, I think she pressed a button, and then the glass door started fogging up so you really can't see peeps doing their business inside. So cool. And the girls bathrooms are upstairs which overlooks the club. Gives you something to look at when you're waiting in line. 

The club itself is really stuffy. There were WAY too many people. It's kind of hard to enjoy dancing when people are pushing through you and shoving you left and right. That was one of the main reasons why I didn't like TAO.",0,0,0

Headed over on a Friday night--I suggest you put your name on the guestlist and get there before midnight. It helps, I swear. It also helps to surround yourself with a large number of girls if you're a guy, so thank God we had that cleared. 

First things first: the girls in the bathtubs? They look as if they hate their very existence and spend more time covering their boobies than sloshing about all sexy-like in the water.

The drinks? Please. Laughable at best, extremely expensive (12 dollars for a shot?!), and small!

The music is your basic hip-hop-Top 40 mix, which tells me the club has yet to go super mainstream. There's more to music than Tupac's ""California Love"" or Kanye's rehash.  Tao would be a much cooler place if they mixed it up and threw in some electro.

I will say, however, that the decor is something out of a movie. Over the top, ridiculously artificial, and a bit too overblown for my taste. The huge Buddha staring at you over the dancefloor makes you feel like praying, not dancing.

it has a lot of potential but is a disappointment every time.

They have some pretty cool VIP areas and I love the dark, sexy red decor but they seem to not have a capacity limit and it gets wayyy too crowded\/boiling hot.

When you first enter, there is a side room with bar on the right and THAT is the place to hang out if you want to drink\/boogie a little... the other bars in the place are always way too crazy & crowded - the bouncers are over-protective and the bartenders are overwhelmed. Suit yourself and take a peak into the main room for a sec but then trust me, Its honestly not even worth trying!

The drinks are the normal expense - $15-20\/cocktail - and the crowd is mostly asian, but you can't really expect different from a club called TAO.

The coolest part of the club was the bathrooms. 
The ladies bathroom area is upstairs and they are all individuals that have glass doors. They actually are see through when the door is open and frost over when it shuts.... that's pretty damn incredible if you ask me!

The dance floor is wayyyy too packed to bust any moves and you can't stop for one minute without having a bouncer flash his light at you telling you to keep moving.

The one other fun part I can remember was that if you did have a table in the main room, you could stand up on the top of the bench seats like a makeshift stage and dance - aka no one sweating on\/pushing\/elbowing you - and that was a blast.  Just watch your skirt ladies!

Definitely not worth the price of a cover - or the wait in a huge line - or anything actually... The only time I've ever had a good time here was when we had our own private area and that honestly could have been in any club anyway.

If you're a guy with a bunch of other guys, forget about it.  Go to another place on Yelp and don't even bother reading the reviews.

Being in a group of 5 other guys, your chances are slim to none of getting in.  As other people suggested, you could eat here but I lucked out and had friend that knew one of the bouncers and we were on the guest list.  Even that doesn't help you out that much because there's the enforced girl to guy ratio.  The only way to get in with less trouble is have a 10:1 ratio of girls to guys.  Don't even think about bringing your sausage party over here unless you're willing to pay for a table and bottle service.  I guess it ensures that there's more girls so in theory it's a good trade off but good lord it's harder in practice.

Finding a group of girls should be easy right?  Not so much.  The best thing to do is wait downstairs and ask as they come in so the bouncers don't scare them off which happened to us or have a promoter stealing them from you as he tries to impress them by doing the Soulja Boy dance and ""superman that ho!""

Eye candy in the club is very abundant with girls with flower pasties on their boobs in bath tubs, go-go dancers, and for some reason, girls in lingerie being ""playful"" with each other in beds, not that I'm complaining.

Logistics: 
Security and bouncers rule with an iron fist over here and it's noticeable as soon as you take the escalator up.  This place was way over crowded and that's not an understatement.  Even as a guy, I felt violated just getting through the dance floor downstairs.  The crowd mix was decent with a bit of favoritism towards my fellow Asians.  Drinks were decent but all anyone cares about is getting drunk.  Music was current.  It's dark. Oh, and don't forget that there's another level.  

Overall, it's not a bad place if you have a big group of girls to go with (emphasis on the girls part) and want a big, exclusive place to go to on the weekend.

The people in back of me were screaming at the bouncers to let us out and the bouncers were just straight up rude. One of the people in back of me had to yell out ""hey you SOB just let us out!..yeah you heard me.. what are you gonna do? kick me out of the club?! oh wait.. I think that's what we're all trying to do in this stupid line!",0,4,0

1. We walked in right away because we were put on the VIP list that afternoon. So no charge or wait. BIG plus!
2. Good music to dance to! 

The Bad:
1. So crowded; in fact if you don't have a table, expect to be pushed around

Took us 15 minutes or so to get in.

Once you're in, it's like a lounge downstairs with booths to sit at; plenty of room and a dark atmosphere. The nightclub itself is located upstairs.

Once in, if you walk to the left, you're at TAO Beach and to the right is the nightclub. We walked to TAO Beach and weren't there for no more than five minutes when we were told to leave as they were closed. Really? Why would they close off this area??

So we decided to stroll over to the nightclub and this area was PACKED. And by PACKED, you're bound to bump into people no matter where you walk. The dance floor is small and packed as well. There are A LOT of rude people on the dance floor. They don't care that you're standing there, they'll bump right into you and shove you while you're trying to dance. Only thing you can do, push that mofo back! This happened several times throughout the night to our group.

They also have a  balcony where all the smokers hang out and it has a nice view of the Venetian and the gondolas in their rivers. Packed out here as well.

Overall, nice club but way too crowded and a lot of a**holes.",2,2,2

Fact: Tao is Asian
Fiction: Tao is full of only asians.

My friends were looking to do it up big one night and we called around seeing what sort of deals for bottles we could get as our guy to girl ratio was really bad.  Marquee had kaskade playing so our hook up there said it would be near impossible \/ break your balls expensive to get a table that night.  So, our friend called another connection at tao and got us a great deal.  I won't expand on the extravagance of our alcohol tab but let's just say I am very happy I made it back to my own hotel room that night.

It was my first time at tao and I had a blast, the music was banging and we had a table in a not so hot spot at first.  We weren't complaining as we had just asked for a spot like an hour prior to actually arriving.  But our host told us a spot opened up right on the edge of the dance floor and Shazam we were right in the mix of all the action..

This place is Asian themed, yes there are a lot of asians that go there, but there is quite the mix as well.. It is your typical over crowded, alcohol infused club but you can definitely have a great time there. I know i did. I know everyone thinks Tao is washed up and that XS, Tryst, Marquee, Haze are the spots but Tao is still happenin' and its not a dead beat by all means.

Next time in vegas, Tao better watch out. :)",1,2,2

And I must admit, while I really REALLY wanted to hate it, it wasn't all that bad.  Pretty damn good actually.  See, this is the problem with reviews sometimes - you can't always base your opinion entirely on someone else's, sometimes you really just have to check it out for yourself.  

So I went the normal route for entry, used a VIP pass and maybe waited about 7 minutes before I was let in.  As this was winter and I was smart enough to wear a coat, I went straight to the top level where the ($5) coat check was and got myself situated.  And that's pretty much where I stayed the rest of the night.  

I made some new friends and was able to enjoy their table service, but this is not the only reason why I had a genuinely good time here.  The crowd was lively but it wasn't ass-to-elbows crowded up there...  They had a guy jump up on the balcony with the dancers and TEAR IT UP to Enur's Calabria on the saxophone....  The bathrooms are freakin off the hizzle with the clear-to-opaque door change....  Overall it was just FUN.  I enjoyed the overall atmosphere and decor, and of course the chicks in bathtubs are a nice addition (even if most of their fingertips were pruning and they looked chilled).  And I did buy at least one drink and don't remember being shocked at the $$$, so its obviously comparable to other clubs on the strip (actually, I had WAY WAY more fun here than the 10 times or so I've been in Pure...)

I had a great time here and will definitely be going back again this summer, hopefully this time I will actually see the rest of the club and Tao Beach.   I think since this is one of the more popular clubs on the Strip, it is definitely worth a try.",0,0,0

We get in and pass everyone up which was nice. The ambiance was cool but the place was so freakin packed it was a pain in the ass to get anywhere. We tried to dance! HA ya right!

I would have been pissed if I had waited in line for that club!

TIP 1: when you go to the bathroom, be sure to flip the little switch thingy that frosts the door so people dancing and drinking at the bar don't see you peeing! My friend didn't flip it and people got a show. 

TIP 2: Don't drink to the point where you don't feel well. If security sees you and you like like you are going to puke, they will take you to their drunk tank! I kid you not. This happened to my friend.",0,0,0

First thing is that we made reservations for 9:15pm and had to wait 45 minutes after our reserved time to be seated!!! That was absolutely ridiculous, to be so hungry and have to wait like that. horrible. Finally we ordered an appezitzer of ahi tuna, which we did not even get until we were seated at the table. 

Our tuna appetizer ended up being the best thing I ate all night. It was very good. I got the pad thai as my entree which was $30 and nothing special. You can get better pad thai in Atlanta. The martinis which were $14 were not very good or very creative they just have fancy names and taste like alcohol mixed with fruit juice. We refused to get dessert. I tried some of my friend's orange chicken and the chicken was good but the bok choy that came on the side was the worst I have ever had, and I love bok choy. I tried some other food from my other friends and it was all so blah that I can't even remember what they got. Another thing is the music downstairs is so loud you hae to shout to your fried across the table to be heard. 

Next we went upstairs to the club I refused to buy a drink, and givethat place any more of my money. The dance floors were too crowded, and the girls in the bathtubs, and well as in the glass looked miserable and faking it. Needless to say we left the horrible place within 30 min, and went to Tryst in the Wynn which was awesome!

If you take another left from the first bar you go down the hall and see the reject VIP seating and two girls locked behind the glass. Don't stare too long or the bouncers will come after you.

Overall the main room is tiny and they pack it to the max,  get ready to be touched. The real VIP section is small about 8 sections girls can go in but men get ready to pay the bouncer. Keep in mind if you pay under the table to get in there that means you can dance in the walkway not sit in the seating. Those seats are reserved and they will kick you out. 

Bartenders and staff seem cool but cups are broken and leak everywhere. I think this place is over hyped unless you are completely wasted and want to be smashed like a sardine.  I was hoping to go up to the rooftop but it wasn't open on MLK weekend. Maybe it's a summer thing.",3,1,2

Went here for my 21st birthday, but got here kinda late (12am) on a saturday, surprisingly there wasn't a long line to get in because I have heard alot about this club, well lets put it this way... 
From older people (30-40) I've heard very positive reviews about TAO saying how fun it is, but from people around my age (21-25) they all told me this club sucked lol so I knew I had to make a judgement on my own about this. 

Prices to get in are not bad:
$20 for girls, $30 for guys. Just incase you guys were curious.
My first thoughts walking in, wow this place is reallyyyy nice! the first floor is a restaurant\/ lounge area, and gave me that zen feeling floating around because of all the buddha status. Those were really cool considering i'm very much a fan of Asian themed places, made me feel like I was in a temple converted club if that helps haha but thats just the review for the first floor, lets get to the club...
the club is on the second floor, make sure you're wearing comfortable heels ladies ! The music is reallllly good here, that's if you're into hiphop\/ r&b\/ pop... they don't play too much edm, well on the night I went. The dj on the night I went was dj reflex from LA's radio station kiis fm and wow he was playing alot of good songs people could sing and dance too... so look him up if youre still curious about the music. But although the music was good... MAN,THE PEOPLE... the people are the reason why my review is 3 stars. I'm sorry but this place reminded me of why id rather go to music events than clubs ! So many sloppy obnoxious girls here, and I understand.. everyone's just trying to have fun and drink, but please if you can't control your liquor and then dont drink pls.. it really sad to watch lol or atleast have good friends that'll look out for you ! So many girls just bumping into everyone trying to get in the way... super crowded and i'm sorry but there were so many older people around (30-40) and dont get me wrong, thats not a bad thing lol but its definitely not my crowd. If you're 30-40 or even 50 looking to have a good time, im sure you'll fit right it. 

Recommend this place for older people (ages 30-50) other than not a fun place for 21st bday except if someone is performing of course, then i'm sure that'll be fun.

I definitely like this MORE than Marquee but not as much as XS.

I should preface my review by saying that we had a hookup that walked us into the club. No waiting, and no cover. So that definitely skews my perception in the good way.

I really liked the ambience and decor.  There wasn't a ton of space to DANCE and we spent most of the time kind of standing around and talking (which was great, because it's kind of what we were looking for) and watching the go-go dancers.

Nonetheless, the experience was worth the wait (if I had to).  The bouncers, although strict with the guy:girl ratio, were never less than courteous.

2. Situation of treking up and down the stairs didn't improve after Tao Beach started because it's another long mother 'effin flight of stairs. Yes, I'm going to the club to work out, by dancing, not to feel like I just climbed the Himalayas.  

3. The whole trying to incorporate the ""Asian feel"" into the club is creepy bejeebies with Buddha's face (wait, faces, tons of faces) staring at you while you're obviously sinning in Sin City. 

4. Rope situation outside the club is so confusing, people are always bunched up, as mind as well move the club outside where everyone's congregated and bunched up. 

5. Decor of the place seriously just kills the experience.  Total Asian theme fail.  

6. Different rooms are so far from each other and you'd always have to pass by this long hallway (or what it seemed in my drunken state). I guess most people wouldn't mind since there are naked girls in bathtubs along the way for entertainment.

1)i know if i dont have bottle service i can't sit, but the security was harsh about just leaning ont he wall for just one second for a girl to get breathing\/resting for a second space while i was in there. not cool
2)i had no less than 6 guys make me feel awful by either trying to goose my front, slapping my butt, or barter a free drink for sex. really REALLY not cool.
3)from what my friend who works the vegas circuit says, tao probably had about 4-5 thousand people and it was sooo crowded i felt like most of the time i was trying to wade through mosh pits with better clothes. there were points i had to gently push people and duck and do all other kinds of moves just to get 4 feet over.


aside fromt hat, the women's bathroom upstairs overlooking the club floor was pretty cool. the doors are glass that fog up when you lock the door. very chic and awesome.

Let me start with the atmosphere: Immediately when you walk in, you will see bathtubs lined with flower pedals and candles. Once you walk in and go upstairs to the main part of the club, you will find Buddha statues everywhere (hence the ""religious"" nightlife). But the best part about Tao is the girls scantily clad in nothing but flower pedals dancing around in the bathtubs. Where else do you find something like that??? They also have two girls in the main hallway upstairs who's only job is to lay there and massage each other. If you like looking at pretty girls, this is definitely the place to be. 

Besides the atmosphere here, the music is always good, which is key. If you want to get away from the crowded main dance floor, go into the side room (which is normally where I spend most of my time). There you will find a DJ who spins mostly hip hop (and even throws in some old school stuff while still keeping it classy). My favorite part of the night on my most recent visit was when they got the whole crowd pumped by playing ""I'm in Las Vegas bitch!"" I have heard this at other clubs in  Vegas before, but when they followed it with ""shots,"" I think everyone in the club sang along :)

I always make Tao my number 1 priority when hitting Vegas. I highly recommend Thursday nights there - it's their industry night, which means you get more locals than tourists, and it's less crowded than on a Friday or Saturday. Also, if you eat at the restaurant beforehand, ask your waiter for a stamp and that will get both males & females in for free and no waiting in line. Absolutely unbeatable. If you don't eat here, you can pick up passes from one of the promoters around, but those will only get the ladies in for free. You can also try to get yourself put on the guest list, which will save you from having to wait in line.

Tao maintains a very good girl to guy ratio - If you are a girl or with a group of girls, you will have absolutely no problem getting right in. If you are a large group of guys - good luck. Your best bet would be getting a table, but that can get pricey. As always, make sure you are dressed appropriately - the better you look, the easier it will be to get in. 

I have always visited Vegas in the winter months, so I have always missed out on Tao beach on the third floor, but I hear it's pretty rockin!

Sorry i went off on the bathrooms, but hey that is a very important part of any club.  We went upstairs to tao beach as well, and that place is gorgous as well. Good atmosphere, good music!! Loved this club.
Now minus one star because come on cant a girl just post somewhere without being shoved on all the time. If you do not have a vip section, then there really is no place to just sit down and get off your feet for awhile!! It is horrible, every time you stop just to chill, a bouncer comes along and moves you along!! other than that the club was great!!",0,0,0

NEVER AGAIN!!!
I went back (for a second time) only because I got in for free for open bar.
Never intended to stay here.
But alas, circumstances did not permit that we move on to a better club that night, so we stayed.
The club is gorgeous. Drop dead gorgeous decor, but sadly not pretty enough to redeem this loser of a club.
The music is bad-- hip hop (so last decade) 
I mean, if you wanna play hip hop, fine, but don't play straight hip hop for the entire time. Not everyone likes that!
DJ vice was on after- sort of saved the night, but none of this has anything to do with the 1 star rating.

What pisses me off about this place, is that the owners\/promoters completely disregard any rules about capacity.
On weekends, TAO gets SO full, it's IMPOSSIBLE to make your way to the dance floor without getting into fights\/getting stepped on\/molested\/harassed.
I got in for free- my question to these people: Why on earth do you keep sticking people inside your club? I didn't pay to get in, I didn't pay for the drinks I had, how do you profit by having so many drunken people smashed together in one tiny place?

I tried very hard to have fun, but it was absolutely impossible. Finally at around 1 am some drunken 30+ yr old stepped on me SO HARD that two weeks later I'm still limping and I have a bruise that covers my entire right foot.

I blame this entirely on the owners that have no respect for a person's right to a good night and disregard the safety of everyone inside.

I've gone to massive raves that were WAY safer than this place. 

That one star I'm giving them goes to that one cute security\/bouncer guy who looked after me all night.",2,1,1

With the package you get Red Carpet Photo Op (you use your own camera), Nightclub DJ shout-out along with Cake Pop presentation, Nightclub Twitter shout-Out, VIP Entry,  and a ""I Turned 21 @Tao"" T-Shirt.

We did order the VIP Table & Service which included, and I quote from the check list;
The ultimate VIP treatment - your very own private table for the entire evening complete with cocktail waitress, security, and busser to meet your every need. 

Here is one of the many things that I'm very disappointed in, and feel did not receive all that they promised which our party paid $$$ money for! We could have up to 15 people, we had 13 women. I was told by Gabby whom I had talk to on numerous occasions about the package and details. It is very difficult to book anything with TAO since only Gabby can take the call, and give you quotes and details. I have never been to a night club, nor had bottle service, security...and I was shocked that I'd even need it, but once I talked to Gabby it sounded like a great time and I was very excited for my daughter. Now here I go, my daughter did receive everything that was promised and had a great time, what she didn't know was behind the scene, that I and several other people from our party were the bouncers...people climbing over our seats to dance on a ledge,... we had a very small VIP section that could seat 7 at best (I understand not everyone will sit at one time, but when your feet hurt, and you want to sit for a bit to have a drink from the over priced bottle service) we had 4 men hanging in our small section, and I finally talked to our hostess to let her know, about them and she said ""I thought they were with you"" and then asked them to leave. They kept coming back, and our party had to keep asking them to leave.  The cocktail waitress, did come and set up our bottles and ice and made our first round of drinks, but they never came back. I thought after talking to Gabby that they'd come back and make us drinks when needed. After about 2 hours, I asked my hostess when will the DJ do the shout out (this was around 3:00am) and she said ""oh, it's your daughter's birthday?"" About 20 minutes later, they provided the shout out, and her name on the screen. Meanwhile, another guest in our party, was asking our hostess, bartender, and a security man on the floor about the cake pops that we're part of our package along with the parade of sparklers and flashing lights. About 3:45am, they came out and did make my daughter feel very special, but had a small volcano cake, and had my daughter take a bite out of the top. They then placed it on the table, with no plates, utilizes or anything to serve it with. Needless to say we didn't eat it, and never got our cake pops which is part of the agreement in their check list, and also promised to me verbally by Gabby.

To wrap this up, I called Gabby the next day (party was on Friday night, and we were guest at the Venetian Hotel for 2 nights, which we had 3 suites) and asked if I could meet with her to discusses some of the issues we had. She did meet with me, and a couple of people in our party, and she seemed truly horrified with our experiences, we had some other let downs with our dinner service at Tao Restaurant, which we booked through the 21st package too. She was going to get back to me in 20 minutes after talking to management. The 20 minutes turned into 2 hours, then I texted her and she apologized and said she'd get back to me on Sunday. After I landed back home on Sunday evening at 8:30, I texted her again and said ""Come on Gabby, what's the deal?"" I still didn't hear from her, and had told her I'd like to talk to a manager in one of the earlier conversations. At 9:30pm on Sunday, and exhausted from a long weekend, I texted her again and said how ""disappointed I was in her and Tao for not getting back to me. I was hoping for some money off since we didn't get everything that was promised, and the few people behind the scene including me, didn't get to relax, cut loose and enjoy the evening because we were to busy following up to make sure my daughter got what she was expected, being our own body guards to make sure people didn't take our stuff,  and that people didn't step on us as they climbed over our booth while spilling their drinks on us. After I sent the 9;30pm text stating all of the above, and telling Gabby that I'll have no choice except to write a Yelp Review, she texted me right back saying I should expect a call from Elliot the Operations Manager. He called me back at 10:30pm, listened to all my concerns, offered me a bottle (no thank you) offered me something for next time I come back to Vegas (It's been 15 years since I've been there) but would not offer a few bucks off our 1,600 bill! If you are planning on booking a package through Tao, my advice is DO NOT! It sounds good, but the way they treat their customers is unexceptionable!",7,0,0

On the very expensive side considering its chinese food....$36.00 per person for the peking duck??? in monterey park, that would be crazy talk, like u should be closed down crazy talk...I guess in vegas they follow a different standard than Sam Woo though....

A few positives about the place would be their coconut butterfly shrimp...simply the best i've ever had...such an easy dish to prepare but it was perfect...extra large tiger prawns deep friend with shreds of coconut then a light tangy sauce (not a traditional sweet&sour) .... Orange chicken had white breast in them, didnt make it taste any healthier but it was delicious...mixed veggies dish..skip it, we had it b\/c the girls at the table requested a not entire carnivorous supper...sizzling beef is a safe pick, it was tender with black pepper flavor....Def recommend this place over PF Changs

The perk of dining here is that you dont have to wait in line for Tao night club and it gets you free entrance so that saves another 25.00 per person... they already tapped that onto your meal though so its a wash...overall, it was well worth it, i mean if you go get dinner somewhere else you still have to wait in line for another hour and then pay the entrance fee....something to consider!!!!!",1,1,2

Drinks sucked, too strong & not enough anyway.

Many areas to dance but music was not groove'n for me--& I'm a huge dance freak too.

Topping the horrid downward spiral was this pissy little waitress. I accidentally bumped into her, spilling a bit of her orders on the tray.

We went upstairs and checked out Tao Beach.  The bartenders were pretty delicious looking.  Patron shot number one happened.  Then we headed back down to the club.

The dance floor still wasn't going off yet, so we went out to the balcony, which had a beautiful view of the water below, as well as the Vegas strip.  We went in and started dancing, not too crowded, good times were being had, and then the bouncer asked if I wanted to dance up on the platform.  Done and done, I was up on the platform having a good time with my friends, and I started eye-flirting with the guys in the VIP booth below.  

When it came time to exit the platform, Mr. VIP helped me down the stairs, and before I know it the night became an endless stream of vodka tonics and tequila shots, all courtesy of some dude from New York who had just become president of his company.  Bottles of champagne with sparklers in them also arrived at the table.  

The club was packed wall to wall, but in the booth it was spacious and comfy.  We had our own cocktail girl, as well as our own security guard.

When we were finally able to get inside, I didn't want to be there any more. The rooms they have are small and the dance floors even smaller. This club is honestly all about the bottle service. They make it impossible to get any kind of drinks and they just don't have any standing room at all. The music was ok, but I really expected sooo much from them, being TAO and all.  Also warning to everyone, people can smoke inside so it makes it really hard to breath, because the smoke just hangs in the air. 

Overall I would have to say save your money and time. This is not what it's all built up to be. I'm not quite sure why celebrities think this club is hot. Everything is over priced and the music is ehh....",4,0,0

I have always despised clubs and clubbing. Maybe its the whole dressing up, getting sweaty in a long sleeve dress shirt while dancing, being surrounded by a bunch of sweaty people taking up your air space. Being a guy does not help either because you almost always have to pay a cover charge. I got around that though, since I learned IF YOUR A GUY STAYING AT THE VENETIAN, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY A COVER! JUST LET THEM KNOW! 

NO COVER, SHORTER WAIT IN LINE (there is a line for hotel guests), we walk into the club in a matter of minutes. I even got through with sneakers! Actually one of the guys out front pointed me out BUT I still got in quickly before they could do anything.  

Up to the club we go, as we walk up the stairs. Shit it is packed!!! I had trouble getting drinks all night because people were hanging out all over the place. You want to dance? Forget about it! I could not even move my way onto the dance floor. They did have some good music though, playing old school 2Pac songs, Biggie, Snoop, etc. 

When we were about to leave The DJ goes, ""LETS GIVE IT UP FOR RIHANNA!! WE AINT PLAYING NO CHRIS BROWN SHIT TONIGHT!!"" Good shit. 

We walk back down because we were hot and sweaty from dancing. Some guy almost puked on me! Luckily for the fast reflexes I dodged and got out of the way. He would have gotten a can if he did. 

We walk back down to the lounge area, find a booth to sit on without paying for bottle service. It was actually pretty empty in the lounge area on a Friday night. We danced at just hung out here for the rest of the night.

WHAT: It might be hard to believe, but this is actually one of my favorite local clubs!!! There are many downsides though- lines, getting in, crowds, etc., but aren't all clubs like that??!!

Thursdays are local nights! So everyone with a local ID gets in free!! So don't forget to be there on time (usually by 9pm to get in the club first). There is usually an open bar for ladies from 10-11pm!! Mixed house vodka drinks!!

Fridays & Saturdays are the busiest nights!! The crowds are usually OFF-THE-HOOK, but the thing is, tao likes to pack the club to its maximum capacity! So there may be some annoyance there. They just keep letting people in, to the point where you just want to give up and leave! (I've done that a couple times, because noone likes to be pushed and shoved around!)

On a brighter note, music is great!! They have every type of music!! There is the main room, and a smaller room (where they usually play hiphop & all that jazz).

Dinner was ok, overpriced but the food was decent. I wanted to have some pictures to remember this by so I had my camera with me. 

If you have dinner at the restaurant you get free admission to the club part, you still have to stand in line to have your ID checked.

Our turn in line comes they check our IDs and then one of the bouncers said that they want me to check my camera at the coatcheck.  I asked why, and all I got was ""I can't have the camera in the club"" - nowhere did it say that, and everyone was taking pictures with their smart phones.  So I walk over to the coatcheck and the guy there said they don't take camera's - great. Finally had to hide the camera in one of the girls bags and sneak in.

We came in, ordered drinks, about 10 minutes later we and several other people were asked to give up our couch and seats because the section ""wasn't full enough"" and they are closing it off.   All this with an attitude as if they are doing us a favor for allowing us to be there at all.  Meanwhile, there is a good size line outside the club.

i ordered the fillet mignon black pepper, and my friends ordered orange chicken. and another dish. got my order expecting a steak but it was stir fry with green beans and pieces of meat. honestly i felt like i was eating something made by a stir fry 101 class for beginners.  everyone else's food tasted like panda express, they gave us stamps to get into a line to get another stamp to enter the club

so as far as i knew there were only 2 parts to this club once you go up the stairs you have a choice to go to the left which had hip hop or to the right which had party rock, soo we picked the left sided area, all i gotta say is that tao is useless unless you come planning to get bottle service cus if you don't have bottle service you will be left dancing in the aisles and having the workers constantly pass you bringing bottles to the tables.... and every 2 mins there would be people with flashlights checking dress code. also, jager bombs were $16 shots were around 12 and watered down... so yeah....",1,0,0

-i suggest booking your bottle service with a promoter and not with Tao staff. Originally we booked with Tao directly and I had to negotiate down to $1,100+ service= $1,400 for 2 bottles of Grey Goose (for 14 girls). Though that may have originally been for the lower level vs the upper level where we ended up, I don't know. Miraculously we ran into a promoter in Vegas who instead got us a $450 bottle with 1 free bottle, totaling $700 after service. The area where our table was located (upper level) had this great elevated space at the back of the booth where we danced all night. 

The venue- 
-Very loud DJ, your ears will ring the next day, but this is to be expected. 
-AMAZING special effects from lasers to confetti to this bubble\/foam sprinkling down, to mostly naked Asian models bathing in rose petal tubs..
-Throughout the night there were a few DJ's spinning house music, some better than others.
-The dance floor is extremely packed so overflow goes into the bottle service areas. Women who had been let in for free with bracelets pushed through our section and butted up against our table- too packed. At one point I couldn't get back into our section because it was so full. Excuse me??? We have a table unlike these 100 bitches standing around in my section.
-It's a very young crowd here with A LOT of women. Didn't see attractive men in their 30's, I have to be honest. Also, some guy tried to snatch one of our iphones IN OUR SECTION! We had him kicked out of the club.
-Okay, back to the good. Our bottle service was attended to well. We never ran out of mixers and we were checked on regularly.",6,1,3

Not too big on covering clubs but my experience here was unique as I had people I didn't know wanting to sit and enjoy a few friends who joined me but I thought paying for bottle service perhaps they should tip me for taking a seat.. Lol -

I had the fun of watching dancing Barry (don't know his name in real life) but he was the center of attention believe it or not.  He was a dancing machine, off beat but fun.  Reminded me of an intolerable, yet flexible work trying to survive one beat after another while sweating profusely.  He was definitely an attention grabber whether positive or negative he was hated by men, but adored by women.

I just flew into Las vegas, had a nice dinner with friends from out of country that I haven't seen in a very long time.  Then we decided to go to the night club that was in our hotel the Venetian.  I believe it was around 3:00AM when something terrible happened.  A random dude comes out of nowhere and punches me in the back of the head.  At the time I was dancing with my friends on the dance floor.  I was not in anyone's way and wasn't even interacting with anyone outside my group.  So the punch hit's me in the back of my head and my glasses.  So I look at the guy that did this to me and ask him ""What the fuck are you doing?""  and he just says ""Fuck you blah blah blah"".  Then the bouncers come out of nowhere and grab ME!!! NOT HIM! BUT ME!!! forcefully as if he assumed I was the one who started the commotion.   I was guilty of giving a man a finger but only after I was assaulted and lost my glasses.  

As I was being grabbed and pushed backwards outside some side exit I try to tell the bouncer who has his vice grip on me that I did not do anything and that I am blind without my glasses (I'm -7.5 in both my eyes) and I need to get my glasses.  He ignores me and when we are outside acts like he does not give a single fuck about what I am saying.  Again I repeat to him for the 5-6 times that I really need my glasses and I would gladly leave the premises ASAP if they would just let me look for my glasses.  

He continues to ignore what I am saying until he pushes me outside.  He the asks for my ID.  So I give it to him.  In my mind I assume he was filing some kind of incident report (but this was not the case since I called back the next day and there was no evidence of the incident happening according to management\/security).  So why did he take my name down?  Why did he need my id?  

Then the bouncer has the audacity to blame me for his broken watch, like really?  How could that have been when I did not resist you and you had my by both my arms so tight that it left bruises on my body.  Yes people bruises, and yes I do have pictures.  I was shocked that he would handle someone so fiercely even though I did not assault anyone nor threatened him in anyway.  
So I tell him I didn't do shit to your watch and I really need to get my glasses.  Another bouncer comes in and tells the bouncer who threw me out of the club for being hit in a head by someone else to go look for the glasses.  That bouncer leaves and the other bouncer says something like ""we are trying to run a business and we are trying to end this disturbance...."" So at this point I was really angry.  I continue to explain what happened and that I really need my glasses since this is the 1st night of my vacation and not having sight really puts a jam on things.   Talking to this guy proved useless much like the last bouncer.  
So the bouncer that threw me out comes back after 3-5 minutes of ""searching"" for my glasses and says I'm shit out of luck.  They get my number and escort me out of the club and simply say ""if we find your glasses, we will contact you.""  So end of the night, nothing happens to my attacker and I lose sight and I don't get so much as a sorry for the bouncer's behavior.  

So I later that night I file a report with the Venetian Security.  There was supposed to be a representative from Tao present at the time of the incident but I was told by the Venetian front desk that they will not be coming.  More proof of zero fucks given by Tao security and management.  

I call the next day to security office and I file a report supposedly with one of the girls there, since there was no report failed from the next before.  They say they will send a email to the ""Director Victor"" who runs the show at Tao.  I am told I can only have someone from Tao email him because it is impossible to reach this ""Director Victor"" by any other means.  Really?  Really?  Okay let's just believe in that bullshit.  They did ask me what kind of outcome I would like to see happen.  I mentioned my trip is essentially fucked so that was worth a couple of thousand to me and my glasses was worth around six hundred but I did repeat multiple times that the money is not as important to me as getting my sight back.  

So a day goes by I call them again and again I ask them to contact ""Director Victor"" by email since there is no other way he communicates.  More days go by..  no answer.  So I'm back in NY now and still no answer after a couple of weeks.  
So ""Director Victor"" thank you for making Tao so memorable for me.  They way your people conduct security and the way you do business is something I will keep near and dear to my he",28,5,2

PLACE: 
Located in Venetian Hotel , decor is rundown .crowded and very very small dance floor , same problem in TAO Beach , so tiny and you cant barely move. 

VIP seating is not even worth it because the stairs and the aisle occupy more space than the dance floor.  Too many GRANADE you know what I mean . Crowd are its either older men or GRANADE girls in a very mini skirt . 

Music is so so ... When lights get bright you can see how many people are bored in the music.

bathroom is located downstair , YING is for female and YANG is male. if you cant still figure out check the statue , the ladies bathroom statue has breast.

And too much grizzly chicken and two o'clock beauty queens. 

SERVICE:
I came here friday night! Line was not bad at all . line get pretty busy at 10:30 to 11:30 but after that no more line. 

Security are pretty linient but vibe is pretty down . Hostess looks so tired , you kinda feel the negativity is very contagious.

The girls dancer of Tao is not even fit, when shes dancing and her stomach sticking out , i just lost my complete appetite. I am used to Miami night clubs dancer who works at their clubs are pretty fit. "" must be  because of the buffet vegas ""

Music :The music they play is so old and and they just kept repeating it . never coming back again!

TIPS:
* if you eat in their TAO Asian Bistro and order main entree you get free pass in the night club. nightclubs is located upstairs. they will stamp you after your dinner but you still need to get in the line outside and get another stamped , that is a bit strange system . but since theres is no line after dinner it's alright . 

* But i will not recommend this place for night club experience this is more touristy.",7,7,3

However, the club has become so overhyped that it is always freaking packed beyond capacity.  Having a good time here solely depends on: 1. if you're drunk enough to not care about people all up in your breathing space, 2. enjoy the sweat off somebody else's forehead on you, 3. don't mind spending about 10 minutes to walk up about 20 steps, or 4. don't mind dying of sweat without even hitting the dance floor. Yes, it was TOO hot and crowded for this old timer.

Nonetheless, it is still a beautiful club. The DJs weren't spinning anything out of the ordinary, yet, still did a good job of keeping the floors rockin. As far as pricing, it all depends on who you're with and who you know. Ladies can pay up to nothing at a place like this and fellas only have to drop a a bill or two to keep the night going. 

Overall, it's ok. Will I come back? Only if I'm forced to.",6,3,5

This place incites such rage in me that I don't even... My phone, my debit card, and my room key was stolen in the dance floor here.. so just shows you what kind of people this place attracts.

To be fair, I'll try to review this place outside of that event. 

minus 1 star: The dance floor is crowded and packed. People are pushing and touching. Say goodbye to personal space. You can't even call it a dance floor, it's more of a dense conglomeration of sweaty bodies, pushing and just standing. 

minus 1 star: I enjoy hip-hop BUT the music was horrible in here. It's not hip hop you can dance to at all. The hip hop in local clubs are definitely better.

minus 1 star: The floor plan seemed like it was designed by a three year old with a crayola marker. A really good place to lose one of your drunk friends or to disappear. (that could be a positive I guess)

minus 1 star: The bathrooms are SMALL. There were lines going out for one and the other one with less people had about three stalls. 

minus 1 star: The bar was so slow, not the bartenders' fault, the place was just way too crowded. I had an Adios. It tasted like cold rubbing alcohol, and it didn't even get me buzzed.",1,2,0

Left the main dance floor and hit the reserved area to find someone at a table to enjoy there bottle service, we did and that killed about 1 hour and got liquor in us, because no free drink tickets were given out here!! even tho i PAYED 20.00 dollars to get in! 
Around 2 am the dance floor cleared some and we were able to hit the main floor. The club closed at 4:30 am so you can just imagine how many people were still left.

Tao is one of the big nightclubs in Vegas.  It's got it's pitfalls but in my opinion is still great.  The absolute worst thing about Tao is the crowds.  At it's peak, Tao is packed.  The dance floor is just a mass of people and the bars are 5-7 people deep.  Being a big club Tao is extremely popular but that works against it too.  I understand there's a big demand to get in but they just let too many people in.  It gets really uncomfortable by the time midnight hits.  You literally can't move.

The only times I've been there have been when a friend had bottle service so the crowds weren't a huge deal.  If you goto the smaller room on the second floor the crowd is manageable.  The main room on the second floor is ridiculous.

They try to ease up on the crowding by opening up Tao Beach on the roof but as if the club itself wasn't hot already, Vegas on a summer night can be worse.  Even with all that, Tao is still a fun place to head to.",0,0,0

-Get there early.
-buy a table.
-be a woman (in a group)
-be hot (male or female)
-don't wear sunglasses (the guy next to me)
-don't wear a hat (they mentioned that)
-wear single color DRESS shoes ($100+ is a safe bet, again, guy in front of me) 
-don't be ugly or have facial growths (guy behind me)
-stay at the hotel to be on the ""guest list""
-look like a fratboy tool looking to get some puddy.

We were looking to have a great meal followed by some nightlife in their club afterwards.  After spending a good amount of money on a good dinner, we were given free entrance into their nightclub which was nice.

Next we had our hands stamped and were instructed to head over to the entrance line.  This is where our experience was terrible.  We were treated very unprofessionally by their security staff.  We were yelled at and criticized for entering the wrong line.  We were not being unreasonable, nor argumentive, and had no drinks at this point.  The security\/line personnel were extremely non customer service oriented.

As a business owner myself, I understand the importance of customer service, and I know working security must be frustrating at times.

I just like Tao better than any of the other clubs in Vegas because there's just so much to see besides the people.  If I wanted to people-watch, I'd have strolled around the Strip.  There are mini-shows going on all over the place, people dancing on wall crevasses that you never even noticed before, half naked chicks floating in water, and... well.. just... keep your eyes peeled.

Music:  Mainly hip-hop and top 40s music.  Nothing too weird.  Can feel like you are listening to the radio but it is always fun to dance too.

Dancefloor:  Tiny ass floor and usually you end up feeling like cattle being herded.  I don't know how many times I have been stepped on in Tao.  One of my friends refuses to come here anymore because it is so packed here.

Drinks:  I usually get free drinks with the bracelet that the promoter gives us.  Ladies drink free before midnight?  I forgot.  But we usually get tons of drinks... makes the night fun.

Was the night club me and friends decided to go to on a saturday. I was surprised to see how packed it was. We arrived at around 11:30ish or so and it was still extremely packed with long lines. I was a bit worried that we weren't going to get in! But we did. 

What I hate about this club was that I had to pay $30 to get in, girls get in for free, even though I was on the guest list. The club inside was like none other though. Venue was very nice. Lots of ladies and gents. 

Another thing I did not like was how packed this place was. The dance floor was so packed, there is no way that you can really ""dance"". People were all shoved around and I spilled my AMF that I bought(which was expensive as hell. Around $13-$16?). By 2-3, it was still packed. This place stops poppin at 3ish, when the clubs about to close.

So what I liked: two dance floors, ladies, three. DJ's were alright, not the best but kept me goin for awhile. restroom was nice, which is a plus. Lots of asians... Dancers were HOT HOT HOT.

OVERALL: I'd give this place another GO when I am back in vegas. Hopefully by the end of this month. But I'd like to check out other places if I can, but I would definitely keep this place in mind.",0,0,0

The restaurant gets my 3 stars-it's really very hard for me to find any mei fun on this side of the country, and it was absolutely DEVINE. Sooo good.
Waiter was very attentive and our drinks were constantly refreshed. I was never thirsty.
Yes, overpriced. 
The ambiance is great and the music super loud.
We made a reservation about a week before arriving in Vegas, and had to change it last minute, as we were arriving later than expected. They accommodated our change with no hassle.
For those wondering how to get past the line..eat at the restaurant. You go right in, eat, and then you get access to the club with zero wait, and no cover charge.

Ok so the club gets a big fat MEH from me.
It was seriously over crowded. I kept wondering if a fire broke out, or a fight or any instance where I may need to run for my life, my chances for survival were zilch. I could not move at all. It was sooo insanely crowded.
The music in the main room was awesome but forget enjoying actually dancing. Not possible.
After 90 min, we high tailed out of there. I'd had enough of being elbowed and pushed.
I think sardines have more room in their can than we did (are sardines even sold anymore)?! Anyway..forget it.
The female bathrooms are cool in the club, because you get your own room-HOWEVER, you have no paper towels in there, so you have to touch the nasty handle and get towels in the hallway?? eww. so gross.
I balled up a few squares of TP just to get the door open. Just seems very unhygienic.",0,0,0

Since we were staying in the hotel we only had to wait a minute to get in. The night was set to be a great one because Bruno Mars was performing.  The night went from great to crap in a short period of time. The club did nothing to control the crowd and what was fun one minute became a bunch of angry people pushing on the dance floor. The situation got so out of hand my phone ended up being stolen and my license went missing. The bouncer saw that I was upset and told me to take a business card and to call the next morning at 9am, which was mirrored by the woman at the front. When calling the next morning I was given two different times to call and by the third time I called they told me their security staff didn't even get in until 2 PM. I physically went back at 2 and requested the lost and found log. The woman barely glanced at the sheet when she told me Nothing was turned in. 2 weeks later a Good Samaritan mailed my license back, and when we spoke she said her phone had been stolen as well at he same club. The staff did nothing to help her. Sounds to me like this club is either being targeted by thieves or they have a shady staff that likes to pocket lost and found items. My advice is to stay away from this one. You'll either get trampled or robbed!!!",1,0,0

It was fun for about 10-15 minutes and then it stops. Why? Because it gets overcrowded and theres a ton of people pushing and shoving to get by. People were nice about it when they are trying to get through but it was getting a bit too ridiculous. I was literally getting shoved and knocked all over the place.

It was a pretty fun night and was overall good, though the club got SUPER crowded.  The main dancefloor was so packed that we could hardly move in there at all.  I just felt like I was trapped in the middle of a bunch of sweaty sardines or something.  That definitely wasn't very fun.  But the club is pretty big and there are a couple dancefloors that you can go to.  
The last time we went, we actually happened to be there the night of Kim Kardashian's bachelorette party, and it was there.  So we got to see the Kardashians (bfd... I couldn't really care less).  
What was cool about that night was that we both got in for free (my bf and I).  We were walking around in the Venetian earlier that evening and I decided to go up to them and ask them to be put on the guest list.  We got on the guest list and also got free drinks before 11.  
We got dressed up, got there, and hung out on the roof, near the pool area.  It was a pretty nice place and we just lounged around on their sofas and pillows.  I got free drinks until 11 but for my first drink, I actually got charged.  I forgot that I could get a free drink.  And even though I had my wristband visibly on, they failed to mention that my drink was free.  I got a free drink for my second drink.  And then I went back up to them and asked for a refund for my first drink and after some talking with the manager, I got another free drink for my boyfriend.  I guess that was an ok refund?... :-\/

We left the restaurant and got in line for the club. First of all, someone had puked and they were in the process of cleaning it up. Gross!

Once we got inside, you could barely move. If you tried to stop just take a breather or take in the surroundings, the bouncers would bully you into moving again. There appeared to be someone famous there, but neither of us got a good look at him. The only place you could stop was the ridiculously tiny balcony off the dance floor. We didn't even bother to get drinks.

1. I am assuming that bottle service would be highly recommended here as every other bar in this nightclub is packed and if your tits aren't sticking out over the bar good luck trying to get a drink.
2. If you don't have VIP or bottle service reserved for Tao, you will be thrown in with the rest of the sweaty, nasty perverted sardines of this club. People are pushing and shoving you everywhere you go, trying to get into the middle of the club to dance. One girl even spilled her drink on me and said ""oops, it happens."" even though she was f*cking rude as hell and literally put all her body weight on me... this review isn't about her it's about Tao, but that did hinder my experience quite a bit.

Tao DOES however, have an awesome ambiance and the lighting and set up of the club is AWESOME. I just personally don't like to be pushed and shoved around in a nightclub where every five minutes someone is trying to get by you and you can't even dance. 

The drinks were also very expensive.

If you like crowded, loud, high adrenaline clubs, go here.

One huge downside at Tao is the limited space filled with guys who want to grope you. In the winter months, there is no outside space (except for the smoking patio that's as big as your average balcony). 

The dance floor has bubbles that come down when the party gets going... that's my one +. Otherwise, it's crowded. No one cares if they're stepping on you or shoving you. The music is alright, a pretty good mix of hip-hop, top 40 and electro. But really, who doesn't have decent music in Vegas?

So as of late, house music has been taking over all of the most popular clubs in Vegas & LA.  Tao will also advertise a house DJ every once in a while.  And don't get me wrong, I like *good* house music well enough - in moderation.  But when it gets so bad that you have to go to the hoodest of hood clubs just to get some hip-hop music - on any day of the week... that's when I really started to appreciate Tao.

Tao is just as big as the other top clubs in Vegas and in the summertime, they open up Tao Beach upstairs.  I have always liked the multi-level setup at Tao because they have multiple DJs, which means more than one music option.  In my opinion, the main drawback to Tao is that the main dance floor with the go-go dancers is way too crowded unless you have table service (the hip-hop room at Marquee has the exact same problem).

But, if you go to the other room on the second floor, there's enough space to dance.  And with the DJs that were performing at Tao the last time I went, I could finally DANCE - not just spaz around to house music.  I loved the DJ, who was obviously from the bay (he played Black & Orange).   He went on for over an hour playing West Coast hip-hop, with a good half hour segment of hyphy.  This kind of music may not be for everyone, but it's definitely for me =)

So overall, I think Tao deserves 5 stars.  They've been around for a little longer, so if you're all about the hype and the crowd, maybe you won't be as satisfied.  But if you want a good, well-balanced mix of hip-hop, top 40, and electronic music in Vegas - I recommend Tao.",6,5,5

The first time I went, my friend\/promoter had confirmed me on the guest list. However when I got there, the guest list worker rudely told me I was not  on the list. I argued with him and offered to call my promoter, but he let me and my group go to a separate line instead. When I asked if we were still being charged cover, he snottily replied that he was doing me a favor by putting me in the line, since I wasn't even on the list. I guess I appreciate that he didn't just throw me out of line, but still, have some class and treat clients with respect. His attitude and behavior is a reflection of the company he works for, and I did not rate it positively.

It's usually on your list of things to do in Vegas, you know you will see some tacky shit, but you will also probably enjoy it and be glad you did it. Much like traveling in general, it all depends on who you are going with and what mindset you are in. 

I personally had a blast. I was with a small group (5) and because we were staying at the hotel we waited in a line that moved pretty fast. We went around 1030 and waited maybe 10 minutes in line. We got in no problem, no trouble from the door guys. Guys were $20 cover and girls were free. People were dressed up and looked good, but it wasn't quite as formal as I thought it would be (then again, I'm from Manhattan). 

Yes, there are girls in bathtubs filled with rose petals. Yes, there are go-go dancer type people. Yes, the balcony is crowded and filled with tons of smokers. Yes, it is a little tacky - red decor, buddhas, and bamboo looking accents. Yes, the drinks aren't cheap. Yes, there are a lot of bachelor\/bachelorette parties going on. 

But here's the thing - I think it works. It's got all the right elements: Good DJs playing a mix of top 40s, EDM, and the occasional classic throwback. There are a LOT of bars, and I never waited more than a minute or two to get drinks. People are definitely down to dance, friendly and fun but not overstepping. We had a blast and partied til 430. It may not be as new as XS or Marquee, but it's definitely a good time! 

Tips
-Go early if you can. Standard club etiquette I suppose, but this solves a lot of problems. 

-Dress up! Girls were wearing really short and tight dresses (e.g. Herve Leger style) and guys were mostly wearing nice jeans, button downs\/blazers and loafer-type shoes. It's Vegas! You can't be 'over dressed' :) 

-Make sure you get in the right line. There is a line for hotel guests, for non-hotel guests, and if you are all girls, you can basically just walk right up to the doorman (sorry boys!). A note on all guy groups - they let the all guys group in behind us right away... but maybe on the weekend if you are a group of all guys, I'd recommend finding a few girls in the line to pair up with and trying your luck in a better ratio than all bros.",4,0,0

With that said, this place is phenomenal once you get inside the doors and take the staircase to the actual club.

However, six months later I found myself not as impressed as before. Why? 

My experience the second time at TAO was just dull. The DJ's choice of music was quite strange at times... from rap to trance to some weird jazz mixed with trance. Wouldn't it be obvious to change the song when everyone at the club stopped dancing? The atmosphere just wasn't as fun as before. It's as if the spark has disappeared.

We'd  been walking up and down the strip when one of  the many club marketing guys gave us an assortment of club vouchers for open bar and free entry into the hottest clubs of that night.  After a full day of eating, walking, the spa, and more walking and shopping, we decided while having a sundae at Serendipity 3, that we'd go to TAO.   

(Jessie put us on the guest list!)

Originally, we were supposed to have gotten there earlier (9:45) to get in first and hang around a little bit, but with dinner on the other end of the Palazzo (went to Morel's for some good wine,) my friend and I walked back to TAO by 10:30pm.  Even though we were on the guest list, we had a to wait a little bit in the ladie's only line but that was fine.  It was a great time to take some more pictures of our hott night!  Getting in felt like we were being rounded up like cattle... but we got in!  Upstairs was for those with wristbands and up we went.  

The place was packed! Lots of different rooms\/bar areas\/ and go-go dancers who actually knew how to dance (and were pretty) all around.  The only downer about this place was that their coat check wasn't available until midnight.  Until the restaurant closed, the coat check wasn't available til then.  (Fraking sucked! Had to carry our jackets everywhere we went.)   

Regardless, my friend and I finally found a nice spot (by a couch where we could place our jackets) and dance without abandon.  Some really sweet guys came up and danced with us literally 5 minutes in finding our spot and we had a grand time.  Too bad they ""left to go get drinks,"" they missed out on having a great time with two hott ladies!  It was all fine with me anyway.  Our 24-hr Vegas trip was almost done, I had to drive all the way back to the O.C. the same night.  We left around 2am and got home at 5:30am.  All in all, I'm glad we chose TAO over LAVO and  Bellagio's The Bank.  This Vegas trip compared to the summer trip I made last year in August, was definitely the best fun I've had in awhile.  And that time, my group had stayed for 4 days!  This place was awesome!  Definitely coming back here to start up the night--- until the next time --- I'll be dancing up a storm in downtown Long Beach!

Notes:  

Ladies--dress to impress!
Bring a small bag rather than a huge purse.
Unless you're coming here by 12am, don't bother to bring your coat.  Coat check opens at 12am.  So anytime before that, you'll have to lug the thing around.

This was my 2nd time at Tao (my 1st time, not being so good).  

Now I've partied all over four continents so I do have a point of comparison.  Let me just say that TAO SUCKS JURASSIC BALL SACK!!  

There's more to a club than fancy décor and cute girls and yes it was packed; guess what, plenty of other clubs in Vegas can boast that.  

So we got to the club in costume and witnessed the total unorganized mob scene where the bouncers stand out in front and take bribes.  We had a package with Sienna and got escorted in by their hostess (good company).  Once in, I immediately get berated by some bouncer, telling me to put my mask up (I was wearing an Obama mask for my costume).  Apparently they didn't want anyone wearing masks in their club (or they were democrats).  What??  Is this not a Halloween party?  Without the mask, my costume was unrecognizable and pretty useless...of course no mention of this policy on their website.  

We make it out to the main level which is filling up fast.  First off, no sign (literally) of anything having to do with Saw IV so I don't even know why they mentioned it.  Next we ask a bouncer where we sign up for the costume contest...one idiot sends us upstairs, another one sends us downstairs...clearly these people are even more confused than the mob.  We sign up at a table where two very cynical people are handing out contestant numbers...they give us a supposed time when everyone is to be called up for judging.

Meanwhile I notice that the roof\/pool area is closed (two times in two visits).  I politely ask another bouncer why the roof is closed and my answer was, ""BECAUSE IT IS!""  Geeze, what an as*hole.  Found out later that they closed it for the ""winter"" even though its nearly 80 degrees outside.  And once again, nothing about the roof being closed on their website...funny, every other club had theirs roofs\/patios open.

Still trying to enjoy myself; having a lot of fun with other folks who are dressed up and generally having a good time.  Everyone is looser when wearing silly getups.  So my costume turned out to be pretty popular and I posed with a lot of people for pics...ONLY to be pulled aside by yet another black-jacket storm trooper who threatened to throw me out if I put my mask back on again.  Starting to get really pissed at this point.  

Now comes the contest time...  WTF??  NO calls, no judging, no audience participation...  A couple of hand chosen (back room) candidates were walked out on to the balcony and declared winners.  HUH?  What is up with this place?  I've seen fairer elections in Nicaragua.  

Sooo...  After finishing my last $15 drink, we decided to give Tao the finger and look for another venue.

Cover - Ridiculous 
Patrons - Most people were pretty cool
Bouncers - Total Dicks!
Bartenders - No problems
Drink Prices - Outrageous!

I've been here a couple times over the years. It's cool for a Vegas night club. Most clubs seem to have some kind of unique go-go dancer. Tao has their lovely flower-petal girls, who are seen semi-dancing while sitting in a bathtub. I say semi-dancing because all they really do is move their upper body while they sitting down. Sometimes there are two girls to a tub. It's definitely interesting to see.

The dance floor is a big square that's in the middle of the room. During peak hours it gets really packed and there is no balcony to get a breather outside unless you go to Tao Beach up top. The lightening is also too dark and dim for a main dance floor. Maybe that's just the mood of the place, but I'd prefer to see who I'm dancing with.

The space around the bar near the dance floor is always packed too. I like going to the bar located off to the side, in a little more private area where it's lit with bright blue lights. My friends and I grabbed a couple drinks at the first bar for our ladies, then ending up going to this blue lit area to dance because there was way more room to move. That corner was more fun for us because we had more freedom to move and hear one another.

Going up to Tao Beach is suggested because it gets way too stuffy inside. If you're going with girls or you happen to meet girls, you'll get that chance at sitting in your own cabana, which is what happened during one trip I took. I have some good memories of this place and met some really cool people here as well. I've only been here during their busiest nights (Fridays and Saturdays) so I'd like to see how this place on a weekday.

The owners want to cram as many VIP tables in the smallest space, and the security is told unless people are ordering drinks, they are in a walkway, and have to move, there is limited facilities.  This place knows the numbers, and they don't care about your clubbing experience.

It gets packed like sardines up at Tao and by 1am there's no room to breathe. The trick is to go up! Start climbing on tables, and rails, and high platforms - there you can have room to move.

Came here using Palazzo's Winter in Venice deal.  Did the same thing last year and was able to go straight into the club, no hassle whatsoever.  I showed the same voucher this year and was sent into the GA line.  Okay let me just say one of the appeals of this deal at all is not having to wait in a line and being able to go straight into the club.  That being said, it was still free admission for me and two buddies of mine so there's not much I can complain about there.  The deal did promise a free drink voucher though, which they did not uphold because ""they ran out.""  To get a drink voucher I would have had to exit the club and ask the bouncers.  Ended up just passing on the free drink voucher.

TAO had DJ Politik playing that night, on 11\/29.  Typical Top 40 hits, didn't really enjoy it as I was waiting for Sultan and Ned Shepard at XS on Saturday night (EDM).  How people can dance to or enjoy Wrecking Ball is beyond me...

Drinks are cheaper here than they are at other clubs.  Still very expensive, but the bartender was very cute and that's always a good thing.  Ended up spending more than I would have liked buying drinks, and this was very clear to me towards the end of the night when the bartender stopped in the middle of tending the bar to shake my hand.  I was pretty flattered at the time but now thinking back that probably just meant I had spent a lot of money (which I had) or that I tipped to her liking (read: generously), which I believe I also had.

Even though a lot of the club was closed off, TAO still tried to give the night one of those memorable feels by giving out those light up styrofoam wands.  They also spared no expense on glitter... my friend had found glitter in places that you can't (don't want to) imagine while showering after the club.  There was also a girl spinning around in the sky for an entire song, which I can only imagine to be very dizzying, but that was pretty awesome too.  Finally, there was a guy dressed up in tiny mirrors, including a spherical helmet made of mirrors, that came out on one of the better songs.  They directed lights on him so he was shining and dancing throughout the song.  His head resembled a disco ball.

I was thinking about giving TAO 3 stars this time but then I remembered how much fun I had.  Sure, it's not as amazing as it used to be, but it's still a lot of fun.",3,2,0

So the only people inside were fellow employees of the California company my husband works for. Thus, it wasn't overly crowded.

The decor is unique, yet most side rooms are dimly lit, with the exception of the main dance floor room.  In there you will find two separate bars and lots of seating alcoves at various eye levels to the dance floor.  The red-bulbed chandeliers give off a nice glow and complement the comfortable sofas.  

We had numerous friendly wait staff strolling around with lots of appetizers and unlimited free drinks.  The appetizers tasted great, but the drinks were ridiculously watered down.  Even so, we never had to wait long for a server to come back to our seating area, and they would often bring us two drinks each at a time.

When the catered dinner arrived, it tasted as good as it smelled.  I'm assuming it was made in Tao's kitchen downstairs.  Everyone enjoyed plated dinner while the DJ kept the music going.

The last two hours or so, people enjoyed dancing on a non-crowded dance floor and relaxing outside on the terrace overlooking The Strip, always enjoying the unlimited free drinks.  This outside terrace is probably one of the best views and places to actually converse with friends as the inside rooms are extremely loud.

The experience at Tao Nightclub was fun, but even so, I was somewhat underwhelmed by the generally small interior size of this venue, considering it is called a Vegas ""mega club.""  We would not choose this nightclub to party at if it was the usual open-to-the-public crowded night.",0,0,0

The music was mostly rap\/hip hop\/pop remixed by the DJ. The crowd was slightly older (late 20s\/early 30s) and the dance floor was directly upstairs from the restaurant.

- nice decor
- nice Vegas view from outdoor balcony
- music decent, DJ's good
- good location in a prime hotel

Negatives:
- cover high relative to experience you receive
- Security personnel EXTREMELY rude, pushy, threatening & generally obnoxious
- small dance floor, relative to crowd admitted in
- extreme & uncomfortable crowding (I would say overcrowding)
- lifeless bar staff (I know it's hard work in a crowded club, if it drains you, well, maybe consider another career)

I have worked in and visited many nightclubs all over the world of all sizes, styles\/flavors etc. in various capacities and I as I bullet-pointed above there were a few positives, however, I will not return to this club and I would not recommend it to anyone. That is unless they re-train the staff in general professional manners or replace them with folks with manners already in place or.... re-name the club ""Prison"", that way the security ""Gentlemen's"" general attitude would make sense.

Friends and I decided to get a drink and go to the 3rd level. OMG, Tao Beach is awesome. It's open and theres fresh air and you can see the pool. You can't go into the pool though :( The crowd up here seems more friendly too. The drink girl came around with shots and said they were buy one get one. Okay, let's do it, $24 for 4 shots, good deal and tasted good too. 

Some guys came to dance and one guy was the guy that all the friends claimed to ""get all the girls"". HAHA, I showed him!! It was fun to dance though... but buddy, that's about it, sorry but you gotta tell your friends that this was one girl you couldn't get. Still the group was friendly and nice.

I loved the moody Asian theme (shocking, I know...) and special accommodations they made for my party. After getting referred by a contact to the lead host, we were advised to arrive at 10:30 to bypass the long line and to be escorted inside to our table and bottle service. The dark and seductive lighting along with thumping beats had us ready to get into mischief. Our servers were diligent in checking to make sure that our drinks were topped off which was a plus! 

The professional dancers elevated able the crowd and jaw dropping ladies splashing around topless in the tub certainly peaked interest in what Vegas has to offer. The DJ was solid and the place was swarming with photographers and a lively crowd. 

My only gripe is many of the horrifically offensive young ladies who were grinding and attempting to be ""sexy"" on the elevated bar area. These women were patrons of the club and had no issue with showing off their ""lady parts"" when they had no business doing so. Trust me sweetheart... I don't need to see you Britney and that bandage dress is around 3 sizes too small for you. Thank goodness security finally removed them from the dance area.... unfortunately there were many clones of this throughout the night.

Anywho, I really like this place because the music is great. Great current, hiphop music that you can really dance to. And if you want to have alittle bit more of a chill environment, then you can go into their second room in the back where i would say is more r&b. However, the room started to pick up the tempo around... midnight? 

The layout isnt as open as say, XS, but the music is better, the crowd is better, and i felt like it was more of people that just wanted to dance. AND i think i saw less old people.

They don't ask if you are staying at the Venetian. Therefore, it's free for everyone! My suggestion is to drink BEFORE you get there because they are damn expensive.

From what I recall they used to have 3 separate areas that played 3 different types of music.  The night that I came, the main dance floor and the little room in the back were playing the same garbagey techno crap that we thought we left with the previous club.  We ended up going downstairs to the tiny lounge\/entrance area where the music was a little better...but not by much.

My particular experience this time = 2 stars 
Security Guards = 0 stars 

This was my second time at Tao after an enjoyable first experience two years ago. This time around I was with a bachelorette party and I had fun up until the point when our bride got thrown out of the club at 11:30pm for stumbling. She had tripped (due to the crowds) and the guard mistaked that for being drunk (which she wasn't). 

We tried to explain what happened and the guard didn't appear to care. She was escorted out immediately and they took her driver's license number so she couldn't return. So thank you Tao for ruining my friend's Bachelorette Party. I understand guards run into unruly people all the time but they could at least listen to a person's explanation. 

Besides guards that don't understand, my next complaint really applies to all Vegas Clubs and that is they are too crowded. These clubs let so many people in that it gets impossibly crowded to the point that you have to spend most of your time just trying to maneuver yourself around instead of having fun. 

A few things I liked about Tao were the club's decor and all the girls posing in bath tubs and on beds. Also, through our hook up we got free drinks from 10-11pm which was cool. Their balcony serves as the smokers pen and if you don't mind all the smoke there is actually a really nice view of the strip. 

Finally, I loved their big dance floor but unfortunately due to the crowds I barely got to use it. I would have loved to dance more except that there was so many people security guards were constantly telling me and my friends we had to move more into the dance floor or leave the dance floor.

The women here were pretty attractive in general, but any kind of conversation is impossible because it's so loud, so you're really going to have to look the part too.

Not only did they have drink chips with his name on them, but cups and napkins too.  The setting was set up for his arrival.  He got some really good advertisement as did Pandora. Since Lil Wayne was a no show the club opened the bar up.  FREE LIQUOR!   Yes, that was nice.  Just be prepared to stand at the bar for refills because the drinks have a weak pour.

Other clubs I've been to in other states would never go for that. Either way the DJ played some really good hits.  After they announced no Lil Wayne the club cleared out.

HOWEVER - the hype about this place is so overdone that the staff has a huge attitude and they do not know how to treat guests.  

My husband and I went around 7:30 on a Thursday night.  We were staying at the Venetian (the hotel connected to the restaurant), made reservations for both the restaurant and the nightclub.  After waiting an HOUR we finally got a table.  The place was dark, loud, and the layout made you feel very crowded.  It was difficult to see what we were eating, let alone have a conversation.  We dropped about $400 on dinner (we were celebrating and had a bottle of Veuve).  

After dinner was over, we said we had reservations for the nightclub, the entrance to the club was literally 20 feet from our table.  Well, we had to get up, go outside the club, stand in a long ""special line"" and then wait in another ""special line"" in order to pay a $20 cover to go back through the restaurant we just left, back up the stairs we just came down, in order to get in.  

Pathetic.  

When we got inside, it got even worse.  The place was packed (it was only 10:30 p.m.!).  The bouncers were rude, the place was pitch black in some places - so it was a lot of bumping into people.  I would estimate that about 80% of every room in the entire club was sectioned off for VIP.  So unless you are ready to drop $300 on a $40 bottle of vodka, don't expect to have any room.",1,0,0

My friend wanted to check out Tao and see Kid Ink. We got on the guest list and hardly had to wait in line (granted, we did get there early to make the open bar). That night they had an open bar from 10:30-11:30pm and we intended to make the most of it!  We had a good time dancing and making new friends. The music was pretty good. We were disappointed that Kid Ink's appearance was super brief. Enjoyed the confetti and smoke effects used on the dance floor. A fun time was had by all",0,1,0

All the celebrities hang out here so what's so great about this place? First off, for the normal folk it is very difficult to get into. I've heard of people standing in line at 830pm when the club doesnt open until 1030pm. I figured out the best time to come is between 1-2pm. Dont worry, it will still be crowded so being there at 2am is no different they 12am. If you're staying at the hotel, get on the guest list or chat it up with the bouncers and get some VIP passes. 

The place has awesome decor and statues. Be sure to walk through all the different rooms. Girls dancing in cages up top and a stage area for the drunk girls from that bachelorette party. The smaller roomer on the side was much less crowded with still great music. This place gets 5 stars for music but downgraded one star for the huge crowd. People pushing everywhere and it was impossible to get a drink. Bottle service is probably the way to go for me next time. Although I heard it's quite pricey....",1,0,2

Upon arriving to Tao's entrance, my friends and I were greeted with hundreds of patrons waiting in line to get in. I was totally shocked by the amount of people during this time of year in Vegas (we were there at the end of July). Luckily, one of my friends had connections with his associate and were able to have us bypass the line to the ""hotel guests"" section (obviously, we weren't guests of the hotel) and get complimentary admission to boot. After waiting in line for about half an hour, we were escorted up stairs into Tao Beach, which I thought was pretty pointless to be in considering it was 11pm and the pool was closed. 
On a side note, what's so beach-y about Tao Beach? You have a pool, some lounge chairs and benches, a few VIP cabanas, and a bar. I don't know bout you, but it looked like your typical hotel pool environment to me. Nothing special.

Drinks at Tao were very watered down and way overpriced AND I was not able to get a buzz going. I had a 2 ounce shot of Sex on the Beach for a whopping 12 bucks--for a shot! A friend of mine bought bottled water and that set her back 5 bucks. Holy smokes. A regular sized cocktail seemed to be a better deal for about 14 bucks.

Anyway, it was a Saturday night and the club was packed like a can of sardines. Security was all over the place scolding at patrons to either clear the aisles and proceed to the dance floor or bar. 
My group and I proceeded to squeeze into the dance floor to dance. It was pretty difficult to find room, but once we found it then we were stuck....flanked by gyrating people. It was really fun dancing, given a square foot of dancing space among others. Music was appropriate and the place was hoppin'. 

I've been to Tao a couple more times and it was always so so crowded.  Coat check was pretty nonexistent, and you're lucky to even make it to the main dance floor.  If not, then expect to dance by the foyer. 

It was a pretty fun experience, if you want that whole ""Vegas"" nightclub gig and don't mind the crazy crowds. Good music with a fun and young crowd and sexy decor. What else could you ask for? I may go back again (most likely not), and I'll definitely pre-game.",1,0,0

I got bottle service at Tao Beach just to see how it was like.   It was great having a place to sit when the place got packed, the service with the security guard, bus boy, and waitress were great, but I don't know it was worth the money doing it.  Definitely good looking people (as in women) so no complaining there.  Drinks are pricey but that was to be expected, it was a overall good experience.  Only grip would be that the main floor got insanely packed, no one could even move.  You always want people at a club, but not that many!",0,0,0

I knew that I had to check this place out. Luckily I had recently won a free trip to Vegas to party at Tao, courtesy of Virgin America Airlines (See Virgin America review).

The atmosphere within Tao is very trendy--like a Buddhist temple run amok.  There is somewhat of a strict but relaxed dress code. Play it safe and don't wear ANY kind of hats.  If you have VIP - THIS IS THE PLACE!  Granted, I would never stand in line for hours. The music at Tao was pretty good for the most part, but there were a few songs the DJ threw in that made me feel like I was in high school. But I digress.. 

The VIP party I attended was with a group of Virgin America Vegas winners hosted Bob Guiney formerly of ""The Bachelor"" and ""The Bachelorette."" Drinks were flowing all night long thanks to our waitress, I forgot her name but she was a cool little asian chick, who was very attentive to our party.  We had so much fun dancing and mingling with some HOT people throughout the night...

We went to celebrate my bachelorette party and were having a good time. That is until we encountered rude and inappropriate staff in the restroom area. Yes, my friend may have had a little too much to drink. But under NO conditions is it ok to push open the bathroom stall while a woman has her dress pulled up and using the restroom and holding it open while calling security, so that EVERYONE walking by can see her. That is what the lady working the bathroom area did. And if you have been to the bathrooms at Toa, you know they are open to a Hallway where anyone, women and men can pass by and see inside the stall if it is open. This is completely inappropriate, WRONG and disturbing. No matter how intoxicated someone may be, you do not disrespect them or humiliate them in such a manner. How unprofessional. Staff should be taught common decency. Safe to say, this was probably the last time we will be celebrating anything at Tao",1,1,0
