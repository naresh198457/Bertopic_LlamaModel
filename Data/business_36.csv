The rooms are just alright. No fridge and you have to walk a half mile to find the ice machines. Cool view that over looks primarily MGM and New York New York. No WiFi which is pretty whack. You have to go ghetto style and plug their ethernet cord into your laptop if you bring one. The midevil castle them has always been pretty cool in my book as well. I'm still going with the 5 star heavily because of me hitting 3\/3 parlays here.,0,0,0

I understand views are subject to availability but your check in lady told us that we had a view when we checked in as well as an updated room which clearly both were just blatant lies.Also maybe talk to your management and put the fridges back in the rooms that's incredibly bad business I talked with 16 different couples all of which stated that due to that they will never stay there again. Just bad business.,1,0,0

There's been some reno's and it's looking better! I can't say that I will ever stay here again, but it's in the part of The Strip I like the most and it's the best hotel for the budget traveler!

Especially because the pool is being worked on and we had to walk to the Luxor pool if we wanted to use a pool???  Also a weird situation there was a ambulance by the valet when I came one night.  I was told be the security guard even though I'm staying here I have to go somewhere else to park??? I just didn't get it... Why do you have to shut down all Valet operations when when a ambulance is there. I get a fire truck.... but why a ambulance when you could use YOUR RADIO and stop movement if you are bringing a patient down to that area???  Maybe its my military side but their security\/emergency procedure is stupid.  

Speaking of fire.... At 0230 the fire alarm went off.. holy shit was I freaking out... I thought I was back in Iraq how f***ing loud that sh** was.  There was no fire but that alarm is loud as all heck.  The hotel itself isn't too bad.  Parking is a b***h, the slots and hotel floor are ok.  The food court and restaurants are all pretty cool.  Make sure you know there is $26.00 resort fees per day!  Which was more than the Palms BTW.  All in all the experience wasn't the best but what do you expect from $25.00 a night!

Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas. - Paul Samuelson",21,11,11

I think a lot of the mad reviews are being really nit-picky about this hotel especially when you can get a hotel room for $25\/night here during the week. You get what you pay for and for $25\/night, you really shouldn't be expecting the services and quality that you would see at newer, fancier, and way more expensive hotels like the Wynn and Cosmopolitan.

People stay here for its location and when you're sitting on the Strip next door to the New York New York, Tropicana, and Luxor hotels and an extremely short taxi ride away from the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Caesar's Palace, and Cosmopolitan, you really can't beat this deal.

I highly recommend this hotel if you're budget-conscious, looking for a place to crash during the night and don't plan on staying in the room the entire time you're in Vegas which is just silly since you're in Vegas!",0,0,1

I checked in at about 10 am. The clerk was very friendly and even waived the resort fee because I was celebrating my birthday! My room was clean and it faced the Luxor pyramid. It looked similar to an average Holiday Inn inside the rooms. 

As a first time gambler, I enjoyed the $5 minimums on the table games and the friendly dealers. I also visited the pool. I liked that there was an adult pool area! The main pool and connecting hot tub were filled with kids. The adult pool was nice because it wasn't too crowded and I ended up meeting great people to party with later on that night!

If you are a cheap college student looking for a place to crash that is not sketchy, I recommend Excalibur!",5,0,1

If you want a cheap hotel on the strip,  this is it.  Dont expect anything fancy.  This was a classic room, one tv with basic programming, normal bathroom, two regular noisy beds, out of date furniture and that's it.  I didn't like that you could hear almost everything and I mean everything from the room next door thru the room connecting doors. This is basically why I gave a three stars rating.  I think the hotel could do something better to improve this.  The fire sprinklers looked rusty,  I assume these get tested.  Sorry but I just couldn't keep the 1980 MGM fire out of my head.  We did see improvements on the Fun Dungeon area, my kids loved it. The staff was nice and helpful.  The ""want a free show"" people are kind of annoying. We probably heard that at least 20 times a day. Most likely will look for a different hotel next time we go to Vegas.",0,0,0

The front desk guy was nice and friendly and no problems during that process. I didn't like the fact that we were literally harassed about seeing a show every time we entered or left the property. 
Other resorts don't seem to have near the same amount of those pushy people. 
There are multiple pools that seem nice with a lot of non-intimidating bodies and also many families. We walked into the adult pool area with no issues or being charged. However, when my Husband ran back to the room and came back their was a little guy at a desk trying to charge $10 for entry. My husband motioned to me and walked past him. We discovered there is in fact a fee to enter which wouldn't be a problem if it was more of a ""fun"" atmosphere within the walls. There was no music playing. The waitresses looked annoyed bothered to be working. Any door fee would be acceptable if they'd earn it! 

The room was clean and alright but there were 3 glasses just outside our door when we arrived on a Monday and they remained in the same spot upon checking out on Wednesday. 
Just a lack of attention by housekeeping staff and also a hazard.

The thermostat didn't do an actual, comfortable temperature. The bathrooms are also only okay.  Oh, yeah, no free wi-fi, even though it is the year 2014.

I also thought the Medieval theme was kind of neat. I had kids with me so I thought that the options offered at were kind of neat. As soon as I walked into the lobby the long lines shocked me. My check-in was on a weekday so I am not sure what the long lines were all about. I noticed that on everyday I walked by the registration area that the line was always long. After about a twenty-minute wait time we were off to our room in the ""renovated"" Tower 2. The room was pretty basic. Two beds with a common soft headboard separated by a nightstand. The room was fairly clean. The wall-mounted TV was huge which was great during the few minutes a day that I watched TV. I did not have a view so not much to note there. The one thing that I did find kind of annoying was the fact that there was camera mounted right outside the window so we could not open the blinds without feeling like we were under surveillance. Not sure if that is the case for all the rooms or not, but I could not bring in any natural light during the day with that damn thing there.  No gripes about the bathroom. It is what it is I guess. It was clean. If you have a ton of gadgets, as most do these days, finding a receptacle to charge said gadgets is nearly impossible. The most obvious place to find an outlet is right on the nightstand. Well in our room the outlet was on the base of the lamp that was on the nightstand. This outlet was equipped with only one plug-in for only one device. The frustrating thing about the outlet is that to plug in just about any charger we had we had to somehow tilt the lamp back then plug in the charger and hope that it stayed in. My suggestion for this issue is to put something underneath the lamp to keep it fixed at a tilted position. Finding any other chargers was like a scavenger hunt. Enough about the room. There are plenty of options for grabbing a quick bite. I do not recommend the buffet, but that was only me. Some in my group enjoyed it. The service personnel in this hotel also had bad attitudes. I understand they have jobs to do and all, but some were just over the top. I will not get into detail but some trouble areas were the lifeguard attendant who checks room keys before allowing you access to the pool area and the security in lost and found. Security moves at a snail's pace when helping you in retrieving your lost possessions. I understand thorough, but thorough can be done quickly.  And if you loose some of your personal belongings with your name on them do not wait for the hotel to look you up to see if you have a room. It will not happen. So hopefully you find your things before you return home. The arcade's hours are the worst. It closes too early and opens too late. Again, one of my reasons for picking Excalibur was for the options it had for kids. The arcade's hours took away one of those options. The pool was great beside the lifeguard access granter person and the rude guests who would leave their seats for over an hour and expect that seat to be reserved for them. Get real people. The sound system may be in need of an upgrade in the pool area. I could barley hear the tunes from some of the pools. And any time the little ones strayed away and got too close to the pool bar or to a machine on the casino floor the staff would quickly lash out at us to reel them in. I understand the law is the law, but show the same kind of excitement to help us out. Not sure if I would try this one again.",0,0,0

I've never really liked this hotel (maybe I'm just not a huge fan of the cheesy medieval times theme) but stayed here because everyone else in my party booked their rooms here. We got a really good deal (Friday-Sunday) at $75 a night in the renovated tower (tower 1) as well as 2 free drink coupons. Staff at check-in were very helpful and accomodating, allowing our party of 9 in 3 seperate rooms to all be on the same floor and room pretty close by each other. It was awesome that we all booked completely seperate but still got to stay in rooms close to each other. 

The room I stayed in had a king bed and a nice view of the strip. We asked for a non-smoking room but it smelled like smoke in the room. The renovations are nothing spectacular but nice enough. Honestly, we weren't in the room much anyways so as long as it's clean, I'm fine with it. If you're looking for amazing rooms, stay somewhere else. The hotel itself was fine but again, nothing great. We checked out the food court upstairs (McDonalds,Quiznos, Auntie Anne's, Krispy Kreme, Pizza Hut) and the buffet. There's also a baha fresh downstairs. Buffet was OK, priced a little too high for what you get ($47 for 2 at dinner). 

Loved the service here and the room worked for what we needed. I still wouldn't prefer to stay here but the location is good and so are the room prices. I have a little bit better view of Excalibur now and can say I've stayed here.",2,1,0

If it hadn't been such a last minute trip I would have saved up a little extra to stay more central on the strip and for a better ambiance. 

Friendly check in people, restaurant credit ($20 per room) which we promptly used at the first bar, and a decent Starbucks were the highlights. 

The rooms are dark, the air is smoky in a way that seems to linger on and make your eyes burn, but again I think we paid under $50 a night. So, better than not going to Vegas at all.",2,0,0

Second tip: Stay in tower #2 - the renovated rooms are much better than the tower 1 older style ones. While roomy, tower 1 rooms show their age in little ways - no bathtubs, worn carpet, etc.

Overall the place is decent, but I've stayed in small town Holiday Inn Express-es that were nicer.

The Good - 

The rooms are nice and the bathrooms are roomy.  Our room had a big plasma t.v. and a great view of the strip.

Buffet is worth the price of $27 for all day.  

We love the arcade that has county fair like games and of course, my favorite, the claw game!!  Games are not hard to win.  So it makes it fun for the kids.

Pool is nice.  One area has a water slide and the other side is more for the drinking adults.  

The Bad -

Asked for 4 extra blankets and we only got 2.  They said they were out!  That's crazy!  Who does the laundry?  Fire 'em!

Ice machine on our floor was out of ice for a whole day.  

Our nice big plasma t.v. turned itself on at 5:00 a.m. and nothing worked to turn it off.  I finally had to unplug it!  Then when I plugged it back in we only got a few stations.  We checked out that day so we didn't complain.

On our second night, a burning smell woke me out of a sound sleep.  We panicked and searched the room for the smell.  It was the air conditioner!!  We shut it off and went back to sleep.  Crazy, I know.  But we were tired.  We only had the thing at 65.  The next night it worked fine.

The arcade is a little run down.  Most of the claw games are out of order, but some of them did work just fine.  

We did get a little tired of the buffet after having it for every meal.

Still, I love this place.  I never want them to fix it up because then it will be higher priced.  It's fine the way it is.  Not perfect, but nice.  

We go to this hotel once and year and to the MGM Grand once a year.  They are different.  MGM is nicer but much higher priced.  Excalibur is great.  At it's price we can still afford to go to shows and do other things and not break the bank.  At MGM we just go and enjoy our expensive hotel.",1,0,0

We came in on early Monday afternoon, and were immediately greeted by the valet and luggage guys. They welcomed us with open arms and we're very fast. The front desk staff were so fast and helpful. We only waited a few minutes and we're checked in and our room was ready. 

The room was okay. It was a good size room, clean and had a very specious bathroom.  It had everything you need while in Vegas. We were in the newly remodeled tower, tower 2. The view from our window was absolutely amazing. We were able to see a large portion of the strip. If I had to knock anything about our room, it would be that the shower floor was a little slippery and that the beds were very hard. But we didn't spend much time in the room other than to sleep and shower.

The casino had a wide selection of slots and table games, so you definitely won't be bored. Many of the slots include many of the Vegas classics and many of the newest games. They also have a decent poker room with affordable poker tournaments.

The hotel also has many restaurants to choose from, including buffets, sit down restaurants and fast food. All decent and the food court is open 24 hours.

Decent amount of shops with a wide selection of products.

The location of the Excalibur is fantastic. Being on the south end of the strip, it's right across the street from the MGM, New York New York and Tropicana. It's also connected on the inside and by trams to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

Overall, I had a great time and the hotel delivered. It's staff is amazing and it has the essentials to make a great Vegas getaway.

I would definitely stay here again.",3,1,1

  the bus bumps you of at the back entrance of the hotel where you walk  endless streets and round many corners passing  rows of shops to get to the  check in desk 
 on the way  you are confronted almost every step by a team of hustlers trying to get you to sign up for their  (no obligation) time share presentation for which you will receive tickets to one of las vegas.s many shows .

getting to the line is no more uneventful  as they inform you check in is at 3 pm  ..its now 10 am but for a payment only  $20 you can  precheck in  and  if you dont want that  there is another army of coons willing to take care of your bags until such time as you can occupy a room and then deliver the bags to you.
 just a few  clever ways to  more money from  your pocket

 while avoiding these   offers you are still at the mercy of the * time share pushers *  who never seem to   know  when  a no means   no and continue to hassle   you  we  turned down all offers and waited out our time to check in by sitting  in a nearby bar.

THE ROOM 
 it was about average size  strange thou it didnt have  any of the mandatory  pictures attached to the walls. no safe or bar but it did have   a coffee maker in the bathroom .
it was old and needed updating the beds* two king size*  were   clean with plenty of pillows,  the shower screen was loosely  attached to the wall and the taps on the sink needed tightening  down  we found the air conditioner was noisy with no way to adjust it .


 FOOD 
  this was the good part the restuarant    sells a DAY ticket for $36 PER ADULT VIP STATUS   you can eat ANY  time as  MANY  times as you like  for this price. a good deal in vegas as most eateries in hotels  for even a light meal starts at around $15.the food was good   the service was excellant and as VIP we got to go right in and not join the end of the  line   this privilege   was one of the reasons it was  worth the day ticket alone
   so much time is wasted in las vegas   waiting in line to eat ,see a show or enter one of the many nite clubs .


For the price we paid it was nt a bad deal you only get what  you pay for
  just wish the hotel management would take action to stop these   little asian  guys harrassing  every new quest as soon as they walk thou the door .
   your tired after a long and stressfull flight your first thought is to get to a room, shower change clothing and hit  the strip    this continued hustling is annoying .

First, I was promised a 3 night stay at the Luxor with 2 show tickets and $150 cash voucher, and that would have my money back for the $125 I paid for the deal. I did get the money back, however the timeshare presentation was excruciating and took almost 5 hours instead of the 2 or 3 they said it would. No I didn't buy into it. The show tickets choices were all really lame, we wound up choosing a dinner show that we didn't actually even get to go to because the timeshare presentation took so long! Could have gone the next night but it was their blackout date and we left the next day. We did not get to stay at the Luxor as promised, ended up at the Excalibur, which is only a subpar hotel these days. Took almost an hour just to check in for the line. Stay away from the buffet! It has totally gone down the tubes! Expensive and nasty! The room was just OK, the bed was comfortable but there was zero water pressure in the shower, and we got noise from the street and from our neighbors all night long!

I was able to check into the hotel early which was nice and the hotel clerk upgraded my room which was great!! So the first night gambling was great had drinks and fun.  
The next day i had  breakfast in the room went down to gamble and ordered some shots.  The cocktail waitress Cheryl yelled and said that they don't serve shots on the floor and that she worked for the hotel for 26 years and all her days there they have never served shots on the floor!  Instead of arguing we asked to speak to a manager and the manager apologized and gave us shots.  SMH was all that really needed for a customer who has been gambling and just wants a shot before its time to head out to a wedding??  That just killed my entire vibe. I went to the wedding came back to the room and noticed that the person who was supposed to clean the room made the bed but left the trash and the old breakfast plates from the morning.  SMH.
So i thought no big deal. let me just put the trash outside the door ill order some food drink and get ready for tomorrow. So i called downstairs to request new towels so that i may take a shower in the morning. It took them 2 hours with no exaggeration for them to bring towels to my room.  SMH.

The room has been remodeled, if that's what you call it. There's no tub and the shower has corking that is coming up so it looks like mildew is developing in the corners. There was hair in the restroom from the previous guest, so that also shows that housekeeping is not doing a good job. Housekeeping also failed to swept the bathroom several times because there was hair left on the floor. The walls have been repainted in the guest room, but that's about the only good update. With the price of the room you would expect a refrigerator in the room, but it was removed (You can pay an extra fee to rent a refrigerator during your stay). The fact that this hotel charges such a high fee for your stay you would except the housekeeping and updates to be ""updates"" but it's not by far up to par.

We got there early but still had to wait a long time to check in. The workers did not seem to have any sense of urgency. The line got much longer throughout the day. We had to wait a long time for our room to be ready as well. The check in process needs to be more efficient. 

I'm not much into gambling but the casino was nice. There wasn't too much of a cigarette smell. 

The rooms in the hotel were surprisingly nice. They weren't too cramped. The views from the upper floors are amazing, regardless of which direction you were facing. I think the bathroom has been redone recently. 

There are a lot of options for food here. There is a buffet, an Italian restaurant, and a food court as well as several other restaurants scattered about. Dick's is also located here which is a great time as long as you're not sensitive. All of it is insanely priced but good luck finding cheaper food elsewhere. 

The pools here are nice, though one of them was closed and the other cost $10 to use. One of the pools has a little slide. 

Most of the staff here seemed friendly. 

The hotel is within walking distance of a number of hotels. New York, New York, MGM Grand, and Tropicana can be accessed via outdoor walkways. Luxor can be reached via an indoor walkway and there is a free tram that takes you to Mandalay Bay.

On this Halloween weekend the Excalibur had set-up festivities such as beer pong and other adult games to cater to the dressed-up guests. The rooms are nothing special, older curtains, 19 inch TVs from the 80s, older carpet, small bath towels, so much for the room. But hey this is Vegas and you just sleep in them anyways.

Excalibur does have something I want in a casino...a big sports bar to watch and bet on games. The casino also features two lounges with live music and an upstairs lounge with a dueling guitars act. For gamblers..black jack tables, poker tables and an abundance of slot machines. I didn't see many people dumping silver dollars in those dollar slots. So they must be drinking themselves at the main bar, Dick's bar (redneck bar), or watching the pseudo strippers at the bar across the from Dick's. (yes that was the name of the bar).

Most of the casinos have bufftets and for $29.99 you could eat until you pass out. I decided to checked it out, ate a lot of fruit, pasta, chicken dishes and desserts. Excalibur also has a very nice food court that featured a McDonalds, pizza parlor and a Coldstones.",3,2,1

I'm currently sitting in my room at the Excalibur (which actually has great strip views, I must admit), typing this review from my ""free"", yet wired, high speed internet access that I paid $9.95 a day for (note, the rate has been raised to $12.95 for all new check-ins, we just happened to reserve when the rate was lower back in October). If I'm going to be paying for it, I might as well use it, right?

Staying here out of a need to save money, rather than a desire, I wasn't really expecting much from the hotel overall, and my expectations have been met head-on. The room is of a fine size, and I believe we have one of the ""recently remodeled"" options as the furniture seems new, or at least well taken care of. However, our King size bed is really hard, and I find it hard to sleep all the way through the night without readjusting because my back hurts.

The water pressure is lackluster at best, and the electrical outlet on my bed-side table (built into the bottom of the table lamp) doesn't function.

All in all, you get what you pay for and this is no exception. Know what you're going into before you get here, and you can save yourself a lot of frustration. This isn't a 5-star hotel, but if you're looking to save money, at least the hotel functions well-enough for that end.",4,1,0

The bed actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but I prefer more firmer beds. The one complaint I have is the smell of whatever cleaner they use for the bathroom. Every time we walked back into our room I almost wanted to gag from the smell of it. I'm totally fine with the smell of clorox, but that was not it. gross..

I will say the plus side of staying here is that they have a food court. When we came back from the clubs we were able to go to our room, shower, then come back down to grab a quick bite.

My gripe with Excalibur is pretty much the same as with Wynn\/Encore...they're both on almost the complete opposite ends of the ""happening"" part of the strip.

Average hotel, but be careful with the doors and lock you things up.  They do not close tight unless you slam or push\/pull them.  My wife went gambling between midnight and 3:30 am while I was sleeping with the kids.  I did not put the latch-lock on because she needed to get back in.  Iphone and ipad were charging on the floor.  Wallet and coin purse on the entertainment center.  ROBBED while we were sleeping.  Filed the report with security and they said they do ""push checks"" on the doors at night, so this must be a problem.  Maintenance man came up the next morning and said that was normal.  They do not seem too caring about the fact that we were robbed while sleeping and lost over $1100 worth of Apple equipment.  That can be replaced, but just creepy someone was in the room taking from us.  They have security downstairs and you have show your keycard, but they could be easily distracted.  They said there is a law that prohibits putting cameras in the hallways due to privacy issues.  I'm not sure about the validity of that, or they may just be too cheap to add that.

No frig or coffee pot in the room.  Annoying people asking you for free tickets every time you enter the hotel, which is really to get you to listen to a sales pitch to buy property.  Kids like the game area downstairs.  Lots of places to eat on the 2nd floor.  

I would not stay there again unless they gave me a free stay because of this.  If I did, I would lock everything in the safe, latch the door, and trap the door.  I doubt they will reimburse any losses, so I can only file a police report and start rebuilding my life stolen in my wallet.",3,1,0

After exiting the Johnny Rockets, a guest approached my friend and commented on her ""behind"". He asked her to go back with him and after she rejected him several times he asked her to continue to walk away so he could stare at my ""nice behind"" (this gentlemen's choice words were not so polite). This all occurred in front of a bartender amongst a few employees. After he made her feel humiliated (at this point he had been rejected ~4 times and was now objectifying her body by telling her to walk way so that he can stare, I asked him to please leave us alone. This is when the other guest made a fist and told me he would, and this a direct quotation, ""beat the sh*t out of me"". I asked him to repeat himself for confirmation, and he again said, this time to both of us,  ""I will beat the sh*t out of you"". At this point the guest started backing up , and I made note that security was now approaching ( i noticed the bartender pick up the phone around the first threat). Both the guest's and our tones were now loud. As he started to walk away he told me to (direct quote) "" Shut up, you FAT B#$!H"". I started to walk towards him and asked him to repeat himself, he then said YET AGAIN that he was going to ""beat the sh*t out of you"" (this time he motioned towards both my friend and I). When I asked him why, he told me that he's not afraid to hit a woman. 
After talking with security, and noticing that they intentionally stalled to let the man walk away, my friend and I realized that the issue wasn't going anywhere. Therefore, we walked back to our room and decided to call someone in management.
 This is when we got to speak with Denise. 
She is absolutely horrendous as a representative of your establishment.
She let us know that she didn't see anything that the other guest said and all she heard was that he called us fat and that it was not that big of a deal. She repeated the fact that he called me fat 3 times and claimed she was the one who told the bartender to call security so she ""missed everything but the part when he called the girl in the red dress fat"".
 If this were true, she should have been more cognizant of the situation and notice the man gesticulating with his fist and saying he would ""beat the sh*t out of me"" AFTER he called me fat. Instead, she said that the whole situation looked very bad on us and we should have walked away (the entire reason the altercation with the disgusting guest began).

This is beyond unacceptable. Not only did we get sexually and verbally harassed, but we were then made to feel unsafe. Additionally, the reaction of your ""management"" was to victim blame. She made an assumption, and because she agreed with the man's observation of my size, felt that I had overreacted. I get nauseous at the idea of how poorly she treated us. She was rude from the beginning, asking ""what were we supposed to do about it?"" and ""what would you have done? Were you going to press charges?""
Denise's response to two women's call of distress was completely inappropriate and reprehensible. Because of her wrong assumptions, she made the stay there feel unsafe and unpleasant. The fact that she victim blamed was the worst offense.",0,0,0

When I arrived, I left my car with the valet, my luggage with the bellhop and went to check in. I stood in line for TWO HOURS and when I got to the counter, I was informed that they had lost my reservation.  I had booked a suite with a credit card to hold the room for late arrival. They had given it to someone else.  They promised a king size single with a view because the suites were all gone.  When I got upstairs to the room, it was a single with a full size bed in a very small room and no view. I called downstairs... Three rooms later, I was in a king with a view.  I saw 4 rooms total.

There were two holes in my wall (fist sized) that needed to be repaired and the bedspread had cigarette burn holes in it. I called housekeeping and they promised to send someone to change the bedding. There was nothing they could do about the holes in the wall. Could maintenance come and fix them? No. 

An hour later, I called to check on my luggage and was told that they were understaffed and very busy. The man on the phone vented to me about how they were cutting hours and how guests were complaining. He said they would bring my luggage up as soon as they could. (It had been 3 hours so far.) Could I come down and get it? No, but they would bring mine up next. He promised. 

I ordered room service. They brought me someone else's food. I called down and was told they would send up another order. They did. Again, it was someone else's food.  Third time was a charm and I got my order. 

After eating, I called to check on my luggage as it had been another hour and a half. Once again, I was told I was next in line to receive my bags. It was late and I wanted to get some sleep. Could I please come down and get them so I could get settled for the night? No. 

My luggage finally arrived. It took almost 5 hours to get my bags. The two men who brought my 3 bags up, handed me a folded comforter and left. I called housekeeping. Was I supposed to change the bedding? And if so, what was I supposed to do with the other bedspread? No, the man who brought it up should have done it and taken the other one away. They said they'd send someone up. That someone never showed. 

The next morning when I was ready to drive somewhere, it seemed to be taking the valet a really long time to bring my car around.  After 20 minutes, I asked about it. They told me they had lost my car and were looking for it. No apology. No nothing. It took them about an hour to find my car. 

Later that day, I looked at my itemized bill on the television. I was being charged the room rate for a suite (when I wasn't in one) and I was also being charged for all 3 dinners from the night before. 

Deciding I needed to get some fresh air away from this unbelievable nightmare, I went to get my car from the valet to take a drive.  Once again, I was told, without so much as an apology, that they couldn't bring me my car.  This time, they said they lost the keys.  Later, I was told they found the keys, but couldn't locate the car.  It would take A WEEK for them to FIND MY CAR!!  

I went to the front desk to make a general complaint about everything and straighten out my bill. Before I was finished telling the front desk manager on duty my story (and let me add that I was being nice - not yelling, not taking it out on her, etc.) she offered to give me the phone numbers to some other hotels if I wasn't happy at the Excalibur. She told me she was busy and left.  She didn't listen to the other problems which included: things like being charged for receiving mail that wasn't mine (they charge for each letter or package you receive while a guest in the hotel), inappropriate behavior from two male staff members (they wanted me to go on a date with them both at the same time - I said no.), camera stolen from my room, water leak from the ceiling (slow drip), toilet that ran (maintenance took a week to come and fix it)... I could list more, but you get the idea. 

When the day arrived for me to check out, I still had 2 holes in my wall, a slow drip from the ceiling and 2 comforters in my room with one bed. They never came for the one with the holes in it and housekeeping never took it away. And yes, I did ask. Repeatedly. 

The final kick in the teeth was when I checked out. I called for a bellhop at 9AM to collect my bags. It took them 3 hours to show up. When they did, I went downstairs to check out and had to wait in another long line. The lady at the counter charged me for another night because I was checking out late!",7,7,2

The rooms seemed recently upgraded with a more modern feel, as is the trend with these themed hotels slowly loosing their themes, e.g.: Treasure Island (no more pirates,) and the Luxor (Egypt no more). I personally love the new color schemes in the room and in the public restrooms.
Why the 1 star? 
  #1 Because the parking structure is NOT attached to the hotel, and you have to schlep across a parking lot (that reeks of sewage,) from the structure. No bueno in Las Vegas heat!
      #2 oh, and the cleaning lady tried to barge into my room at 9:30 when checkout wasn't for hours. 
   #3 as guests, we had to pay for parking!!!!! This is new, but total BS for Vegas! Sure it was only $8 a day, but this is Vegas! You should NEVER have to pay for parking in a place that is guaranteed revenue by you simply parking there... either by gambling, watching a show there, or eating and drinking there. AT LEAST make the parking free for the guests. oh, and putting that information on the sites would be helpful too!
  
     This is happening at the MGM resorts, and for this reason alone, I never want to stay at any MGM resort!

- The location isn't too bad as far as vicinity to the strip. One star.

- The price isn't bad for what you get. I paid around $50 a night for a room with a king bed. Not bad at all. One star.

- The rooms are in reasonable condition and were clean. One star.

So that's the positives. Negatives:

- The rooms are still outdated and the walls are painted a grotesque brown. Looks like they didn't put a lot into the updates.

- Those event people attempting to sell you on shows and buffets drive me up the wall!!! I get it, you want to sell the products offered and such, but you kill any kind of customer service trust once built up. We ended up walking through a couple of times to get things in order and they just kept on coming! The same lady tried four times to sell me on crap. Maybe a hint on this: Do this when the people check-in. Don't keep bothering me and  wasting my precious time with your sales pitch each time I pass. It's unnecessary and absolutely infuriating.

I usually don't care about hotel rooms either, a place to sleep is what they are for me and as long as they are safe and clean, I don't care what it is. If you're looking for luxury, this is not the place for you (but I would think you would know that already when booking). Have stayed in both the new updated rooms and the old ones and both have treated us well. Simple shower in the bathrooms, maid service is prompt, check in and check out has always run smoothly (although it does get SUPER busy at prime time hours!) and the casino seems to spit out more money than some of the others I've been to. The beds in the older rooms were a little too soft for me, which is the only negative I can think of. Nice views of the NYNY and MGM from the newly updated tower and parking is plentiful and has never been a problem. Kids have never been a problem... at least not anymore so than other casinos. Pool is fine, have only been there once so can't review that too well. 

A few things I don't like - horribly pushy sales people inside the casino and on the bridge to get there. A few times they would RUN after us or people walking next to us yelling about show tickets and whatnot. From being inside all the other casinos on the strip, this hotel was the only one we experienced this at. While I just walk by and ignore like I usually have, it does become an annoying factor when you realize how desperate they are to get you. Another downside - from what I've seen, this place doesn't have any room service at night (I could be wrong.. we usually don't order it as there as so many places to eat in Vegas!). Last time we were there, I noticed on that there were certain hours and during the night was not one of them. They do have a food court which they list on there for their night food. One other negative is the location, it's south of the strip, so it is a bit of a walk if you want to explore other casinos. While this has never been a problem for us, it's something to think about. That being said, with MGM, NYNY, Luxor and Mandalay Bay (which has a LOT of nice places to eat and shop) being so close, there is always something to do. 

The negative reviews always make me laugh... for $24 a night, what did you think you'd be getting? Four Seasons? ... big fat NO. It's a fine hotel to sleep in and that's that.",2,1,0

The rooms aren't all that great.. the linens are on the cheap side, and nothing is really luxurious in the regular rooms.  I did get a good deal,  and paid and average of $37\/night including tax, and the $5 resort fee. 

The greatest thing about the casino, is the all electronic poker room.  It's just like playing online, except you can see and talk to everyone.  They even show odds of winning like on the poker TV shows. 50 cent and dollar blinds.  The comps suck though. The rake is supposed to be the lowest on the strip.. and there are always people in there.  The poker staff is very friendly.  It's the only place that i gamble now.. but i heard they will be adding these machines elsewhere soon.

They have a food court, and an IMAX ride as well.   I did notice a revamping of the Casino too.. in ways to try to get you to spend or lose more money!!

1) Flat screen TVs installed right above the tables to distract you from your blackjack hand.

2) Hot bikini gogo dancers right next to the tables, to distract you as well.

3) Female staff asking to give you a massage for $1\/minute while you gamble.

MGM is hurting right now, and they're pinching pennies.  I've also notice room rates vary wildly from day to day. 

Overall, this is a decent bet, for the right price.. For under $40\/night, it's decent, but over $60, and you can probably do better.

There is a free tram that runs to the Luxor and the Mandalay bay.. or if it is closed, they have people movers as an alternative.",1,0,1

PROS:
-Cheap. We stayed here mid-August for $32\/night, plus resort fee...very good rate!
-Family Friendly.....there's an arcade downstairs!
-Cheap food court in hotel. They have everything, McDonald's, Quizno's, DQ\/Orange Julius, Starbucks, Krispy Kremes, Chinese Food, coffee cafes at reasonable prices for the strip.

CONS:
-Excalibur is far, far, FAR away from the centre of the strip. You have to do A LOT of walking in the blazing hot sun across catwalks and through hotels to get places (unless you want to fork the money over for cabs).
-Drab decor
-No refrigerators (unless you want to pay $15\/day)
-A few minutes after we turned on the shower, it smelled like butt. Seriously, no other way to describe it other than butt. Luckily it went away after a few minutes, but I wasn't too impressed with that.
-It takes a long time to walk to the bus stop (called the ""Deuce""), which is by the Coca Cola Store.

TIP#1 If you do stay here, bring a cooler and buy all your drinks ahead of time or at a grocery store or some place cheaper. Anything is cheaper than in the hotel...even the ABC\/convenience type stores near Excalibur (especially for water)!

TIP#2: If you want a sit down breakfast close to Excalibur, go over to ""America"" in New York, New York hotel instead of Denny's. You'll wait FOREVER to get a table in Denny's, but you can walk into ""America"" (FYI -Portions are HUGE at America, try sharing)

Note: A taxi ride from the LAS airport to Excalibur will cost you about $15.

OVERALL: This hotel was okay since it fit our budget, but all the walking in 115 degree F weather was too much....it drained our energy levels and our feet and legs hurt. I don't really care about decor when I'm on a budget....but next time, I'd consider paying a little extra just to stay in a more central location on the strip.",1,0,0

I paid for this on Las Vegas.com and chose it because it is a castle and we have a two year old.  It was also the cheapest out of all of the hotels although last month we vacationed at the Luxor for about the same price with better customer service.  When we arrived I was told that there was a resort fee of $22.  That was unexpected but cool so I paid cash. The following morning I get a message light telling me to call guest services which I did and was told that I still owed the resort fee.  The woman was rude to me as though I was trying to get away with something and snorted when I told her that I'd paid cash and that should be in their system since after all I was in the room...hello?!  Then she told me that there was no note of it and that I bring down the receipt.  Well that just pissed me off as it was early morning and when I described the guy who helped me as Hispanic she answered, ""So you are saying that he's Mexican?!""  Like what?!  I told her that I didn't know specifically the nationality and asked if there was any log of me checking in and she said, ""Well yes, but you need to pay.""  I asked for the manager.  He came on and told me that the employee was off that day but he would check into it.  We went to have breakfast at the little table in the room and when I sat down I was stuck in my upper thigh by a skinnny piece of metal sticking out of the arm of the chair.  I called down and once again the rude woman on the line just said, ""Well, what chair and are you coming down to pay what you owe.""  There was no, ""I'm sorry that you were hurt are you okay?  We'll send someone right away to take the chair out since you have a two year old with you...or anything like that.   This time I told her that she was rude and she just transferred me to the manager named Mark.  He was nice enough and told me that he didn't understand the rudeness and would speak to her and that they would extend our checkout time until 3p.m.  We agreed I put some Neosporin on the pin prick on my leg and we went out to lunch since we had time to pack.  We got back at 1:40 p.m. and when we tried the door key it didn't work.  I called on my cell the hotel number three times to no answer and finally a supervisor of the maids came by and called security.  The guard got there but first had to let another family into the room.  Then when I told him that we had called downstairs and that they were rude about the call he responded, ""Well what do you want me to do, I can't answer for other people.""  He opened our room and left.  I laughed at that point because truly you do get what you pay for.  I don't know if the issue of the ""resort fee"" was solved but I did go down to speak to them again and absolutely no record of my paying cash was lodged and I wasn't given a receipt and they also had no idea that I'd paid the hotel fee on line completely.  It was a disaster.  Leaving on a positive note, the wading pool was great for small children.  Otherwise it was a horrible experience and the unfortunate end to my lovely summer vacation as a teacher on break. Advice:  Spend the extra money and skip the castle.",1,0,0

This place is in dire need of a facelift. See, this place needs some cosmetic surgery, not Heidi Montag.

My friends and I stayed in Tower 1 where the rooms are very dated. CRT TV, loud inefficient AC, and the decor is straight up kitschy. One of the last kitschy hotels in Vegas, especially now that the Vegas strip's becoming more high-class and all about real estate and timeshares.

I found it very difficult to sleep (even after a night out on the town and being pretty damn drunk) because of the loud AC that would turn on and off intermittently. The walls are very thin; we were able to hear the people above us getting into their room at around 2am on Sat. night and the sausagefest next door the night before. I also found a strand of long blonde hair in the bed my boyfriend and I were gonna be sleeping on. Gross! I guess I should be thankful it wasn't a pube but still! I guess having stayed at the Venetian, the Mirage, Treasure Island, and Vdara during past trips to Vegas spoiled me. Is it too much to expect a clean room? It's true what they say: you get what you pay for. I honestly don't understand why parents would even stay here with their little kids here when you can stay at a non-smoking, non-gaming hotel where the air and the atmosphere's a lot cleaner. And you most likely won't see a lot of people drunk off their asses.

If you're able to wake up early enough, the all-day buffet is a pretty good value. $30 for a wristband that allows you to come back and eat throughout the day until closing at 10pm. This is especially very worth it when they start offering the prime rib. And at least they seem to be making an effort to make good food, unlike the folks over at the MGM Grand buffet who can't even serve taco shells that aren't stale.

And the elevator situation is AWFUL when you're trying to check out on Sunday morning, but then again that's always the case no matter where you stay at. But the difference with this stay at Excalibur is that some of the elevators weren't working! So my friends and I hauled our stuff down 5 flights of stairs to the 18th floor so we could catch a hopefully empty elevator. And then there were some people in the single-digit floors who were actually trying to catch an elevator. Are you serious?! My boyfriend yelled at the people on these floors (since we stopped at every floor on the way down), ""DON'T BE LAZY!"" There were even people on the 2nd floor who wanted an elevator. Really? Are you trying to be funny?

Excalibur was a good value for where we needed to be at since we went to see the Jabbawockeez perform at MGM Grand and all you need for a weekend in Vegas is a place to sleep and get ready at different times during the day.",3,3,2

The rate was ridiculously cheap -- something like $51\/night during the weekend. Of course, we crammed four girls in one room, so for four nights, each of us only owed about $50. You can't beat that if you tried!!!

Pros:
-- Location, location, location! If you are taking the shuttle from the hotel, this is one of the first stops because it is on like the first corner after you turn onto Las Vegas Blvd. And, leaving to go to the airport, we were picked up last, so the ride was short and sweet - just how I like it.
-- Shuttle. When you're there in the middle of August and it's 100 degrees outside, the last thing you want to do is walk around. This hotel has a shuttle train that is connected to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay (and maybe even one more hotel - I can't remember). And, it's right across the street from New York, New York and the MGM Grand. We could get around quite easily without having to sweat too much.
-- Price\/Value. Seriously, $50\/night. That left more money for eating and DRINKING. No complaints there. Also, what you get for the money is decent -- room wasn't horrible. It was clean and decent-sized. The recently renovated rooms are MUCH nicer. Try to get one of those if you can. They have the widescreen TVs in them and a nicer bathroom.
-- Pool. Now, I didn't go to any of the other pools, so I couldn't compare. But, the pool there is a nice place to recover from a hangover. Tons of beach chairs and cabanas, and for someone like me who can't swim, they have pools shallow enough that you can wade and not drown. of course, you'll be amongst kids, but whatever.

Cons:
-- Slow elevators! There are only like six elevators that service each tower of 30+ floors. Completely inefficient.
-- The lobby is huge and confusing. It took me about 20 minutes of walking through the casino before I found the check-in desk. Check-in, however, was quick and easy.
-- Poor food choices. On our first day, we were so jetlagged that we decided to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Big mistake! I left feeling like I had just inhaled ten pounds of lard. Gross. But, I did discover a Krispy Kreme in there, so I somehow lived off coffee and donuts when I was too lazy to venture elsewhere for food.
-- In-house entertainment. Essentially, there is none. Unless you are a fan of Thunder Down Under, there is really nothing to see or do there. You have to venture outside the castle if you actually want to see a decent show\/concert\/attraction, etc.

Overall, I would definitely stay there again. The cons are nothing that would keep me away from staying at this budget-friendly and convenient hotel.",1,0,0

It's not bad at all, the motif of an adult disney land is old...but awesome. Regular rooms come with two queen beds and a flat screen TV. Suites are moderate in size as compared to the Paris' Red Room and Planet Hollywood Suites. The furnishings and styles inside are EXTREMELY dated but for the price....acceptable.

Entertainment options plentiful: Fantasy, Tournament of Kings, and that dude one (disclaimer: as a straight male, one shall not acknowledge the existence of said ""banana fest"" show).

Well, yes - a bathroom that doesn't have wads of hair on top of the shower drain or changing the dirty sheets from the previous occupant would've been nice.

Can catch the tram down to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur; can walk to NYNY and MGM, or can walk up to Monte Carlo and catch the tram through the City Center up to Bellagio.

Got good deal for Laughlin Nevada through Expedia previously and received no unpleasant surprises so thought we would use the service for a Las Vegas trip. Not a good resort stay this time including fees piled high and two free breakfast buffets not available as advertised - only discounts and only if buffet charged to room. Went to buffet for breakfast and it was not very good. Even the coffee was very weak - just coffee flavored hot water. On the plus side we could walk to two other resorts connected through walkways, the Luxor and Mandalay (about the only good thing I can say about the Excalibur). Nothing inexpensive at Excalibur. Room rates are no bargain, parking is $8 per day, buffet is $35 during week and $40 on the weekend. Employees try to sell you show tickets as you are walking through the resort. No coffee maker in the room, but there are coffee kiosks available near the elevators. Unfortunately the coffee kiosks are closed half the time. When open, especially in the morning, expect to wait in line 20 to 30 minutes for a mediocre but overpriced cup of coffee served by the slowest baristas in Nevada. Our room was noisy, near some type of equipment that emitted a loud droning hum 24\/7. I am a Navy veteran who used to sleep under the flight deck on an aircraft carrier so I could sleep through it. My wife, however, had trouble sleeping. Update: Checked out a day early and informed front desk. Next day received an email with a link to expedited check out! Contacted the hotel and they insisted the charge for the entire stay would remain in place and I would have to contact my booking service, expedia.com, for any refund issues. I contacted Expedia, was placed on hold for 20 minutes while someone at Expedia contacted Excalibur.

I grew up in the days of old Vegas. The Vegas with the 99-cent buffet and when the best prime rib dinner in town was served with a show on the side; the Vegas where the men still wore suits and the ladies wore silk hats and you saved for months to be able to ride to the show in a limo; the Vegas where Caesars Palace was THE place to go (or sneak into if you were underage). Boy, how times have changed. 

The only real positive thing I can say about this stay was the customer service. I know you get what you pay for, but that being the case, this place should have been a lot cheaper. The rooms were very mediocre and the first two rooms we were put in (yes, we changed three times) not only felt dirty, they were dirty. Where the in-room refrigerator should have been was an empty hole. Apparently, management has decided that is not an option. There is no in-room coffee pot so it's either go to the coffee stand downstairs or order room service. Which, by the way, room service ends at 2:00 p.m.  Oh yes, did I mention that we were in the ""newly redecorated"" tower rooms? I was afraid to see the lower priced, ""old"" rooms. 

This place definitely wants you to spend money in the casino and restaurants. Unfortunately, since there is no way to keep food or drink in your room, you have no other choice. 

The restaurants are, at best, also mediocre and very expensive. Even the fast-food court was highly over priced and lousy (we spent $30 at Hot Dog on a Stick, for two people, and the food was dry and cold). 

Oh, yeah ... That $30+ per night ""resort fee""? I'm still trying to figure out what the hell that covered. The pool was closed (not that I go to Vegas to go swimming), the gym\/workout room is a joke and you will never convince me that WiFi is that expensive. I didn't have a car but I understand they also charge parking fees so it certainly wasn't for that. 

Bottom line, the next time I spend more than an hour on the strip, I will stay some place worthy of loosing my money in Vegas.  The Excalibur certainly was not that place.",5,3,1

For instance, it is established that the excalibur is not a five star hotel, true, but does it live up to the inexpensive hotel rooms and wifi internet it promises to provide? Yes! It does. And if I am still on a budget, I would definitely stay there again.

The registration\/ check-in line moves along. I think I waited 15 minutes. It wasn't a big deal.

Our room was clean, so were the bedsheets and the bathroom in Tower I. 

The casino areas were nice and they have many updated games, as well as $5 dollar tables in the mornings and afternoons.

The pool was a little cloudy though, but the hot tub was a hot tub.

My girlfriend and I saw the Thunder from Down Under show. It's a must see, truly.

The one thing that was a regrettable experience was the fact that there are these ""marketing"" people with ""TAKE A BREAK"" name tags that are advertising free shows or gaming monies if you take a ""small"" tour of a vacation home opportunity. My husband and I did go on the tour. The food provided gave me severe acid reflux. And the three hours that they estimate it taking, really took 5 hours. The sales people hold you hostage in this room with tables and press you hard to buy a vacation rental. I after we were working into hour five AND I had acid reflux, I lost all respect for the company, ""Vacation Village"" at the Grandview in Las Vegas.  

If you stay at the Excalibur, don't let these Take A Break people rope you into that experience. It was terrible.

The smell lingered through the halls and into the room. Outfitted with terrible wallpaper and disgusting carpet, a 1990s air\/heat box, dated furniture and NASTY linens\/blankets- this place resembled a motel 6 and an extremely low budget casino from a small town- which I would almost prefer over this.

The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful- asking for towels seemed to be too much for them to handle. My friends luggage was lost on the way in and once it was delivered to the hotel, they called and told her she would have to come get it because they didn't have time for at least an hour.

I can not clearly put into words how low budget and disgusting the entire experience was... Even the restaurants within were terrible.

I always receive comp night offers from Excalibur through MLife. I always look forward to my stays there as the staff is friendly, the food and drink options are plentiful and Rick at the lounge bar is the best. 

I am going to Las Vegas in mid October. I checked my MLife as I always do to see what comp nights I have available. I had an offer for 2 free nights mid week at Excalibur. I called to book the rooms. When I gave my dates, I was told comps were not available due to conferences\/conventions in town that week. Ok. No problem. 

Well, on Friday July 1st, my fiancée received an email from Excalibur with an MLife offer inside. The offer was for 2 comp nights mid week. They also included a calendar within the email showing what days were comp and what days were discounted rates. I start looking at the calendar at the week I am going. That whole week (Sun-Thurs) is available to her for comps. I was really upset. The comp was not available to me due to events in town but it is available to her? 

Today, I called the reservation number in the email. I explained why I was calling and asked what the deal was. The man (I don't remember his name) I spoke to told me the offer was available to her at a higher tier than me due to her spending more money there. I said that didn't make sense because I go twice a year to her once every couple years.

Then I started thinking. I am a higher tier than her (I'm Pearl, she is Sapphire) yet she gets a higher tier offer? Then I start to think, what difference does it make when we both have 2 night comp offers but my dates aren't available to me but they are to her? 

Next, I get online and go to MLife.com. I looked up my tax info provided through MLife.com and saw I spent $1,900+ last year at Excalibur. According to their tax info for my fiancée, she spent $752 last year at Excalibur. But the guy on the phone said she got the higher tier due to spending more and they want those people to come back. Now I feel lied to because I spent $1,200 more than her.

But once you step inside your room, you realize that it's not as cool anymore.  

The parking lot is huge, but it is spread out around the hotel rather than being condensed into a parking structure.  So, we ended up in a spot where we had to walk pretty far to get inside the hotel.  Not that I'm lazy, but we had a lot of stuff to carry! 

Check in was easy.  We dared my friend to try the ""$20 Trick"" to see if we could get a room upgrade, but it didn't work-- probably because there were too many bookings for EDC weekend.  

Our room could have used a facelift.  The furnishings were all pretty ugly and must have seen better days.  I've stayed at better equipped Holiday Inns.  Not that I could complain, really, because the price for the room was pretty good! 

This is a practical hotel that fit our needs of 1) being on The Strip 2) storing our things 3) giving us a place to crash at night.  If you are expecting any more than that, or if you'll be spending a lot of time in the hotel, you'll be disappointed.  In that case, I  suggest you drop a bit more cash on a better hotel.

The registration line was pretty long. It took like about 20-30 minutes just to check in. Took a while even though there were a lot of people at the front desk. 

The inside is really great. There are restaurants on the sides of the first floor and they have a buffet on the second floor. It's ~20 bucks but the buffet is BOMB. I went for breakfast and they were making omelette and crepes. They had many different types of food varieties. They even had sushi. 


My biggest problem was the room. I walked in and it looked no one had cleaned it. The beds were the only thing in the room that were changed. The bathroom had towels all over the floor. Also, the trash wasn't taken out at all. I was pretty disappointed. You go to Vegas and have this expectation of these hotels and maybe housekeeping just forgot but it was unacceptable. I called housekeeping and they came and cleaned the room fairly quickly. Besides that the place was nice, the view was great, and the food was amazing. I probably won't stay here a second time since there are so many more hotels to choose from.",2,0,1

When you check in they will offer you an upgrade for more money per night.  If you refuse this upgrade they put you in the worst, unmaintained rooms they have.  I had to dismantle the AC unit to clean it and I had to pull the dresser\/TV stand out repeatedly to reboot the outdated TV system.

The maid went into my jewelry box and stole my earrings. The hotel did NOTHING about it.  The safe was hidden in the dresser drawers in the bottom drawer. There was no sign saying there was a safe in the room. 

The picture of the room on this website is the room I stayed in and it was unacceptable. The staff is rude and knows nothing about customer service. The room's bedding was about as nice as a motel 6's. The air would shut off in the middle of the night. The cheap rooms looked like something from a murder scene. 

The pools were closed expect for two and they were so gross and unsanitary looking that I refused to swim. There was no one serving drinks around the pool I had to keep getting them myself. 

The spa was on of the worst ones I have ever attended. The staff at the spa was young, snotty, and ghetto. There was no locker room attendent when I arrived. I was yelled at by one of the cleaning ladies for not knowing my way around since I wasn't given a tour. There was no fresh fruit or water in the locker room. When the locker room lady finally showed up she came with two small children that she was baby-sitting. Instead of relaxing I had to listen to these little kids run around.

The hotel is now old, outdated, a bit dirty and most of the employees seem very unhappy.  We stayed here because we were on a family vacation and 2 of the 3 nights were free.  Next time I think we will pay the extra money to stay elsewhere.

The employees at the front desk are far from friendly.  After getting a room with a view of a block wall and no sky, we were able to change to a room with a view of the Luxor.  The front desk employee begrudgingly changed our room after I complained and explained to her what I was told when making the reservations (I was told we would receive a room with a view of the South Strip for no extra charge).

The rooms are pretty decent as far as decor and cleanliness go.  The bathroom could sure use a makeover, but was clean enough. The a.c. was the original unit from 1990. The casino is old, dark, dingy and not very lucky!  It was almost impossible to get a ""free"" drink.  I played for over 45 minutes nonstop and no waitress was to be found (and no winning either!).  I swear the casinos in Southern California have better odds of winning.

The swimming pool was down right scary.  My 8 year old son begged to go swimming, so we did.  He ended up getting sick and throwing up that night and I'm convinced it was the pool water.  The pool was filled with adults and kids from age 1 to 15, the water was too warm and very cloudy.  After getting out of the pool, I realized there wasn't even a hint of chlorine smell on our swim clothes, not good.  The restrooms in the pool area were absolutely disgusting.  I won't go into details, use your imagination, it will most likely be spot on.

The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the prices are low and they have a pretty nice arcade for kids.  They could really use a 24 hour cafe type restaurant (they used to have one years ago).  You are forced to go to fast food, expensive eats or leave the hotel and go elsewhere.

All in all, I don't recommend the Excalibur unless you are on a really tight budget and are terrified of staying at Circus Circus (like we were).",3,1,1

The Excalibur is still the best value on the strip, especially when you consider it has a great location, with easy access to the New York, New York, MGM Grand, Luxor and, Mandalay Bay. Most major  hotels are within a 45 minute walk.
Excalibur has a festive atmosphere, a great food court,  an above average buffet, and a friendly staff.

Despite these positive qualities however, I am still not sure whether I should give them another chance.

When i made my reservation over a month in advance, I was assured that the first night deposit of $140 included taxes and the resort fee. I even asked again before ending the call, and the agent once again confirmed that this was the final total for the first night.

When checking in, I was expecting a balance of about $200, but it was actually $268 and change. I was told upon checking in that the first night deposit did not include taxes or resort fee, so I was caught off guard.

The room was better than it was six months ago, with improved ventilation, but I am not exaggerating by stating that this was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in.The mattress had no pliability at all, and it felt crooked.The problem was made worse because we received no housekeeping service on Sunday the 26th.

The housekeeper came by at about 9:30 AM, but we were not ready, so she left. I then went to ask her for some towels from her cart a little later. She probably thought that since I asked for towels, that this was all I needed for the day, ans hence she never returned. I was surprised to get back to the room at 6 PM to find she had never returned.

I got no sleep at all the last night because of the uncomfortable bed. I never imagined what a problem it was going to be to try to sleep in a unmade bed. 

Also, shame on MGM resorts for their  $13 vallet fee every 24 hours.  This fee began a few weeks ago.",0,0,0

Room: the rooms in Tower II are recently renovated and come with a new flat screen tv, granite countertops, modern carpet and upholstery. I don't believe this is the case for Tower I, which still looks like it was furnished 25 years ago. 

Casino: one of the more smokey casinos in town. I usually go elsewhere to play so I can enjoy better ventilation since I don't smoke. 

Pool: there are 4 pools. The first and largest has never been open in the 3 times I've stayed here. It's beautiful, just never really available for guests. Also, the pools close at 6pm, but that's standard for Vegas. Otherwise I find them to be very nice with ample seating (although little shade until after 3:30).

Spa: The spa is very nice and allows guests full use of the facilities (private pool and hot tub, steam showers etc) the entire day of their appointment starting at 6am. 

Shops: shops between the Excalibur and Luxor are standard resort quality and pricing. 

Restaurants: the themed restaurants within the property are 2-star. Think Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral. Good enough food, a bit over priced, but convenient. 

Shows: I've never seen any of the shows within the property as they seem a bit cheesy.

The last thing is a big setback since this place is popular among families and you always could get away from splashing children for free on my previous years.

Excalibur is definitely one of the less impressive hotel on the Vegas strip, but if you compare it to other hotels in another city, you'll realize that the quality is amazing for the price. You have all the wonderful amenities of a swimming pool, a decent room size, and a large bathroom. It is also one of the cheaper hotels on the strip.

There were a few things that detached from its rating: the pillows, they're way too tall. I prefer the flatter ones, but they don't get you the option. The quality of the TV shows, it was very grainy like in the early 2000s. 

However, most people that go to Vegas is there to explore nightlife, shows, restaurants, and shops, not to lounge around in their hotel and watch T.V. or lay around in bed all day anyways. I think Excalibur has everything one needs to enjoy their trip to Vegas while still keeping your wallet happy.",11,2,4

Our room was clean (though wish it had a fridge) and had a great view of New York New York and the strip. It was easy to check in, always able to get a taxi, and I had the best luck at this casino over the others :) We also really enjoyed the Excalibur buffet (twice), ate at Bucca di Beppo inside the hotel and had some beers and watched the game at Octane (bar next to the buffet).

I booked 4 rooms for a very good price.  When I checked in, the friendly receptionist offered to upgrade to tower 2 for about $6 more, which I did.  The location for tower 2 was really good.  It's close to the pool and food court.  Also, with this upgrade, I could check out at 12.

Coupon book:
The room also came with a coupon book for $20 toward bar\/ some restaurants.
I used the $20 on Lobby Bar to order some juices for my kids.  I have to say that the bartender did not like my group of people who used the $20 food coupon.  He was impatient to us, but smiling and welcoming to others who paid.  I guess he thought we wouldn't tip him...... That was not a pleasant experience.....

Pool:
It closed at 7pm..  I have never been to a casino with pool closes before 9.  Kids were all so disappointed.  We went the next day morning at 9.  Then we found out the water slide opens at 10.  Also, adult pool costs $10 to enter...  This was really not kids friendly.   

Dragon dungeon:
Really good prices for kids to spend time.  Loved this area!!

Parking: 
Limited parking spaces by the casino.  We had to park behind the casino and cross a street where had no stop sign.  People were driving pretty fast on that street.  It was dangerous and not convenient at all.

Overall, I liked the room, the acade and the food court.  However, because of the pool hours and ""not friendly"" bartender who does not like people using coupon, I give 3 stars to this hotel.",0,0,0

Almost immediately upon getting into the room and checking it out, we realized it was not at all worth the cost.  

The first night we tried the bath tub, only to see chewed gum stuck to the light on the ceiling.  It was on the back facing the wall behind the tub, so clearly they don't do detailed cleaning... ever.  

The curtain behind the tub was broken so we couldn't put it up.  That window had our only good view of the strip, so it was disappointing.  

There were mystery stains on the floor and bed, which is never good to see in a hotel.

The sun rising outside our window the next morning really illuminated how extremely dusty everything was. 

Our AC worked very well, but still somehow every time we went back into the room, we reeled at the overly musty smell.

The whole building reeked of cigarette smoke and the smell is the first thing to hit you when walking in the front door.   Multiple times throughout the weekend when considering what to do, I found myself thinking\/saying, ""We should go to one of the nice hotels to (gamble\/drink\/eat\/walk around)""

I did find it ridiculous that the pool closes at 6pm.  The one night we were looking for a place to sit outside, away from noise and smoke, we were told we couldn't even SIT by the pool.  For the cost we paid, I think we should have been able to just sit outside.

Most of the other wedding guests also stayed here, and the first morning at breakfast we all exchanged our own dirty\/broken\/gross room stories.  Some other people also had dirty floors and stained pillow cases.

The pros:
Every staff member we encountered was friendly.  Nothing over the top, but competent and not rude, pretty much what I would expect from a hotel.

We only did The Buffet for breakfast, but it was very good each time.

As a guest, the wedding went very well, and the reception at Buco's was well run and the food was delicious.

The bride talked about the pleasant experience she had with the planning and execution.

AC is EXTREMELY loud, it is not built into the hotel, but a separate machine that is placed on the window. This machine had no built in thermometer, so there was no setting a temperature, which was a drag. Coming back from EDC having it be hot, then sleeping and having to wake up to turn it off. This was a non-stop problem. Either way, I got through it.

The bed is surprisingly comfortable to me.

There is no fridge OR wi-fi..... which... is very sad to me. The room itself wasn't terrible or anything, but nothing amazing as well.

If possible, I would stay on a hotel ON the strip, just because of the experience, but I wouldn't say Excalibur is bad. For a hotel on the older side with not much remodeling, it was not a totally bad experience.",2,1,1

All of the other hotels around are pretty expensive. We got a non-remodeled room, because it was the cheapest option, and it was just OK. They told us when we made the reservation that they have upgraded some of the things in the room so I was expecting there to be new things. The only thing that was new in the room was the TV and everything else was very old. On our second night we walked the strip and when we came back to our room our key card would not work. We tried several times to get into our room and it just wasn't working. So we went to the registration desk told them our key card wasn't working and they gave us new ones and told us to keep them away from other credit cards and cell phones. So we go back to our room and try the new key cards and they still didn't work. At this point we were mad, went back downstairs and complained. They told us they will send security and they will be able open the door for us. 10 minutes later security comes up and tries getting into our room. Well that didn't work either. So he called engineering to come open the door. He left and we waited 15 more minuets for engineering to come and he finally was able to unlock our door with this hanger looking tool. So after an hour we were able to get in our room and go to sleep. The engineer told us to call the locksmith in the morning so he could check it out. So the next morning we call the locksmith and he comes to our room and tells us our key card reader is dirty. I'm thinking ""sure it is"" and he cleans it. We only had one more night at the hotel so I wash't going to make a big deal and change rooms but I would have if we were staying longer because I am sure the same thing would happen again in the future.

As far as amenities go, the rooms are nice.  Very clean and the staff was very diligent about cleaning while I was gone.  They also have a nice pool area and the casino was very comprehensive with a poker room, sports bookie, table games and machines.  The casino's appearance definitely feels dated, but whatevs.

I only have three gripes.  First, I didn't care for the restaurants they offered.  They were either very pricey, sit-down affairs or cheap take out (McDonalds, Krispie Kream, Starbucks, etc.).  I would have liked a cafe-style area similar to what they have at New York, New York or, say, Paris with healthier options.  

My second wish is that they had better cell phone reception.  I stayed on the 15th floor and I could barely get reception, especially data.  This wouldn't be a problem except for (gripe #3) the lack of Wifi.  The rooms only have a wired ethernet port.  I'm not sure who lugs their laptop on a vacation to Vegas, but they're all set.  Everyone else is going to have to rely on spotty data reception.

That said, if you're traveling on a budget or with kids (who will enjoy the King Arthur motif), Excalibur will do just fine.

They had a taco area, which I liked because they were taco. But tacos don't cost $17. Their selection wasn't very expansive or special. 

I do like the idea of their arcade downstairs being like a carnival with people manning the games. Their arcades work and the people there look so bored because no one there is playing their games. 

On the other hand, their Tournament of Kings show was quite amusing. I wouldn't go back again but that one experience was fun and I would recommend it to those that haven't seen it already.

I mean, my parents have furniture from the 80's that can put this furniture to shame! The carpet, covers and upholstery looks like it's from the medieval times themselves!! Despite all this, I was still just happy to be out of the car and in Vegas... until I turned down the blanket. God only knows what kind of fluids left those stains! I was absolutely horrified so I went downstairs and asked to change rooms or pay to upgrade to a better room. The guy behond the desk then rambled on this paragraph that I'm sure he has to say 100 times a night about how we can't change rooms tonight and when I asked if we could upgrade our second night in advance, he wouldn't let me do that either. I then asked him for fresh linens so I can atleast TRY to sleep on this disgusting bed and he looked at me like I was stupid and told me he ""I can't just GIVE you sheets"".

On our last night, Tuesday night, my sister and I decided to test our luck at the $5 Blackjack table. We were hoping to get a seat, but it was packed. We decided to stand behind until someone decide to move. The dealer, who's name I will not put on here for privacy purposes, immediately saw us.

I paused for a few seconds before answering that we're from America. Our mood immediately changed. We were upset, embarrassed, humiliated, offended and in some kind of way, we felt violated.

We had booked a suite which was a nice size for the amount of time we stayed and housekeeping did an excellent job. The casino was extremely smokey and as a non smoker it was difficult to be there. The food court was convenient and open late but the healthy options were extremely limited for breakfast. They have a really nice smoothie bar but it doesn't open until 10am. The biggest reason I'm giving excalibur a 2\/5 is because of the staff members who constantly harass you about free or discounted tickets each time you walk by. My husband and I were asked 3 times in one day before 9 am. It was ridiculous. They target couples and try to get you to go to a timeshare presentation in exchange for discounts.... stay strong and avoid them. The location was far down the strip but everything was accessible with a bus pass. I will bet staying elsewhere next time.",0,0,0

There is a mandatory $15 resort fee which allows you internet access through an ethernet cable (who uses these still?!), gym access, and phone calls.  It is nowhere worth $15.

The bathrooms are gross.  The towels are cheap and stiff.  I recommend your own toiletries if you do decide to stay here.

The bed wasn't that bad but the sheets are pretty old and I was freezing cold.  With the heater, I thought I was going to suffocate and each time it turned on, it scared the daylights out of me.

I would only stay here again if I was desperate.  Yes I enjoyed the staff, but the amenities are just not worth it.

Upon check-in during my most recent stay, the front desk was kind enough to upgrade our room at no charge.  The room and bathroom were immaculate, bath amenities were great, and we had a nice view of the strip.  The TV isn't HD, but that wasn't important to us as we were out and about most of the time.  Room service was very responsive in bringing more towels and bath products when I called.  On our last day, they gave me a good rate when I requested a later check-out time.  Since we had a few hours in between check-out and our flight, we left our bags with the concierge for free while seeing a show and had no problems at any point in the process.  The food court upstairs was great for quick eats, like Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, Auntie Anne's, and Tropical Smoothie Cafe.  There is also a Johnny Rocket's on the first level.  On one of my previous stays, I had vouchers for the buffet restaurant there and it was decent.  The pool area is nice and spacious but not as swanky as the trendier hotels, which isn't important to me.  They have complimentary WiFi.

The casino has an odd smell mixed with cigarette smoke, especially when compared to the other casinos we walked through, but we weren't overly sensitive to this and didn't spend a lot of time there.

You have to do some walking to get around outside of the hotel, but Uber there is super cheap and there are still some hotels to explore that are in short walking distance.  Also, it's easy to get to Luxor via the indoor walkway inside the hotel.

Yes, there are some inconveniences - no fridge, no microwave, no free breakfast, not one of the trendier hotels.  However, nothing was unexpected nor surprising during any of my stays.",2,0,0

The first issue was poor customer service. Room Service hours are printed as 6 am - 2 am. I called at 1:40 am and they had already turned the phone line off. I called the front desk asking where 24\/7 food is available, the front desk associate told me Johnny Rockets was open 24\/7. I explained they had a sign out front saying they were closed till 6 am. The associate said she would call the restaurant to find out and contact me back. She never called back which is my complaint. It's disrespectful of my time and money as a guest. 

We had a late checkout for 3 pm and left the ""Privacy Please"" sign on our door. Upon entering the room at 2:20 pm our room had been cleaned and empty! I called the front desk and it took over 30 minutes for security to come. Part of the  missing items were 4 bottles of champagne. An assistant manager Cassandra said that even when alcohol is left behind the cleaning associates do not remove it, they are to call a manager to come collect the alcohol. Ultimately the cleaning associate played dumb to all the items I disclosed as missing but admitted there were bottles of champagne. She said she left them in the hallway but now they're gone. An executive by the name of Claudia Hernandez came up to our room and said the employee admitted to throwing out our possessions (including multiple items of clothing and experiencing an enormous financial lost) but as an executive she could offer us nothing! Not even a true apology that her employees so carelessly fail to follow guidelines that would have prevented our items from being dropped in the trash. How insulting. We were told to wait for Risk Management to contact us and we weren't given any follow up information. 

I would warn someone not stay here because they do not follow their own policies to ensure business operates smoothly and they do not have any remorse when they make humongous errors",6,0,0

(Better than my friend's view, a brick wall...)
On to the cleanliness, not too clean. The room was straight, there was visible damage to the wall and ceiling. The bathroom was not clean at all. Used soap on the shower soap dish, a large clump of hair on top of the shower door and one roll of toilet paper. The walls of the shower were a bit mungy as well. 
The hotel advertises widescreen TVs. They most certainly aren't HD though. (again when one is in Vegas one doesn't watch too much TV.. )
The ""Lobby Bar"" was offering free drinks with coupons. Good luck getting a bartender. As soon as one sees you have one of the little blue coupons they walk the other way and help everyone else at the bar before you. (I suggest going to the Sherwood Bar at the other side of the lobby, the bartenders are nicer and will serve you right away)
The food court was good, clean and filled with options. 
The buffet, the first breakfast was pretty good, the last one I had could have been better. 
The pool was great, the hours, not so great. 7 pm close?  Other hotels have a later pool closing, why wouldn't Excalibur?

In the end, the experience wasn't bad. I'd return and stay again. The rates were good and we were able to reserve rooms for all the people in my group meeting up.

It was one of 4 hotels associated with the conference I was attending - Mandalay Bay, Luxor, and NY-NY were the others.  Excalibur was the cheapest.

Rough impression from visiting the other 3 casinos?  This was the one that felt the cheapest.  That being said, it wasn't a terrible place to stay.  The tram runs directly from here to Mandalay Bay, the conference casino.  There's a walkway directly to the NY, as a gateway to the rest of the strip. There was nothing especially objectionable about the rooms or casino itself, it just had a cheesier feel to it.

It had penny video poker, my game of choice while I was in Vegas. I'm not a gambler.

The biggest problem? When we arrived, midday Sunday, there was no food! Seemed like every place in the casino was closed. That's what left us stranded at Dick's Last Resort! Because it was, it really was.

There was also a bikini-clad dancer at the Excalibur at this time, a phenomenon I didn't see there or elsewhere the rest of the trip. Weird.

You know what area they fall down on? Toilet seats. That's right. I sat down on the (closed) toilet seat, and... it cracked in half.  Look, I've put on a few pounds in the last years, but I'm still on the slim side of your average adult male.  Toilet seats shouldn't just split apart!!!

Ok, really, there aren't many problems to complain about.  Nothing super stellar though, either. I don't have anything to compare it to, as it was the only place we STAYED, but a lot of the other casinos gave the impression of being more fun and exciting and novel.",1,2,1

I asked the Valet how long it would take to get our bags to the room, he says ""not long, check in go to the baggage desk and they will send them right up"". We check in, go to baggage desk and the lady at the desk informs us the Casino is NO LONGER ALLOWED TO TAKE BAGS TO THE ROOM! I through a fit and she continues to tell me it is a new policy. Then after throwing an even bigger fit, she says it will be an hour and a half to get our bags. So I say fine bring them on the cart and I will wheel the cart myself, she says that is is casino policy she can not allow us to use the cart. I then tell her we will leave and demand our money back, so she has a bell man walk with us to our room with the cart full of luggage.

Guess what happened when we went to check out? Yep, no bell men. So after a night partying in Vegas I had to drag all my luggage out to the car. The funny thing is it was not just me dragging a ton of luggage, a bunch of other super upset people where dragging their luggage as well. 
To make matters worse, at about 8am the entire casino smells horribly of bad disgusting Italian food. I like Buco De Beppo but I certainly don't  want the smell of bad Lasagna at 8am because apparently once a week the cook a huge amount and it stinks up all the rooms. We left a day early.",2,1,1

The room was clean, I didn't inspect it like some of the nutsos who come equipped with their black lights and white gloves but it didn't smell like feet and there were no noticeable stains anywhere.

 I think I spent all of 7 hours in the room, 5 of which were spent sleeping, 1 getting ready to leave, and 1 trying to get the motivation to drag my hungover butt out of bed. Room Decor was definitely dated but since I wasn't there to stare at the walls in the bedroom it was OK. Shower was clean, water pressure wasn't very good but it rinsed soap off so it did what is was there for. I had little to no interaction with the hotel staff, although we did take advantage of the free jello shot cards being handed out for Dicks Last Resort. 

The pool was OK, one was closed but we sat by one that was open and I tried to turn my pastey complexion a little bronzer (I failed).

When we got to the room, it was the last room on the floor at the end of the hall and everything seemed off about it. There was a light bulb missing in one of the lights. The TV was broken and wouldn't turn on. 

When we went to take a shower, there was conditioner that they offered, but it ended up being chunky and looked like it had gone bad, like sour milk. The next day, when they replaced our toiletries, there was no conditioner available and when we called to ask for some, they said they didn't even have conditioner, only conditioning shampoo... We asked for them to bring a couple up to our room and they didn't come for 1.5 HOURS, and when they did, they brought us a giant bag of like 20 different bottles, including 'shampoo' and 'conditioning shampoo'...

My view was right over the pool!  The fitness center is pretty good with many cardio machines, some weights and lockerooms.

The check-in line was long, but this year I was upgraded to Pearl status so there is separate line for Pearl status and higher. Other MLife Properties have a separate line for gold status and higher.
My only gripe about the location is the driveways can only be accessed by eastbound on Tropicana or south on Las Vegas Blvd.  If your traveling west on Tropicana, you have go about 1\/2 down, U-turn and come back over the freeway because there is no break in the center divider for you to left turn.

That said, I have stayed at the Excalibur about 90% of the times I've gone to Vegas.  That is NOT because it is fabulous, but because it is decent and cheap.  The rooms are usually anywhere from $30-$60\/night, and for Vegas, that is great!  And, let's be honest...spending less on a hotel room means that you have more money to spend on cab rides, drinks, and gambling.  And isn't that really the point of Vegas?

Anyway, for someone who wants to really ""do Vegas right,"" I wouldn't recommend the Excalibur (maybe the Wynn instead?).  But, for someone who just needs a place to crash between bouts of fun, the Excalibur is perfect.

Plus, if you're a total hotel snob (and I am anywhere other than in Vegas), you can just pretend you're a prince or princess because the Excalibur is a castle!  Always makes me feel better!",4,1,0

Each time I got to Las Vegas, I stay at a different hotel. My recent trip in July 2017 was Excalibur's turn. I received two free nights from the M-life players club. 2 ""free"" nights was still $169 after resort fees and parking. 

I liked Excalibur. They are linked by Tram to Mandolin Bay and The Luxor. It's on a corner lot across from Tropicana and New York New York (always fun to hear people screaming on the roller coaster). 

Inside there are two towers-- The Resort Tower and the Royal Tower. The Royal Tower is the updated rooms. We stayed in the Royal Tower. When you go to the elevator there are two sections to walk to. Stay left if your room is odd number and right if your room number is even basically (may be the other way around, but you get the idea). 

The room was an average room. No frills and it faced the dead part of the strip. The thing that I could see was the Luxor Pyramid, which is always pretty cool to look at. We stayed on the 26th floor. 

Inside the casino are fun shops, restaurants, and lots of machines to play. I only spent $24 on slots this whole trip. I was more interested in seeing shows and the strip then stay inside and waste my money. This was hard for me because I like the slot machine. I can be a slotaholic. 

Dick's resort is inside here. It's the restaurant that is rude to you on purpose. I wanted to go, but never made it. Downstairs, nightly, there is a dinner show, Tournament of Kings, and it has live Jousting. I didn't make it to that, either, but I will one day! Never enough time! it 

The pool-- Excalibur has four pools. They close at 6 and 7 PM which is nuts and not cool. They aren't more than 4 feet. Two of the pools have a waterfall which is somewhat relaxing to stand under, one has a small (super small) slide. There is an adult pool ( you get free water. Don't have to pay $5 like everyone else) although you have to pay extra to get in here. There are no kids allowed obviously so this is more where the single people hang out. We went in there because it was less crowded and I was on vacation without my kids-- I certainly didn't want to be around others lol. Honestly though, we checked out all pools.",11,3,5

I don't really know the rate, because it was part of a bus tour package deal, but I know that Excalibur usually has one of the cheapest room rates on the strip.

We came on a Monday afternoon (surprisingly a good amount of people there). I wasn't expecting much because I knew this would be a older hotel, and I have definitely been in worst during Chinese bus tours. 

The room was a pleasant surprise:
-For an older hotel, they did try to modernize the decor, and it was simple but nice. 
-Beds were comfy, and pillows supportive
-Room temp was just right. You couldn't tell that it was 102 outside. 
-Room was clean
-Bathroom was huge, but no bathtub. Just a big shower. Two sinks. 
-Water pressure in shower was good (so important)
-Lots of towels

We had a room on the 8th floor of tower 2, so no real view. Service was pretty helpful though when I was looking for a way to get farther up the strip. If you want to stay near the south end of the strip, without going too far, this would be a good place to stay. I thought most areas were walkable and they even have a free shuttle to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. We ended up walking back from Cosmopolitan and it was doable, but kind of uncomfortable in 95 degree weather at 8pm at night.

They evacuated everyone while the fire department did their job. It took a few hours before we were allowed to go back to our rooms. Because of this, the hotel waived the nightly fee and gave everyone a free pass to the Round Table Buffet for breakfast or lunch.

BFF and I stayed in a remodeled room. The tower we were in was perfect for us, it is right by the pool and right on the corner, so we didn't have to walk forever to get to our room. (I can't remember if it was 1 or 2! Sorry) Plus we had an awesome view of NYNY and the MGM. The room itself was okay. WAY nicer then the old rooms. The widescreen TV was nice, but it's Vegas - we didn't come to watch TV. The bathroom was large, with Kohler faucets and a walk in shower, so no gross standing water to worry about. 

The front desk was nice enough to let us check in at 10am, instead of 3pm, and for free. On our check out day, we did have to pay $40 to have a ""late"" check out...which was so worth it.  We didn't have to leave the room until 3pm.

You can tell that Excalibur is trying to attract more 'party' people. On weekends, they have a 'party pit', with blackjack, roulette, etc. The big draw is the Pussycat Doll-style dancers they have dancing around the tables. Kinda bizarre, but BFF was told by a few guys that they had been sitting at the tables all day and night. The pool area was also remodeled. Supposedly they have a wave pool and an adults only pool, but for some reason, those were closed when we were there. However, the pool that was open was large and had seating IN the pool. It was so nice to sip at my margarita while in the pool.

The Excalibur is not luxury, but the price and location is right. I'd stay again!",0,1,0

I don't get it.  Excalibur is exactly what a hotel is supposed to be- clean, vibrant, and full of life.  Myself and two girl friends spent the weekend in Vegas for my birthday.  We booked a three-night stay at Excalibur and the price was magnificent- no complaints at all.

Upon arrival, we were greeted at the entrance and the door was opened for us by one of the employees.  The smell was fantastic, a perfumed smell throughout the casino floor, we didn't even know smoking was authorized as we did not smell one cigarette.  We checked in and went to our room.  Our room was exactly what we were expecting- two queen sized beds, flat-screen television, window view of the strip, and a clean and bright bathroom.  We were pleased with our accommodations.

The only complaint I have (and it isn't really even a complaint) was the lack of cocktail waitresses on the casino floor.  I played a considerable amount of Blackjack and it was difficult to get a drink order placed.  I stopped one of the waitresses and she said ""I'm sorry, but my area is over there"" and pointed to a row of tables across from us.  Ok, no problem, it wasn't a deal breaker, but it wasn't exactly convenient.

My friends and I also saw two shows- Thunder From Down Under (swoon, handsome Aussie men) and The Tournament of Kings (swoon handsome medieval kings).  Both shows were absolutely AMAZING!  NO complaints whatsoever.  I HIGHLY recommend you see those two shows.  For discounts \/ free tickets download the app ""Vegas Slots"" where you are able to earn ""loyalty points"" for free shows, food, gambling, etc.  I was able to redeem some of my points for free a free buffet meal, $50 in free-play gambling credits, and a free Thunder From Down Under ticket, YES!

On our final day we decided to rent a cabana in the pool area.  The spa staff were very pleasant and their uniforms were neat, clean, and tidy.  While at our private cabana we had a superior experience.  Cabana ""boys"" and waitresses stopped by frequently asking if there was anything we needed - very convenient for a day at the pool.  My only complaint, and not a deal breaker was the timeliness in which we received our food \/ drinks.  Perhaps a dedicated cabana wait-staff could be implemented.  

All in all my friends and I had a wonderful stay at the Excalibur Hotel- my mind still can't wrap itself around all of the one and two star reviews.  I think folks assumed Excalibur would be like The Bellagio or Caesar's Palace, it's not.  It's a fun place to stay that includes gambling, food, and poolside resort relaxation.  I will definitely stay at Excalibur the next time I am in town.",6,3,4

Can't really complain because to of the three nights stayed here were free through MyVegas.  Stayed in tower 2 so that was really convenient to get to the casino, pool and excal skywalk\/food court. Wasn't too impressed with the room though.  It is literally just a decent place to sleep and shower.  The room itself to me seemed a little dated.  The linen on the bed was way too thin, which leads me to my problem with the air.  Upon entering the room it was really warm with a muggy smell.  I just figured if we turned on the air it would clear out the smell, which it did but no matter the temp we put it on it was still freezing and the linen on the bed was too thin to be able to warm up.  Then we turned the  heat on which made the room feel better but the muggy smell came back.  At this point we had to choose between a cozy, muggy room or a cold clean fresh air room.  Again, FREE so I won't complain.  However, the bathroom was nice and large.  The linen in the bathroom was definitely of a better quality than the linen in the bedroom.  After leaving I thought I could not come back to stay here unless free.  I guess I should mention that previous stays in Vegas included Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Aria and Vdara so I guess my expectations were a little too high given the comparisons.  With that being said, I will be returning to Excalibur for New Years Eve week because this is the most reasonably priced hotel on the strip for that time of year.  Other reviews have stated that tower 2 is more updated than tower 1.  I should also mention that the wifi was extremely slow so I wish they would've waived the resort fees given that was the only thing I attempted to use listed under the cost of resort fee.",0,0,0

It is now connected and affiliated with Mandalay and Luxor through the Mlife group so we went to check it out. Excalibur did not have the tacky and annoying soliciting that Luxor had. Mandalay is newer and updated compared to Excalibur, but I sure enjoyed the gambling tables better at Excalibur than the other hotels in the these three connected Mlife hotels. You get what you pay for, so I'm sure the rooms might not be as nice here as Mandalay or Luxor, but at least you know what you get with Excalibur.

If you were expecting champagne dreams at cheap screw top wine prices, then you're better off not staying here and paying more to go stay at the Wynn or the Encore or something or you'll be disappointed. But for the rest of us that still want to save money while wanting to stay on the strip, I was very pleasantly surprised. I will admit I was scared of all the negative reviews before I went, and considered almost canceling, especially in light of the whole murder\/suicide thing, but I really enjoyed my stay there.

Basically my gf and I decided to head to Las Vegas for New Years. We really wanted to stay on the strip and the Excalibur was by far the cheapest place for the location. I go to Vegas at least once or twice a year, and I never really need to spend a lot of time in the hotel room, other than to sleep and get ready to go out. If you're the kind of person that spends a lot of time in their room, then yeah, you also probably won't like this place, but if you're like me, it's perfect. The staff  I encountered was always friendly and helpful.

 I will say the casino is smokey, maybe a little bit more than average, but every casino in the city is a little smokey, so I didn't think this one was vastly and horribly worse than the others.  Also, the timeshare people never bothered me. I only ever ran into two the whole time I was there, and both times they immediately backed off when we said "" no thank you"". The room was clean, spacious and comfortable, with a cool view of the Luxor and the mountains, and this was even in unrenovated Tower 1. We were having such a good time, we stayed an extra night and I registered for a player's card. 

Also, I booked through Expedia and it very clearly states that they will charge you a resort fee! I can't speak for other booking methods, but where Expedia is concerned it's not like it was some kind of scam cause they mention, I think at least twice, in regular print, that they will charge you.

All in all, I thought the place was fun and good for the price.",5,3,0

1. There were questionable stains in our curtains (body fluid), a lipstick stain on the jacuzzi, the jacuzzi curtains has questionable stains as well. Lastly, the backboard of the bed has some nasty stains. Pictures will be attached.
2. There wasn't enough towels and merely 3 beauty care products only.

Even though it's towards one end of the strip, it's actually a really good location and easy to get to everything from there.  There are so many good food and drink options within the hotel.

I have gone to Vegas before but he has not. He made all the arrangements for us, I arrived and enjoyed the plans and the chivalry.
The hotel is a bit out dated but not too bad. We have definitely stayed in worse. The room was clean and spacious, the bed was very comfy and they have the best pillows ever! The bathroom was large but did not have a bathtub, just a shower. There was lots of counter space for the keg, Jack Daniels, ginger ale, 2 tooth brushes and some makeup. 
The view we had was amazing, there was a safe and a large closet. So overall the room was fine.
The Internet service at the hotel is a piece of crap. There is no WiFi in Excalibur, you have to go down to the lobby, pay to go online and pay to print anything out. The computer we used froze up after 5 minutes, I was in the middle of printing out my boarding pass!!!!!  We had to call into customer support to get any resolution. We couldn't get threw. Then, as we were waiting to get threw over the phone the computer jumped to a 20 minute time (when it was just clocked at 5 minutes 45 seconds). So that meant to me that i was getting charged $22 and then someone was going to have my boarding pass when it would finally print, it never printed. What the hell??????  Freaking Vegas.
I brushed it off and gave it all to God. With that out of our hands, we found an All American Burger place in the hotel. I don't know if it was the Vegas air or lack of nutrition but it was the best damn turkey burger I've ever had. Loved it!!!!
There is a tram that runs between hotels and shopping, which was timely and efficient. A very nice perk.
I wouldn't stay here again but I would recommend it to anyone who is on a budget and staying on that side of the strip. Not entirely awful at all.

I actually stayed here this time and felt like I made the right choice.  All I was looking for was a place to keep my stuff and take a shower between marathon gambling sessions and binge drinking and stuffing my gullet with massive portions of freshly killed carcass.

I checked out reservations online and then called them directly and found out that making a reservation over the phone was actually going to cost me a total of .56 cents more than making them online.  WTF?  So much for getting a better deal from calling the casino directly.  Thanks MGM-Mirage!

When I arrived to check-in I was hoping all the negativity that I had read here wouldn't apply to me.  Well guess what?  It didn't!  They checked me in 3 hours early with no problems whatsoever, they gave me a free room upgrade without me having to ask, gave me the location preference and bed size I requested, and knocked off another 46 bucks off the price of my total bill.   The room didn't smell like smoke, and it was clean in appearance unless you really really looked for small stuff.

That being said, I like this spot because you are right between the MGM and the Mandalay pretty much, with walkways connecting that whole corner of the strip.  The casino is aged but the employees are nice.  I had a good time in the casino here and the lounges.  I was actually kind've disappointed that I never got approached by the 'party girls' another reviewer mentioned!  Right now the Excalibur is being used as a sort've experimental casino.  MGM-Mirage is trying out new things here first to see how they work out, before deploying them to other casinos.  An example of what I'm talking about is the video-poker room.  They took out the traditional tables and dealers for this new experimental system. I didn't really care for it.  I mean, you can't really watch a machine to see if it's cheating now can you?

 The "" revamp"" rooms were still sub-par, and I don't mean sub-par with a nicer hotel, I mean sub-par with a motel

To start the service I received was good all around, from the cabana servers, to the check in staff. Everyone that we encountered was very helpful and kind, which is a nice plus in a hotel. I love when I am valued by the place I give my money.  Unfortunately that is where the good ends.

On to the rooms, which is were the majority of this two star rating is coming from.  They were new 'remodeled' rooms, yet our pillows were stained, our comforter had a burn mark(in a smoking free room), and the comforter also had nail polish on it. The beds were also rock hard, in the 4 nights I was there I didn't get a decent night sleep at all. Overall the room felt dirty. The shower also had extremely low water pressure and backed up every night, despite maintenance coming to our room. 

The pool was decent. There were 4 different pools and one was an 18+ pool, which I do think is a nice touch, yet they were just pools. No bells and whistles like other hotels. 

Also beware there are tons of kids at this hotel, and many unsupervised. Me and a few friends were heading out the the pool one morning, we were on the 21st floor and got in an elevator with two boys, who seemed maybe about 11ish and they had pushed every button on the way down. So we stopped on every floor from the 21st, on.

I was forced to stay here as it was one of the three ""conference hotels"" for the conference I was in town for this week, but I had registered so late that both the higher end options - Mandalay Bay and Luxor - were sold out. 

I've been in corporate America long enough to not mess with the way things are ""done"" - staying elsewhere and justifying it was more work than I was prepared to undertake. But it would not be a stretch to say that I was dreading my Excalibur stay more than anything else during my trip to Las Vegas this week, thanks to the aforementioned less than rosy Yelp reviews. 

My stay was full of pluses and minuses, which makes this a solid three star review. 
--- Check in took over thirty minutes (minus), but the person checking me in (Cindy K.) was extremely warm and friendly (plus). 
--- Cindy put me in a Royal Tower ground floor room with a king bed. The room was super close to the casino floor and fast to get to (plus) but smelled of smoke from the casino floor (minus). 
--- My room was spacious, comfortable, and had a working safe (plus) but the carpet was a bit worn (like in the rest of the hotel) and two of the six dresser drawers didn't open (minus). 
--- Food options at the hotel were mostly limited to chains (minus), but it is a quick walk away from the excellent food choices near the New York New York casino and hotel (plus). 
--- They charged me a $10 per day resort fee for ""internet, gym access and printing of boarding passes"" (minus) but the internet was good and the gym was well equipped. 

Some things I didn't like: 
* There is a lot of pushing of shows and other services. 
* There are hookers plying their trade out in the open - I especially noticed this on Friday evening. 
* They charge an additional $10 per day fee to use the men's locker room and sauna at the gym! 
--- Some things I liked: 
* There is a tram to the Mandalay Bay (where my conference was). 
* The poker room is small and ideal for beginners like me. They offer free classes every day at noon, which gave me enough confidence to play a bit of 2-6 limit hold em later that night. 
* The service in general is very good. Everyone I asked for help was courteous and useful.

Everything in this hotel looks outdated although it does look clean and well kept.  I didn't have high expectations coming here anyways.  (side note:  I'm assuming the upgraded rooms look slightly different according to other Yelp reviews)

I don't gamble so I can't give the best review about the casino.  Every casino looks the same to me:  slot machines and card tables.

I guess it's ok if you don't mind the old vibe.",2,2,1

The issues I had were with the elevator and staff. The elevator was by far the scariest I have ever been in. I heard other guests say ""that didn't sound good"" at least 5 times during my stay. Also, the staff was constantly hounding us to take part in their specials or pre-book our next trip.

They have always wanted to stay here because they wanted to ""stay in a castle.""  I was not that impressed.  It was disappointing because I stayed here probably 10 years ago and it was much better at that time.  I got a deal through their website for $35 a night which was nice but I definitely got what I paid for.  The rooms were pretty basic.  There were noticeable scratches all over the furniture and the bathroom floor had cracks and marks which wouldn't have been a big deal except there were very big and noticeable.  The nice thing for our room was that we had a big window that the kids could sit infront of and look across at the NY NY rollercoaster.  There was no WIFI which was thoroughly disappointing.  They have a cord if you want to connect a laptop but if you have an iPad...forget about it.  They have a decent kids arcade.  They also have a pool area that my kids enjoyed.  The area for the kids was 3-3.5 feet deep all across and there was a waterfall and small slide that my kids loved.  The hotel itself is like a maze which I didn't enjoy. They have a decent food court area upstairs along with other restaurants.  I think if you are looking for a basic room on the strip for a decent price then it's okay to stay here.  If you are looking for something really nice and comfortable and more aesthetic then go somewhere else on the strip.",1,1,1

 Let me tell you about the time share experience. While walking thought the Casio I was sucked into a timeshare tour. Thinking it would be legit since we were staying at a MGM property it wouldn't be too bad for a time share tour. The sales person who set this up said these tours are to show off the property and to have good word of mouth. 

Our tour time was at 10:45. We were told it round be two hours. Then we found out that the two hours started once we sat with a sales person. The bus was late. We were the told to sit in this holding area, where we stayed for about an hour. I went to ask when this was going to start to one of the sales people. He was so rude. At that point I told him that I didn't not want to go on the tour and would like my $50 deposit back. He rudely said ok and left me standing there. He went to the desk and was taking to a women. I waited 15 mins then I went to the desk and was tested rudely again. Then we finally got our money back from Daisy. Who complained to us about other customers.

After we got back to the hotel we went and talked to the manger Mitch. He did nothing but look at us with a blank stare and asked if we had gotten out money back. I feel that the time that will be spent should spent should be truthful and not meet with an attitude. 

In the end we wasted two hours and had to fight to get our money back.

While the Mirage started the mega resorts in Vegas the year before. This was one the new of the amazing mega themed hotels and casinos and MGM was the leader. While the Mirage was beautiful, I had never seen anything like the Excalibur before. I was a Stardust stayer. But I could see it was time to start thinking about staying else where. This was something to see. It was the begining of a new era in hotels\/casinos on the Vegas strip. It was like there was a war going on to see who could build the most amazing hotels and casinos on the strip. Las Vegas was changing. I could see the difference in the people that stated coming to Las Vegas, people with more money, everyone wanted to come here. 

Excalibur is right across the street just north of the Luxor and south of New York New York on Las Vagas Blvd. I did the visit here this past trip as I did the Luxor before heading back home. This time I just went to the casino. This is another one close to the airport so like Luxor and Mandalay Bay it's a good one when you have time to kill before a flight, i used to go to the Klondike for this. It is connected by a monorail that goes to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. 

We walked from the Luxor, its a short walk across a street and then parking lot and right into the Excalibur's casino. Its not a bad casino, smaller minumum tables. Lots of slot machines. It just doesn't seemed to have been kept up as well as it should. I guess after all it's more than 30 years old. WOW, more than 30 year, that is crazy, hard to believe. I checked out the room prices and they are quite reasonable for the strip. 

I hope this is a hotel and casino that stays here. The shows that I have seen here have been good, I have had good food here. I had some luck gambling here. But, as I have seen so many casinos come and go, this one seems to be following one that may be on its way out. Time will tell. It's worth the visit.",4,2,4

I tried coming here over the weekend. The last time I was here it was maybe 15 years ago. Prior to that, it was another 10 years ago. Both times back in the day, I would say it was ok although I had a horrendous memory of its buffet back in the day. Now, it was horrendous experience throughout. 

I booked this place only because I exchanged MyVegas points (game from Facebook) for a night here. And since it was the under bonus days, I got the wife to book for the other night. So I had it for one night, she had it for another. Confusing as it was, we had to book it together at the same time but we had to put in our MLife number and CC as well. 

When we checked in, we had to spend almost 40 minutes just to make sure it was linked so that we don't check out and then had to recheck in the day after. Also the keys had to work so that it won't lock us out the day after. At the check in desk, I even tried the $20 trick. http:\/\/thetwentydollartrick.com\/
It did NOT work. I believe I had a worker who did not know what she was doing. (Hence the 40 minute wait) She never took the money and mentioned she had no rooms available. She asked me if I wanted a high floor and a view I replied yes. We ended up in a room on floor 20, semi close to the elevator with no view 

What's worse, we had to come down to the line again and wait another 30 minutes because the other key did not work. See, did I tell you that I had just the wrong person???

The room itself was okay, the AC is slightly loud, the walls are thin. There is no fridge which I would've love to have but I think it was $20 extra a night for it. 

The POOL here was probably the best experience I had here. It had music, but not crazy loud like the pool at the MGM. There were no drunk ass, fraternity looking, trouble makers. There is, however, just a small area for kids. 

While sleeping here, we had some knucklehead knock on our door at 4am and yelled Security. We clearly had our ""Do not disturb"" sign out but that didn't work. 
The second night we left the sign out and even though there was no knocking, our sign strangely disappeared. 

While playing here, I dropped a couple of Benjamins and asked to see if I can get some comped breakfast. I had to wait 30 minutes for a printout which I never got and was told to come back in the morning at 8am which was about 4 hours later. 
I came at 8am and found a pit supervisor and then was told that Johnny Rockets was NOT linked to the hotel's system and they couldn't give me a voucher. 
Rediculous right? 

The ventilation here is horrible, if you're sensitive to smoke don't bother coming here. They also have these people trying to pressure to sell you these timeshares which gives more negative image for this place. 

The dungeon fun place is a glorified chuck e cheese. When I went at 6pm, most game booths were not open. 

The only good thing is that I just had to pay for the taxes for both nights which equates to about $40. But with my losses here, it was  a lot more.

Parking here sucks. If you're at tower two , it's best to park outside at the lot closest to Tropicana. If you're at tower one, then you would either valet or park at the structure or the lot closest to the employee entrance. All the handicap parking are always full here. Even the ones by the front and inside the parking structure. 

I'm so NOT coming back.  This was probably one of the worst hotel experiences I've had in Vegas.",15,9,7

I figured we'd save the money on the room so we had more spending money to go out with. Wow, what a mistake. We arrived at the Excalibur and checked in. They provided us with our keys and off the room we went. 

We were a bit confused at the fact that the room was on the first floor, the casino floor. I never knew casinos had rooms on the casino floor. WTF? We walked in and I swear I rented a room at a Motel 6. Actually, the rooms at Motel 6 probably would have been nicer. 

First of all, on the travel website I requested 1 king bed in a non smoking room. I got 2 full size beds in a smoking room. Everything in the room looked like the 70's threw up all over the room. This was a place that you should be renting for an hour with a stranger you are paying to have a good time with . Or a place you would see on an episode of CSI Las Vegas with Grissom searching the bedspread with a black light for some incriminating evidence for a murder. 

I immediately went to the front desk and demanded a new room. They provided me with a room that was on a higher floor with king bet, just what I requested. It still was a crappy room, but it was definitely better that the original room. Whatever we just slept there and left in a hurry the next morning. 

I honestly still don't know why this place is still open. I guess we will have to wait to watch the place blow to pieces.",4,6,2

Short story - don't stay here!!!!! Choose another hotel! 

Extended story;
I checked into the Excalibur on Wednesday October 4, 2017,  we were placed on the 17th floor of the Royal Tower, my friend and I put our luggage in the room and went to get something to eat around 3:00pm, we walked around, did some gambling and got back to our room about 10:00pm, we started to get ready for the next day (we were there for a convention) as we sitting on the bed chatting we feel ants on us - we started looking around the room and there was a Huge trail of ants all along the wall where the TV and dresser was! Gross! We call the front desk and they offered to change our room and remove 1 resort fee. Fine - we moved 
Fast forward 2 days into our 2nd room now on the 11th floor we had to change the toilet paper roll, while doing so, my friend whom works in the medical field shouts out - this is disgusting!!  There was BLOOD in the toilet paper slot - YES it was Blood, we swabbed it! 
Called the front desk, they sent housekeeping and the housekeeping manager (which whom was genuinely a kind person) to come clean the bathroom, after it was cleaned and they started cleaning the rest of the bathroom the hotel security came up to ""take a report"" ummm.... the housekeeper had already cleaned it but still insisted to take their own photos - ok- there was nothing there anymore
Talked to the front desk again about what they were going to do to compensate this terrible stay and 2 disgusting rooms - we agreed on what was going to be paid against the rooms for a total of 4 nights
When I went down for checkout - they did not honor what was told to me and wanted to charge me a night in which was stated was going to be comped - the front desk manager was rude and very unprofessional- I understand I may be a dime a dozen and they may never need my reservations again - I mean it's vegas! But seriously, they work in hospitality - would this be acceptable if this happened during one of their hotel stays while visiting another city - I don't think so.

I loved this hotel when I was a kid because of its huge arcade and fun show (Knights of Excalibur). I always looked forward to staying in a huge castle. This past weekend I visited again as an adult and I definitely was hesitant going in. It doesn't have a great reputation as being very nice and I didn't have high expectations. As someone looking for good value and an even better deal, I definitely recommend this hotel.

The rooms are perfectly adequate, especially considering that during a visit to Vegas you are unlikely to spend much time in the hotel rooms anyways. The biggest oddity of the rooms is that there is no mini fridge, which was a bit of a bummer. The best part of the casino is that there are some cheaper tables to buy into, so if you aren't a big gambler you don't have to risk as much money.

I also appreciated the location of the hotel. It is right across from New York New York and you can walk to a lot of places. Also, the uber is pretty cheap from Excalibur to anywhere on the strip.

I'm not much of a gambler anymore, but my friends were having a great time playing cards until late into the night.

Why do people try to head to bed early when they're in vegas???

For guys....

There are a TON of girls just happy to hang out w\/you at a moment's notice.

My very married friend and father of two.. ran into 5 russian girls who were asking him what kind of party he had in his room...

He had to politely refuse them(don't think he didn't think about it..because he did..I could tell on his face..haha)

The very same night I discovered (Maybe I'm not supposed to relay this secret information out..but I don't care...I'm outta the game..I'll relay the secrets)..

at around 3:30-4:30am...around the slots near the sports betting area it's called the ""SOFT SPOT"".

Meaning..girls who want to be ""taken away"" to party with all just hang out there...waiting for guys to take them away...

They were there like clockwork every night.  These girls were NOT professionals and didn't take compensation.  They're just like the
girls gone wild girls who know that this is the bus stop equivalent in the Excalibur.

IF that's your cup of tea.. it's your ""buffet"" in that sense..
Anything you want is there...

Lots of blonde girls w\/short denim skirts..bad make up, but rocking bodies..all just sitting on the bar stools..asking guys to party w\/them...
LOTS of them...we counted more than 40... 

And that happened EVERY NIGHT....

And NO we did not indulge...

1.) Bad customer service. We booked through expedia and both expedia and the hotel charged us the resort fees. We spent two hours at customer service trying to get it settled and they refused to help. They claimed expedia was breaching their contract to charge it and that its only their right to charge. FINE, but if its their contract being breached why did I have to be the one spending my vacation time fighting it? I had to stand there on the phone with expedia to deal with it. Plus, be prepared to wait 30 minutes to check in. 

2.) The less than impressive rooms. The rooms were clean and the beds are comfortable but they lacked basic necessities you'd get at a Motel 6. No safety deposit box, though online it says they have them, you have to pay an extra $25 per day for a fridge, no full length mirror so I could never see how my outfit looked, the resolution on the TV was horrendous and I'm not one to normally even take note of something like that so it was THAT bad. It was like a 70s television and had less than 10 channels. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been updated in 30 years and the bath mat had rips all over it. There's also no shelves in the shower at all so you have to put all of your shower toiletries, including whatever you plan to wash yourself with on the floor. The icing on the cake was how half the outlets in the room didn't work, including the one between the beds. We had to charge our phones on the ground on the opposite side of the bed. Also, the room smelled like someone hadn't been in it in months. We had to request an air freshener because I couldn't take it. 

3.) Promotion after promotion. Every time we walked to and from our room we had to battle at least 5 hotel workers trying to sell us time shares and other promotions. It was worse than walking on the strip. Any other hotel we walked through had 1 person if that, at the excalbur they were stationed every 25 feet to harass you from 7 am to midnight. 

4.) The smoking. Oh my gosh the smoking. Somehow the other casinos are for the most part able to manage the amount of smoke in the air and properly ventilate the casinos since its legal to smoke within them. At the excalibur you could smell the smoke before you even got in the doors of the building. I could barely breathe in the casino. 

Other complaints: they did construction in the room next to us at 8 am. I don't enjoy being woken up to the sounds of drills on my vacation. All but one of the pools was closed and the towels they give you are barely enough to cover an average size torso. Not to mention the towels are all worn and frayed. We had a $20 food and beverage credit but it took talking to multiple people just to find out how to redeem it. 

Key takeaway: don't be fooled by the low price. They have reasonable daily rates, but when they add in all their resort fees it winds up not being much less expensive than any of the other places on the strip that I'm certain would provide a much better experience. Spend the extra few bucks a day and stay somewhere nicer that you can actually enjoy.",1,1,1

I get it, it's probably the one place in Las Vegas parents can really take their kids to. The theme is kiddy, they have a ""Dungeon"" full of games and carnival-type experiences. The shows here are comical\/fun. It's all about fun, fun, fun here!

Unfortunately the place is a dump. It stinks. The casino floor has that early 90s vibe to it. The food court is odd and out of place. The buffet is horrible. Other dining options are ridiculous too: Bucca di Bepo (poor excuse for Italian) and Dick's Last Resort. Okay, I've never been to Dick's, but who really wants to be insulted by their waiter? And of course the new BBQ joint, which I've heard good things about, and would be more apt to try... if it wasn't in Excalibur.

I cannot comment on their rooms since I've never stayed here, but I can only imagine what they must be like, unless of course, they've been renovated.

Overall this place just needs to go away. It's from a different era, one of which we moved on from a long time ago.",3,4,1

For a supposedly newer \/ modern hotel ON THE STRIP in Las Vegas, this is a pathetic excuse for a hotel room.  I would describe this room as a ""motel"" quality room in a Las Vegas resort structure.  The rooms were plain, with outdated amenities such as old school LCD TV (not HD), old and decrepit shower-head (see my pics), old bathroom fan with a separate metal toggle switch and even the A\/C unit was a below the window unit (similar to what they have in Motel 6).  As a matter of fact, I would describe this room as  Motel 6 style room inside of a Las Vegas resort.  Other areas of the Excalibur were standard.

The beds were also super comfortable!

Now the reasons for the lack of stars.....
After arriving in Las Vegas for our first time, the airport shuttle dropped us off at the hotel with a 9 year old, a 2 year old, and 8 bags, we walked into the hotel only to find that we were dropped off in the rear of the hotel and was very rudely informed by a security guard that there was a phone to call a bell hop. After 3 attempts to call the bell hop and being put on hold for extended periods of time, we gave up and walked to the complete opposite end of the hotel to check in. Once arriving at the opposite end of the hotel there was a line to wait in (which took an hour) to check in. 
We finally get to our room and request more towels and such since there are 4 of us and only 3 sets of towels. We go to eat and when we come back, the towels are on the counter in the bathroom. I lift up one of the towels to move it and there is a large clump of dark hair on the towels which I can understand being missed in the probably massive amounts of laundry that the hotel has to do it the day, but similar instances happened on 3 occassions. One time clumps of hair, second time brown stains on the mats, and the third time brown stains on a towel. All of these on 3 different days and 3 different occassions. That is not forgiveable. 
The first impression is everything!
On day 3 of being at the hotel and out walking around for 6-7 hours we were sore and wore out when we got back to the hotel and we decided to take turns going to get massages at the spa. I went first. When I got down to the spa I wanted to add on a foot rub to my 25 minute massage but apparently it takes 2 different people to make a back massage and foot massage happen and even though it is a total of 50 minutes of massages between the 2, I was told it would take an hour and a half. So I cancel the foot massage because my boyfriend's massage we only an hour after mine. I go back to the women's locker room and the girl sitting at the desk says that I am already running on my time and I have to shower before I can get my massage. So I am thinking that she means that I am using up my 25 minutes worth of massage so I explain that my appointment isn't until 4:30 (it was currently 4:20). Her response was that my time starts 15 minutes before my appointment. I rinse off with water and proceed to wait in the sitting area for my massage. I bring it up to the girl checking people in that it should be explained to people when they set up an appointment that they need to tell people that they need to be there early. She argues back that they did. My boyfriend was literally still on the phone making the appointments when I left the room and headed to the spa. Now the hotel may be big, but it is definitely not that big. As I am struggling with the staff there are 2 other women who openly share their dissatisfaction with the spa also for different reasons. One told me that I would pay more if I went to the Luxour or the MGM but I looked up the prices for massages at them and they were very similar to the Excalibur prices. If I would have known that before my massage, I would have happily taken my business elsewhere. I was there to relax, not be rushed by someone. 
Some other things that were a problem are.......
1. The timeshare people always bothering you.
2. The amount of smoke was terrible. 
3. The one time we went to the Lobby Lounge for drinks the bartender was slow and the ratio on both my drink and my boyfriends was completely off. 
4. Only offered one show and that was the Tournament of Kings. (A word to the wise, you can get the souvenir cups for $8 at the 24\/7 store upstairs instead of paying $14 at the show)

Overall, it is waaaay better than Circus Circus to stay if you have kids but the kid amenities can be visited without being a hotel guest. We will not stay here next time.",4,1,0

We arrived at around 5:00pm and the line to check in was crazy long but the staff handled it really well and were very organized. When we got to the front of the line we were directed to the VIP check-in area (they were handling the overflow). The guest services lady was not happy about helping ""regular"" guests in the VIP room (she complained to a manager who walked by while she was checking us in.  the manager said ""I know they are just trying to get through the line as fast as possible"".). So we kind've felt a little wired since she said it in front of us and the manager just kind've agreed with and sympathized with her.  

We got a room with a nice view of the New York New York and the Strip.  But our AC was not working properly so we called and asked if someone could come by to check it. The maintenance guy came about 20 minutes later and was very friendly and fast. There were parts disconnected and the filter needed to be changed. 

The alarm clock in the room was not reset and it went off at 6:30am!!! Since we didn't go to bed until almost 3:00am that was terrible! And I couldn't figure out how to shut it off! I had a hard time going back to bed after that and we ended up getting up by 7:30am which ofcourse meant that we were very tired by around 3:00 in the afternoon and had to take a nap (yes we are old haha). The alarm clock fiasco kind've ruined our day. 

The Casino is conveniently located next to the Luxor and near the MGM and New York New York. We didn't spend much time in the Excalibur, there was an odd smell in certain areas, the AC in the Casino didn't really seem cold enough and there were men and women dressed in black who were constantly approaching us to ask if we wanted free show tickets which is a scam. I totally understand that they are doing their jobs and since they are scattered throughout the casino they don't know whose been approached and who hasn't (something they might want to work on) but its so tiring when you are approached 4 or 5 times just walking through the Casino to your room. We made a u turn because we were walking in the wrong direction and the same lady approached us twice in a matter of 60 seconds!  And they are so pushy, they follow you and talk to you even after you let them know your not interested.  Some of them were rude about it. It's pretty sad when you have to walk the long way just to avoid them, like there isn't enough walking going on in Vegas already! Haha

We probably won't stay there again :(  Our not so friendly experience at check-in kind've set the tone for our stay. Not being able to relax when we got into our room after a five hour drive (since the AC was not working) and being woken up at 6:30am just compounded our dissatisfaction. 

The 2 stars are for the maintenance guy who was awesome and the location of the hotel.",3,0,1

We stayed here for a long weekend during the Rock N Roll Marathon weekend. I chose this hotel based solely on price and proximity to the start and finish lines. And price. Yeah, I said that already. But really, I'm not trying to drop buckets of bucks on a room I'll only be in for a few hours each night. 

All in all, we were impressed by the hotel and the room. Sure, it wasn't super new or super fancy, but it was clean and affordable, and the room was larger than we had expected. The parking garage was well-lit and spacious. 

The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough for our needs. Our view was towards the front of the hotel, which also gave us a bit of a view of the strip beyond. 

About the only thing I'd squint at is the bathroom. The toilet paper was on the wall behind the toilet itself, so you needed to do your best contortionist impression to get the toilet paper after doing your business. 

The shower was also a bit cramped, for as large as the bathroom was, and kind of dark, as there were no lights above it. There weren't any shelves, either, so all toiletries ended up on the floor. 

The bed wasn't exactly terrible, but it wasn't very comfortable, either. The pillows were of the super-soft variety, which meant I had to stack pillows to get some neck support. 

Still, it was all fine for the time we were there. Decently priced rooms during a time in which most hotels jacked up their prices and friendly staff made our stay just fine. 

We never gambled there, nor did we dine at any of their restaurants. The most we did was frequent their convenience store, the Auntie Anne's Pretzels (how I didn't eat every meal there is a mystery for sure) and the Krispy Kreme (for the hubby and cousin). Heck, any place with an Auntie Anne's in it can't be bad!",10,4,4

When we made reservations I think we ordered the standard room but when we got to the registration we got the tower 2 room which also everyone on yelp is saying that is great.....so I can't say anything about tower 1, but the process was easy. the staff was all right, no attitude, but they could have explained to us what the hell they were giving us; like coupons for shows and stuff like that.
Also I just want to say, if you're a big eater or if you're family is its better to get a 24 hr buffet- u kinda save more $ that way; especially if you're bringing the kids along or teenagers.
The reason to why I give 3 stars is cuz it was an OKAY hotel, it wasn't  like luxor ( i mean at luxor there is a theme, at excalibur there is none)
It's great to bring kids here ( the slots machine's and all that is still there though ) to just have fun, or family, but if you're on a vacation with ur significant other then I wouldn't recommend it unless you two are both serious with each other and want to see kids to remind you that you need to get married and start making babies.",0,0,0

It was right after NYE (but just in time for my bday) and at $70 for the whole weekend - it's hard to complain!

It's at the very end of the strip so unless you're trip consists of whatever is in this building and New York New York, you're going to have to do a little bit of walking (which luckily our group didn't mind).

Not the prettiest and definitely not the fanciest of room, but it did it's job of providing us a place to get ready and sleep (who stays in their hotel when there in Vegas anyways?)

The sheets were a bit thin and cheap, but it did its job. There was a heater\/AC for the cold winter night anyways so we were fine. Blowdryer was broken though :\/

I hadn't been in Las Vegas for many years and, quite honestly, thought the idea of themed hotels was kind of dumb.  Well, I must admit that the theme does serve to differentiate this hotel from the myriad of others that line the strip and it was kind of fun, in a kitschy way, to see how thoroughly they played out the theme.

My friend is a poker player and spent some time down in their poker area and even won money.  She taught me to play the quarter poker machines and I even tried my hand at Pai-Gow but I don't think I'll ever be the gambler she is.

The Starbucks next to poker area did a fabulous job of keeping us caffeinated and the food court upstairs did an admirable job of providing me with Chinese food and cinnamon rolls, even into the wee hours of the morning.  

There is a free tram that runs between here and te Luxor and Mandalay Bay (I think) and it's right across the street from the MGM Grand where we attended the concert.

The room was not fancy, but it was cheap and got the job done.

Stayed here numerous times since I was a child, as the hotel is accomodating to all ages---hard to find in Today's Las Vegas.  Anyway, my most recent stay was during Xmas 07 which was in one of their remodeled rooms that feature modern decor and Flat-screen HDTVs.  The remodeled rooms feel really nice...unfortuanately they had very few free channels on TV, so there is nothing you can really enjoy on high resolution without paying extra.  The Casino action is hot as always, and their sports book\/keno combo room is just the right size.  The remodeled casino really does feel really comfortable.  

The Fantasy Faire for kids is still there, but carnival games are up to $2 now.....how i miss Circus Circus and their old 50 cents games.  Also, the arcades are old and outdated.  Ventilation is non-existant here, as the whole bottom level is extremely stuffy and smelly.  

The Buffet is still there with their classic ""cattle-line"" style of food islands.  Went for Breakfast most recently...don't expect the best, but for its price, it is still worth it.  Besides, it's hard to mess up breakfast food.  

The Dick's Bar is really trashy and gross.  Loud music, trashy women, etc.  I had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon for a drink, but after some trickery, the bartender ended up getting me 3-2 deal...what the heck?  Dick's really sucks.

I stayed at the Excalibur a few weeks ago. The place is obviously dated and has a cheesy medieval theme. 

I shared a room with 3 other girls so I requested a room with 2 beds. The room met our needs, which was we just needed a place to sleep and to shower. The bed was fine in terms of comfort. The linens really sucked. The bathroom was extremely spacious and we were given plenty of towels. 

The rate for the place was really good after I applied MyVegas points to it. It was around $175 for a Friday and Saturday night. 

Parking was easy there. They have a structure and a lot so we were able to find parking just fine. 

I don't know if I would stay there again unless I got a very cheap rate. It's far from the newer hotels and shops so we had to take a cab to get back and forth from the cooler\/newer sights.",0,0,0

Jeez, I've been to Vegas three times already and every time we drive by Excalibur I just STARE.I think it's the fact that it reminds me of Cinderella's Castle and it's so beautiful at night. To all my fellow yelpers, ooh'ing and aww'ing at how epic this hotel is, is as far as you should go. Don't stay here unless you're super budget conscious, you get what you pay for. 

Check in was the usual. The lady that helped me definitely tried to upsell me. She was going to ""upgrade' me for free and then asked for my credit card... um NO. LOL, sneaky sneaky. Watch out for that, if you paid online you should ONLY be paying for the resort fee and that's it. There is no pool or gym, I'm not sure where this money goes to but it would be nice to get shampoo that actually foams, haha. 

Honestly, I don't know how ""upgraded"" the upgraded rooms are because if they are barely better than the standard rooms, it's not worth it. I have a hard time believing the more expensive rooms are that much better. You might as well cruise over to Monte Carlo or Aria and treat YO SELF. 

We came here because the group I was with didn't want to drop too many bills. Understandable, considering we were out and about all weekend long, but DANG coming home to the hotel room we had was awful. I definitely learned my lesson LOL, I've never been to a Vegas hotel this bad before. 

The room is straight up OLD, it has NEVER been remodeled. The carpets are probably the original ones from who knows when. It's worn down and looks like it hasn't been vacuumed in a long time. DON'T walk around barefoot, I had my shoes on the entire time, I just didn't feel very safe. You should use a disinfecting wipe to clean the shower floor and maybe wear some flip flops in the shower if you're paranoid. Yeah, this place just doesn't seem very clean to me. 

Everything is just very gringy, the room has like a moldy\/moth ball smell, the furniture and curtains are all dusty. THE BED IS REALLY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE. Also... the AC units are CRAZY LOUD. I literally didn't sleep for three days when we were in Vegas. I know, most people are there to party it up and sleeping isn't part of their vocabulary but if you're looking to take a cat nap in between playing slot machines, you might as well sleep on some chair in another hotel lobby somewhere else. The struggle was very real LOL. 

Location is pretty good though, a lot to do across the street. I definitely prefer being around that area but I just can't come back LOL. My eczema REALLY started acting up when I stayed here. Be warned!",3,1,1

The room we stayed in had some funky odor... model\/smoke\/vomit maybe... and it looked like it was a flash back from the 70's. We had the deluxe suit, which is the most basic room. But like I said, for the price, you really can't beat it. And do you really spend much time in your hotel anyway? Not necessarily. It's at the end of the strip, so lots of walking. There is a okay selection of fast food establishments and Buca de Beppo's, which is always good, however, we didn't have a fridge to keep any leftovers.

To start of my stay I arrived at about 11 am and asked when I could check in.  The guy at the front desk said I could check in at that point.  I came to realize AFTER that we wr charged an extra $20 for an early check in. We wr put in tower one. All I can say is WOW!! They need to update this tower asap. The rooms are dark and have a weird smell. The beds are old and VERY uncomfortable. 

The next day I pulled out the iron to iron my clothes and get ready for the day. I haven't noticed the iron was full of black gunk and it ruined a brand new white shirt I bought for the trip. I called down and spoke with a ""manager"" Chris  he apologized and said he would send a new iron within 45 minutes. Really??? He then offered to try and clean the shirt. I told him there was. I way it could be cleaned. He said ok sorry about that and THAT was it.  $45 down the drain. 

My party and I tried to enjoy the pool on that sunny day. The only pool open was the one at the far end which I believe was a kids pool. Because it was the only one open it was pretty full. It took us about 40 minutes to get any type of service. I asked for a Long Island ice tea with double shot and the waitress brought me a lemonade basically with no alcohol it seamed. I asked if they can fix it. She said I would need to pay for more alcohol. What a joke but I did end up paying.  As we sat there and tried to enjoy our drinks the music and the sun their sound system was HORRIBLE. It kept going in and out it old sound staticky and go off for minutes at a time.

On the gaming side it has been very lucrative, and this one particular casino, has made a record number of instant millionaires.

Regarding the casino.....and the overall resort. it does not require any sort of renovation, and look just as good as it did 20 years ago. but it is in desperate need of better signage. There are very few signs anywhere so once you're inside you usually will require assistance to get to your next location.

I think the exterior architecture is timeless and beautiful.... especially at night.

I have not eaten at some of the fancier places. but Dicks Last Resort, must try on my next visit in February 2015. Somehow eating steak at the steakhouse if you are solo, seems like a good way to attract females hookers. but I would love it if they were male hookers! Just kidding.

The newly remodeled food court is a feast for the eyes and stomach. make certain to use all of your coupons, if you are staying at Lux or or Excalibur. the prices are only a dollar or two higher dad if you were in your own neighborhood location. the tables are kept spotlessly clean as is the entire area.

I am not at all keen on Medieval architecture....but this place does it right, and I did not ask my opinion before building it. It reminds me of a vastly larger and more colorful version of the Disney Castle. but with clearly adult aspirations.

Some may differ..... but I do not think that any Resort Casino in Las Vegas, is a place for children. Period.that is not to say that should be sheltered. but parents work hard for their money, it should be allowed to have fun without worrying about their children. It is also painful to go out to eat and have to sit next to a family, with a crying child, who not a fault of its own, is an unfamiliar and loud circumstances with its sleep schedule disrupted.

I've stayed here before on different occasions, but was a bit hesitant about this trip due to the recent reviews. I couldn't help but wonder if maybe the place has changed since I had last visited? I eventually decided to go ahead and stay here after getting a decent price for the two nights. I can say now that I wasn't disappointed with my stay! I ended up in a room in Tower II on the 22nd floor. I find that most people who are upset with the hotel end up getting a Tower I room, but I can't comment on that since I have not been in that tower for several years. Maybe just go with the $20 upgrade for Tower II?

Let's go over the room first.

The first thing I checked when I got to the room was to look around and make sure that the room had been properly cleaned. I was pleased to find that the place had been properly vacuumed, no mysterious hairs or left over fast food anywhere in the room. The bed was clean as well! No stains, bugs or hairs there either! The bathroom was clean too! No stains, loose hair or mysterious matter in the sink or shower. Not even left over water spots on any of the mirrors corners! Or that funny little fold out mirror that those of you that wear make up use.

Now for the AC unit in the room. I've seen other complaints about it, but I have to wonder if any of you actually have a regular AC unit or if you run central air and heat through your houses? I have a pretty high end unit at home that is installed into my living room and I found that the two units sounded the same in volume. Once the room gets to the right temperature it kicks over to fan and then they run pretty quiet. I did find however that the unit did kick over to the AC often, and I believe that is partially because it was 108 degrees outside and also that the large window and thin walls did little to actually keep the heat out.

Now for the noise. Having the room right above the pool area, I did notice that the music playing down at the pool was rather loud. So I understand the problem for those of you that come out to party all night and sleep in the next morning, it would easily be enough to wake someone who isn't a heavy sleeper. I however had gone out on this vacation to show my girlfriend the city and some of the shows since she hadn't ever been before, so we were up at a decent hour of the morning and didn't have any problems with the noise. But I can agree that maybe thicker walls or perhaps walls made of a more dense material would've mitigated some of the noise.

On a side note, it did take me a few minutes to find the safe. I'm so used to seeing them in the closets I never even thought to look in the drawers! Who would'a thought.

Now for the rest of the hotel.

At check in there was a small line when we arrived, but it only took about ten min. for us to get to the front. But I will say that's only because we got there a half hour before our check in time (Check in was at 3 on our reservation print out). By the time we got finished and were getting ready to head up the room the line had grown to the point it trailed off the slightly raised area the check in was at! So to anyone staying here, definitely COME EARLY! It's not so much the staff that makes check in take long, it the rush of people! Not to mention the people that I saw trying to demand a cheaper price in front of me. So before you go automatically blaming the staff for the check in time, take a look at your fellow patrons, and maybe tell that girl at the front she shouldn't be talking on the phone while she's trying to check in.

As for the staff themselves, most of the people I dealt with directly were very pleasant and happy to help me out, even the housekeeping staff would kindly greet me and wish me luck!.
Except for this one short asian guy with glasses who was trying to get you to sign up for those time shares. FIVE times that guy approached me during my stay! And one of the times he actually followed me through the casino for a bit before I guess I got too far away from his post! But he was the only problem I really had with the staff.

We didn't have enough time to visit the pools so I can't really comment on the quality, but I will note that from the room the area looked too crowded for my tastes and I don't think that we'll visit them if we stay again in the future.

I also didn't get a chance to visit the arcade area to see if that had changed. Lame.

As for the casino, I didn't find it any more dirty than any of the other casino's I go into. Smelled a little of smoke sure, but otherwise I didn't see any trash on the floor or anything. And while it is a bit dated, most of the hotels that were built back then still are, some now just going through renovations.

As for food, I like the options they had! It was kinda broad with the range of options, so everyone should be able to find something for them!

I hope this was enough to help anyone thinking of staying here!",10,1,2

Honestly, I can't say that I have ever had a bad time in the Excalibur probably because I took it for what it was going to be which wasn't the best on the strip and I have always consistently had a blast here.

I MUST plug Dick's Last Resort in the Excalibur because it is probably the most crazy fun I've had in a restaurant in Vegas. I think a few times I was doused with beer and dragged out on a chair with toilet paper in my face. Don't ask.

Regardless, yes this hotel smells like smoke on the first floor(s), but in the towers which is where you must stay at least in one of the upgraded rooms, the 42"" LCD is a nice touch, the beds are not bad, the carpet is in dire need of a revamp and the shower clogs. But it's $22 a night. Can ya beat that on the strip with a 42"" LCD?

I just think the Excalibur keeps the child in me alive, sort of, and they have $5 minimums on black jack, a fun wanna-be circus circus downstairs and the rooms really aren't that bad!

The first time was good and I did enjoy the room, of the walkway over the window of my hotel room.  Plus the 5am wake up of all the glass bottles being thrown away (yes, I was on the third floor).  I just took it with a gain of salt.  

The next time, I showed up to get my room which to my surprise was on the same floor, but this time on the opposite side of the hotel, i am thinking I do not need to listen to glass breaking at 5am, which I was good with.  Arriving to the room, I noticed a wall about 5 feet from my hotel window, thinking I will not be able to see anything, which in my book is OK since I do not look at a hotel window for the view, but I am using this room to shower and sleep.  When I needed to check everything out which I do, the restroom light was burned out, OK still not a show stopping deal, call the front desk and let them know and have somebody change it.  I still needed to get something to eat, which is perfect for them to change the light in the restroom.  After calling maintenance to make sure everybody in the world is aware of the situation, I left to get something to eat.  After returning several hours later, I walked in the room of course to check on the light, to my deep surprise, nothing had been done.  I immediately called the front desk, to see why this had not been done, I was told they did not have a light bulb to change my light, WHAT!?!?!  I am in a hotel resort with several hundred room, and they could not find a light blub!!!!  Go to Home Depot or Lowe's I am sure they have some very cheep.  

I was not going to stay in a room where the restroom light was not working.  I then ask what can be done, and yes I did suggest they go to Home Depot.  They decided to move me to another room, I was OK with that, but here is where it now gets interesting.  They told me the room was in the other tower a long walk as I was at the end of the hallway on my floor in the west tower, now I had to move everything to the east tower at the end of that hallway.  I asked if somebody could send me cart to move my stuff, of course everybody in the world at this hotel resort was busy, and they gave me a time limit to move my stuff or I would have to pay for two rooms, yes that is what i said two room...who in the world set these policies up???  Well, after being confused with my options, I told them to send somebody with the key if possible, of course everybody in the resort is so busy to do that one thing, again none of this my fault and yes I should have gone to Home Depot myself for the light.  Now I moved myself from one tower to the other tower, without any help from anybody staff at the hotel\/resort.  Needless to say I was not a happy camper.  I was able to deal with this whole situation until my stay ended.  

It just makes me think why I would stay at a hotel\/resort that do not have extra light bulbs, they could not take it from another room they were not using, oh wait I did ask that of the front desk and was told that was an older bulb and they did not have any, again Home Depot or Lowe's.

However, the higher end hotels also charge equivalent amounts so I don't really understand why they charge so much for the resort fee. Also, I was somewhat annoyed that they charged an early check in fee. You cannot check into the hotel until 3pm. I know that some other hotels on the strip do not charge an early check in fee.

The good thing about Excalibur is that they have a food court that won't break your pocket book. Even though most of it is fast food, at least you know how much it will cost you. They have a McDonalds, Pick up Stix, Baja Fresh, Johnny Rockets, Buca di Peppo, etc.

This is a pretty good hotel for families as the rooms are very afforable, of course depending when you come. And its location is pretty good as you are accross the street from the Tropicana, MGM Grand, and New York New York.

A cople reasons why I have stayed here are the price and location.   For me, I find the location of this hotel to be great.  Next door is Luxor, across the street is the New York New York Hotel, diagonally is the MGM Grand, and just a bit further up is a food court with several food selections such as my favorites Subway, and Del Taco, all within a 10 minute walking distance from the hotel. Not in the mood for Subway or Del Taco, then just drive over the 15 freeway to an In-N-Out.  Need gas for your, there is a gas station close by.  Speaking of the 15 freeway, that's another reason why I like this hotel's location.  Just hop off the Tropicana exit and a few hundred feet up is a driveway for the parking lot. You don't have to deal with much pedestrian foot traffic.  Even leaving the hotel to get on the 15 is relatively easy. And the traffic around that area isn't as bad as the traffic I have seen further up the strip.

When I have stayed here,it's always a room with two beds. The bathrooms are spacious and the showers are fairly large.  The beds themselves have been comfortable where I can either lay and relax as I watch some television or to sleep.  For the purpose of using the room for sleeping and relaxing, it does its purpose.

Check-In was easy.  With reserving a room, just show a valid  I.D. and the credit card you used to make the reservation.  I had my smart phone already displaying my email conformation receipt just in case something went wrong. ha ha.  If you check--in early ( I am assuming before 3 p.m.) there is a $20 early check-in fee.

Check-Out was also easy.  I didn't know Excalibur did this until I got home, but on the day of your check out, they send you an email so you can Express Checkout if you want to, which is convenient if you don't want to go down to the front desk.",5,1,2

I recommend you read this for your own good I never write reviews but this is worth it.
 Every year we take a trip to Vegas and stay at a different hotel each time to get a full experience. This year we decide to go for my wife's birthday and Excalibur was a horrible choice this year we drove 6 hours to check in and I was looking to get a nap in before heading out only to get bitten by insects or bed bugs. Within the first 30 minutes after checking in I had 4 bites down my leg and my wife on her butt. 
 We went back down to reservations and they checked us a new room and we did a security report and took pictures. The security mention we have ""ANOTHER  case of insects"" suggesting this has happened before. We asked about it he declined to tell us more, other than ""it doesn't happen often"". My wife at that point wasn't thrilled about this stay but we figured a new room on a different floor should be fine. Through out the night we couldn't sleep and I ended up getting another bite on my back and 3 more bites on my other leg, for my wife on her arm. By 530am we decided to go to front desk to show the manager. Our stay was originally for two nights but we decided to head home we spent the morning at the laundrymat to kill any bed bugs since they jump on luggage so we left our luggage bags since my wife didn't want to take a chance of bedbugs or insects home with us, we literally walked out with trash bags with clothes. I spoke to a hotel manager Josie who also mentioned ""in other cases the rooms come back NEGATIVE with insects"" implying its happened to others too just like the security guard did.  
And what do you know after all the bites we got our rooms were ""NEGATIVE"" too and no report to show us of the results only to take her word of it. JOSIE may have removed any fees of the hotel but we still had to pay full price for a sleepless, bedbug bite night, go to the laundrymat in the morning, cut our trip short and take a 6 hours drive home without any sleep we should not have paid full price at all.

It felt pretty clean to me, it definitely wasn't the place I'd take a relaxing bath but I have no complaints. The service was great, it was a pretty good location for what I wanted. I had a pleasant stay here. The only complaint I have is the line to check in.. OMG, I think there were 10 ppl in front and we waited 30-40 mins. I have to figure out that mobile checkout thing to avoid this in the future.

Also, it wasn't smelly!",1,0,0

The hotel casino smelled heavily of cigarettes! You could smell the smoke several feet away even before entering the hotel! We nicknamed it the Smoky Hotel because it was that bad. My throat was so dry and inflamed after staying here for 3 days. I think Excalibur is known for being family friendly, but I would never bring my nieces to stay here because of the heavy second hand smoke. The check in line was also extremely long.

In the morning we used the pools as well, they were clean, and guarded good, the only thing I have to mention is the over protectiveness I noticed, but I guess it's an American thing we as Europeans weren't used to.

We stayed at the end of january for monday-friday. It must have been a slow time because we waited for only a few minutes to check in & had no problems. Ours was a standard room in tower 1 (the old tower i guess), but the room was clean & nice, not stinky. Not fancy, but good enough for me. If someone is a snoot and going to complain about chips on the door or rattling bathroom fan, then sure they'll hate this place, but if you are a normal person who lives with minor imperfections on a daily basis, you'll be just fine. We were on the 20th floor and the wifi worked just fine. I even brought my laptop & ethernet cord in preparation for having no wifi based on others' reviews, but was pleasantly surprised.(atleast that resort fee was for something i guess). We did a late check out option for $28 meaning we could wait to check out until 3pm. Very useful. I actually like the cheesy ""outdated"" casino, I find it cozier and more homey than the huge richy rich pretentious places. The foodcourt & walkways between the excaliber & neighboring casinos(luxor &NYNY) were really nifty and had good(though conspicuously overpriced) food options if you just need to grab something quick. The ""fun dungeon"" is a cute little arcade downstairs that is a fun diversion from the adult activities, it's only open til 10pm or so though.  I would totally stay here again and actually preferred it over the Luxor which we stayed at last year, though the luxor's room was just a teensy bit nicer.",0,0,0

This is the second year that some of them stayed here, it was my first time this year. I've stayed at crappy hotels and I've stayed at luxury hotels. I stayed here because that's where my friends booked to stay at, obviously they were going for good pricing. 

We arrived to the hotel around 3AM because our flight was delayed. We had a speedy check-in, since no one else was checking in at that time. Our room was in Tower 2, they had remodeled since last year. It's better, more updated looks within the rooms. No more dark carpet or dark wallpaper. The bathrooms are upgraded with granite counter tops and lighting fixtures, flat screen tv's and new paintings. We were on the 11th floor and had a nice view of NY NY and the strip (which was better than last year's -- a view of the roof). 

Like someone else said, Tower 2 is good for being close to the pools and you have easy access to the parking lots, if you drove. There is a Baja Fresh on the main floor, on the second floor there are other fast food options -- McDonald's, Quizno's, Pizza Hut, ColdStone, Starbucks, and some chinese food place. McD's is open 24 hours.

This hotel was worth the money, especially on the second busiest weekend of the year, when they raise prices by 200%. It's a good place to sleep, get ready, swim and eat cheaply. But if you're looking for a fancy, flashy, luxury hotel...you should probably move along to another place farther down the strip.",1,1,1

I think this is the cheapest hotel in the heart of the strip. We enjoyed our time here. Here's my complaints:  Right after we got in our room, my 4-year-old immediately ran to the phone and tried to call his cousins, who were also in Vegas at the time. I realized this right away, and immediately made him stop. As I was pulling him away from the phone, I got a call from a front desk person who was very rude. From her tone, I'm guessing it happens often and that's the reason she has a low tolerance. I apologized and was very nice with her, so her rudeness was inexcusable. Another complaint I have is there seems to be miscommunication or just improper training on behalf of the management staff. Before we left CA, I called and asked whether the hotel supplied life jackets for children. I was told yes, so I deliberately left ours at home (wanting to pack as light as possible), but found out they do NOT supply them when we went to the pool. I was also told different prices by different people when calling to make our reservation. So employees need to be trained better in order to avoid giving customers misinformation. Other than that our room was nice and clean, the buffet staff, arcade staff, and staff in the shops & bar were great. I'm looking forward to giving this hotel another try. Hopefully there won't be any customer service issues next time.",0,0,0

The key attributes it has going for it are low room rates, decent rooms, and all of the desirable amenities included under a very low daily resort fee.  The problem is that the staff are not very friendly or accommodating at this hotel, and there is not much cleaning up after the less than considerate guests who jump on those low room rates for a stay in Vegas.  Sigh.  

I would say I was pretty happy with the quality of my bed.  The room itself had no circulation though, and the air conditioner worked so efficiently that after five minutes of turning it on, it felt like a tundra.  There was no way to sleep through the night without shivering or waking up with a dry throat.  There was no balance at all.  The resort fee included free high speed internet which had a fairly good download speed.  It also includes a free daily paper, but don't expect them to deliver it to your door.  You have to go downstairs and ask for it, show ID, and maybe even be given a dirty look to get it.  The fitness center was beautiful with a wonderful range of current machines allowing me to do a full cardio\/strength training workout.  Unfortunately the staff at the fitness center were not just unfriendly but rather rude (accusing me of not wearing shoes when I was for example and then having to show them my Brooks running shoes on my feet).  Also, the narrow hours that the fitness center was open (they close at 8pm) made it difficult to use.  The resort fee also includes phone calls, but they don't advertise that either; you just figure it out for yourself after a few days.  Security was pretty tight at the hotel in a way that it is not at the nearby Paris for example.  This went beyond looking out for the welfare of the guests to the point of being annoying.  

If only they showed the same zeal in keeping their common spaces tidy.  There is nothing more disgusting than walking into an elevator to your room and seeing it littered with spent cups and napkins.  Gross.  My recommendation, stay elsewhere.  At this price point, the Luxor is a much better deal.",7,1,2

I have read that this casino is a bit on the older side and I was willing to deal. As we walked through the the lobby\/casino floor I could visually observe the thick cloud of cigarette smoke I walked through absorb into my hair. Super ick! The women gamblers were all older Peg Bundy look-a-likes and there were way too many kids here breathing in that second hand smoke. Based on my observations, I was very hesitant as to what our room would look like.

Now, my superbulous man-friend surprised me with an upgrade to our reservations which included a view of the strip. The renovated room was very much acceptable with granite table, counter tops, flat screen TV and even a  seating area in front of the window. The view of the strip was beautiful and so worth it for only $30 more a night! 

What also annoyed me was the pull string to our Roman black-out shutters that kept breaking. In addition, my man-friend was horrified to find that a bottle of bourbon he had brought in his duffel bag had popped and saturated most of his clothes. The wait to dry-clean pretty much took the duration of our trip. Poor guy mostly wore undershirts! Super lame!

This was probably the only sour point about my experience at this hotel. Our friends were behind us in line, so we were served first. When we went to check in our agent, Nina, said there were no kings left but that we could come down the next day and they would move us. There was some back and forth between her and the agent helping our friends and then we were all checked in and ready to go. Our friends came over and told us that they had been upgraded to a King room. At which point I was like wtf? We went upstairs and lo and behold, they had NOT been upgraded, their agent had lied to them. Not impressed with that.

The next day we did go back down and Kathy was happy to help us switch and was very prompt at doing so. We didn't have to give back our old keys, just leave them in our room and we were able to move immediately. Our new room had a strip view, which was nice, and a king bed and was as well appointed as our previous room.

One thing with this hotel is the noise. Because you're on the strip, non strip view rooms will be quieter. I'm a light sleeper and I slept with earplugs every night, if not for the noise from the strip, for the noise from the air conditioner. Every single room we had (between four of us) had loud a\/c units.

The hotel itself is pretty well situated, you really wouldn't have to leave if you didn't want to. The casino is spacious and I was able to play all the games I wanted to without having to wait long. I also found $100USD on the floor my first night :D Lucky me! The food court has some good options, starbucks, mcdonalds, krispy kreme, etc, and there's lots to see and do within the casino itself. Location wise, I would have preferred to be closer to the main part of the strip but you get what you pay for.

The only other bad thing at this hotel was constantly being hounded to go and see this new property they were pushing. ""We'll feed you and you'll tour the facility"" they said. ""We'll give you cheap show tickets"" they said. Very suspicious and my bullshit radar was up - avoid these guys like the plague, they'll hunt you down. After a while, we stopped admitting that we lived at the same address just so they'd leave us alone.

Overall, this was a great hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The slots were great, the amenities were good, the rooms were well appointed and fairly modern and it wasn't hard to get around. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for - we didn't want to spend a ton of money for four nights in Vegas, we wanted that money to go to gambling and shopping and eating. This was a reasonably priced, clean hotel. We didn't spend a ton of time in our rooms besides sleeping and changing and it suited us just fine.",12,1,1

By the way...no bath tubs! ""It's in the small print"". The hotel was built without bathtubs. I found this incredibly funny, after my annoyance wore off. No smoking room smelled good.

I have never stayed here, but have visited many times.  The casino isn't half bad.  It's fairly large, with all the usual table games and a good selection of slots.  Cocktail service has been average on recent visits.

But the poor Excaliber is really beginning to look dated and not really in line with the ""modern"" vegas culture (meaning non-family oriented these days).  Last October we walked over from the Luxor and through the Excaliber's food court area.  The whole area was dirty, with trash thrown about.

It is very close to everything on the strip, and the last time I came here I was able to walk to New York New York within 5 minutes.  This is a plus if you are trying to watch Zumanity in NYNY and want a slightly lower price range compared to staying at NYNY.  There is also a food court in Excalibur that includes Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, Popeyes, and McDonalds.  It is also very walkable and drivable to other areas on the strip.

Some of the downsides to staying here are that the walls are not very soundproof, and there was another family with a loud child that kept me up for part of the night.  Luckily, the front desk was very accommodating and I was able to get a room change with ease.  The buffet is also not very good, and there is not really a club or night lounge here.

The only reason the hotel got a 2 stars is a) I have to remember that I get what I pay for and b) we had a great view out our hotel room.
The smell in the lobby\/casino floor is of stale cigarettes and old nasty carpets. Sure, I can get over that and hustle up to my room, but being ""welcomed"" by the scent is awful. The front desk were okay, quick but snarky, and were talking about other guests who were standing just down the counter from them, calling them names and complaining about them being high maintenance. Not classy, even if you are a cheaper hotel.
The bedroom was nice, simple -- I upgraded to a Widescreen room (I would recommend the upgrade...only $30 or so). However, our shampoo\/conditioner and body wash bottles were only 3\/4 full, and there was no comforter on the bed...just three sheets. I excused it thinking, ""Ya, it's hot in Vegas"" but really, it's just cheap. 
The view outside our hotel was lovely, out over the pool and to the mountains, and the location of the hotel on the tram line between the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay was convenient.

It is on the north end (my favorite) close to New York, New York, MGM, Hooters and Luxor. 
Upon checking in (on a Sunday), we had to wait well over 20 minutes, but the line did move pretty fast. Customer service could use some work. I thought I'd be clear and honest upfront in explaining to our clerk that the name i booked the room with may be different, as I had changed my name due to getting married. She looked at me with a death stare, as though we wouldn't be getting the room if the name didn't match. Luckily, my Expedia reflected the name change, but please wipe your snotty resting b-face off. We ended up upgrading for $10 a night to be in the same tower as our friends, so we lucked out getting the end room (which was slightly bigger with a table area). Another major annoyance was the solicitors that would attempt to harass you into purchasing show tickets or another stay at the hotel--literally every time you headed towards your hotel tower, including when I am in the process of leaving and clearly have my luggage with me.

I am a local here in Vegas and for years Excalibur has been our destination for a staycation. Over the past 15 years I have never had such a terrible experience in my life. It's dirty short staffed and just overall not well kept. Multiple times we were told they did not have any clean towels for the rooms. A picture was missing. Off the bathroom wall. Broken glass still on the floor. Mirrors dirty. Stained pillow cases. Windows so dirty we could see out of our room with a ""VIEW"". As my brother and his family were meeting us from out of town we wanted rooms close together. We paid for early check in. He got his room pretty early, however my room was not available until after 6pm. Two days after we checked in they called him and said they needed to move his room due to maintenance needing to be done in his room. They wouldn't tell him what. Then they said well it's the joining room. He was not in a joint room so that made no sense. They then said well never mind it can wait.  They now charge for parking which isn't that big of a deal but I feel like to charge us to park given the state of the rooms is not cool. I would not recommend this hotel again. It saddens me that such a fun family focused place is such a dump now.",0,0,0

To make up for the inconvenience they said they'd comp our breakfast at the Luxor, only when we arrived there the next morning the people at the Luxor didn't know a thing about it and only comped us $50, which was not enough to cover breakfast for three with the prices at the Pyramid Cafe.

My fiancé and I just stayed at the Excalibur over Labor Day weekend and had the most disgusting experience of our lives. We are Pearl Mlife Members and have stayed at every hotel in Las Vegas through M life at this point. I booked two nights because one night was comped and came with $100 resort credit. We checked in and paid to have our room upgraded. The woman at the mlife check in area insisted that it was a much better room and was very recently updated. Great... we'll go with the upgrade. Room 6168 to be exact (STAY AWAY) We ordered a movie the first night... that didn't work. It kept freezing. Moving on to the most appalling thing I have ever seen in my entire life. On the second night we found DISGUSTING MOLD in the bathroom. There was a growth of mold not just speckles a f****** growth, mushroom, whatever you want to call it  ( I have attached the photo) in the bathroom and mold in the shower. This is beyond neglectful and I can't even process how neglectful this is to PAYING guests!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so disgusted that I was breathing in mold for two nights!!!!! Housekeeping should get fired for how neglectful it is. The fact that we were sold on this room and to find that makes me sick to my stomach! Management didn't handle it well either at check out. Just rude and didn't take ownership of the fact that we were sold into being in that room and had to BREATHE IN mold all weekend long ! Almost feel like I should sue them for negligence!




On our way out we had an even more appalling experience! After my fiancé kept repeatedly telling the bellman that he will handle the bags, he kept insisting and pushing my fiancé to go towards the valet even though he was telling him I was elsewhere. Once we got the the valet once again my fiancé told the bellman that we can handle it from here and it's hasn't been a good weekend, the bellman completely ignored that and stayed. Once our car pulled up my fiancé loaded all he bags even though Ali the bellman kept ignoring him and basically grabbing the bags from his hands. When my fiancé was being polite and came to ask me if I had a cash tip I explained that we had played all our money and we're on our way out. When he told the bellman, ""Sorry, no cash.."" his response was, "" You cost me 45 minutes, and I have to pay taxes on this."" this is unacceptable considering my fiancé and myself lost about 900 each with M Life this weekend. The man was arguing us in the middle of a full valet lot and that was very embarrassing and unprofessional.",7,8,0

We stayed at another hotel the first couple of nights, then moved to Excalibur because it was cheaper - and we thought would be more family-friendly for our young daughter.  Boyyy was I wrong!  

They stuck us in Tower II - which is the farthest from the registration desk - on the top floor, at the very end of the hall.  It took a good 15 minutes to get to the room upon entering the hotel.  Not only that, but at night we had to walk through ""the Party Pit"" that had dancers on the bar.  Then we passed a bank of slot machines with another dancer on top.  I know this is Vegas and this kind of stuff is all over the place - but  it was just another sign that they are really trying to return to being an adult-oriented town.  

Excalibur is somewhere between economical and shady.  There were some weird characters in the hallways of the hotel, and drug use (nothing awful - I smelled pot smoke - but again, it's not the kind of thing you want your kids around).  I heard security pay a visit to a room near ours.  Oh yeah, the walls are pretty thin!  

The casino was pretty ghetto.  Hard to get service while I was playing video poker.  We didn't go in the pool, but the pool area did look nice, with several pools and a water slide.

The room was surprisingly nicely-appointed (sort of a Hollywood Regency-meets-Medieval style that actually sort of worked), but the plumbing was obviously having some problems (drains ""glug-glug-glugging"" every time you used a sink or flushed the toilet).  The shower door only opened on one side - the side that was 4 inches away from the toilet, so you practically had to climb over the toilet to get in and out.  Towels were nice and fluffy.  The shampoo\/conditioner\/mouthwash freebies sucked.  The beds were very high and my daughter fell off a couple of times, which was scary.  There was a nice plasma screen TV, but no ""kid"" channels (ie Nickelodeon, which seems to be standard in most hotels) - actually there were very few channels at all.  The a\/c was weird - we tried messing with the temperature, but the room was always too warm or too cold, regardless.  The a\/c blasted right onto the beds, so if you were laying down, you'd wind up freezing.

One thing that really pissed me off was that we requested a non-smoking room, and they gave us a smoking room - something I didn't realize until late in the evening when I found my daughter holding a book of matches in one hand and an ashtray in the other.  Fortunately we only stayed one night so it wasn't the end of the world - just very irritating.  

The coffee stand at the bottom of the elevators had some seriously nasty coffee - and you had to walk half a mile through the casino to get to a Starbucks.  

I cannot see us staying here again - the whole Excalibur scene definitely was not for us.",0,0,0

I am pregnant so I was skeptical due to the reviews but we got the room for $30\/night. The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful, we arrived to the room and we quickly did an inspection and it was very clean and smoke free and the view wasn't too bad, the bed comfiness was super imperative to me so I tried it out and it was so comfy we all ended up taking a short nap.
After our nap we went to the pool . They have three I believe but we were all intrigued by the family pool with the water slide and the waterfalls. There were no seats so we sat at the VIP cabana and no one said shit to us, You also get towels when you show them your hotel key card upon entrance to the pool,
Then we got hungry so we decide to use the coupon book the front desk gives you upon check in and it had some great deals. We used the Baja fresh coupon and they were  skimpy and overpriced but nice.  Then we gambled and  we all won . I made $1700 off $100 at the big wheel and with pennies slots my friend kept making high dollar amounts, i love gambling there, The ONLY reason they didn't get five stars is due to the excessive cigarette smell in the casino, it sticks to your clothes and body and it got so bad I got nosebleeds because I am not normally exposed to that and I am very sensitive to it, but the smoke is only in the casino nowhere else,  Im pregnant too so it was so bad I bought a mask, i don't think children should be anywhere near the casino. 
They had a dungeon with arcade games and in the book you get a free midway game so that was fun, 
We also had lunch at bucca de beppo and their family size. Bowl that fed all four of us was $40 bucks and we all had drinks so the total bill was $50 and we used the $10 off coupon from the book so it was an amazing money saving deal, later on for dinner we used the Popeyes deal and they had great customer service up there too,., I'm just glad they had so many food options at the food court and coupon deals that I never had to leave Excalibur.

Let's just say that I agree with the other reviewers that this hotel looks like it has seen better days. The hotel's outside appearance looked pretty cool and picture worthy. However, upon walking inside, you can tell that it is one of the older hotels on the strip. Also, this hotel also seems to appeal more to the older population. There does not appear to be any nightlife here for young adults.

The check-in process was LONG. I've never been to a hotel where I had to stand in line for 30 minutes just to get check-in. However, the young lady that we spoke to at the front desk was very nice and friendly.

On to the rooms... Upon walking in, the room reminded me of one that you would find at a motel or one of those cheaper hotels like Days Inns or Best Westerns. The air conditioner is an old school unit attached to the wall below the window that made a lot of noise while we were sleeping and the fan didn't work very well. The bathroom looked pretty clean at a glance, but a bit dingy and definitely not something you would find at Aria or Cosmopolitan. The carpet looked pretty old and cheesy as well. There was no refrigerator and it was difficult to get adequate lighting in the room. Also, the hair dryer was broken so I slept with my hair wet every night.

We also stopped by the pool as well on our last day. There were a bunch of kids and parents and again an older population swimming and laying out in the sun. It was difficult to find a chair to lay down. Supposedly, the hotel spent millions to renovate the pool area recently. If you're not picky and just wanna go for a swim, then this place would be okay. Don't expect pool parties or a hip bar and you wont find people taking drinks into the water either. You would probably be better off going across the street to MGM for a nice pool party.

There were a few pros to this hotel. Number one is the price. It is one of the more affordable hotels on the strip. We were not picky and we didn't expect to stay within the hotel that much anyway. We took the tram a lot to Mandalay Bay, where the conference was held. The tram is free and it will take you in between Luxor, Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, so that was very convenient.

We chose Excalibur because of it's proximity to Mandalay Bay and it was one of the hotels recommended by the host of the conference. Also, because Mandalay Bay was full for the weekend already. If you are not picky with where you stay or sleep at night and are mostly going to be touring and partying and are looking for something affordable, check out Excalibur. If luxury matters, then go somewhere further down the strip.",0,0,1

As a 39 year old single dad with two teenagers - one boy, one girl - it is important to find accommodations that satisfy everyone's needs.  Excalibur did not disappoint.

Located in a prime area of the south strip, Excalibur offers excellent opportunities to see the major attractions within a reasonable walking distance.  Valet service is reasonably fast, and there is a self-park garage to the west of the hotel facility with adequate parking.  

Registration is surprisingly fast, and the staff knows what they're doing.  I booked my stay through a third party, even though the Excalibur website advertises lowest price guarantee I found that the third party was still less expensive.  Not by much, but enough to make a small difference.  More on that later (Those of you who have read my previous reviews know that I dislike talking prices.)

We stayed in the Resort Tower.  Elevator service was always fast, the facilities were just fine.  The resort tower is the older facility, but still reasonable.  The hallways were clean and had that unique Vegas hotel smell.  The room was clean - slightly smaller than I would have anticipated but adequate nonetheless.  There was no refrigerator in the room and I didn't see an ice machine in the hallway, but we were alright with that.  The room was clean, the place was safe and respectable. WiFi service was free-of-charge and dependable, a big plus.

During our stay, we attended the Tournament of Kings dinner show onsite.  I have reviewed that show separately.  I purchased tickets from the box office adjacent to registration, and was eligible for a nominal guest discount since I was staying at the hotel.

We kept so busy during our short trip that there was no opportunity to visit the pool.  We had a good view of the pool area from our room and it looked clean.   There were people down there from the time it opened until close, The pools are vacuumed nightly and the area is tidied up by pool staff.  

Navigating through the casino area was easy, even with younger guests.  The thoroughfares are clearly established on the carpet and take you past good places to eat, drink, and buy souvenirs and gifts.

I have just a few suggestions;  First, it would have been nice to have the bathroom stocked with an extra small bottle of body wash - just as a nicety.  In all fairness, one hotel bottle of body wash and two-in-one conditioner DID last us each two showers - but with two or more adults it may not have.   Secondly, I was surprised that no resort coupon book was available.  I was offered the possibility of discounts by enrolling in the players club, but I did not wish to enroll in the player's club.   As an MGM resort, I think it would make good marketing sense to advertise offers for Excalibur and it's neighboring MGM properties.. Not to mention it would make me feel welcome and inclined to visit them.  Finally, the best-price guarantee that I mentioned earlier;  Visitors are encouraged to book directly through Excalibur's reservation system with a price guarantee.  However, I DID find a better price on a third-party site.  If you book through Excalibur's reservation system and find a lower price, there is a claim form that you can fill out and submit with proper documentation.  That, to me, seems like a big hassle and I think they can do better than claim forms.

Recommendations;  Hotel check-in is at 3pm.  If you arrive early in the day, it would serve you well to pay an extra $28 (tax included) for an early check-in.  I arrived at 10:30am and after paying for early check-in was in the room by 11.  After a long road trip, no-one wants to go places without showering and changing... So the early check-in is a nice convenience offered by the hotel.  Also, I recommend visiting the adjacent MGM properties of New York, New York, Mandalay Bay, and the MGM Grand as well as Circus Circus.  If you plan on driving around the area, use the self-parking garage. ****UPDATE: Per Excalibur; ""In the Spring of 2016, a fee based parking program will be implemented.""  What this means, I have no idea... But I' don't like it one bit.  MGM had better tread very lightly, in my opinion.****

All said, our experience at Excalibur Hotel and Casino was enjoyable.  In fact, our visit to Vegas was perfect - Everything went right - and having a quality place to stay was a big part of that.  I recommend staying at Excalibur to guests of all ages and inclinations.",1,0,0

THEFT EXISTS IN EXCALIBUR HOTEL !
**************************

IF YOU VALUE YOUR OWN OR FAMILY MEMBERS' LIVES, DO NOT STAY AT EXCALIBUR HOTEL. 

This is the WORST hotel stay my ENTIRE life. Our room got broken into while we're sleeping and the bugler took three iphones and all of our cash with a total value over $2000. There were 4 of us staying at the room and even my friend's phone that's charging at the most inner corner of the room was stolen. All of us were traumatized and feared for our lives for the rest of the trip. What if one of us has woken up and got hurt by the bugler? 

The burglary happened last Saturday morning (8\/24\/2013) between 5 a.m. (when we went to sleep) and 8:30 a.m. (when we woke up). It is amazing how the bugler took his time and scoped out the room and only took cash and iphones (not credit cards\/ipad\/laptops\/jewelry) in such as short window and managed to not wake one of us up. 

What did the hotel do? NOTHING! The security came up and took statement and referred us to the ""Risk Management"" department, which conveniently was closed for the weekend. The security taught us how to ""dead bolt"" lock the door after the fact (you have to turn your door knob upward with a 90 degree angle). There was no instruction on the door for such unconventional locking method. However, after the front desk manager moved to another room, BOOM, there was a sticker on the door showing how to dead bolt the door. It led to us to believe our original room 9206 was a repeated burglary room. 

The entire Saturday was a waste talking to security, front desk manager, hotel manager and they all said they have no authority to do anything and we would have to wait for the ""Risk Management"" department to come back to work on Monday. We followed up on Monday and the Risk Management receptionist told us that ""we're still just getting the report in; you will have to wait until one of the investigators gets the report"". We called repeatedly and she just kept on referring to the investigator. Excalibur is truly amazing on how they just continuously pointing fingers to another person\/department. I called again yesterday (8\/29\/2013) after 5 days of the actual burglary, the receptionist said ""the investigator assigned to your case has just stepped out of the office"" and of course she never called me back. I called again today and Risk Managements' automatic answering machine is on again. I'm assuming they have the Friday off for the Labor Day weekend. 

We checked the reviews on tripadvisor and apparently burglary is a repeated offense in Excalibur. I'm seriously thinking to start a CLASS ACTION SUIT to get justice, and to save future customers form our traumatizing experience. If you have experience with your belongings getting stolen at Excalibur and if you're interesting in joining the CLASS ACTION SUIT, please send me a message.

I will give Excalibur a zero star for the following reasons:

1. Repeatedly burglary offense.
2. No security camera on the hallways.
3. No process in place for burglary events. 
4. Hotel manager don't have any authority to help us.",3,2,0

I did not choose the hotel and was highly amused by the Yelp reviews. We stayed for 3 days. Our room was a decent size and fairly clean. The decor is rather old and boring, but its Excalibur so I wasn't expecting anything mind blowing. We stayed on a smoking floor because my friends smoke, but wow, the whole floor smelled like weed. As soon as the elevators opened, the smell was overwhelming. I opened our window in our room but the window only opened so far, which was disappointing as I would have liked the smoky scent to get out of the room. 

Excalibur itself was a blur of lights, slot machines, smoky air and a large amount of people gambling, drinking and walking to and fro. The interior and exterior are both old and tackily decorated, but it's a theme hotel.. *shrug* I didn't mind the hotel but personally, I prefer very nice things.. so I'd probably not come back.",4,5,2

Room was clean - comfy bed, clean bathroom, no weird smells in the room. Back in 2009, we had the room with the jacuzzi and a great view of New york, New york - it was really nice.

The casino downstairs was totally filled with smoke to the point that it makes my eyes water, but of course - that is expected in Vegas right? Very sad that they closed down Sherwood Forest Cafe. Lots of good memories there, eating breakfast with the family. It was open 24 hours too which was convenient when you didn't feel like wandering off too far from your hotel. With that restaurant shut down, there's only Dicks (which doesn't appeal to me), or resorting to eating the $5 hot dog and beer special at the Sherwood Bar. Anyway, there is not much to do in Excalibur itself, but it is connected to New york, New york, Luxor, MGM so it is very easy to wander out to other places for entertainment. 

They really treat my boyfriend's mom good while she is here though. They send a gift basket to her room, give her lots of comps with free meals and free starbucks, and also give her free nights to stay. So as far as customer service, they really go out of their way to accomodate you.",2,0,0

It used to be married to a hotel with some caliber but they've since divorced.

The 90's called. They want their carpet back.

If you haven't been here, the atmosphere is like walking into an Abercrombie & Fitch run by chain smokers.

If the water in the shower were any harder, it would be hail. (Seriously, the soap would NOT lather up one bit.)

Jerry Seinfeld has a quote that goes something like, ""the scariest moment of a person's life is when you flush the toilet at a party and the water starts coming...up."" That's what this toilet was always like.

And I was very upset that the maid that cleaned the room had thrown away my souvenir bottle!!! Like WHY? It was NOT in the trash can for a reason. .... I kept it on the dresser next to the TV. So I don't see why it had to be thrown out......  (it was a glass souvenir bottle with a cork top)

Also, I keep my tooth brush in a plastic case and after the maid cleaned the room, it was taken out of the plastic case and placed in the restroom next to the other 2 tooth brushes. 

I get that MAYBE she was just trying to make things look ""tidy"" by doing that. ... but if my toothbrush is already in my plastic case then it should just be left there! It was just unnecessary to open someone's toothbrush case just to lay the brush out. .. but I was thinking ""OK whatever, she was just trying to clean.""

Overall, the room was really nice, everything looked new. I also noticed that there was a floor mat the first day.... and the 2nd day it was just gone. I mean, I would have been fine reusing that same floor mat in the bathroom for the whole weekend! But since they took it out I just used a towel for the floor... (I didn't want to slip.. and it gets pretty slippery after a shower!)

Also, there was a really rude waitress in the gaming area... my friend & I were playing slots (where there were 3 machines in a row) my friend flagged down a cocktail waitress to order a drink and she didn't even offer me or the other person in the row a drink. She just took 1 order and took off so fast that I couldn't even ask! (And I was even turned around and ready to ask if I could order) 

And when she got back with my friend's drink, the other person & I asked if we could order a drink. And her response was ,""ugh on my next round!"" ---as if it's our fault that we didn't put an order in when my friend did???? because we were pretty much ignored! 

We were all just in shock with her attitude! I was like, ""what the f***!?"" So we just got up and went next door to Luxor. The cocktail waitresses there are WAY NICER. Even when I wasn't playing at the moment, I was always offered a drink because I was there with someone who was playing! (I would even tell the waitress ""I'm not playing at the moment. ...""--- and she'd still offer me a drink with a friendly smile!) 


So lesson learned..... never let the maid clean my room again & go gamble next door where the waitresses are actually welcoming and deserve a good tip! 

It's a CASTLE on the outside but a DUNGEON on the inside!",7,8,3

The lifeguards are dismal though. I have stayed here approx 8-10 times and have twice intervened in a rescue as an EMT\/Lifeguard and someone who trains lifeguards. Their skills are not sharp, the attention is lacking however they are no different to every other high school and college lifeguard I have met. The fault lies with the pool management. That aside, I love this place and will continue to visit.

We got a free upgrade because they ran out of the rooms that we reserved, which was a huge bonus for us. We ended up getting sick, so four of our ten days were spent in our room. It was nice to the view of the Strip since we couldn't be out exploring. The cleaning people were very nice, and the staff was helpful: everything from bringing us extra towels to keeping our bags during our last day in Vegas (our flight was at midnight, and we didn't want to trek around the city with our bags). The casino is a bit smokey, but for the price, how can you complain? This is not the Bellagio. It seems like some reviewers expect that quality while paying $25\/night. C'mon. Use your head. But, if you're just looking for a place to spend the night because you'll be out on the town for the rest of your time in Vegas, this is the place. The beds are comfy, the pillows are comfy, and if you upgrade your room to a view, you'll have a great view of the area.

We drove up to Vegas to spend our short but sweet honeymoon at the Excalibur. We have been coming back ever since. Our most recent stay was on 7\/4\/2016 for 2 nights. Excalibur has changed a lot since 2002. Some good, some not so good. My husband and I used to love eating at Little John's Snack bar back in the early days. The food was always good and plentiful and priced fair. It was the perfect late night dinner or snack. For several years now it has been replaced with a generic ""La Salsa"" restaurant. We always miss ""Little Johns"" and always wish that MGM would bring back these classic eateries inside their casinos. The rooms at Excalibur are nice,clean, priced fair, and we do appreciate the upgraded rooms. The extra resort fees are ridiculous though. With the money the guests put into the hotel and casino just by staying there, charging guests a resort fee should be illegal. MGM should be ashamed of themselves for charging resort fees to their guest. The policies for the players club change constantly. We never understand the tier credits or comp credits or what our card points will be good for when we play in the casino. The slot supervisor came over to chat with my husband while he was playing slots this past time we were at Excalibur. He told us that each point is like one penny. So if you have 245 points on your card, you have $2.45 you can use as a comp anywhere at Excalibur. We were surprised, by this small amount of comps for our points but he told us to make sure we took our card to the M card membership desk before we leave Vegas to redeem our comps. We did, we saw the same slot supervisor. It turned out our 300 points on each of our cards turned into a $55 comp for our hotel room. Even the supervisor isn't sure how the slot system works. No complaints though we will take the $55 comp. The supervisor even gave my husband $20 free play for his birthday. We were disappointed in seeing the Mcdonalds being no longer at the MGM properties. As far as restaurants go, we are happy about having Buca, Cinnabon, and especially the Johnny Rockets. Johnny Rockets has expensive burgers, but they are really really yummy! All in all Excalibur would be the perfect place to stay in vegas if they took away the ridiculous resort fees brought back Little John's snack bar, and added a better variety of slot machines. Slot machines are getting more expensive. It was hard to find slots where I could play all lines with no less than a .50 cent max bet.

Besides the low price, there's nothing really special about the hotel. It feels old, has an odd stench, and half the rooms aren't remodeled. My room had an old tube tv in which only half the channels had sound. Cmon now, its 2011, please upgrade your TVs!

They charge a resort fee of $9.95 + tax i believe for newspaper and internet? I'm not sure since I didn't use anything associated w\/ the fee. Just another way for the hotels to take your dollars away.

We were lured out to this place because of a deal. Honestly, I would never pick Excalibur to stay at. The location is not ideal to me. I'd rather stay closer to city center and I'm willing to pay for it, but I guess the deal we were offered was too good to pass. 

Parking garage was small but there's plenty of outside parking, but who wants to leave their car out in the hot sun? A few times we just parked at New York New York and walked over. Check-in is 3pm but if you want to check in early it's $20 extra. Lame! At least the lady at the desk ""upgraded"" us for free. Wasn't really an upgrade, just a slightly larger room. 

The casino is old and dingy, but they have free classes to teach you how to play craps and black jack. 

We stayed on the non-smoking floor but it seems a few of the guests decided to ignore that fact. The AC worked but it was old and made a lot of noise. Some of our pillows were lumpy. Bathroom was alright, definitely old. Room had wired internet. The cable reached all the way to the table. It was slow but still glad to have internet! 

Overall, this place could use a remodel. The decor is worn and outdated, but they do try to keep everything as clean as possible. There are a lot of cheap eats within the hotel which is nice and convenient.",6,3,4

Excalibur is just right for us. My family and I have stayed at Excalibur several times and have enjoyed our stay each time. It is family-friendly (as far as Vegas goes) which  is really nice. The past couple of times it has seemed like they are trying to become a little edgier, but it's still better than other hotels if you want something a little less risque for kids. We were able to walk through the hotel at night, go to the arcade, and there are game kiosks throughout the hotel.
The pool is not the best on the strip, but it works. It is towards the end of the strip, but it's not a deal breaker, as there are various buses and monorails to get to the other side of the strip. We really enjoy the free monorail to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay, as they have several places to eat and shop. 
There are places to eat, but it's not the best variety. The buffet wasn't my favorite, but there is a pizza hut, cold stone, krispy kremes, baja fresh, and another place with things like nachos and hot dogs. These places don't stay open too late, though.
The workers have always been nice. I got lost a couple times and the workers were nice when answering my questions. It's a hit & miss with housekeeping. They do a wonderful job cleaning the rooms, but if they don't leave enough towels you may have to call down a couple times. 
As for the hotel rooms, they aren't the best in Vegas, but they're fine for me. The beds are comfortable, there's room to move in the room, and they are recently upgraded (within the past few years). There is a table, 2 chairs, a tv, and beds in each room. We always get the room we request, the non-smoking rooms are really non-smoking rooms (I think there are non-smoking floors), and the towers and rooms are very quiet. I have stayed here many,many times and have never had a problem. (I think I've always stayed in Tower II). Check in is fast and they have a loading area near the towers. They also have great parking. I enjoy the atmosphere as well. There are some kids here, but it's not just for kids. 
I give this place 4 stars because it could improve in some places, but it is a kid friendly and nice hotel, which is what I like most about the Excalibur.",3,0,0

So we check in early and there's a $20 fee... So okay. We go to our room and and I guess it's just the ""standard"" room. The room reminded me more of some motels I've seen and we were not impressed. Through the night we realized that the room has very thin walls and we can hear and were even waken up by people just walking through the hallway. The bed felt old and in desperate need of being replaced, not comfortable at all. And it may be a small detail but the bathroom towels were tiny! I'm 5-06 150 pounds and they were to small for me so I can only imagine how they would fit on someone a little larger? 

The staff was very friendly and helpful when needed. 

We also ended up with enough comp points to basically cover a dinner at the buffet (we were tired and didn't want to go anywhere) it was reasonably priced and was actually very good and a place I would recommend. 

Like I said before this has always been our favorite place to gamble, we just have fun in the casino doing our little $5 bets on roulette or blackjack and can sit in there for the entire day if we wanted.

The rooms are fairly priced because there are no real amenities. We got a $32 room but then you're slapped with a $20 resort fee. The bed was too soft and the pillows were too hard (odd combination). The sound of the AC turning on and off is also really distracting. And last complaint about the room - the blinds don't close all the way so in the morning, sunshine will blast into your room.

The tables ARE cheap and it's a great place to learn some of the games. But the experience is also a little depressing. Something about the low ceiling and bad lighting made me miss any of the other casinos on the main part of the strip.

My MAJOR complaint is the blinds. Even in the new rooms, they installed faux wood blinds that look like they were bought from lowes. Thats find, but it lets a ton of light in. It was hard to sleep in past 8am. When your out until 3am, its nice to have a super dark room to sleep in late. You won't get that here. For that reason alone, I probably won't stay here again.

My ideology behind my hotel room is that in Vegas, you're only going to go there to change, sleep, or utilize the toilet if you have a bad hangover. I am not going to scrutinize every detail or complain about the decor here, because despite its cheesy theme, I enjoy it. Who doesn't appreciate the medieval period of history? I sure as hell appreciate it! 

It's been a while since I have stayed here, but I enjoyed my stay. I was pleasantly surprised at the room. I thought because people bitched and moaned about how old and worn down this place was, that it would resemble a roach motel. It was a nice, quaint little room with semi comfortable beds. I am not picky about what I sleep on, as lon g as it is some what soft. I am pleased to say that I slept my buzz off during my whole stay there.

I didn't gamble on any slot machines, but from what I recall, even in my alcohol induced state of mind, it seemed more family friendly. I saw a lot of families there, so I didn't spot that much eye candy. I was disappointed, but not too disappointed. I also don't recall finding a bar of choice at the casino, so I can't make a comment about that. The place was sprawling, from what i remember, and it was quite a walk from our room to where all the activity was, but I didn't mind. I was happy that I could burn SOME of all the calories I acquired from all the tasty drinks I sipped on.

Last but not least, it all comes down to the food court. I have a weird ritual when I drink. I attempt to not eat so I can get inebriated quicker. Mathematically, it sounds great because it means I don't have to spend much money. Or so I assume. Anyway, after many nights of drunkenly walking across the casino, with a pair of heels on on one hand, and a clutch in another, we all went to the food court so it wouldn't hurt in the morning. Although there were not a lot of choices for the calorie minded, our group simply didn't care because we wanted to eat in the comfort of our hotel. We all adjourned in the food court, and what was our option? Mcdonald's! Well, it was quite alright with us. We were okay with grubbing on salty fries, and eating as many burgers as we could so we didn't have to complain about a dry throat and a throbbing headache in the morning.

Excalibur isn't glamorous by any means. If you are a baller and have large amounts of money to your name, this won't suffice. Go and invest in a wonderful suite, and enjoy all that luxury for me. For po' folk like yours truly, this was quite alright for me. I had a comfortable bed, air conditioning that worked, and a mirror to get ready in front of. Granted, the lighting was horrible, but that's why it is common knowledge that after you are done applying make up,, you should drink so you think you look club ready. All in all, good stay.",9,9,2

They sent up the so call handyman that came in and sprayed a spray in the shower. Dumb move we left him in the room & went out on the town. Just to come back & have several towels on the wet bathroom floor & the carpet in half the room was soaking wet. Luckily we had moved our belongings over by the window.  We was gone for 12hours he knew he made a mess & didnt come clean up. We rented a total of 3 rooms for 2 nights, which was $390 per room. What a waste of time. 

When we called down again, they sent another handyman up which walked straight in with a plunger to the toilet. Hello I said the shower! This wasnt the only problem, they dont give comforters for floors above the 10th. They had to get approval from a manager to switch us out of this soaked 
room, mind you they gave me a hard time took 30minutes to speak to a manager that answered the phone & automaticly placed me on hold.

Don't get me wrong, this isn't the Wynn or Aria -- but you aren't paying Wynn\/Aria prices. We generally try to stay somewhere different each time we visit the strip and I was, admittedly, a little apprehensive about booking a room at Excalibur. But we were going up during the conference basketball tournaments and, after our January stay at the Monte Carlo was such a let down, we just wanted something reasonably priced on the south end of the strip (that wasn't the Motel 6 -- Jenny's veto, not mine). 

Arriving Thursday evening, the aged cartoon castle theme did come off a little cheesy but it was refreshing compared to all the 'faux luxury' presented on the strip. The front desk service was prompt and helpful and the host pointed out our free drink coupons in the coupon book. When we entered our room, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. Like Circus Circus, the Ex has had some fairly recent room renovations and the quarters were easily nicer than Monte Carlo. Granted, our King room did not have a desk or coffee maker, but the bathroom was clean, the bed was made, and everything seemed in place. Everyday during our stay housekeeping brought the room back to par and refilled our toiletries.

Now, like all Strip hotels, everything downstairs is overpriced. Nothing I can do for you here. It's like an airport and it's ridiculous. But that's part of Vegas. I only played downstairs a few times and hit the sportsbook and the bar once (to get those free drinks) but all those employees were professional and cordial. My huge takeaway is the employees who stand around and try to ask if you want to see a show or get a free stay. It gets so old. But I guess it must work. I usually start off politely waving them off as I walk passed and they drop it. If not, Vegas is the kind of place you can ""Go fuck yourself!"" and no one really thinks twice.

The gym is small but was never crowded to the point I couldn't get in a workout. The locker room is great -- they offer juices and it is laid out like a county club bathroom with toiletries and individual showers. The pool is fine -- nestled between the building and the parking garage -- but you can't bring in drinks and they want to charge you top dollar to buy them here.",3,1,1

***************************************************************************A word of warning for anyone going there. The reps that pull you over in the casino and offer you free tickets to shows, in exchange for a ""brief guided tour of a new hotel"" & ""breakfast is included' so that you can tell your friends all about the new hotel is bulls**t. You pay a $40 deposit that you will show (refunded at the end of your 'tour') and are promised seats to the show of your choice. The following morning, just before getting on the bus for your tour, you have to sign a form that you agree to go on a 3 1\/2 hour timeshare presentation, with every high pressure dirty sales trick being thrown at you before you are rudely ejected out the side door of the building if you dare to not see the amazing deal being offered and whip out the cheque book.
Just so you know, at first they offer you a time share at the resort (THE GRAND VIEW) for $42k, then the manager comes over and offers you it for $32k. By the end, if you still haven't signed your kids college fund away, they offer you the same time share package for $4,990. This is no joke, or exaggeration. Warn others. Then when you collect your tickets, they are only vouchers and DO NOT guarantee you a seat at the performance time or day promised. 
On the whole I am very disappointed that the hotel allows these vultures at every corner. The whole experience leaves a bitter taste in your mouth and stays with you longer than the day.",0,0,0

We go on staycations.

Just stayed here last week for 2 days... For my 30th bday actually :) My husband wanted me in a 'castle'.. cute huh! It was perfect for what amenities we would be needing. 

And the VIEW WAS AMAZING! We had a widescreen view room for a small upgraded cost. The room was perfect. Decent size. Access on wall to control your AC\/heat. New comfortable beds. All feathered pillows. Everything in room was new & updated except for shower door.. random. WINDOW OPENED like 4 inches , YaY. Mirror that extended from wall to do my my makeup :) WiFi in each room & is included in your daily resort fee.

As I sat on the toilet the 2nd day... I yelled out to my husband that I could not believe how clean the bathrooms were & the whole room was super clean actually! It was amazing. 

So everything about this room was perfect for what we would be needing it for. It's only 1.7 miles to Ceasar Palace. For my husband & I that wasn't far at all. For some that might be too far but its super close to other popular casinos :)",2,0,0

Why we decided on Excalibur is beyond me but it was the cheapest and really how much are you in your room?!? 

There seems to be a lot of complaints and bad reviews about Excalibur but honestly I was ok with the place. They were a little disorganized at check in and check out**. The room was ok, I liked the bed and pillows here better then anywhere so far on the strip, so that's a plus. The service at the bars in the hotel does suck badly, you're better off going to the Sherwood Cafe in the hotel. As far as others complaining about the families or the people that you pass by there, all I have to say is relax it's Vegas, what do you expect!! Easy to get to parking, a pool, and a work out room (you need a pass). 

ROYAL TREATMENT SPA -located in the hotel 
Maybe it's my fault for not getting a deep tissue but the Swedish was pretty unsatisfying. I was kind of bored and I don't think that has ever happened during a massage for me. So not worth the money, go somewhere else. 

Excalibur wasn't completely terrible but I would stay somewhere else next time.

I'm not surprised that this hotel is only averaging 2.5 stars.
Some people, including my parents (they stayed here about 9 years ago), are saying ""never again.""

My wife and son stayed here from the 22nd-24th (my in-laws were here from the 21st-25th- their room was basically down the hall).

My wife was charged $230.72 for 2 nights.
The Room Rate was only $68\/night, and the Room Upgrade charge was only $10\/night (there are 2 towers, and my father-in-law wanted my wife and son to stay in the same one).
All the taxes and fees, though, added an additional $75.
Hmm.

My wife didn't like having to walk through the casino to get to the front desk (it's quite a walk).
In addition, the line was long.
It took 20 minutes just to check-in.

The room didn't have a fridge or a microwave.
There was also only a shower (no bathtub).
My son is only 3, and he took a shower for the first time (I'm glad that it went well).

There were some stains on the bathroom floor, but my wife's room was otherwise clean.

When my parents stayed here, they noted some of the same things (no fridge or microwave).
In addition, their air conditioning unit was old and really loud.
It kept them from sleeping well.

There are 4,008 rooms (everyone was on the 13th floor).
There are also a lot of restaurants and bars.

The casino seems to be about average in terms of how smoky it is (you're not going to cough up a lung).

As another reviewer states, ""the Tram is connected to this casino in case you don't feel like walking to the Luxor or Mandalay Bay.""

There's free WiFi, but only in the newest rooms.
It's also ""really slow and sometimes disconnects you."" 
  
It costs $10 a person to enter the adults-only pool (I don't like that guests are nickeled-and-dimed so much here).

I've been interested in this place for years, but mainly because of the tournaments (I basically want to see some knights fight and stare at any medieval skanks).

http:\/\/www.bucadibeppo.com\/restaurants\/nv\/las-vegas-excalibur\/:
Buca di Beppo is on the main floor on the left (you just go up this escalator- a Starbucks is on the right).
My wife and son and in-laws really only stayed here out of convenience (they took part in a family gathering).

The Excalibur Hotel and Casino has been around for 25 years.
Still, there's no excuse for how ""old"" many parts of it are.
Some changes are really in order.

This is the renovated side but I had low expectations in the back of my head and was a little worried about the quality of the room. The room was quite clean and very spacious. Didn't smell like smoke according to other reviewers. The bathroom was modern with plenty of space. The only Cons about the room is I wish the had thicker comforter as the air conditioner was always either too hot or too cold. And I wish the room had a fridge. You can rent one for $30 a day but that's ridiculous so my bf and I walked over to CVS and bought a cooler for the room. Other than that the room was fine. The maid cleaned up the room good giving us fresh towels daily. It's a cheap stay hotel exactly what we wanted since we knew we would barely be at the hotel.,4,2,5

Cons: Hard beds like sleeping on a rock.

However, I still expect a reasonable amount of customer service.

Also we saw a show at NYNY and went over there for shopping and the roller coaster which was convenient.

First of all the time share people are unacceptably aggravating! Accosting you at every turn.

I normally stay elsewhere. Its difficult to find rooms with soaking tubs just by going to websites, you have to call from one place to another to find them half the time and even then they are not plentiful (or the rooms are well over a grand for 3 nights). The hotel we normally stay at DOES have them but they were sold out for the weekend (I did book 5 weeks in advance) of that type of room and we wanted that treat, otherwise we probably would have stuck with what we knew.

We've gone to the Excalibur before on multiple occasions because we like Dick's Last Resort and we've also gone to the Tournament of Kings. So for about 600 dollars we spent 3 nights 

Thankfully we didn't spend a whole heck of a lot of time in our room.

Only one of my issues is something completely out of the control of the hotel and that would be the noise. We've never stayed in a room facing the strip before and we were on the corner in tower 2 so there was traffic, loud motorcycles, sirens from ambulances and police, as well as screaming from the roller coaster (this stopped around midnight though, thankfully)

(Enjoying the roller coaster and listening to it whenever your in your room for any period of time can become annoying)

Our room was the FARTHEST room from the elevator, so ALL the way across the casino, then all the way back to the VERY end of the hall in tower 2. This may be because the room had a ""soaking tub""

Our room was.... a shambles. Here is the description of what our room professes to be (snippets from the actual description on their site)

"" Contemporary Superior Room, reign in this beautiful room . Soaking tub and luxurious bathroom featuring granite counter tops. High-speed Internet access.

Contemporary means updated (doesn't it?) This room had a thin blanket that was not really big enough for a king bed with 2 sleeping in it and a thin duvet (more like a sheet covering it) I shouldn't have to crank up the heat because I was given a beggars blanket. but the cover over the thin blanket seemed to be the newest thing in the room. 

The wallpaper was peeling (badly in some places), the tiles in the bathroom were so chipped it looked like someone spilled dirt all over and then didn't bother to sweep it up, the wallpaper had obvious patches in it and then was painted over (if this room was updated WHY wasn't the wallpaper torn down and the room painted, its SO easy and makes a huge difference), the door stop behind the bathroom door was falling out, the chairs by the table were threadbare, the table itself was gouged and deeply scratched (which was made worse by the fact that it was painted black so every scuff made it look cheap and neglected, and there was also a broken cover plate to the plug receptacle.

I was so disgusted I took pictures of all of the things that were tangible. 

Other issues I had?

The Internet being included in your resort fee being only via Ethernet is VERY outdated and misleading, I brought an iPad I couldnt use that Internet. Also the cord didn't even reach the bed, you'd have had to drag a threadbare chair over and sat right next to the dresser where the Ethernet cord was tethered. There was wireless, but it was in the lobby. Who uses Ethernet in a hotel?

The tiling was crooked in the bathroom, this isn't something easily fixed, just another testament to how shoddy the entire place was.

The window shade by the tub was broken completely so you couldn't look out that window while in the bath, (this is a simple and cheap fix, just like the cover plate would have been)

The clover tub was OK, but there was a little plastic sign sitting near the tub (not stuck or screwed in or anything) giving instructions on how to use the jacuzzi and what all the knobs meant, but it was a clover TUB not a jacuzzi, there was ONLY hot\/cold, not a complaint, but still misleading.

In the halls there was graffiti on lighting fixtures (I only took a picture of one but we saw several) and huge dark scuffs on the wall paper in the halls.

Another thing that really bothered me was I've never been bugged by security before in a casino (EVER) and neither has my guy, but there was someone being loud and belligerent with a security guard as we were heading out somewhere and I don't know what it was about but he was drunk and it was unsettling.

I will NEVER stay here again. We will come back for Dick's Last Resort, because that place is awesome but for the price I paid just for an over-sized tub in our room, it was absolutely not worth it.

The Valets and Bellmen were very nice.",8,3,4

The room smelled like a ash tray.. which is fine I guess you know everyone smokes in Vegas but there was a huge sign on the door saying if housekeeping thinks you've been smoking in the room you'll be charged $300. So my husband jumps in the shower and the shower is clogged. I was unpacking the bags and 2 huge cockroaches run across the bed! So I call the front desk asked for another room...they said sure give us 20 min and go to the new room and your keys that you have now will work.

This last trip I played craps and slots. Lost at craps overall, but had a great run while it lasted. Friendly dealers giving me crap about how young I look.

Definitely is not being maintained as well as it could be (I don't think it's changed much at all since I can remember visiting Excalibur.

Has a nice food court and restaurants.

There's a walkway to Luxor which is really convenient and a monorail which takes you to a few other hotels.

I arrived in Vegas on the 3rd of January for a convention and decided to stay at Excalibur. I was disgusted at the clenliness of the the rooms. I could clearly see that the staff does not take pride in maintaining the hotel. The first room that I was given was dirty and had hair on the shower wall, in the sink and under the covers in bed.  I called and they sent someone to the room with a key for another room. That room was also bad. Same issues with the hair and a ottoman with several stains on it. For sure the 3rd room has got to be better. No it was not. This room had part of a toothpick on the carpet along with long pubic hair in the bathroom. I was so grossed out that I grabbed my suitcase and went down to the front desk. I told the manager that the 3rd room was rely disgusting. His response was ""so you want to check out?"" I responded that most of the hotels are sold out because of the convention and I expected to stay here.  He asked me to back to the filthy room and wait for the housekeeping manager to review my claims.  I waited in the room and the manager and another guy came. They both looked at the issues and pubic hair and continued to apologize. She took pictures and said that she will bring up these issues at the next meeting. The thing that pissed me off is that the manager picked up the room phone and told someone that my claims are valid. Rely! It's 3:00 in the morning, all I want is a clean room to sleep in. I'm sure the person she was talking to was the rude manager at the front desk.  After a few moments they reprogrammed my key card and I went to the next room with the housekeeping manager. Thank goodness that this room was finally clean. I was surprised that the manager at the front desk was not experienced in handling this kind of issue. It was very disappointing after wasting my time searching for a clean room and being considered a lier that i was not ever contacted with a formal apology.

I google searched Excalibur, and clicked the direct link to Excalibur.com One the first page there was a link for BOGO (Buy1 Get1) Tournament of Kings tickets. Awesome, so I clicked the link and it took me to the site. Once I realized that on the site I could only purchase tickets from now until 11\/15 I decided to call reservations to see about purchasing tickets further in advance. 

When the female customer service agent answer the call she asked me in disbelief to confirm the website that I was on, informing me that they do not have a BOGO promotion. I read her the exact url address and offered to email her a screen shot. She was not listening to me and just repeated that they do not have this promotion. I am so tired of customer service people not listening or refusing to believe me. I asked for a manager or someone else that can help me. She put me on hold until a manager was available. At that time the manager informed me that after Nov 15 or 16 holiday pricing takes effect and the BOGO is no longer offered. 

1st, someone needs to educate the customer service representatives so that they have this information. All of this could have easily been avoided had she been aware of this information. 

2nd, I have lived in Las Vegas my whole life and I am very aware that holidays are often the slowest period for casinos, specifically around Christmas. So I find it very unlikely that they are not going to offer BOGO during this time. As a local, I feel it is incredibly rude and outrageous for the CS agents to be treating people this way.

First of all, it seemed as if to get any where in the hotel, you had to walk through the casino and I went to other hotels and that wasn't an issue there. Secondly, the parking is awful. You either search 45 min for a surface parking spot or try your luck in the 3-story garage a mile from the hotel doors. Service was alright, wasn't rude and not a problem. Now, the room. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It is absolutely awful, it smells like stale cigarette smoke and must. If you could book a non-smoking room there wasn't a mention of it. There was no wifi and there wasn't a channel guide for the TV. The TV also was not even close to HD. The beds were hard as a rock and the blankets were thin and cheap. This hotel also has the worst dining on the strip. A dicks last resort? Really? I know most hotels had fast food courts but fast food seemed the best the Excalibur could offer. As for a view, you either pay more for one of the strip or you get the parking lot or a brick wall. Cheap, tacky decor seemed to be a big theme at this place. The only redeeming qualities was that I heard they had a DQ and their pool. The extra $40 for a different hotel on the strip is absolutely worth it. This place is essentially the Motel 6 of the strip. Just know, looks can be deceiving",0,0,0

I must - while I await my room service coffee (because there is no complimentary coffee in the ""room"") - so you pay $22 for 8 cups (Im sure they will be small. Oh - the coffee is only $15 - but there is a service charge and tax- of 4.50 and 2.50 respectively).
Then I can move beyond it. No really - I can.
Lets start from the beginning, shall we?
You cannot pull up to a location to unload your multiple bags and ""stuff"" - unless you pay for Valet Parking. Either you pay valet, or schlep your bags across a parking lot (that's if you can find a space) - and that walk could be anywhere from 100 feet to 3 blocks if you have to park in the ""garage"". Ridiculous.
Bags go one way - we go another. We are supposed to call when we get to our room, but the guy who unloaded the bags from the car gives me a ""tip"". ""Tell the lady at the desk to call. Save time. Ok, buddy, thanks. Tip him. Tip the guy who brings the bags up.
Not 5 steps in the door we are greeted (myself, wife and wifes friend- both filipinas) - by a VERY friendly Filipino man - who of course latches on to the 2 Filipina ladies - like a long lost brother. ""Ohhh you are filipino - let me get you some vouchers!"" Takes us over to the counter where another guy with teeth and manner like Wink Martindale takes over. Now actually I am looking forward to this. I know its coming thanks to a friend . I am willing to go along with the three hour trip to see a vacation home - because she got show tickets, free dinners, and free airfare. So I play along. A long story short - I get nothing like that offered to me. I DO get offered $100 in spending cash, 3 show tickets (he sees there are 3 of us) for $105 - about a third off, and a future 3 day 2 night free stay at Excaliubur (yehhhhh - RIGHT - like thats gonna happen now.) I have to get him up to this offer...its not his initial offer
Ohh...coffee just arrived - ""cash only, sir... they did not tell you?""
""Uh... no... they didn't."" Give him 2 20's and he cant figure out the change- then he doesnt have it. I'm cutting zero slack by now. ""Come back when you have it...meanwhile I keep the coffee.""
He starts to leave with my $40. ""Uhhh...no... that stays here. Come back when you have change.""
Back to Wink..... I actually tell him I will do it - (I have not seen my room yet) - but he wants $50...cash...as a deposit. Offers to pay my ATM fee (thats big of you). but by now Ive had enough. He has looked at our Cards to see that we're married - verified income (very un-specifically, of course), gotten my email and a look at my DL.... I've had enough..... I walk.
Parting shot at Wink. Near the end of his schpeel - I say ""How long will you be here?"" He looks at his watch. ""35 minutes.""
Funny thing though.... 90 minutes later I walked out to dinner - guess who is still there? If he had caight my eye I would have called out something. He didn't. I didn't.
40 minute wait to register. I tell the woman ""I was offered a room upgrade- and paid for it already."" 
""Oh yes,sir... have it right here."" Points to a picture... looking good. I ask for a high floor. No problem. 27th floor is newly renovated.
great...up we go.
I suppress my disappointment in front of the girls - this room is a dump. I would expect it in a cheap motel somewhere between Winnemucca and Wendover - not here on the Vegas Strip.
Far from the picture I saw there are fresh sheets and white comforter on the beds - but no colorful bedspread. The floors are carpeted in an ugly brown (Newly renovated? I think not). The bathroom is sparse - no extra lotions or conditioner like we had in Anaheim. No extra towels. And NO FRIDGE or COFFEE? This requires a phone call to which I am told ""No rooms come with a fridge - that is an extra charge of $26 PER NIGHT!!""
Are you freaking kidding me?? A mini-fridge is expected. Its not something one should be required to ask about before arriving. Coffee too.
The brochures they leave you - room service menu, etc - is stained with previous food orders. Magazines have been used and re-used.
Oh...Julio just came back with the change. Counted it out like he knew what he was doing.
No tip... and honestly he didnt look like he expected one.

Looking over the room service menu - $18 for a fruit plate..$19 for pastries, coffee and juice- $21 for bacon and eggs

Oh... one more rant - ""complimentary"" wi-fi internet speeds below 10mbps

Review #49:
why is it that the 2 remaining ""family friendly"" resorts (this place & Circus Circus) on The Strip are at the low end of the spectrum and future candidates for implosion?; the main floor, including the knights\/medieval theme, just looks tired and out of date; it is a half-step above Circus Circus however, for whatever that's worth; the 2nd floor with a few shops and a couple of decent restaurants at least looks semi-modern; there is a huge kiddie-city gaming area for all of your rugrats, that is fortunately on a separate level from the main casino floor; the parking is out of date too, with an uncovered hike from the garage to the casino; best craft beer bet = well, you can imagine, as every bar is the same here; but I did find one with a few craft beers (including Tenaya Creek brown ale), and probably best is the 2nd floor big sundries & liquor store which includes a few craft bottles to go",2,0,0
1283193,-XdpUQNf5_WsFSVd8o7Ciw,NWhiK3EqtI1jVXEAHmmI2A,o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w,1,2007-08-01,"Staying in the Excalibur is like accidentally stumbling into the 1960s, when Camelot was on Broadway and empire waist dresses were really fashionable.  Except that was 40 years ago, and did I mention the hotel looks like it's been untouched since 1960?  To be fair, the cocktail waitresses' outfits remind me of the late 1980s, so that's a moderate improvement.  

The best thing I can say about the Excalibur is that it's cheap, and it's on the strip.  Those are two positive points (thus the two stars).  Oh, and there are two Starbucks in the bottom floor now - trust me when I say this is an improvement on the meager options that used to exist!!  

Sadly, I have to stay here for work every year so I will be back.  A couple of tips I've picked up along the way:

1.   There is always a line at the Starbucks in the food court, but there is NEVER a line at the Starbucks on the casino floor.  Go to that one unless you like excessive waiting.

2.  Speaking of excessive waiting, the first time I came to the Excalibur I was really frustrated that I couldn't get the ""Express Check-in"" kiosks to work.  I've found the trick.  There is an online check-in website where you can basically pre-register to check in - if you follow the instructions on the website, you'll be able to swipe your credit card and check in without waiting in the lines (which are ALWAYS ridiculous).  It doesn't work unless you pre-register in advance, but it's definitely worth it.

3. It's a lot more fun if you have a sense of humor about the ridiculously low-tech ""light show"" surrounding Merlin at the entrance, the dimly lit rooms, and the ""tapestries"" on the walls.  Oh, this also goes for any lounge or featured entertainment performing at the Excalibur (I'm talking about you, ""Thunder from Down Under!"")",3,1,0

However, if you don't like kids, then this isn't the place for you.  It's pretty much the only casino on the strip where you will see kids running around.  There is a kids section on the ground floor where there are all kinds of carnival games (and best of all - a DQ and Orange Julius *YUM*)

There are 4 pools and one of which is adult only.  The alcohol at the pool is very reasonably priced - which is very important - and there is no shortage of servers that will bring all of the food\/drink you can possibly consume so that you don't have to move an inch if you don't want to.  The vibe at the pool is a lot of fun.  When I was there, they tossed out a bunch of balls and everyone was playing with them - even the guys that were trying to Mack it with the ladies.

The casino has an awesome atmosphere to it.  The staff would greet us by our names, often times before we even showed our player's card - perhaps that says something about our routine - but I digress

From October 26 to 31, 2015, I stayed at Excalibur. On the evening of October 29 (technically the 30th since it was 1:00 a.m.), we were locked out of our room. The night latch had slid over and thus, we could not enter our room. I get this happens and we get into our room.  Then on October 30 at 4:30 p.m., my wife tries to enter our room and the same issue takes place. So, security is flagged down to try to help, but seeing that I'm not with my wife, they have to find me in the casino to get my approval to fix this issue and let them in the room. Now, again, I understand this, as frustrating as it was. It is at that time that security escorts me to the front desk. The person appointed to help out identifies himself as the Assistant Manager for the Front Desk. The security guard details what has happened and the Assistant Manager says ""I'll call engineering right away"". I'm left standing there for two minutes wondering what that means, but fine, he appears to be solving the problem. He returns from his call to tell me that someone from maintenance is going to be by the room to let us in and they will be ""at the room before we can even get back to it."" 

He acts like this solves everything, but how is this solved. I turn it back to him and ask how he can assure me that this won't happen again (personally, I thought I'd at least be offered another room) and his response is ""trust me, the problem will be solved"". I ask how can you assure me that given this is the second occurrence to which I get this doozy ""here's my business card with my direct line. If you have this occur again, just call me and we'll fix it"". First, where's my apology for this even happening. And then, how is it fixed if I need a business card from this guy ""in case it happens again"", when I'm told it's solved!! 

Granted by this point, I'm upset but I go up to my room and imagine this, no one is up there as promised. So I pull out my fancy card and call the Assistant Manager and wow, he doesn't pick up. It rings a good dozen times. Nothing. I hang up. Eventually a maintenance person does show up and he gets us in the room and removes the night latch so we don't have this problem anymore (why not do this the first time?).   After, I go back down to the lobby, find the Assistant Manager and confront him. ""I just called and you didn't pick up"". He then looks at his phone perplexed and says, ""did you just call me now?"" I say my two cents about how ridiculous of an experience it is and leave the area.  

When I get home, I send an email to Excalibur to outline my concerns as I'm still quite upset with what happened and seriously shocked it was as bad as it was.  After sending my email, Excalibur finally gets back to me in December with a phone call.  

In spite of it taking five weeks to get back to me, the person I deal with (the Director of Guest Experience with Excalibur) seems genuinely disappointed in the situation. She follows up our conversation by inviting me back to Excalibur for a complimentary two night stay in one of their superior suites and would provide me with discounted rates for any additional nights.  

You can't undo what happened, but this was a fairly nice gesture.   So, on March 4, 2016 I email the Director of Guest Experience with Excalibur as I am planning to go back to Vegas for a three night stay in early April 2016.  I ask her to let me know of the availability and what the additional cost would be for the third night.  

Later that day, I get a reply that says, ""I have reached out to our room reservations department to check our availability and see how much the rates would be for the additional third night.  I should hear back from them either today or tomorrow.""

Well, today marks exactly two weeks since I last heard from the Director of Guest Experience or Excalibur.  As a result, I've booked to stay elsewhere.  I'd rather have an enjoyable experience than constantly be marginalized by Excalibur.  It's now clearer than ever that the attempts in every situation to address issues is so unimportant to these people.  If anyone at Excalibur with a customer service bone in their body reads these posts, seriously consider having a real discussion with your staff about responsiveness and customer service.

Let's all look forward to some half-hearted reply post from Excalibur where they will sincerely apologize for the events that took place during and following my stay at the resort and also for the inconveniences experienced.  No doubt they'll promise to learn from this and enhance their performance.

Then we walked through the very smokey (what's up with that?) casino trying to found the check in. The signage here isn't really that great, honestly. Then, waited in the check-in line for around 20-25 minutes. We were really surprised at the wait considering it was almost midnight. Check in was fairly easy. Finding our tower was a bit of a guessing game as it felt like we had to go all the way back across the casino again.

Our room was nice and large but no fridge or microwave. Which, okay. But there wasn't even a coffee pot! I think it's the first hotel we've stayed in that didn't at least have that. Our view was the roof. Not a super huge deal, until lights out. What was in the roof area were lots of lights. Our curtains didn't close all the way so we had bright lights staring us in the eyes as we tried to sleep. We were thankful it was only two nights of bad sleep. The room overall was okay but a little dirty.

After walking what seemed like an eternity in 30 something degree weather with a one year old and our luggage we we're guided to the registration desk at the other side of the hotel!
Upon arrival we we're told we couldn't get a room because check in is not until 3PM and they either way they were sold out! However for a nominal fee of 28$ plus the room at 150$ we could get a room at 10:30am; Whattt???!!! And
Since my friend was already there she offered us to crash with her and after the staff checking with them (good security point thety called the room first) they gave us a key to the room. 
With high expectations since it's you know VEGAS and our first time there tired but very excited up to the room we went.
On our way we decided to just drop of our stuff (since it was now 6am and my friend's family would still proably be sleeping) go eat and shop to let my friend and her family get up and about and until 10:30 so we could get a room.
After all that we came back and we're informed there we're still no rooms available so up to the room we went to plan out the day.
When finally seeing the room in daylight I have to say I WAS TRULY DISSAPPOINTED, the room was a non smoking floor and someone obviously ignored that, the room smelled of old and dirty carpet, the furniture is completely outdated, and so is the bathroom, the screw to the lamp my was so fragile my one year old manged to unscrew it.
*Sigh, I've worked in the hotel industry so I know what to look for in cleanliness, it was decently clean, the toilet is not often scrubbed since you can tell where the dingeness starts, the towels were decent, the bed was soft, the ac vent and the air vent in the bathroom we're clean, the shower was well scrubbed (We checked before anyone showered).
Tho the furniture is supposed to be mediaeval it was more dingy meets mediaeval, the tv had well no entertainment just your basic antenna channels is what it feels like, not great TV quality...I guess I expected more since it's supposed to be a Vegas hotel, after deciding this room was not worth the 100-and something we decided not to rent one there.
However the staff itself was always friendly and courteous.",0,0,0

Room has no sound barriers.  You hear everything all around you including other guests.

Lastly, Unlike other establishments Excalibur is not a non-smoking friendly experience.  Our clothes smelled of stale secondhand smoke within moments of entering the Casino.

He went and actually poured two doubles while staring at us, dumped them into a new drink and slammed them in front of us. Even though he was being a complete jerk, I threw down $6 for his tip.

Overview: All of my equipment was delivered wet, people were not helpful, contacting them several time but ignored me, etc... I don't have enough room to add everything so this is the short version.

We arrived at Excalibur on a Saturday, we had the bell person load our items onto his cart. Him & I loaded the items to the cart, we let him know which pieces were valuable so that he would be extra careful. Since I am a photographer and my sister-in-law and brother are videographers we have a lot of valuable equipment so we wanted him to know how important these items are to our livelihood. The bell person brought everything up and placed all of the items down. 

The next morning on Sunday we woke up, got ready to go to our conference called the WPPI located at the MGM. The WPPI is a photography conference that we attend every year. I picked up the laptop bag out of the closet and the entire bag was soaked, we had no idea how it got soaked but everything inside was completely wet! We then freaked out because we did not want any of our items to be damaged. All of the items in the laptop bag were DRIPPING WET! We went to the bell desk to let them know that the laptop bag was soaking wet and they left a note for the head bell caption, we waited for him to come for a little bit but we had no time to wait since we were trying to get to our paid classes on time. These classes are very important and we paid a lot of money to attend, we did not want to waste our money by not going to the classes. As soon as all of our classes were done we came back to the front bell desk to follow up regarding the problem. They then had the bell caption come out to speak with us, he said that we will need to put a security claim in so we can have it investigated. They then sent up someone from security to look at the situation and all of our wet equipment. He and I took photos of all of the equipment that was wet, I would love to add the photos I took but it does not seem to allow me. You can see from the wet bag laying on the bed how it was still soaked even after the entire day passed. We had SD cards has wedding videos from the weekend before which is worth thousands of dollars and not to mention memories that could never happen again. Once we put the SD cards in the laptop it gave us the error shown in the photo. The videos are a part of my sister-in-law's & brother's portfolio, worth thousands of dollars and their reputation, she freaked out once she saw these error. We wrote out an incident report for them. He said he will write the report and have it in by that night and to call tomorrow morning. 

On Monday  I called the security at 10am to find out an update and they did not have any news yet.

On Tuesday I called the security again around 10am but no answer.

On Wednesday. We were there from 8am to 10pm attending all of our registered classes and events, after our classes ended we went to go get something to eat. We walked back to our hotel room at 12:00am midnight and were startled to find a big blue loud fan in our room facing the closet. I found my $500 Ice Light turned on. 

We have called several times to check the status of the incident and left messages but they do not care about their customers. I didn't even get an apology which is so crazy. This happened in March and it is now June and nothing has been done to this date. I would recommend that you do not waste your money here because you could be spending thousands of dollars worth in the end.",3,1,0

The price to stay at this hotel is VERY FAIR. If you compare it to many other hotels, you would appreciate the price of Excalibur. Of course you're not sleeping in 5 star rooms, but they are more than comfortable and as I've stated above, they are a cut above Circus Circus. 

All the staff on hand are very friendly and the random characters walking around the hotel were humorous, to say the least. I haven't done the the ""Knights of the Round Table"" thing or whatever it's called, but it's something I wish to do when I come back just to see what it was all about.

The hotel is right on the strip and with the tram stopping at the Excalibur, navigating around the strip from here is not a problem at all.

So why three stars and not anything higher? When you compare it to Circus Circus, yes I believe it is a significantly better hotel\/casino. If you compare it to the other big names on the strip (Wynn, Caesars, The Rio... blah blah) it doesn't compare. Of course those places cost an arm and a leg but you get what you pay for.

But we also payed 1\/5th the price for almost the same Vegas experience. 

Pros- easy check in. Upgraded to king room for free. Friendly service at the ""shops"" concierge table and housekeeping. Within walking distance to most areas of the strip. 1-2miles isn't a terrible walk. Uber and Lyft are great options. $5 to Bellagio\/Cosmo\/Venetian\/etc. still cheaper than booking there. 

Cons- nothing fancy, smells like Vegas, ""value"" customer so you are gonna get all walks of life. 1-2mile walk to ""new Vegas"" 

Overall it was a great stay and great hotel for our first time in Vegas. Knowing what we paid for, I would give it 4 stars easy. Most people will rate it 2 or 3 cause they want to pay Excalibur prices but get Venetian experience.

First stay @ Excalibur was this past weekend, April 27 for 4 nights (quick girls getaway).... Yep, we were looking for cheap - both accommodations (seriously, how much time do you spend in a room anyway?) & lower limit craps helps......  I really don't have many complaints.   

Arrived around 3 pm on a Friday (I'd assume that is near a prime check-in time) & yep, there was a line but it moved pretty well. We were given 2 bed room, as requested in Tower I (later was told Tower II is nicer, so......). Went straight to our room, it was acceptable. Had view of Tropicana, nothing special but I guess better than a brick wall.  Yes, the room was dated (old carpet,bedding, furniture) but it was clean. 3 girls in 1 room, it did have something we needed:  a large bathroom! Single sink but large space with long vanity for all our stuff.

We were in our room for maybe 3 minutes before heading out. 

The next morning, our entire hallway reeked of weed. Cannot totally blame Excalibur for that, but still........  

My 2 girlfriends went to the pool & thought it was fine (went to the adult only section). They were there way early (9:30 a.m.), stayed for a couple of hours. Said by the time they left, people were stalking them for their chairs because it was so crowded. 

Left note for housekeeping requesting additional towels, which was accommodated. 

Didn't gamble @ Excalibur at all until late night Saturday & it was great. Friendly dealers (I only play craps).  Other patrons playing were sometimes a little shady; not unexpected at lower limit tables. 

Rented a car for a drive to Red Rock Canyon (cool, btw). rental car service @ desk was easy ....walking to the parking garage & the garage itself:  sketchy, ewwwww.....

Tried to use free drink coupon @ Sherwood Forest and was basically duped. Guy totally saw my coupon (and consistent with a lot of others, he basically ignored us as long as possible & then was pretty rude). I order vodka tonic & when we handed, said I could not use coupon for Absolute. I never requested Absolute. So he told me I had to pay for my drink....  Bait & switch. I should have been more assertive but didn't want to make a scene over $10 in front of my friends so I let it go. 

At checkout, another long line. I opted to just leave.  I emailed to request a copy of my bill, which was promptly sent & was accurate.  

All-in-all, I didn't hate Excalibur (& I've stayed in fabulous places worldwide). I didn't eat in any of the restaurants, I only gambled there late night as we were coming home....  I found it to be a great bargain for on the strip & is worth checking out if you want nothing but the basics.   Biggest complaint is the $15 resort fee for pretty much nothing:  no one WANTS to honor the coupons & there is no wireless.",1,0,0

I stayed in the resort tower which was convenient to most everywhere I needed to go including the bus pickup and tram station. My room was on the 22nd floor and overlooked NYNY and MGM.

GILBERTO!!!  He was the lovely man that checked me in!  He is the cutest thing ever and was so welcoming and sweet to me!  He was professional but also welcoming and social and really just a breath of fresh air!  It is because of him that I decided to stay again on my way home.  I travel a lot with work and I will now be using Excalibur as my bi-monthly stop because I loved his service so much!  For the record, he wasn't working on my second stay and the lady that checked me in then was also amazing and super sweet!  I wish I remembered her name so that I could give her credit also!

I just hope that if the managers\/owners read this that they let Gilberto know that he is doing a great job!  While I am writing this review, I am 100% certain that I am not the only person that feels this way.  You guys have a winner with this one!  I hope you are treating him as well as he treated me!

So I come on the weekend of EDC, a weekend event with a 100,000+ attendees. All I can say is that there were a lot of lines and a very unpleasant experience. Since check in at the hotel is after 3pm, we come at about 4:15pm to see a line that loops around the lobby and casino. After an hour in the line, I estimated that it would take another two at least based on the pace. I find out that the computers at Excalibur and MGM are down for a few days and a few more to come.. understandable, but just barely. Employees pass out free drink vouchers throughout the line to alleviate the stress. Too bad you can't get drunk off their stingy well drinks. I planned to eat at the Wynn buffet with friends at 6:30 that night, definitely not happening. Thanks. At 7:45 we get to the registration and it takes about ten minutes to get us our rooms through the computer. They upgrade our room from the cheapest room to a slightly less cheap room (a $10\/night difference), how sweet of them. We rush to our rooms to find out that the room they assigned us to already had occupants as blatantly visible by the bags, clothes, and electronics left throughout the room.

Okay. Are you serious, Excalibur? You just gave us access to someone's room. I could've easily stolen anything. Seriously. What the hell. 

I use the hotel room phone to call front desk and tell them that the room they gave us already had people in it. The woman on the phone is shocked by this, so shocked that she hangs up on me. Another strike, Excalibur. I call them again and another woman answers and apologizes and tells us to come down to the lobby. We lug our baggage across the hall, down the elevator, through the casino, and back to the lobby where a rude ass front desk woman questioned us about the validity of the pre-occupied room. She eventually gave us another room, one with a slightly dysfunctional door, but at least it was empty on the inside. At this point, I was ready to use those free drink vouchers, all forty of them. Yeah, they gave us forty free drink passes.

The maid service was kinda shady. You can hear them coming down the hall, like five doors down because they frantically yell out ""ROOM SERVICE, HELLO? ROOM SERVICE"", an awful sound at 9am. I put do not disturb for a reason. Whether or not this may be my fault but I left my room door partially open one night and when the maid arrived the following morning, she yelled into my room ""EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THIS DOOR. IF YOU DON'T CLOSE THIS DOOR, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CALL SECURITY. EXCUSE ME!"" And I'm like.. are... you.. serious... God gave you hands for a reason. Please do us both a favor and close the door!

The wife had been lookin for deals last week and this hotel apparently had 4 nights for about $270. What a deal right? WRONG! As soon as I checked in there's a ""hidden resort fee"" of $67 to use the ""amenities"" of the facility such as the fitness center, pool, Fun Dungeon Arcade, etc. Nice of them to mention that fee as we were booking the reservation. So, we check in and as they point us to the bell desk they ""failed"" to advise me that their bell staff is in the heat if a union labor dispute which prevents them from providing us bell service to our room. WTF?! The lady at the bell desk NOW informs me of this and after some pissing and moaning I get a cart; However, the guy who brought it to me was nice enough to tell me ""fuck them! I know I'm not supposed to do this but WTF is the service that you expect when you come to Vegas? It doesn't make any sense?!"" We had an enlightening discussion as I sent the wife and kids up to our room and I went with the bell guy and out luggage. Apparently, the Luxor and Excalibur are ""merging"" and the staff are getting screwed out of their tips: the valets are too apparently. Just to save a few bucks management tells the bell staff ONLY to assist the disabled and elderly; I talked with a supervisor at the front desk and she went with the political excuse that ""they cannot refuse service if you request it"" but ""they instructed their staff to ONLY assist the elderly and handicapped."" After I pulled the ""discrimination card"" she told me this. Completely unprofessional. As we went to other hotels in the area such as the New York New York, Circus Circus, and the Luxor, it was nothing but tired folks hauling their own luggage around checking out (we went to lunch around check out time at these places) and checking in. Now, back to our hotel; we got housekeeping service 2 out if the 3 days we stayed; we came back from a fun day and I found filthy towels STILL on the floor and the room hadn't been touched. I called for towels and washcloths instead since we were leaving Sunday morning; I had to leave to catch the ""Tournament of Kings"" show downstairs (which was bad ass I should tell you). When we came back, there was a bag thrown on the floor with soap and shampoo; in the bathroom there was a stack of ""leaning"" towels and washcloths left in haste. Needless to say, the service in Las Vegas is going to the dumps. The buffet sucked; we never got to  breakfast during our stay  (a Mexican thing) and I wish I could've. From my experience, breakfast seems to be the best meal in the buffets. There was no safe deposit box in our room AND NO interior lock on our doorknob like other hotels which really pissed me for security and privacy reasons. All they gave us was the stupid door hanger ""privacy please"" which I'd expect from a Motel 6 not an upscale strip hotel. Self parking is a joke; almost had some ""parking rage"" on the 2nd night but I survived with a clean Vegas rap sheet j\/k. The valets are understaffed and have major A.D.D. so there is no ""sure fire"" time to get valet. The lamp outlet in our room couldn't hold a plug, two wall outlets didn't work AT ALL. The toilet was so low flush ""Eco-friendly"" we almost had to use the ice bucket to assist with flushing *yuuuck!* On a positive note, the bathroom was roomy, shower was ""intimate friendly"" and plenty if sink space.

We didn't explore the options of what the hotel had to offer.

Watch out for the guys that appear to be real helpful, and seem like hotel staff. They try to sell you on the timeshare option, and say that they will give you tickets to 2 shows. Just politely walk away. Be abrupt and direct or they will never let you go.  Vegas is hurting for money and will do anything to get more of it. 

The rooms were clean, reasonably priced, easy checkout and check in. I have no complaints about that. We had a room with a view of a brick wall next door. Didn't matter too much since we only slept there.

The floor layout is marginally easier to navigate than the MGM Grand diagonally opposed, or NY NY directly opposite; it has a few watering holes that are low-key and friendly enough, even going so far as to only charge me $5 for a near-pint of ale.  However, it's not the most updated joint, and I'm fairly sure they market to the low-end consumer.

Rooms are decorated in a kind of weird para-medieval theme, which makes sense since I'm staying at Medieval Time writ large.  The A\/C unit is loud, and about thirty years old.  Maybe 35.  It also blows the curtains around, so sleeping is a lot like attempting it near a helicopter.  I managed to get the window open, so I'm just choosing background street noise over the Huey Cobra ambiance.

The bathroom is also a 1977 special.  Some updates, like large tile, are amusing paired with showerheads from the 60s.  Individually-wrapped plastic cups are an ironic ""Death by plastic"" thematic touch.  Also, house staff will place your soap in one of the cups, because soap dishes did not exist in 13th century England.

The cable modem is almost daring me to hack it.  I leave it alone, because for whatever reason, wired Internet here is fantastic.  No WiFi, but I absolutely do not care.  Great speeds, almost makes up for the single bar of 2G connectivity I get in Tower 1 (VZW).  TV is a flat-screen, which is nice, and zero movie channels, which is offset by the ridiculous download speeds.  I strongly suggest packing an HDMI or VGA cable with your laptop if you stay here.

The elevators are frequently littered by the aforementioned low-end target demographic.  Staff simply cannot keep up with the myriad ways in which the lowlifes decorate the floors with french fries.  The hallways are also under attack from these reprobates.  Good times.

I haven't gone to the pool yet, and think I will just skip it.  It's a cheap place to stay with good walking connections to other casinos, and while I'm probably not going to return here if I can manage it, it wouldn't be the worst place I've ever stayed, either.

The Excalibur is also home to a big food court, with Starbucks, McDonalds, Krispy Kreme, and Scholtzky's, to name a few of my favorites, they've got a little something for everyone who would rather spend their moolah on some gambling or drinks than a fancy dinner. Their famous restaurant down by the casino, Dick's, is fabulous fun! The bartenders and servers are famously rude and therefore hilarious, putting paper hats with cruel slogans on their customers and making fun as you down your booze.

This hotel is also very kid friendly if you're taking the whole family, with their Fun Dungeon arcade and their King of Tournaments jousting show.

The casino itself has the usual slew of tables and computer slots, along with a sports booking bar to bet on the upcoming games. I'm not a huge gambler but I do enjoy killing some time at the video poker games at the Sherwood Bar downstairs while knocking back some free watered down drinks.

All I really look for is a decent rate, a clean room and a bed that isn't stuffed with a dead hooker. Excalibur met those needs. Checking in was quick and easy, although finding my room was odd. My card said room 17 and I walked up and down the hallway looking for it to no avail. I finally asked a housekeeper and she said it was 117. ?!? No big. 

I do have a few complaints. 1) The parking lot is a little far from the hotel and there is no connecting bridge or moving walkway that leads to it. 2) I was having problems with the in-room pay per use internet. I called the Tech Guy and as expected, he had a very condescending way of talking. Made me feel stupid. He asked me what my VPN was. I said ""What's a VPN?"" He said ""If you need to ask what it is, there's no need for you to be asking questions about it."" F-U PRICK! After a half hour of not getting it to work, I gave up and got a refund. I then used the alternate wireless services. The one I picked by Travelocity worked, but it was a pain trying to connect to it. Tip: The Starbucks in the food court has free wi-fi although they don't advertise it. 3) There is a prevailing stench of cigarette smoke in the hotel towers. I don't know if being from California and not being used to indoor places that allows smoking had anything to do with it, but it did take some getting used to. 4) Being a guy, staying at a hotel who's main attraction was a bunch of male strippers from Down Under was disturbing. 

Would I stay at Excalibur again? Maybe, if I was with a bunch of my cheap friends. No, if I was with someone that was special to me. I think for that I would try the Venetian.",1,3,2

We're no better than anyone else, but hope you like rowdy 20-somethings out for their first night in Vegas, complete with the footlong beer bongs and paper hats.

Internet? Sure! We were told, but came to find out that is is wired Ethernet only; NO wireless. Want a cup of coffee after using the gym? Forget it; they required not only the room key which we had, but also, ID. All they had to do was look us up to see that we were in fact registered there AND had our room key. I had a martini in the bar and my wife had a coke. When she asked for a refill on the soda, they said sure - it's another $3.50, despite the fact that I paid for a 2nd martini and was gambling at the bar on the video poker.

The room was clean, except for the same pervasive cleaning agent smell, but had no night tables, no reading lamps, no mini-bar, and very little furniture. A bed, a TV, a small table, two chairs, and a lamp. I know, for $49. what did I expect? Well, there are thousands of rooms in Vegas with better accommodations and wireless Internet, and places that don't nickle and dime you to death at every turn.

Yeah, the casino floor isn't too bad and if you bet enough on the bar machines, you get free drinks.  These two factors alone do not merit a second star.  Unfortunately my girlfriend and I made the mistake of actually getting a room here.

(If you want to only read my review of our room and stay, please skip to the section entitled, ""Our Second Mistake."")

The only reason we gave The Excalibur a chance was due to those delightful employees in blazers standing at every entrance.  We were stopped by one on our way out after getting massages at the spa on Super Bowl Sunday.  ""Are you guys coming back to Vegas in the next 12 months? Yes? How about a deal?'

Sure, deals are great!  Basically for a $99 deposit we would get a room for 2 nights and $99 worth of show tickets.  We joked at the idea of staying in a knight themed room and signed up.  We were told that we would only be out our deposit if we didn't book within a year. 

We made our reservations and we told to use the rotunda entrance in the rear which I would describe as the asshole of the castle.  We walked up to the desk, gave our information and the woman gave her spiel mentioning, ""The tour,"" twice.  We both did a double take and asked our new desk friend to clarify.  Apparently we had singed up for a 2-3 hour tour of The Excalibur's timeshare (which we heard from a few sources throughout the weekend that it was more like 5 hours).

We backpedaled and told her nicely that we did not sign up for a timeshare presentation.  She had claimed that when we originally singed up we initialed next to the tour agreement.  First off, I read everything I sign, and second, I would never sign up for a timeshare presentation.  I've made that mistake once and I will never do it again.  When I asked them to produce the document they couldn't and gave some bullshit reason regarding accounting.

We decided to skip the tour and eat the $99 deposit, which they said would be our penalty.  We found a cheap deal through expedia, and decided to give the Knight Themed room a try.

Our Second Mistake

Once we got to the front desk to claim our room we saw that there was an upgrade for $50 a night for a hot tub in the room.  I rarely turn down a hot tub and we were looking for a relaxing vacation, so we splurged.

The room was dull and the only knight themed decor were the plastic sconces on the wall and the shield crest on the headboard...oh and the pictures of crowns in the bathroom, which  will now refer to as the ice skating rink.  The walls were bland and the tub sat in the round tower you see on the corners of the exterior.

We ALWAYS pull the dry clean only comforter off the bed first thing.  Anyone who thinks they clean those is just fooling themselves.  We then noticed the holes in the bed sheets and it then sank in that we had made a mistake.

Don't expect anything from a room upgrade in the ice skating rink.  The shower reminded me of my Grandma's when I was a kid, before they remodeled.  If you get any water on the floor, and you will because the non tub showers leak, you WILL be in for slip or two, and if you take anything from this review, just be careful after you shower.  Oh, and ALL towels smelled of mildew.  It was disgusting and unacceptable.

The internet in the room consisted of an ethernet cable that barely reached the bed.  It had a broken prong and had to be held at an angle to keep the connection, which made it difficult to order theater tickets because it took three or four tries to progress to the next page.

When I called the spa\/pool desk to ask if they had wifi by the pool, the lady just laughed at me.  Even their employees think this place is a joke, and that says a lot.  They ended up charging us for the two rooms we didn't get with the timeshare scheme and $147 for the ""$100"" upgrade.  In total $550 was spent for two nights there.  We would have happily spent that at a nicer hotel and been perfectly content, and we suggest you do as well.

This review will not be comparing this resort to the other luxurious high-end resorts (Palazzo, Cosmo, Wynn, etc.) but will be merely describing our stay.  
Hotel\/Checkin:  Iconic castle hotel really got our kids attention.  Great location next to MGM, NYNY, and Luxor.  Unfortunately, only one of the trams was working.  Valet wasn't the greatest.  They only had a few guys working so it took some time.  The first thing I noticed about the hotel was that there were tons of people pushing show tickets.  I never stopped to find out what the catch was...but there had to be one.  The line for check in was pretty long (at 3pm) so I decided to try the VIP checkin.  I was a M life member but with no status...however, the guy checked me in right away.  The hotel inside looks tattered and out dated.  The smell of smoke was everywhere.  The bellman took quite a while to bring up our bags.
Room:  One big plus was that they offered connecting rooms each with 2 beds.  YOu don't see that very often.  The rooms were in the old tower (I) but was located on the 3rd floor (very short ride to lobby).  There was no central AC.  No bath tub just shower.  Beds were decent.  But like the previous posts mentioned, felt like a motel 6 set up. No wifi in the room.  
Service:  Was decent.  I called to request the connecting rooms and they were confirmed without a problem.  Checkin at VIP area was nice.  Some negatives...You can call ahead to request your car from valet.  Fee for crib and rollaway.  
Amenities:  Nice arcade and game area for the kids.  Prices were fair (most games $0.50).  Buffet was pretty bad...see my review for it.  Did not utilize fitness or spa.
Value:  You definitely get what you pay for.  Pluses...cheap prices on rooms.  They have a big coupon book they give you on checkin.  Big thing was $20 credit for food\/drinks at the lobby bar (they give you 2 drinks of your choice).  Resort fee is ridiculous ($18), you get nothing for it.  NO wifi.  Just wired internet.

The prices have brought me back time after time, as well as the location.

Prices:
- I have the philosophy that a hotel room in Vegas is just for parking your luggage, and somewhere to sleep for just a few hours, so I don't see the point in spending a crazy amount on it. I mean, who really spends enough time in a hotel room to justify the high costs? Not me. Compared to other casinos on the Strip, it's cheap, except for Mandalay Bay and Luxor, both of which are located further down the Strip.
- I do hate how the resort fees are never in the up-front costs you pay online, but then again all of the other casinos on the Strip do the same thing, so I have to hate the system more so than Excalibur alone.

Food:
- I've only eaten at the food court a handful of times, and that was only because I required something to go along with the copious amounts of alcohol I drank. 
- As far as restaurants, they don't look good at all, so I always make the trek to a nearby casino to eat good.

Location:
- Although it's not centrally located on the Strip, I would say that it's decent. I mean it's just a short skywalk over, and you're at New York New York, and are able to walk on the sidewalk.

Although the hotel and casino look really dated, as long as you don't plan on spending too much time within the confines of this place, I would recommend it as a place to park your luggage and yourself at the end of a long night, for just a few hours.",1,0,1

I would have gone somewhere (anywhere!) else the moment I walked in if she had let me leave her friends. Many of us wanted to leave but we had all prepaid - I think it would have been money well spent. This place is old, dirty and depressing. The smell is the first thing that hits you - cigarette smoke covered with bad air freshener mixed with something that I don't even want to try to identify. The casino is covered in dirty, smelly carpeting. We originally were in a room in the Resort Tower that was so tired and dark that I couldn't stand it. They were very nice about changing me to the Royal Tower which was marginally better. However, I had to stand in line for 45 minutes to change it because there was a line of about 50 people at registration with two people working. I never saw a time, day or night, when there wasn't a line. Please learn from us and go somewhere else. You'd be hard-pressed to fine a worse place on the strip.

Yes the outside is pretty cheesy looking but the rooms are pretty nice! They are clean too which is very important to me! My boyfriend and I weren't looking for anything fancy, just somewhere that had a good location on the strip. The Excalibur may not be the fanciest hotel but it is in a great location; it is directly across the street from the MGM Grand and right next door to the Luxor. It even has a little tram that takes you to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. 

I always say that there is no real point in getting a super nice room that outrageously expensive in Vegas, unless you're super rich and need a super nice room. I just need a place to sleep and get ready. Excalibur met all my needs and the beds were super comfy!!! 

Plus everything is all medieval themed, which is awesome! 

I would definitely stay here again.",6,0,2

Call to request a new room. They say ""we will have someone come check the toilet"". Okay. I want a new room. If it's clogged now, it might be a pain this weekend. Took them about 10 minutes to decide to see if there was an available room. 

Got the new room. No poop smell, and checked the toilet right away. All good! The view was nice. We were able to see the pool. 

Everything is pretty outdated though. The TV nice size, but horrible picture and sound quality. Wifi in our room sucked. Better off not attempting to use it.

VALET: For one thing, there was only one valet working and the sign said the valet parking was full. I was worried that my Mercedes would get broken into so something overnight, so I waited 20 minutes to check it in. I have no idea how long it took for it to get parked.

**UPDATE: I needed something out of my car after I checked it with the valets but before they parked it. They guy came up to me and asked why I needed the key. TO MY OWN CAR. Then I asked him kindly to cover the front seats with towels (on the console) after he parked, and he said that he knows how to do his job and I should just let him do it. I didn't ask him to go out of his way, or for anything unreasonable. Then he stormed off in a huff. I couldn't believe it.  My exact response was, ""what the hell--did that just happen?"" My friend and I tried to complain but the only response we got was, ""he has a dry sense of humor,"" and, ""that's just him."" Seriously? It's MY car. I'm entitled to my key whenever I want it. And the car was still sitting at the check-in area. Also, my interior is leather and cherry wood (and valet parking is not covered), so it isn't like I'm over protective of my vehicle.  Customer service is not a priority of this hotel. PS it was a tall Romanian guy who had a whitewashed Jersey douche-like accent.**

We went to our friend's place in the morning. It took half an hour to find a valet to get my car. And returning was a clusterfuck. Again there was no room in valet parking and the drive ins were both blocked. But we already checked into the hotel. So they had us go around to the employee side and leave it by the door. I didn't tip them at any point.

STAFF: At 1am it was slow. It took 5 minutes to check in. Our porter was nice. He helped us unload our car and brought our bags into our room. He didn't try to sell us anything, which was a plus. Throughout our trip were were constantly hounded by timeshare people. We also encountered some less-than friendly gambling employees. I had my friend take a picture of my first casino bet ever and they yelled at me and told me to put my camera away. I can take all kinds of pictures of the place but not of myself gambling. I don't get it.

ROOM: we were on the 27th floor in Tower 1. My first thought was, in Marty McFly's voice, ""27th Floor?!"" I really hoped to have a view of the strip but not really. We saw the back of the castle thingy and a piece of New York New York. The window from the elevator faces Luxor.

Walking in it smelled musty but not offensive. It was like a simple outdated motel kinda scent. That said, this is Las Vegas. I expected it to look and feel cleaner than it did. The linens may not have been clean, as there was a sign in the bathroom saying they only change sheets on request. The beds, artwork, and curtains were old and didn't match the castle decor,  making me wonder if the casino floor had been reorganized at some point. There was also a message on the phone advertizing the spa ($100 Swedish massages). We passed.

When we booked through AAA, we were told there would be a mini fridge. There wasn't one. This was a problem as we brought all our food to save money. Believe me--we went through a lot of ice. Same for the wifi. At booking we were told it was free but our cell phones struggled to access google until we went across the Luxor for Bodies and Titanic.

The bathroom was...clean enough. I noticed a hole in the wall where the doorknob would hit. I guess they never had a bumper there. The shower doesn't have a place to put things inside other than a tiny ledge for soap. The ice bucket was sterile stainless steel but there was no coffee maker. Were also only given one shampoo, one conditioner, one liquid soap, and one bar soap. I thought it's standard for hotels to provide 2 of each. Also, there is a fan in the bathroom, but it is so inneffective will be hazy and the mirror will be fogged when you get out. I found this highly annoying, as my time was short and I didn't want to clean a huge mirror. The mirror itself had signs of water damage around the edges.

Lastly, I took the stairs once and I found a used condom in the stairwell. Viva Las Vegas? No. Not a good sign.

OVERALL: This place clearly hasn't aged well. The walls have dents. The floors need replacing. The amenities are overstated. The gambling mostly sucks as all the machines are standard. The gambling employees are a big negative. And parking and valets suck. I'd give this place negative stars if I could.

I have been to the Excalibur plenty of times for entertainment but never stayed there before. This time we thought we would give it shot. 

The room was good, casino just like any casino you would expect and a good location for the strip. The security on the other hand is absolutely a joke!!! On our second and last night there our room was robbed and they took everything! My purse, wallet, cell phone, 2 backpacks (we travel lightly) , clothes and even my makeup. After we discovered it all missing we called the front desk, they came to ask questions and go ""search"" the lobby and casino area with our descriptions (so they said). After a few minutes of anxiety and helplessness we realized we could track my phone with the find my iPhone app so we ran out of the room where all the security guards were just standing around. No one attempted to look at camera footage or even see the value of time because the suspect was clearly not going to hang around all night at the scene of the crime but they had no urgency to help at all.

Frustrated we went to the lobby guest computers to track my phone. When it was found in a general location we saw it was still in the casino not far from our room so we started looking ourselves since no one seemed to care but maybe one security guard on duty. Now I'm looking under slots and in the trash can thinking I could hopefully get at least some stuff back if it was dumped. On my fourth trash can I heard a commotion behind me, when I turned my husband had the man in a citizens arrest after he walked out of the bathroom with our backpacks filled with our valuable belongings. His girlfriend was clearly high as well as him and it's not their first rodeo apparently (past felony burglary charges). After the security finally got there we asked how can they just walk into our room without a key or kicking it down? Their response was that they had no idea because their hotel is secure (yea right!). 

Once everything calmed down we filed the police reports and got about a hour of sleep before having to get on a airplane to come home. As we were checking out I thought we deserved to be comped for our stay because of all the danger and stress the Excalibur put us through while we are SOLVING OUR OWN CRIME (plus it was 2 nights, not a week or anything long like that)! The manager at the front desk said she didn't have the power to comp anything but really expressed how happy she was we did a good deed!! I was shocked... Good deed?!? It's not like I stopped a robbery on the street, I was lucky to find a dumb thief that stole all my belongings because of THEIR unorganized and outdated, undertrained security staff and system. How is that a good deed when it's hurting me? Specially because for him to get charged I have to fly back to Vegas for court?!? So he can get away with it or I can spend money to go back for that when it's not in my budget or planned future.  I didn't choose to be in that situation, the lack of procedure did! 

The icing on the cake was when we were walking out and heard the security whisper amongst themselves that with the right push and pressure EVERY DOOR in the hotel can be opened easy with out a scratch. Don't let the high tech spiel they try to reassure you with get to you. It's all complete crap! I will never step foot there again. It's sad because we really enjoyed it until we saw the real side of the hotel. 

Oh and it was pulling teeth to get just one night comped, one!!!!??? I am such a easy going guest, travel a lot and trust me, never ever again!! I hope  to inform as many people of these events as possible. Stay there at your own risk!!!",0,0,0

So, a little weekend trip was in order with the hubby and two of my cousins and their husbands.  We were also there for the fight, but mostly to hang out.  

Hubby and I booked rooms in the first tower (they have two) and the room was so janky! (you know, disgusting, broke down, etc)  Our tv was sooo small, it reminded me of the tv I used to have in my bedroom at my parent's house, the bed was not that comfortable, the bathroom wallpaper was yellow-y, the fixtures were old, etc.  

The furniture in the room was just old and outdated as well.  

BUT....it did serve it's purpose of giving us a place to shower,  sleep, ETC,  and while in Vegas, that's pretty much all you need a room for right?  :)  

My cousins actually got to stay in one of the newly renovated rooms with the flat screen tv's and those rooms were really nice!  Newly updated carpets, nice decor with the chocolate brown and blue drapes and bedding. Huge flat screen mounted on the wall.  Marble bathroom counters, new furniture, etc.  We got to hang out in their room for a bit, and I wishing the whole time we were in one of those rooms, it was way nicer!  

We were also there for the De La Hoya vs Pacquiao fight and the hotel actually had a closed circuit viewing of the fight in the Thunder from Down Under Showroom (for those of you who may not know, it's the all male revue show!)  for $40.00 per person-definitely worth it to see that fight!

While I may not be in the room much to be able to look down the strip when I am especially when I go to bed and its all lit up is awesome.  The room was comfy, bed nice, really enjoyed it. 

Tower two is also good for getting right downstairs to the pool and spa.  Don't have to walk across the casino to get there as it is at the bottom of the elevators.  Speaking of never had to wait long for elevators.  Although pretty close by right when you get to the casino are the wonderful time share people.

Got twenty rides in right before lunch the first day.  Casino slots were actually friendly which is always shocking.

The bed and pillows made my neck hurt, the air made my nose bleed, and seeing parents bring their children during a school day made me weep for society. To be fair, the latter isn't Excalibur's fault. Just an observation.

Do yourself a favor and save up money to stay at New York New York if you're looking for an inexpensive hotel. But if you must stay at Excalibur I guess you can rationalize it by telling yourself at least it's not The Quad.",1,0,0

Check out was hours before our flight so we checked our bags at the bell desk and picked them up later.

A crowd was forming and they were just sauntering around lazily.  Waited for what felt like forever.  I was worried that we'd get to the airport late so when our bags came out, I made a mad dash for it and told my boyfriend ""hurry up, let's go!"" The guy that gave me my bag glared at me and retorted ""he needs to sign for it first!""  Anyway, the bell people were super rude.

1. The Hotel

When I booked the room, I reserved a non-smoking king bed standard room.... upon arrival, I was told they were ""sold out"" of king bed rooms. Only after my wife sarcastically stated something about a comp upgrade, and several moments hesitation and thought, did the front desk clerk ""upgrade"" us to a non-smoking double queen bed room with a view. As we made out way up to the room I was thinking, ""ok, we're staying in a castle themed hotel... I can only imagine what the rooms look like"" Boy was I wrong. The room as plain, nondescript, and boring. The only castle themed items in the room was a framed drawing of a shield hanging above the toilet. The beds were comfortable, but plain. The dresser and table had scratches, chips, and dings showing years of use. The only new...ish thing in the room was the TV, a wall-mounted flat panel 42"" TV. The view was good, but for me at least, it didn't make up for the other problems.

2. The Casino

No problems here. My wife and I love playing roulette and Excalibur had both live dealer roulette and something called Organic Roulette where a machine spun the ball and players have their own touch-screen display to place their chips. Both were fun, but I enjoy live dealer play more (especially if the dealer has personality). One thing will say positively of the casino floor was that they had multiple roulette tables open. Three $5 minimums and 1 $10 minimum tables which I appreciate because it can take a while for a seat to open up if there is only one table. The slots are the same as everywhere, so I can't bash Excalibur or praise them.

3. The Dining Experience:

Oh buddy.... where to begin. Let's see, momma always said start off with a compliment. There is really only one redeeming quality about Excalibur that would make me deliberately want to go back (only to eat, btw), Dick's Last Resort (reviewed on it's own Yelp page). The other dining experiences were disappointing to say the least. Excalibur has a little bit of everything: Dick's, a BBQ place, a food court, a steakhouse, a buffet, and room service dining. The problem... THEY ALL CLOSE! The room service is allow offered between the hours of 0600 and 1400 (6am and 2pm). The only... let me pause for dramatic effect... ONLY 24hr dining options are McDonald's, Starbucks, and Krispy Kreme. WTF?!?!?!?!?! We don't go on vacation and spend hundreds of dollars to eat the same shit I can get down the street of my house! Vegas casinos are 24hr operations... they purposefully build the place without windows and do not install clocks so that patrons will not know what time it is and keep gambling. That said, you would think that an operation the wants people gambling 24 hrs a day would want those same people fed and happy during that whole time, right? Wrong. I even called the front desk one night because I was hungry for real food and not a BigMac or a fucking doughnut. I spoke with Mary, the manager of guest services, and was told that because Excalibur caters to the family audience (people who bring their kids) they find that the majority of patrons are not active nor hungry during early morning hours. I was also told, more or less, that she didn't care about my concerns and that there was nothing they could do the make up for the problem.

***Please see my other reviews for reviews of the individual restaurants we ate at***

4. Overall Experience:

I've been to Vegas twice, once to New York New York and then this time to Excalibur... I must say that I was severely disappointed. Between the lack of late night\/early morning dining options, the lack of interior theme decorations (it really looked and felt like they blew all their money decorating the outside of the hotel and the entry way to look like a castle, but just went with a Best Western approach for the rooms), and the shocking number of strollers, infants, toddlers, and other variously aged children running around, I would not stay here again. I will, more than likely, return to Dick's Last Resort for a meal or two during my next visit, but I will sleep and gamble at another resort.... one that takes my patronage seriously and treats me like I am the target demographic (21+).

Oh... one more thing. There is a small army of hotel minions that will seek out, stalk, and harass ANYONE that walks near them trying to pitch them a deal. They start out with an innocent enough ""bait"" question to strike up a conversation and it doesn't fucking matter what you say to them (yes or no) they will try to rope you in to signing up for a bogus deal. The deal is you leave a $99 deposit, if you book within 1 year",0,0,0

First off, the only reason I have it two stars rather than one was because it was at least clean. 

Now, the truth behind Excalibur... The rooms are no different than the Motel 6 that's 0.5 miles away and a quarter of the price. Actually, the room amenities may be nicer since the Excalibur rooms don't have much to begin with.

It is not a fancy hotel  by any means, but it is nice and ha a great casino. The rooms are the most reasonable priced on the strip, as far as I can tell. We used to stay at the Riviera (go Rivi!!) until they closed it down years back. This is now our go to hotel when staying in Vegas.

The rooms are pretty nice. The ones I've stayed in have been clean and comfortable. I love that this hotel is connected to other nearby hotels which makes it easy to get around. There is also a free tram that takes you around the area. 

I love Dick's Last Resort, great place to go and have a good time. Love the actual casino, tons of games and I have had very good luck there.

Their food court is amazing because they have a Popeye's in there, which is a godsend when you're drunk and are looking for some cheap yet good food to soak up the alcohol.

The staff is friendly and accommodating. It's easy to get an even better room rate here if you play MyVegas. You can use your coins for free or discounted room rates.

We got valet because there was no way we were parking and unloading with 2 toddlers and an infant  valet was awesome. We tipped them really good our first day and they took care of us the entire time.

The rooms are nice and clean especially for what we paid for. We also stayed in the newer remodeled side so I'm not sure how the other side was as far as updated rooms but we liked ours. 

The only thing I wish I would've changed was not being on such a high floor. Scene was okay but having 3 kids under the age of 4 I feel it would've been more convenient to be on a lower floor.

I will start with the room quality, it was fine. Despite an odd hair here and there as well as a few handprints, the room was clean enough. Decorations were nice.
Now onto everything else. Boiled down, the whole experience lacked customer service. We had the feeling of being cattle to be herded around. Drop off is confusing, we had no idea where we were meant to go with our car and luggage (unless we wanted valet.) Parking costs money even if you are staying there (in fact, all MGM properties are charging for parking now.) When I went to check in while my boyfriend circled for instructions, I noticed two line. One of the line was impossibly long and one area had something called mobile check in, which seemed quicker. I booked with hotels.com and so needed help from the one attendant in that area, he tried his best but was all alone while people kept barging in and taking over. He then sent me to another line and said (before being abducted by another guest) that I would get an email, but to go ahead to get in line. I quickly got through the
 line without receiving the email and asked the lady if it was important, she said yes and I can't check in until I get it....even though check in is it 3 and it was about 3:15pm. I asked how long it should be before I get the email and got a shrug of the shoulders and a half hearted ""I dunno."" I explained that my boyfriend was waiting for me to tell him what to do, they said we could park. Their whole interaction with me was lethargic and could care less. So they sent me away to wait on the email. I waited 45 minutes. Now, I worried that I put in email wrong and wasn't sure how long I should wait before asking for help. I went back to the mobile check in kiosk, where a new lady took over for the young man. After I explained my worry, how I had no time estimate, and how I have been waiting 45 minutes for an email (an hour after check in time.) She explained that it should only take 20 minutes and that the emails are processed by people. She felt bad and gave me a paper with my info that she found on her tablet and sent me back in line where I got the same person as before and the same cold reception. At least I finally was processed.
To get our luggage my boyfriend, again, got the car and was going to meet me in the back  while I look for a luggage cart. None were to be found and there was no one to help, I did eventually find a small, dirty phone for the bell desk where I was told  it was a 15-20 minute wait before they could send someone, but I cancelled it because I was hoping to be in our room by then (my own impatience won out.) So we juggled our luggage up to the 10 floor. Our door lock and key was ridiculously outdated and unresponsive. Then we realized we had the wrong room, we had requested a king (my boyfriend is 6'7"" and neither of us are small.)  Our room had two queens, I called down to the desk and they explained that we had 'run of the house' (I had no idea what that meant.) Although I booked a king, they are allowed to give me whatever, I asked to be moved and they told me they had no kings to give. So me and my boyfriend slept our one night in Las Vegas separately.

Check in was pretty smooth but the receptionist forgot to tell us about any amenities that are offered at the hotel. We stayed on the 24th floor with strip view but the noise was minimal. Before leaving to Vegas I read that the the rooms in the Royal Tower were recently remolded and we were not disappointed. The room was clean and so was the bathroom. The room's A\/C was working perfectly and it had a safe that can take a MacPro computer. The rooms have no refrigerator or  coffee machines ( 95% of hotels in Vegas don't, they want you to purchase everything). The bed was extremely comfortable as well as the sheets. We heard noise one morning around 11am because they were fixing a room upstairs but that only lasted a few hours and it was only one day. 

There is a food court on the 2nd floor. It has Popeye's, Hot dog on a stick, Smoothie bar, Pretzels, Asian cuisine, etc. There are also a couple of restaurants including Buca di Beppo (the lunch menu is very affordable and delicious). Most of the restaurants at the food court close by 1am. There are also great selections around the strip such as Tacos el Gordo (Authentic Mexican) close to Circus Circus. We ate at least one meal at Denny's (by MGM) on a daily basis.The drink prices are somewhat reasonable but do your research on cheap locations on the strip in which you can buy cheaper drinks. There are many shops along the strip that have $1 16oz beer which is great! On the strip there are plenty of tours you can pay to do. We did the Grand Canyon and Hollywood tours. The Grand Canyon was amazing and so was the Hollywood tour. Shop around for the tour prices before you decide which one you are going with since they all offer different prices. Also, shop around for souvenir prices, we found better prices at Freemont St (downtown). 

The casino at the hotel does need to have a better ventilation system for the smoke. If you didn't know, all casinos in Las Vegas allow their guests to smoke in the casino areas. We went to various hotels in which you could barely smell cigarettes, but at the Excalibur it can get a bit overwhelming sometimes. Also, DO NOT take a metered cab from the airport to the hotel! We made that mistake, Instead use the Uber of Lyft service, it is so much cheaper. We paid almost $30 from airport to Excalibur hotel in a metered cab the night we arrived. Then we inquired about Uber and Lyft and it would have been less than $18. Use Uber of Lyft services as well if you need to get around the strip. During the day, there are club promoters on the strip handing out their cards for the club that is having an event that night. If you want to go to the clubs make sure they get you on the guest list. We went to 3 clubs while we were there and got in for free to each one (entrance is usually $20-$30) because we got on the guest list. One night we only had to wait in line for a couple of minutes because the promoter had us on the list, it also included 2 free drinks for the women. FYI: If you go to a club make sure you go early (around 10pm-10:30pm) because the lines get crazy! One night we had to wait more than 45min just to get in. I highly recommend you go to at least 1 nightclub!!

Overall our stay was very pleasant and would recommend this hotel to friends and family (especially because it's affordable and clean). We checked out using the computer system in the lobby, it was quick and easy. The location of the hotel is great. My only complaint is the ventilation system which they need to improve.",0,0,1

Rooms were below average rooms for Vegas. Always seemed cheap feeling here. I was not a fan of the dingy vibe just walking in here. I don't gamble so I can't speak for the casino. The best part of this place is the area between here & Luxor, there are shops & quick bites to eat in the middle of the night.

I'm not sure what MGM is doing here, but they took my positive experience at my first stay and each time whittle it down a little more.

They screwed up my reservation upon arriving, telling me I was in room 10144 when I was actually in 10114. Didn't find that out until I spent 5 minutes trying my key in the lock, finding out someone else was in that room, and having to return to the desk to get a manager to fix it. He asked if there was ""anything he could do"" to make up for it. I asked for a free night and he laughed as if I was joking and said to call him if there was anything he could actually do. Okay.

Our room smelled faintly of sewage and was very dingy, but we weren't in it much, so I just dealt with it. I didn't feel like calling down to get a room change only to be given the wrong key again.

The line at check-in did move quickly this time and the moving walkway is repaired, which is a positive from my last review.

The casino has gone almost entirely to continuous shuffle machines for blackjack which I have absolutely zero respect for. I realize the casino is in it to make money, but they keep gutting things from the experience to tilt the odds heavily in their favor to a level that just makes it not fun to gamble there anymore.

I still try to stay & play at MGM properties because I'm an mlife member and I want to rack up enough points to finally stay in this goddamn city for free, but it's slowly getting to the point of being unenjoyable on all counts that I need to switch over to Total Rewards (Caesars) properties.",7,2,1

No. Our room hadn't been touched.

The accommodations were nice enough-- clean towels replaced daily, an average hotel-comfortable bed, nice view of the parking lot, a room near the elevator, and reasonably quick check-in and check-out. 

The fitness center was one of my main highlights-- open from 6am until 8pm daily, it features a small collection of cardio equipment (8 treadmills, 2-3 stairmasters, 2 reclined bikes, 2 upright bikes, 2 ellipticals) and a few small rows of machines, free weights, and very small stretching area. It was clean, with complimentary towels and 3 flat screen televisions to keep you moderately entertained.

Internet is ""free"" in each room (included in the $9.95 MANDATORY hotel fee with the fitness center\/ pool access) but it's via cable, so only 1 computer can plug in at a time. It was fast, but lugging around that cable means you can only conveniently use the internet in one location.

I could have done without the endless soliciting for ""free"" shows, and we definitely didn't eat here as none of the food looked appetizing (even when I was starving) or affordable.

What's WRONG with all you one-star haterz and malcontents? I know what's wrong with about 75% of you--your reviews are FAKE, you have no yelp friends and hardly any other reviews posted.

(I couldn't give a rat's behind about posers in rented Lamborghini's, imprisoned albino tigers or girls who are essentially hookers who think they are the most amazing things to ever walk the earth even though they've never read a book.)

In the 2 times I've stayed here, they moved enormous lines through in a few short minutes that would have taken the worthless lumps of meat at the Riviera front desk, several ice ages to deal with.

The better rooms are clean and really nice, but some of the appointments are old-school. The 2 that I've stayed in have been quiet and relaxing. There are lots of kids around, but for some reason they don't bother me here. It's full of tourists which makes the people watching and the poker room lots of fun. There is nothing over the top here, but there are all kinds of fun and cool things around, like a Baja Fresh(!), a steak house where vegans like me can order a fantastic baked potato and steamed spinach AND use an incredible $20 coupon they give you at check-in! If you crave the snazzier Strip experience just transport yourself up the street and have at it to your heart's content.

 I did find myself concerned for the horses 'on staff', as there is a sizable corral in the back but no shade and it was about 104 when I was in town. I know horses are resilient and all, but seriously, not one palm tree?

I wasn't expecting much but was glad to find a place on the strip that wasn't $400 a night. I think this hotel is geared more for families with the fun dungeon and tournament of kings, not to mention the exterior being a castle. The interior is very dated with old carpet and a lingering smell of cigarettes. The parking is pretty limited and the garage is kind of far from the actual hotel rooms. We got a room in Tower 2, facing the Luxor. Due to the Las Vegas heat and the direction of our window, our room feel like an oven but the air conditioning helped (although it was quite loud). The room was pretty dusty and the bathroom average, but the linens were clean and the TV had more channels than when I stayed at the Planet Hollywood. Excalibur charges a resort fee per day that includes wired internet and local\/domestic calls. I don't think that I would personally stay here again, but it's a cheap hotel and you really get what you pay for.",2,0,2

Excalibur is not MGM but when you are looking for somewhere clean and dead smack in the middle of everything, this the place to go.

I've stayed at Excalibur (Luxor is also an option) many times.

I mean, really no con.... Cleanliness is very important to me and I've never had issues with it being anything less than my standards.

The check-in\/staff: pleasant. I always arrive before check in time and I ALWAYS get my room around 10 am or 11 am. No problem. 

At the end of the day, it depends on what you want from a hotel. As long as it's clean,  don't need all the bells and whistles.

The room service ain't great either as it took them forever to get it to us. 

The Buffet used to be great and now it's merely good and probably a little over-priced. They've got a Cinnabon, which is awesome as when I'm taking a Casino for a bunch I enjoy celebrating with a tasty cinnamon bun. It was a tasty way to end my night. 

The Casino is old and full of family gambling types and other Casino employees. It's actually a pretty good crowd to play with. The Texas Hold-'Em table game is the best one on the Strip without question. Their Blackjack has the surliest dealers I've seen in ages and that's a good thing if you're just there to play hand after hand without too much chatter. I love those types of dealers once in a while.

Had a ""view"" room in Tower II on the 22nd floor with an outstanding view of NYNY and the Strip. The room was immaculate, very clean and spacious, especially the bathroom. The casino did not have a heavy odor of smoke which others have reported. We spent a good deal of time at the pool area. It was very crowded as the temp was 100+. The drinks were outstanding. We attended the Tournament of Kings show, which was packed. It was very entertaining, and worth the money. The dinner was pretty good. We ate twice at the Buffet. To our surprise it was not crowded at all. We walked in both times without waiting. I remember that when we stayed at the Excalibur some 25 years ago that there was long line that snaked outside to get into the Buffet, and that the place was packed. Not so today. It appears that the many places to eat on the second floor have taken much of the business away from the Buffet, and of course they are far cheaper. We spent a considerable amount of time in the Fun Dungeon. It was a blast. The one thing that was a negative was the aggravation from the many ""Free Voucher"" hustlers that pounce on you as soon as you walk into the hotel, and are at every entrance. This is a scam. No only do they grab you as soon as you arrive at the hotel, they bug you every time you walk into the casino, or go upstairs to the food area.

Sit down, little boys and girls and let me tell you a story.  

Friday:  My friends and I got a suite here for a 30th b-day celebration. Friday evening, as we are coming back from our night out, we notice on the floor in the hallway near our room: a few used q-tips, and a few feet down... several french fries.  

Now, on my list of top 10 grossest things to see in a hotel hallway, used q-tips would not be at the top, but they do make the list. Ewwww

Saturday Afternoon: After sleeping way in, and telling the cleaning people to leave us alone, we walk out to get lunch. Guess what...the q-tips and french fries are still there. 

THE CLEANING PEOPLE HAD COME BY!!! Did they walk by the q-tips and french fries? Did they just say, oh we're cleaning the rooms now, not the hallway, so we will leave them? Did they not notice them? How do you not notice them?

Sunday Morning: We leave to get breakfast.  The q-tips and french fries are still there!  

Sunday Afternoon: We return to find our room clean. Again the cleaning people have been here.  But the q-tips and french fries are STILL IN THE HALLWAY!  

Cleaning people walked by them at least twice...and left them in the hallway!!!

I have no idea WHO leaves used q-tips in the hallway...how do they get out of the room? Who takes q-tips out of the room? But I was so grossed out by the fact that 2 full days past and cleaning people left them there... I will never stay here again!!

We booked the room through a 3rd party site. It's expected to be expensive during EDC weekend, about $200 per night, and we only wanted to stay for 2 nights total. 

We arrived here late Friday evening, around 6:15pm. Parking is no longer free anywhere in Vegas, the rates are Vegas pricing. Free the first hour, $5 for every extra hour, and $10 for 24 hours and additional will be added for additional hours. I definitely recommend saving your parking ticket and paying it inside, you could save a bit if you're going to have to drive in and out of the parking lot often. The parking lot wasn't too packed, we were lucky to park by the escalator. You'd still have to take a walkway outdoors into the hotel, it isn't directly connected to the hotel. 

The check-in process took some time, they charged us an extra $68 on top of our total for resort fees. According to the front desk, if you book through a 3rd party site, you will most likely be charged extra resort fees. However, it might be dropped depending on which site we bought it from. I understood resort fees are usually added onto the total, but $68 is pretty pricey for a hotel that's extremely outdated. 

Our room was located on the 6th floor facing the pool. We were placed on the very end of the hallway, where the emergency exit is. It's really far from the elevators, but I guess it's quiet. We had also requested for a king sized bed but walk in to find two queen sized beds. We called the front desk and told them, they said they ran out of rooms with king sized beds so assigned us queen beds instead. I felt it was extremely unprofessional for doing that without letting us know! The room itself is very old, the wallpaper was kind of falling off from the walls. I wasn't happy with the bathroom either, they did not have a bathtub, but a shower instead. The shower head was the worst, you can't adjust the pressure of the water, so it was just piercing my skin during my shower. Then to top it off, on the second night of my stay, there was a loud buzzing noise that went on for hours, it made it a little difficult for me to sleep initially.

My overall experience was honestly not the best. I felt that they were very unprofessional in regards to our room assignment without notifying us. Everything is very outdated, I'm not sure how cheap it is on a regular weekend, but I definitely don't feel it's worth the money. I think the only thing redeeming about my room was probably the beds itself because it was pretty comfortable despite my unpleasant experience here.",5,3,5

So here's my take of this place ...check-in time was bad ... I got dropped off at the back entrance by the airport shuttle and had to lug my suitcases, 2 year old son, and other crap across the casino.
When I got to the other side we had to stand in a long line. It took about 45 minutes of our time. & it sucked.
Woman was letting me have it before we even checked in about picking this place to stay...
However, the room was clean... And the view from our room of the Luxor was awesome.
We found the food court to be useful, cheaper then the buffets, and convenient. Lots of options too.
The Tournament of Kings show was awesome, and the Free monorail that rolled us over to the Shark Reef at the Mandalay Bay was also very convenient.

1) The casino smelled akin to a hot-boxed half century old water logged chevy with a burning tire in the rear
2) Do they not clean their shot glasses? There was some sticky SOMETHING hanging on the inside of the glass touching my vodka and they refused to pour me a new shot!! That goose was expensive to waste...
3) NASTY pool. I mean....there was so much ""stuff"" in the water that you couldn't see your hands clearly at waist level.

The room wasn't horrible but you can tell it was a little worn down especially parts of the bathroom. The window was thin and allowed in a ton of noise from the street outside and early morning beeping from construction trucks. The lighting in the room is really dark even with 3 lights on, but the lighting and pull out makeup mirror in the bathroom was great for getting ready.

It's great that they have an entire floor with restaurant and shops. Makes getting a quick meal convenient. And even better that they have walking sidewalks indoors that take you to the casino floor of the Luxor! This made getting around easy and so does the tram that goes between the Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay. We didn't need to take a single cab or drive to get around which made traveling with kids easy. 

Being that we were with kids we spent a ton of time in the Fun Dungeon. Was nice to be able to bring drinks down there as we walked around and played with the kids. One gross part is the dungeon literally smells like one. It smelled musty and like sewage. 

A plus for me was the fact that every public restroom I used was clean and new!! Not what I expected so 5 stars for that!! 

A downside is every waitress or bartender on the casino floor was slow and rude. The walkways are also small and crowded with people standing around on them.

Trust me, if you stay here, you'll be able to tell it's been around for 20 years. You can tell that Tower 1 hasn't been upgraded in quite a long time (since it was built?) and that is where we got saddled for our $45 a night ($33 plus the $11 resort charge). 
   Our room had two queen beds which was great but the polyester bed spread had a mixed colour scheme that reminded me of those gag plastic vomits that you can get at Spencer's Gifts or the like. Except darker. And kind of scary. When we got in, our four year old dove into one of the beds where we discovered someone had put a used Q Tip under the bed spread. I removed it to find... that under the top sheet they had placed ANOTHER Q Tip. You can tell someone purposely did it. Whether it was someone testing housekeeping or the previous tenant to this room I will never know but it was severely gross enough to have us call housekeeping to ask them to remake the bed. 
   They came within 20 minutes and remade the bed. I had disposed of the Q Tips (and scalded my hands with hot water and soap) and we left to let them finish (I'm not comfortable playing lady of the manner while someone does a job I do all the time at home) so they seemed to have that look like 'right lady sure there was a Q Tip. Maybe they were tired. Maybe something else.
    It's kind of obvious that the turn and burn on these rooms is really limited. Corporate probably has told them to get in and get out with as minimal cleaning as possible. Our bathroom had some cleanliness issues but nothing that I couldn't take care of. The towels were a bit smallish and a bit scratchy that comes from being really inexpensive and washed to death. I suppose if you're offering a room for $30 a night, you're not going to be putting in the Frette linens for people.
   If you're not particular about where you are staying and are staying on the Strip, this is your place.
   On the positives: the pools are nice. Great for kids. Not so much for adults wanting to avoid kids. The Sherwood Forest Cafe serves good food (I liked the breakfast quesadilla and the salsa it came with) and is fairly relaxing. 
   The other negatives? Man I hate that you can't walk 10 yards without being accosted by a time share person. We got attacked as we walked in the door to check in and when we finally were able to draw a breath, we pissed off the kid trying to get us to sit through some 9am breakfast talk about how we want to invest non existent money into a Vegas time share. The pool is all the way on the other side of the hotel which means you're traipsing from Tower 1 to Tower 2 through the casino in your suit. Which isn't too bad until your dripping body is trying to get back to your room. Fun to do across the casino with all the people staring at you like an alien.

We didn't get room service because we'd wake up late and they will not stop by if you have the Do Not Disturb sign. It was a holiday weekend, so naturally it was pricier.

Another thing I didn't consider when choosing a room was that if you get placed on the side of the pool, you can't count on sleeping in too late with the DJ blasting hits as early as 10am. If you plan to be up all night and expect to sleep at least until noon, that's something you may want to keep in mind.

I LOVED that there is a pool on site. That was the most fun we had here, delicious in the 90-degree weather of this beautiful Sin City.

This was our second stay in the Excalibur, both stays due to the competitive price the Excalibur offered compared to its Strip counterparts. We kept trying to defend the place after a pleasant first stay, as people were quick to rag on the place. Now I understand why.
My list of why the Excalibur is a waste and disgrace:

1.) Just as King Arthur and his round table are a legend, so is the hotel's customer service. Here's our antidote: we were looking for the ever-so-extravagant wine bottle opener. Something that comes standard in most strip hotels. When we asked they front desk, they abruptly replied, ""I don't know. Go as the concierge."" When we trekked over to the concierge, they replied, ""Why should we have one?"" and proceeded to sell us tickets to a show (logical, of course. They managed to pull this one on every visit we made to their desk). Finally, I had to tip a bartender at the casino floor's bar to open the wine bottle for me. 
Another time I asked the front desk where I could print off my airline ticket. They told me that the concierge desk would gladly do it for me, though the concierge insisted that they are not allowed but that the computers next to them (how convenient!) could cater to my need. The cost? $1\/minute, with a $10 minimum. I'd rather sit at the end of the B section on my Southwest flight!

2.) The pool is for mass quantities, not mass quality. Everyday evening they have a ""pool party,"" which is nothing more than a cover band, drunks, and screaming kids. Quite the combination. No shaded areas, either. 

3.) The air conditioner in our room was LOUD and our bed uncomfortable, making for a restless night. The renovated rooms are ten times nicer than the rest of the hotel (scary to think what the rest of the rooms look like). The result? Stay in the room or run out of the hotel as fast as you can.

4.) The running out as fast as you can part is not always easy, since there are stinkin' Tahiti Village solicitors at every turn. The worst part is that they pose as hotel staff, approaching you while in the check-in line and asking you when you are checking out, etc, and then without your permission beginning to plan your stupid timeshare visit. Even when you tell them, ""No, thank you,"" they don't give up, leaving you to leave in haste angrily. 

5.) And speaking of rooms, don't expect normal hotel amenities, even in the upgraded rooms (a typical Vegas nickel-and-time tactic) - no microwave, refrigerator, even coffee maker. Why would you need your own coffee maker when there is a 24-7 Starbucks on the first floor where you can get a cup of coffee for $6?

6.) Since there are no such amenities, we tried to order some dinner via room service. We called the number three times - and with no success - called a 4th time and left the phone off the hook and on speaker for 45 minutes. ""Your call is important to us,"" the machine lady on the other line ensured us. We finally hung up and fruitlessly searched around the hotel...

7.) The restaurants at the Excalibur are easy to pass up. In fact, treat yourself to a nice dinner somewhere else. Though the $16.99 medieval dinner buffet may look appealing, it's greasy and cheap food isn't worthy for a king such as yourself. 

8.) Seeing all the kids run around Dick's Last Resort and poker table-top dancers (both located between the main entrance and guest elevators, thus inevitable) was like watching a 7-year old's Spring Break at Disneyland. This place knows it attracts families with children - as evident by its Sponge Bob show and afternoon puppet show - yet keeps the liquor, thongs, and dirty music flowing like Rapunzal's hair down her high tower. Or something strange like that. I don't know what is more distracting - watching a woman dance on the poker table next to your elevator, the owner of Dick's Last Resort flap around in a thong, or the look on all the 7-year-old's faces as their parents trek them around the casino floor. The wallpaper of advertisements for Thunder from Down Under are a classy touch, too. 

In short, even though the Excalibur prices are nicer than it's Strip counterparts, I would rather spend less time in Vegas and at another hotel, even off the strip, than a whole free stay in the Excalibur.",7,5,1

My sister and I stayed for four days and not once did our room get cleaned. My sister left a mark on the sheets to see if they would be switched the next day and sure enough they were never switched. On top of that the lights went out and they wanted to charge me $130 to extend my check out for 2 hours. The customer service is horrific, especially for a Vegas hotel.

I did show my I.D but my co-workers were never carded (assuming they thought I looked 20 or something, I'm freakin 30!!!!). That was already discrimination right there. 

To add on, we headed over to the Black Jack table, my co-workers sat down first and were never asked for an ID but the moment I sat down, the Asian dealer guy (probably Chinese) gave me the nastiest attitude and asked for my ID again and I was so pissed I said what's up with all the ID-ing on just MYSELF and not my co-workers and he told me that I cannot play. So I stayed behind the table to watch my co-workers play. I was asked that I cannot watch either. WTF, that was already fucking humilitating.

The only downside is that you do have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators and all those people who try to sell you show tickets. My advice, pretend not to speak English and keep walking past them. It worked for me. 

However the location wasn't bad, there was a tramway that took you to Luxor or Mandalay Bay for free, or you can take the many sky bridges to get around to other hotels. I'd stay here again if I were to return, honestly, most of the day\/night you spend outside anyway so I'm not sure why some people make such a big deal about little things.",0,0,0

Easy and fast check in process. We had a super friendly greeting from Patricia. She got us checked in no time. We stayed in tower 2, floor 18. 

The rooms was nice and clean. A bit out dated.  I checked the room for bugs and to made sure it was clean. Every day our beds were made and towels were restocked. All of our belongings were accounted for. The casino has free wifi.  

We spent two full days at the pool. The slide was a hit for the kids.  They loved it. We rented a cabana both days.  Cabanas come with a tv, shade, water, soda and chips. On Thursday, the pool was packed with families. On Friday,  the pool was packed with families again but towards the 5pm was full of drunk adults. They have 4 pools but only 3 were open and one is adult  only. The children remember the pool and their favorite activity. 

The arcade was fairly priced with many options on games. Kids loved it. Not bad at all. We also went to circus circus and would perfer excalibur's arcade. Its smaller but smells way better. 

The one and only thing I disliked was the time share people that kept trying to have us go to a presentation for free tickets. They would even ask my kids if they wanted to go to a Knight show. Getting the kids  interested in something I wasn't  planning to do. I felt like they were every where. 

Overall,  great vacation.  Great location and service. Prices are fair and great for a family on a budget.",2,0,1

My major complaint is that we booked a room for two nights and the second day our keys were canceled and room keys for our room was issued to other guests. OTHER GUESTS WENT IN OUR ROOM. We happened to see them in the hallway and they told us they were issued keys to our room but left when they saw it was occupied. Everything was downhill from here. 

After being locked out of our room, I went to the front guest to tell them none of our keys worked (we tried 3 keys), and her response was ""you probably went to the wrong room."" I spoke to a manager who was nice. When I told him that we ran into the guests who had access to our room, he told me that was weird because when these things happen they put them in a completely different area, not next door. WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN?! How is this something that is reoccurring? To compensate us they took off our resort fees while they investigated what happened. I got a call from the manager later and he offered us $100 for breakfast at the buffet. Upon arrival at the buffet, we were told we have no comp and to take it up at the front desk. We were having breakfast before we checked out, so we did not have time to argue with the front desk about breakfast. 

In addition to everything wrong with the room, we were YELLED at by a waitress. We ordered a bottle of champagne for my friends birthday, and went to sit at a blackjack table. When we sat down the pit boss explained that we cannot have open bottles, but we can drink the drinks we have and keep the bottle at our feet while we play. Since we could not refill using our bottle, my friend ordered a glass of champagne from a server. When the waitress brought the drink to her, she had an attitude and said that she was not supposed to serve her because she had a bottle (that were not allowed to use at this time). After she left our table, my friend said to me ""that's stupid"" about not being able to order a drink or drink the bottle we have. The waitress then turned from her other table and yelled at my friend. It was completely inappropriate and very rude. We spoke to the servers manager who really had nothing to say about the situation. 

Aside from the room fiasco and being yelled at by a waitress, the service was subpar. The waitresses rarely came by the tables and were not very polite when they did. One waitress ignored one of our orders, and then brought my husband the wrong drink. Overall a really disappointing stay. We will not be returning.",1,1,0

Let me start by saying that for the time period I was staying for work. Previous years for the same trip I had stayed at the Luxor (feel free to check out my review of that dump) but this year the Luxor was about $200 more than the Excalibur... so I had no choice. I have stayed at 5 various Vegas hotels and the clientele here is... interesting... dirty... smokey... not my type. Some great people watching for sure - but where in Vegas isn't!?

Of all the casinos I've stayed in, walked through, gambled at... this was the smokiest I'd ever encountered. Grossed me out. Thankfully I got a non smoking room and the rooms were QUIET! This was a welcome surprise considering the walls were so thin at the Luxor I could hear EVERYTHING going on in the neighbors place. I got stuck with a 2 queen room rather than a king, so that was also a bummer. Oh and the view...or lack of a view I guess. I was looking right out into the rooftop airconditioning units. there was an old beat up chair on the rooftop that moved every night. I started to wonder if they were filming the next installment of the Hangover there. 

Mostly everything in the hotel is outdated (rooms, games, carpet) and not anything that truly appealed to me restaurant wise. I did spend time at the pool which was fine. It was day 2 of pool season so might have been cold for some people but I was ready to feel some sun after a harsh midwest winter so I enjoyed a beer or 3 out there. 

Overall though, I mean, I got decent sleep, the hotel was easy to navigate, the staff was nice when I encountered them and I had no true problems, so I can't give less than 3 stars on this one.",5,2,2

I freaked out when I checked my bank account and saw an additional 94$$ charged to my account!

We ended up asking for our money back since the show we wanted wasn't even playing the night we requested.....we were initially told it was....super upsetting.

The cons:everything else.  I arrived last Sunday at around 5 or 6pm and the line was all the way back to the front door of the hotel.  I am not exaggerating.  I've never in my life seen a line that long to check into a hotel.  That's ridiculous and unacceptable.  And to make matters worse, they don't have any mobile check in or check in kiosk, like every other modern hotel on the strip.

So I ended up having to wait around until about 11pm before the line was short enough to wait in.  And because of this stupid paid parking thing at MGM hotels, I was basically held hostage there because I would have to pay twice if I wanted to move my car and come back later.  

By the time I got in line it was less than half as long as it was earlier and I still had to wait in line for 40ish minutes.  To make matters worse the lady at the front desk was rude and just rushed me in and out.  I also found out I had to come back and check in again the next day because I had multiple reservations.  When I told the lady at the front desk about the ridiculous lines her reply was only ""oh well I have to be here for 12 hours!""  which she repeated multiple times during our conversation.  Do I look like I care how long you have to be here? No.  That's your job, you're getting paid to do it; don't whine to customers about it.  

Aside from that, the internet didn't work well.  The room could've been cleaner.  The pillows couldve been changed.  And it would've been nice if the resort fees didn't cost more than the room itself.  Why the heck does this two-star hotel charge $30 a night in resort fees? It should be half that.  And then they rent out space in their casino\/lobby to time share people who harrass the guests.  That's just tacky.

First off, I went with a huge group of maybe 75-80 people, so the price of our room for 5 days was a great price. 
Secondly, I was getting married that weekend, so I was head over heels for everything and I might be slightly biased. 

Our room was amazing, we stayed in the updated tower which was the best decision I think we made. We also didn't spend to much time in the room other than getting ready to go out and before the wedding, but the size was accommodating for my bridal party, photographer, and stylist to work. The staff was also able to place my wedding party on the same floor about 2-3 rooms apart. 

I didn't get a chance to use the pool but from what I hear, it was nice.

The chapel and the staff at the chapel were phenomenal! I live out of state so planning a wedding over the phone was not what I imagined. They were very detail oriented and friendly. When we got there it was way more than I expected(definitely not a divey drive thru place\/typical vegas style wedding you imagine in movies). I felt like a million bucks walking down that aisle. The officiator was awesome too! I'm sorry to say that I don't remember his name, but he had all of us laughing and really enjoying our moment!

Bucca Di Bepos(which is right down from the Chapel) was awesome! This is where we had our reception dinner. The day before there was an issue with our wedding cake being destroyed in the humidity, so as a last minute decision we added desert to our meal plan. They had no problem throwing in two different desserts 12 hours before the reception for 80 people! 


The only con of course is that it is a very kid friendly place, and seeing how I don't have kids and we were with mostly an older crowd it did get a little hectic with kids running around.

Other than that I will definitely return here in the future!!",0,0,0

It's not fair to rate everything poorly when some services are good to excellent and others are not, please see each category listed below. 

Check in:                                           3 Stars, Average
There were about 23 people in line in front of me. It was a late Saturday afternoon. They managed to get me checked in within about 45-50 minutes. It appeared a few guests were asking a lot questions which took time away from checking the rest of us in.

Room:                                               1 Star, Old, dreary, Plumbing issues
I booked my room through AAA Auto Club of Southern California. We stayed on the first floor, Tower 1, Room was old, more like a Motel than a Hotel feel to it, in need or remodeling. Shower Stall did not drain properly. Bathroom smelled like sewage. Not sure what is going on there. Reported the issues, did not receive a notice of service performed, no improvements before our departure. 

Housekeeping:                                   2 Stars, just below average
I realize Housekeeping is an expense and the crew is probably required to get in and out to keep the rooms rented. They are probably timed and doing their best with the time they are given so I am allowing them a little slack. It is also important to mention since the room was so dreary and old looking, they can only do so much to make the room appear and smell clean. For the record, I am very critical of housekeeping, what bothers me, may not be an issue for others.

M-Life Service Desk:                         4 Stars, very helpful
We had a lot of purchases that can be applied to M-Life. We took our receipts to the M-Life Counter, they helped apply the purchases to gain points. 

Concierge:                                         5 Stars, Very helpful, specifically Michael 
We had some questions about local shows and services. We talked with Michael Greenblatt. He helped us. He was polite and personable.

Check Out Kiosk:                               4 Stars, Nice to have this option.
We checked out on a Monday morning. There were a few Kiosks to use. It took me about 3 minutes. I waited about a minute for one and it took about 2 minutes to use.It was my first time using their check out Kiosk. 

We did not dine or attend any shows at this venue.",0,0,0

They do have nice rooms, but you get what you pay for, newer renovated rooms are in Tower II, Tower I still has un renovated rooms but all units have updated flat screens.

This is a good location if you need to keep costs low, you can get rooms as low as $20-30 a night, plus the $20 resort fee.

The location is good, easy to find free parking and valet (don't forget to tip the valet) if you use a rental car, plus its connected to New York New York, MGM Grand, Luxor and Mandlelay Bay via the tram or a short walk. This can be also a negative as you have lots of foot traffic breezing through the casino.

If you are on a budget, there's an AM\/PM across the Tower I exit on Las Vegas Blvd where you can get a cheap cooler, and drinks for the room. Plus there is a large food court with all sorts of chains inside offering cheap eating options if that is a concern [and as a bit of trivia, the Excalibur has one of the two Mc Donalds locations in the world that serves pepsi products instead of Coca Cola].

In Vegas I did my usual clean sweep with my room, keeping my luggage sealed in the bathroom while I turned over furniture, pulled out cushions, pulled all the sheets off the beds, looked under and in between the mattress and piping\/stitching, etc. It's a 30 minute ritual, but I hate bed bugs, and while my room as dated, it was.. very clean, I slept well for a week there.

Bathroom was basic, no tubs, just a large walk in shower.

The internet sucks, wired only in tower I. Not sure about tower II, there is wifi on the casino floor in spots.

Pool is ok, 3 pools, a shallow pool, a large landscaped pool with a waterslide and an adults only [$10] pool area. Cabanas range from 150-300$ when I last checked, its worth it if you have a huge group that can split the bill and catch a big game and get a few free drinks and snacks, etc.

The spa and gym are nice... not huge but decent enough in size to get a workout done. I believe the gym is covered with the resort fee, however the spa does cost $10, which you get steam rooms, a sauna, hot tub with a relaxation room with free drinks and juice and toiletries so you can shave\/brush your teeth, etc.

Dicks was humorous.. the gimick of the bar is that the wait staff is susposed to be a bit rowdy and off color with their jokes and humor, don't go there with thin skin. I'd watch getting generic cocktails.. there is value to be had with some drinks but not others, one of my party got nailed $22 for 2 tiny rum and cokes in a little plastic cup. Food was decent.

You also have an italian restaurant there with large family style portions to share, a below average hotel buffet, an average steakhouse and a few bars and lounges.

Basically its... ""OK"".

As for the general feel... remember the end of the movie Casino? Everyone looks like they are at disneyland. Fun to people watch if you get a good spot.",10,2,2

There's the usual array of slot machines, table games, and drink options. The presentation of everything everywhere, however, has the consistency of flat soda. Excalibur IS a hotel, is a casino, has an alright pool area, has some restaurants, but everything feels old, tired. Cheap.

The theme itself never makes sense. Paris has croissants and coffee. The Venetian has exceptional Italian dining, gelato, street mimes, and a gondola! So come on Excalibur, where are the giant roast turkey legs? Where are the fair maidens in bustiers? How about some ponies, or court jesters?  Excalibur has none of that, though it should. There's no wifi in the hotel rooms, which is about as authentic to the period theme as things get here.

Still, 3-stars it deserves. Staff were very good to me at check-in, helping me situate my room and the rest of our party in relative proximity to one another. The gym is clean and overlooks the pool, so you can ogle while being ogled. The casino stays pretty active up until around 3am'ish even on weeknights. 

This place is probably fine for families on a budget with low expectations. You will not be wow'ed here, though.",3,3,2

It's on the south end of the strip and is almost the last stop. You're not going to get the all the action of say Caesar's in the middle of the strip, or all the bells and whistles of a newer casino.

That said, you're not going to pay for all of that either. I paid $44 a night and had one of the best experiences you could hope for at that price. The room was clean and had perhaps one of the most comfortable beds I've ever had. The check in was smooth and quick. The staff was friendly. I even got a couple of coupons for free drinks and games.

Loud, not well insulated: awakened multiple times by yelling people in the hallway and traffic outside. No coffee maker.  No bath tub. Cheap toiletries. No decent restaurants. The wifi hookup is behind the TV rather than near a table or desk: not at all convenient when trying to work on a laptop.

I say this as someone who is normally a fan of laid back places where anything goes, smoky bars with wandering souls, and trashy themes. While the Excaliber manages to be smokey (seriously, this place reeks like you're at a landfill that's on fire) and has a nice tacky set up as fits its name, it's not actually any fun. The dealers are rude, the drinks slow to come, the carpet smelly and ugly. Everyone walking around looks like they are on an errand as opposed to vacation. People sitting at tables have that vacant 1000 yard stare of an addict for whom the joy part of the substance\/activity has long worn off. 

All of this would be forgiven if it was the cheapest joint on the strip - I'm a fan of you get what you pay for. But it's not. While the room was relatively cheap, it is awfully sparse compared to spending a few bucks more at another hotel. And after that, the price difference disappears. The drinks are expensive and subject to changes in price - at the bar, I was charged three different amounts for the same beer, with one bartender trying to sell me a bud light for $7. So much for that food and beverage credit. Room service is as ridiculously expensive as it would be anywhere else ($13 for a pot of coffee), the table minimums start at $10 even during offpeak times, the Excaliber show is similarly priced to other Vegas extravaganzas far more worth your time (if you're an adult, see Zoomanity), and of course there is the ever present resort fee for WIRED internet which was no use to me or my girlfriend as all we had were our cell phones. The buffet was somewhat reasonable in cost but the food quality was pretty bad; it didn't make me sick exactly, but left me feeling queasy the rest of the day. 

I really could go on and on. I haven't even mentioned the employee who pulled us aside and started shouting in our faces about some deal or another. Being, you know, normal people on vacation we assumed that when a hotel employee stops you it's to share some sort of helpful information. The Excaliber prefers the shout in your face until you literally have to walk away. 

After the lady and I figured out how bad it was, we kept the room but gambled and hung out at the Tropicana and New York New York. We wound up having a great time in spite of our stay at the Excaliber, certainly not because of it. If you want to be on the strip, do yourself a favor and spend a few bucks on a more recently remodeled place. 

TLDR: cruddy yet still expensive. Pick somewhere else. 

PS: Despite the notation on Yelp that this place is good for children, it's really not. It might make for a good field trip into why you shouldn't smoke, gambling addiction and what it means to have a life full of failure, but you can just visit for that.",2,1,0

I suppose most Vegas hotels are the same in that you must walk through a very smoky casino every time you go to your your - it seems like miles - but, hey, it's Vegas.

My one big issue is not with the Excalibur itself, but the Avis car rental in the hotel.  DO NOT RENT a car here.

I was scared because of all the reviews I read that said that people can easily get into the room. Nothing like that happened. The door had instructions on how to properly close the door.

The hotel is dark (but so are most hotel\/ casinos). The outside hasn't been changed since they opened so not as appealing as say the Aria Hotel. Parking is free and nice to have a garage. But the garage is not very big and the majority of their parking here is open (which is not fun when climb into the car in 110 degree weather).

INSIDE- Check was a pain in the ass to find. But once we found it check in was fast and easy. BUT no thanks to the extra resort fee of 15 dollars! Which is to paid seperate from when you book your room. Inside of the casino was dark defiantly castle like but if you like that, cool. 

ROOM- To my surprise the room was nice. The rooms have been updated and renovated so the decor is modern and clean. We did not like our room because we were placed on the 3rd floor and a beautiful view of a stupid wall. When you check in I recommend requesting a room on a higher floor. The beds were not super fluffy but was not terrible. Bathroom is big and had nice counter space. The shower was alright, the shower head in our bathroom was old so water pressure was uneven. We had a joint room which could connect to another if your staying with others but I didn't need our neighbors constantly trying to open the door. That door also doesn't not keep sound out... Could hear our neighbors talking very clearly.

POOL- nice big pools. Four pools. One BIG main pool which is nice because it isn't as populated as the others. There is an Adult pool with a bar connected. Another pool which contained the waterslide and ALL the children (avoided that). And then a smaller pool. The pools were bot bad for an older hotel.

Horrible experience at Excalibur Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas ! It's cheap here cause the rooms are dated to the 1980s and the managemnet doesn't care about their guests! My wife and I chose to stay here being a MGM resort chain and thought it would be a great experience. BIG MISTAKE! To start off we checked in at the front desk and the gal at the desk told us they overbooked and gave our room to someone else. They were forced to upgrade us to a suite since they already charged our credit card! Hotel policy to charge you for 1 day if you don't cancel within a few days before check in. Reservations were made online a few months earlier. We said wow ok thanks. The next day when we came back to our room around 7:00 pm the room keys didn't work and we paid to go to a show which started in an hour! So we had to go back to the front desk and wait in line for them the reprogram our room keys. The front desk apologized and told us they have rooms now and we must move to another room. We told them we paid for a show that started in an hour and we still needed to get ready. This took 30 minutes at the front desk which left us scrambling to make the show on-time. When we came back from the show our keys didn't work again! So at 12 midnight we had to go back down to the front desk and ask them to reprogram our keys. They proceeded to make keys to our new room and also tell us security would have to meet us at the suite to let us in! Really, all our personal belongings are in the room and now we have to meet security up there to get into the room we paid for?! I felt I did something wrong or a criminal at that point. The room they moved us to was at the end of the hall furthest from the elevators in a different tower and we didn't even have a view. To make matters worse, the maids quarters were located across of our new room and everytime the maids doors slammed, our room door would rattle at all hours of the night. This happened anytime from 10 pm till the morning. I will not be gambling at any MGM resort hotels while I'm here and will not stay in any of these hotels when I come back at the end of the year. I guess they make lots of money so customer service is lacking unless you're a high roller! Do yourself a favor and don't stay at these hotels unless your a gambler and they want your money. Sad these big hotels treat their paying guests like second rate citizens. You would think since they screwed up and sold our paid room they would've at least allowed us to stay in the room they gave us on day 1 and wouldn't inconvenience us with having to move rooms in the middle of our stay. Funny how our room key to our new room worked for the rest of the stay.  I wish I could give them zero stars because that's how I feel my wife and I were treated.",1,0,1

And while I do prefer the luxe rooms of the Venetian when it comes to aesthetics, if you're on a budget, Excalibur is great. If it's a little dirty, well, what do you expect for under $50 a night?

I complained to the front desk and it took them 2 days to fix the smell and the way they fixed it was just by closing the bathroom down all together. Maybe they need to hire a different cleaning crew...

The casino filtration system is terrible so you really feel like your breathing in 2nd hand smoke.

The employees at the front desk were rude when I complained about the bathroom next to the sports book. Maybe that's why they didn't fix it when I complained about it the first day it happened. They must of had other complaints...

I felt like the employees didn't want to listen to me and my complaints\/suggestions because I'm a younger man so they didn't take me seriously, but little did they know I was here for almost 2 weeks and spent over 2000 in their casino and hotel. 

I will never come back to this place.

So this is my evaluation.

Hotel: casino and rooms... Gross.

Staff: (excluding the lady in the sports book) Rude

Food: Buffet was gross most of the food looked like it'd been sitting there for a while besides the food where the guy is cutting the meat off for you...

The pizza Hut which isn't apart of hotel undercooked my pizza. I had hotel staff connect me or attempt to connect me 3 times and they hung up on me every time last time I called and sat outside the pizza Hut and watched the manager walked out while I was attempting to talk to a manager. This is when I decided I need to review this hotel and my awful experience...

So if you want to come to Las Vegas to be treated like royalty know this castle is a total and complete decoy of you want to be treated like royalty don't come here.

Harrahs may be even a better experience and that's saying something. 

I really hope people read this and know what they are getting themselves into.",1,1,1

That said the Excalibur is just a slightly bit better than Luxor which, when they first opened, was an incredible hotel.

My last stay at Luxor was a couple of years ago was interesting because when I went into the room there was a body sized, maroon stain on the carpet. I went to the front desk to ask them if I  could please have a room that was not a murder scene. They said no and I left and went to Caesars.

Everybody who comes to Vegas should band together and protest the ""resort fee"" bullshit. For $18 per night you get hard wired internet -not wifi; free faxes- who uses faxes anymore; oh yeah, a ""free"" local newspaper - we do something that has zero value to me anywhere I travel and I never even got thus.morning; and finally, let's not forget free access to the weight room!  Where else do you pay - in advance- for.stuff you don't want or use????   

You can't just blame Excalibur. But I have no problem quickly blaming big holding companies like MGM who basically owns a third OR MORE of the strip now and can pretty much do anything they want. 

If enough people complained to the Federal Trade Commission maybe they will look into it as deceptive marketing. Which is exactly what it is.  They can put ad on TV and websites for.room rates but the resort fee is not reflected anywhere in the room rate.

It is basically the same scenario as with the airlines who are going to be forced to disclose all of the fees in the total cost very soon. I have done my bitching to FTC and Nevada Gaming Commission...why not join me and hopefully someday, even if we don't save money at least we'll know how we're getting screwed with everything in one rate!",7,4,3

It was an extra $10 per night for a view, $20 for royal tower upgrade. Even with the comped room there is still a resort fee to be aware of. Check in was easy. We weren't going to be in the room much so upgrades seemed unnecessary, how bad could it be? WELL, our view was of a white wall. Pretty hilariously bad but still fine. Long walk from the elevator to the room. Hallways smelled like chlorine since I think we were close to the pool and mixed in was air freshener to try to cover up the smell. Air freshener\/chlorine smell is preferable to the smell of piss that we walked out to one morning in our hallway. Rooms have no mini fridge, microwave, or coffee pot which is inconvenient. The bed is like sleeping on a brick and there is no comforter, only sheets and a thin ratty blanket thing. Our room was clean so props to the housekeepers. 

Parking was free. The pool was decent although if you want to go to the adult only pool they do charge a fee. Casino is on the older side and it takes forever to get a drink on the floor. The one waitress we saw practically walked by us several times before asking if we needed a drink and I saw another lady flag her down and complain that she had been on the casino floor for over an hour on the slots without being served. I feel like this hotel is geared towards a family friendly vibe with people who want to save money. I would say go elsewhere from my experience or try the upgrades.",2,2,0

We went to check in through the thick cigarette smoke that permeated the casino. They gave us our information and we headed off to the room. When we got to the room I opened the folder they gave us and saw the desk clerk had forgotten to give us our hotel key. 
My grand daughter was coughing ( allergy to the smoke) and I have asthma, so it was no treat for me either. I called the front desk and explained this to them and asked if they could have someone bring us the key. They said there was nothing they could do, we had to come back down again and walk through the smoke. You cant bring us the dang key?? Really???
The room was old and drab. The bed was OK. Not great, but I did not have a backache the next day. 
The valets and bellhops did a good job but my grand daughter started coughing and coughed when ever we went to the casino.

My fiancé and I decided to check out bags and just walk around.  1pm comes around and we are walking past the front desk to see a long line.  We ask an employee to ask if they are checking people in now and the man said yes.  He said they do check people in early.  Now i'm upset because the RUDE woman said they NEVER check people in before 3.   So I finish what I was doing, get my bags and check in at 2:30ish.  The doors for the rooms are around an inch off the floor.  I can hear everything going on outside my room and I'm sure people can hear what's happening in my room.  I call the front desk to ask a simple question (where is the ice machine).  The lady was very rude and tried to get me off the phone.  
Another thing I hated about this hotel was all the agents trying to get me to sign up for a timeshare.  I couldn't want 3 minutes without being harrassed.  

I was supposed to stay 5 nights here but I can't handle the quality and the rude employees.  I called from desk to request next day check out and then I called to make reservations at the Paris Hotel.  I will never stay here again.  This hotel only got two stars because I like the Medieval style.",3,2,1

My girlfriend, her family and I decided to celebrate the end of 2012 and the start of 2013 by driving down to Vegas. It was a last minute decision and we realized it would probably be pricey and hard finding an affordable place to stay considering the nature of the events going on and the last minute choice. 

However, for 3 nights we managed to book a room at th Excalibur for roughly $500. Other places were ridiculously high ranging from $200-400 a night. We chose to stay until January 2nd in an effort to avoid the large amount of traffic and chaos it would be to get out of Vegas during the day of New Years. Now onto the review of Excalibur itself. 

The hotel itself, a bit less exotic or upscale looking as other places but still quite a twist having a castle looking hotel with two towers. Depending in the tower your room is located (Tower I or Tower II) you will either have a great view of Las Vegas Boulevard, aka, The Strip or a view of the highway entering Vegas. We stayed in Tower II and had a nice view of some parts of Vegas but not so much a view of the strip. The rooms were a nice size where you can choose to have a king bed or two queens. Bring your own blanket if the air conditioning\/heater isn't enough as the blankets provided aren't true blankets, but nonetheless, the average temperature in the room remains above 60 degrees as you cannot set it lower than that. 

With checking in, you get a coupon book full of many offers. A good one is the complimentary two drinks within Excalibur you get where you only pay gratuity. 

It has a good selection of slot machines and various tables where you can play at and the Craps and Poker tables are often filled with enthusiastic gamblers. Of importance would be to sign ul for M-Life, the membership card that basically allows you to accumulate points at various hotels and casinos which include big ones like the Mandalay Bay, MGM, etc. I managed to rack up 500 points to get a free play balance of $10 and hope to continue to add to my point balance in the near future. 

The casino is a smoking zone so bring a surgical mask or something if you hate smoke. There's a food court on the second floor, a bucca de pepo as well, an odd place called Dicks Last Resort and it is connected to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay for you to explore. You can get married at the little chapel inside, get a water massage, see naked buff dudes dance, and get a bobblehead made!

Overall I felt it was a solid hotel and casino. They had plenty of gambling options to choose from, good drinks, a solid selection of food items. A couple of things that weren't so great was the inconsistency of the ""cleanliness"" of the hotel, spit hanging on the elevator door, being hassled by some guys trying to give you ""free"" stays at the place and the old little ladies with their aged bossoms trying to get you to buy cocktails and drinks. Sadly, the buffet wasn't all that great, it did its job in satisfying my hunger but wasn't out of this world. 

Excalibur is chill, does what its supposed to do and is conveniently located on the strip. Will be back to visit the casino and perhaps the hotel in the near future.",1,0,0

A sassy staff full of quick comeback's and attitude will grace you with your presence upon arrival but if you are looking for an entertaining evening complete with decent food, you are mistaken. 

The food is far from satisfactory, especially if you prefer your burgers hot. You can expect luke warm food with no flavor whatsoever and by the time the rude staff actually brings you the condiments you've requested, it's pretty much a guarantee your food will officially be COLD. 

My best suggestion for an evening at Dick's, eat before hand and just go for the drinks. Be sure it's pay day also because for 4 fantastic beverages (2 tap beers and 2 cocktails) will cost you close to $60.

Pros:
- Cheap for the quality of the hotel
- Great view, well... depending on which room you get.... I got lucky and got a great view
- Got a $20 beverage credit per day
- Hotel rooms were extremely clean and quiet

Cons:
- It was raining at the time I stayed here and water leaked through the windows. I had to use a towel to cover the window so water wouldn't get all over the desk.
- The front door kept clicking for some reason. It sounded as if someone was trying to get in while I was sleeping. I figured out that it was because the door was not completely secure on the door frame so there was a small space for the door the move around due to the wind hitting the door.
- This place is at the end of the strip, so walking would be a challenge. I recommend buying a monorail ticket if you decide to live here. I was tired and in pain from all the walking and I regret not staying at a place closer to the center of the strip
- Some of the things in the hotel were janky. For an example, the shower towel holder broke when I was hanging my towel. The portable mirror looked like it was about to fall. The hot water handle was harder to turn than the cold water handle
- No microwave or fridge

Overall there are definitely more cons and pros. If I wanted to spend a little more I would stay somewhere else. I would also want to stay somewhere closer to the center of the strip. My legs were dying walking to the strip from there. However, I didn't mind staying here since I came to Vegas to spend the majority of my time outside and not at a hotel.",5,0,0

You can get a good rate here mostly because no one wants to stay.  The location is not bad.  At the street corner where it is located is NY NY, MGM and the Tropicana.  The tram connects it to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  And there in lies the problem; it seems that there are more exciting places with better casinos to go to, because they are.

We stayed in Tower 1, which didn't have any special views of the strip but we didn't care about that. We were in Vegas for Vegas..not to be in the room the entire time. We were only in the room to sleep and needed a place to crash at the end of our long Vegas days of walking the strip. If you have the same needs, Excalibur is the place for you. The rates are cheaper and the rooms are comfortable...the beds were very nice after a long day of walking around the strip. Housekeeping was also very helpful in our trip as we needed them a few times to get items for us that we forgot and they had them at our room within minutes! The only downside is the location on the strip as it is on the South end...so if you want to go anywhere, it is a pretty good walk...but I actually appreciated that bc it forced me to get some much needed exercise after all the eating I did. They also have an $18 resort fee which includes internet and use of their fitness center if you need more exercise. I'll definitely be back as this was a great hotel for the price.

Don't stay at this hotel unless you want a legitimate reason to call in sick to work upon your return from Vegas.  If National Lampoon made a movie called ""Walmart vactaion"" it would be filmed at the Excalibur.  When you check in, you don't get to choose an option of ""Bed bugs"" or ""Semen stains.""  Rather, it's just like rolling a dice and if you're lucky, like I was, you'll get both (I considered the 2 inch pubic hairs in my bed an added bonus with my purchase).  When I asked for new sheets that weren't covered in semen, it took 2 hours for housekeeping to come. The woman who finally came was hostile and defensive about the whole dirty sheets situation.  When I asked for a new blanket she looked at me like I had just given the finger to her 3 year old.  Her response of  ""We NEVER change the blankets"" was less than comforting.

I first visited Excalibur in the 90's, and the hotel embodied its legendary name, exuding wonder, mystery, and fantasy.  Now, Excalibur is nothing more than a shadow of its former glory, a caricature of a medieval dream vision.  After all, when Dick's Last Resort replaces Merlin as the centerpiece of the castle, then you know that something has gone terribly awry.  Kitsch, not magic, reigns supreme here.

When you step into the hotel from outside, you're greeted with a blast of smoky air.  Many of the newer casinos do a much better job filtering the air - or, at the very least, disguising it with sweet, floral scents - but Excalibur seems to do nothing at all.  Though it may appeal to children given its castle theme, Excalibur probably wouldn't be the best take to take kids given the smokiness of the casino and hotel.  In the basement (below the casino), you'll find the ""Fun Dungeon,"" which is devoted to arcade games for the under-21 crowd, but the darkness and outdatedness of the space definitely made it feel like a dungeon.  On the second level, you'll find an array of restaurants that primarily serve fast food.  This wouldn't be the place to come if you're looking for fine dining or a place with a decent atmosphere, and I'd hesitate to use the included dining vouchers anywhere here.  The casino itself is fairly conventional: endless rows of slots and a cluster of table games.  

If you choose to stay here, be aware that Tower II has been renovated while Tower I has not.  In order to book a renovated room, you'll have to shell out more money.  Sadly, we ended up in dinky, dingy Tower I.  My friends compared the rooms to those found at Motel 6, and I would be largely inclined to agree.  I'd even argue that updated rooms at renovated Motel 6s - a fraction of the cost of rooms at Excalibur - are nicer given that chain's efforts to rebrand itself.  Aside from the faint smoky smell that permeated the non-smoking rooms, the furniture was worn and dated.  If you've ever been on the Snow White ride at Disneyland, then you'll know what I mean when I say that the room's wooden furniture seemed clunky and old - an unwelcome throwback to a former time when the hotel's theme extended everywhere.  (And, yes, I felt like I was transported to the cottage in which Snow White and her small-statured friends lived.)  Some of the furniture was missing decorative pieces, and I even spotted a nail sticking out of the bed frame.  As someone who doesn't have cable at home, I was disappointed with the selection of TV channels.  What's the point of having cable if you can't even watch HGTV and Food Network?

The hotel has a self-parking lot, but you'll basically have to traverse the entire casino floor before getting to the check-in desks.  Although I didn't have the opportunity to use the pool, it was located across the entire casino floor, closer to Tower II than Tower I.  

The only real reason to stay at Excalibur is the location, as it's convenient to Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand and New York New York.   That, however, might not be a good thing if you're hoping to spend more time at the northern end of the Strip.  Personally, I don't think it's worth it to pay the weekend rate ($100-200 plus resort fee ) if the room is going to be less than satisfactory.",6,3,2

Pros: 
 - I liked that the window of the room opened a tiny bit. Barely opened, but most rooms are completely sealed.
- View was pretty nice even if most of it was the parking lot. Nice sunset, mountains, and people-watching.
- TV was decent sized widescreen (but had a terrible picture)

Cons: 
- Hardly a trace of the ""Excalibur"" atmosphere anymore
- One bedspread smelled like a man's body odor, very gross. Hotel never ended up replacing it, we tried telling housekeeping but she did not understand and did not speak very good English.
- The ""ice bucket"" looked like it was used to make another kind of ""ice"". It was burned very bad on the bottom, very weird and gross.
- There was dried urine on the TOP of the toilet lid, again - very strange. What happened in this room?
- Shower only, no bathtub. Most places like this have a shower-bath. Was kind of a bummer. Got up on the counter after walking miles and soaked my feet in the sink instead.

The worst part? Below.

Housekeeping entered our room without permission, while we were inside, TWICE. I found this to be very rude, as both times we had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, and both times were way before our checkout time!! Our side of the door only locked from the outside after it was closed, so both times they knocked, and then after NOT being told to enter, because we were sitting around in our pajamas in the morning, watching TV, and in the bathroom busy getting dressed, they BARGE in and the second time I am in the bathroom, doing my hair and this dude barges in, rudely asks if we are checking out soon, I said yes? and he finally left. What the fuck? This has never happened to me at any hotel or motel, ever!

If you're in Vegas, don't stay here. Stay anywhere but here.

As a Vegas veteran, I know what to expect on the Strip. But hey, I stay on the Strip because that is where the best times are!! Sure there are a lot of drunk, loud college kids- my group included. Everything is overpriced, which is why I bring my own bottled water and beer thank you. I would rather pay through the nose and be in the middle of it all than stay off strip and make up the difference in cab fare. 

When I saw the prices at this hotel I was pretty stoked for my Labor day get away. I have stayed at MGM, NYNY and Luxor and LOVED this area of the strip. Mostly younger people just having a good time. So I booked the room. 

Upon arriving at the hotel I was met by a saleslady at the door announcing she had my welcome gift. Having never experienced this before, I thought it was just a nice gesture but the little voice in my head reminded me ""this is Vegas, nothing is free"". So my group of 3 guys and myself spent about 10 minutes being talked to about show tickets before we realized it was a hustle. I figured it was a one time thing, but by the end of the trip we literally were running past the doors to not get hassled. HOW ANNOYING! 

We check in and are told we are on the 2nd floor. Kind of a bummer, because let's face it, I love the lights and a good view makes the room. I don't say anything and get to the room hoping we at least are looking at the Luxor.. I opened my window and to my dismay we were 5 feet from a brick wall. Yes seriously- a window facing another part of the hotel building. 

We went about our first night hanging out and walking the casino. I crashed earlier because I had been up so early to finish packing while my boyfriend and his friend stayed out drinking. I woke up about 6 am the following day feeling itchy. I go to the bathroom and turn on the light and there is a HUGE BEDBUG on my leg. I freaked out and killed it, noticing bites on my leg and both my feet. I immediately wake up everyone in the room and call the front desk. They proceed to send a security guard up who is pretty nonchalant like this is an every day occurrence.

They switch us to another room after many pictures are taken and in the new room we notice it is REALLY dirty. I mean not the average, partied in Vegas room dirty, but dried boogers on the sheets nasty dirty. We asked the manager for yet another room and she came through with a really nice suite for us. That is the only reason this place gets 2 stars. Take it from me, if you are going to stay here, buck up and get the suite. 

The buffet was super cheap, and basically you get what you pay for, super cheap food. We went to the Wynn buffet one day and it was AWESOME. 

Basically if you are wanting the strip and want to gamble on getting bitten by bedbugs, stay in a standard room. For a nicer experience get a suite. For an even better time, stay at MGM, they know how to clean the rooms right!",7,3,1

We were givin dirty towels and had to get new ones. The toilet paper holder is so far from the toilet I practically fall off just trying to grab it and I'm 5'2 (idk what little kids do).

You would have thought that this would have been done long before one of the biggest technology conventions in the industry came to town, to avoid the nightmare of an army of tech professionals all needing to check in with their companies, up and download files and confer with new network contacts and all the things that technology professionals need to work. 

Not the case here...

The majority of the time during CES the wireless network was down with no answers being given from the front desk as to an ETA as to when the problem would be fixed or any other useful information. In fact I took my time to compile a list of translations for dealing with the front desk....

I'm sorry = I don't care.
We are are aware of it and are working on it = We are hoping you'll quit bothering us cause quite frankly we just don't care..
We're sending someone right up = We're sending someone up when we feel like it. (or if you bitch enough)
I understand = I don't care.
The manager is in a meeting = The manager doesn't want to deal with you and will be in one long continuous meeting for the next 48 hours.
We'll call you = We hope you'll forget about this later because we won't be calling you.

The bright point in all of this (and the reason for the second star in this review) is David in their IT support dept who went above and beyond to hook me up with a modem and some cat 5 cable to wire in direct. He actually understood that even though we were in Vegas for CES, we were here to work. Kudos to David for some serious dedication!
 
Other than that, The Excalibur is what it is, and what it is is an older hotel\/casino on the strip with lower than most rates, so if you had some Oceans Eleven Vegas fantasy on a budget, I have to remind you that you aren't George Clooney and your best friend isn't Brad Pitt and you aren't staying at the Bellagio. So come in to the experience with realistic expectations and you'll do just fine. CES attendees should think twice about book here next year though, even though it is on their list of recommended hotels.",1,2,0

If you're looking for cheap on the strip, Excalibur may be your place. And I mean, come on...you can only gamble at Bellagio and Caesar's so much before you're broke. Excalibur has $5 craps tables, decent penny slots (I know, sounds like an oxymoron), and all your average games. I was told that the Poker dealers are slightly questionable and may not know what they are doing...so said my buddy who is a regular poker player. He won't be playing at Excalibur any more. 

Also, they have a surprisingly good sports book. Comfy enough chairs, plenty of TVs, and not at all cramped. 

One issue is that out of our group of 6, two of us (including me) got sick after about 30 minutes in the Excalibur. Not sure what it is - smoke, mold, whatever. But we had to leave with headaches. We returned the next day and the same thing happened again. So...that's not cool.",0,0,0

The wife and I ventured to Vegas with the family to celebrate the birthday of one of cousins.  We chose a cheap motel that was in walking distance to the ""Four Corners"" of hotels that anchored the intersections of Las Vegas and Tropicana Blvds.  The Excalibur is one of these attractions, and we were looking forward to a saucy mix of casino fun and Medieval themed romp that the hotel was known for.  The key word for our experience was: Disappointment.

The hotel opened in 1990, and the first time I visited was in 1993 when my then-fiance (now ex-wife) paid a visit to look into possibly getting married at the Hotel's Canterbury wedding chapel.  Even though we wound up getting married elsewhere, we had a blast here.  The hotel\/casino was a perfect combination of adult casino fun and medieval dungeony..dragony..King Arthury whimsy.

Now.. I realize that this was during the 90s, and during this time, Vegas was trying to re-invent itself as a resort for all members of the family (anyone remember when they had a water park...right there on the strip?)  Many of the casinos had attractions that appealed to all ages...and Excalibur was one of the most well-known of these.

Then the new millenia came, and Vegas and its attractions began to re-assert themselves as playgrounds for adults.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for this.  Adults need their own version of Disneyland as well.  

What's so sad with the Excalibur these days is that its lost its whimsy...its lost its magick.  Food courts have replaced most of the medieval\/fantasy themed shops that made the place fun to patronize.  In fact, the only two such shops left are ""Kids of the Kingdom"" and ""The Dragon's Lair"" (which is still an awesome place to shop for dragon and fairy shirts and prints).  The ""Medieval Times""-esque Tournament of Kings dinner show is still there...but also is the Thunder from Down Under male strip dinner show.  

There is still a Fun Dungeon downstairs with circus\/midway type games where kids can win tickets for prizes...as well as what passes these days for an arcade, but its a far cry from what it used to be years ago...its almost an afterthought now.

Most of the Arthurian statues and suits of armor and mural artwork has been removed and replaced with a restaurant where the staff and waiters make fun of you (Dick's Last Resort)...really?...really?!  You'd think that kind of douchebag-ish behavior was more of a match at New York, New York.

Now.. I will say this.  There are a tremendous number of places to eat here, in a whole gamut of price ranges.  But when I talked to one of the Krispy Kreme workers, he told me that right behind where I was standing was going to be yet another food court!...with 6 more eateries!! *le sigh*

Yes... I understand...Las Vegas is about consumerism and making money.  I get that.  But really, a balance needs to be struck.  Neither the wife nor myself appreciated being accosted and, for lack of a better term, panhandled by various staff members; asking us if were going to be in Vegas very long and trying to sell us timeshares!  I almost felt like we were in Mexico with all the up-scale panhandling going on...it was almost *that* aggressive!

We left the Excalibur feeling rather sad.  What used to be a fun place of adult romping and playing mixed in with nice touched of Ren Faire whimsy has, thanks to recent rennovations, become a hollow shell of itself.  Its become little more than a pretty resort and hotel in the shape of a castle.  All glitz and glamour to look at on the outside...with little substance left on the inside.",5,1,2

Excalibur is great for those on a tight budget or maybe those who plan to use the room to sleep for a few hours and then head out elsewhere to party.  

Decent casino area, nothing really special.  The Sportsbook was a little smaller than most, but had comfortable seating.  Didn't go in the pool, but from what I can see, it looked a little small, and somewhat basic, except for a cool looking slide. Also has some lower priced dining options.  

Of course the rooms are pretty basic, but passable.  Popcorn ceilings and worn carpet show its age.  But then again, upgrades make the room price go up.

It seems like a good deal when you are booking online, but they charge a resort fee of $20.16 per day. They also charge you $20 extra to check in before 3pm or check out after 11am. The luggage check lines were about 20 minutes long when I was there, so I opted to pay the extra cash and get to my room ASAP. Unless you find a very good deal (like $25-$40 a night), it is not worth staying here.

Worn out carpet, fixtures, and drapes. New TV, but the internet is wired and NOT wireless.

My room had a soaking tub in it, which seemed like a nice perk worth the extra cash, but they don't have any type of overflow drain in them, and inevitably, the tub in the room above me overflowed and it rained in my hotel room. YES, the ceiling had water pouring out of it into my room at 3:30am.

It took them about 15 minutes to respond with towels. They could only offer me a smoking room, so I powered through and stayed in a room that had water leaking from the ceiling ALL NIGHT. I don't know why it never stopped. After two sleepless hours of running water and anticipating maintenance people knocking on my door, I called the front desk to let them know it was still leaking. They asked me to hold for a moment, 6 minutes later the manager came on and told me there was nothing they could do unless I would take a smoking room.

They wouldn't give me any comps or even give me a break by refunding my early check-in fee or resort fee. I was considering checking out three days early and moving to another hotel, but out of pure resignation I decided to stay.

The rest of the trip was uneventful...besides a few slamming doors in the hallway and bed springs squeaking from the room above.

We has reserved the basic room, knowing that we could upgrade once we got to the hotel at check-in (and it was cheaper in doing so there).

Before we even got to the check-in desk, we were intercepted by one of those timeshare people.  I know they are just doing their job, and I'm sure the hotel gets some sort of kickback by allowing them to operate inside, but I think they should make a rule with them not to hound someone that is carrying luggage and obviously just got there.  Seriously, these people are freaking everywhere inside and outside the hotel.  We ended up doing the presentation for the free stuff, so after that it was easy to just tell them we already did it.

Check-in was great.  We were going to upgrade to the ""deluxe"" room with a strip view (this means it's in tower 2, which has been upgraded, so it has a pillow top mattress and a 42"" TV) with a nightly upgrade price of $30.  She checked and did not have any king size beds in that, only two queens.  I asked her to lower the nightly price to $20, and she agreed.  While she was working on that, I noticed they had spa rooms available, normally $50 per night.  I asked her if she would give us that for $30 a night, and she again agreed.  While working on checking us in, she said that she already put the upgrade price in at $20 per night and the system wouldn't let her change it, so we got the spa room upgrade for $30 cheaper!

The only downside to the spa room is that it is at the end of the hall, but that wasn't the end of the world.  The room was very nice for what we were paying.  The Excalibur is one of the older hotels on the strip, so we were not expecting the ultra modern amenities like what you would find in the newer hotels.  We were only on the 8th floor, so we couldn't see all of the strip, but it was still better than looking at the interior building of the hotel.  The spa tub was large, and was very nice to relax in after a long day of walking the strip.  The bathroom was a nice size, plenty of room for two or more people to use to get ready for the day.  The room also included a large safe, big enough to fit our 17"" laptop into.

When we first got in, the A\/C wasn't working.  I called it in, and being that it was 9:30 pm, I didn't expect anything too quick.  The maintenance man was there within 10 min, and had the A\/C reset and working again within another 5 min.  We also had an issue with the remote for the TV not working, which they got resolve the next day.  Because of our issues, we got a nice letter from the VP apologizing with some free chocolates.  We already had a big discount on the room, so we didn't ask for anything else, especially since they resolved the issues so quickly.

The amenities in the hotel\/casino were decent.  We did not eat in any of the sit down restaurants, but they looked nice.  It was nice to have multiple locations to get coffee in the morning, and also to have the McDonalds open 24 hours to grab some food real quick before heading up to the room after a long day.  There is an indoor walkway to the Luxor, which is awesome because the Luxor has some nice amenities over there, as well as one of the shows that we saw.  We were going to do the Tournament of Kings dinner, but they have warnings about people with asthma attending, which I have, and I was sick on top of it, so we did not risk it.

The location of the hotel on the strip is not the best, it is on the south end.  However, they have elevated walkways on all sides of the intersection in front of Excalibur, and the monorail stops behind the MGM (across the street diagonally), so you can easily get to the north end of the strip if you need to.  Like I said before, there is an indoor walkway to the Luxor, and also a tram out front that goes to both the Luxor and the Mandalay Bay.

We never used the pool, but did walk down there.  It looked nice, but the large main pool was closed for the season?  I thought Vegas was always hot, it was still in the 90s when we were there in Sept, so how was the hot season over?  I was told though that you are allowed to use the pools in any MGM resort, which includes the Luxor and Mandalay Bay, which I was also told have some of the best pools on the strip.

Overall, the stay was nice.  Their express checkout was awesome, just drop the room keys in a box and walk out.  If we need to stay in Vegas on a budget, we would stay there again, although on our next trip we plan to save up a bit more to upgrade to one of the newer hotels on the strip.  I saw complaints in other reviews about kids running everywhere, and to be honest, we saw more kids in other hotels than we did in ours.",2,1,1

It made Chuck E Cheese look like a luxurious spa destination.

The pros: They have a great variety of games for all ages. From shooter arcade games to racing games and even carnival-style games. The games seemed to be taken care of, unlike Fun Factory in Redondo Beach.

Cons: One of the games took my money. Many of the more popular games are $1 or $2 per person. We tried to play two of the carnival games but no one seemed to be staffing them. Only three of the ticket counters were open. All the other machines were out of order, so it was a 10-minute wait to turn in tickets.

The dealbreaker: The prizes are outrageously overpriced. 50 tickets for a mini bottle of bubbles? 25 tickets for those cheap, neon bracelets?

From the second we arrived, we were harassed by an onslaught of timeshare salespeople. Literally, 10+ an hour. You can't even walk to the bathroom without someone trying to lure you to a timeshare presentation. This alone will be the reason why we will never book at an MGM again.

We were also very disappointed in the lack of security. We witnessed a fight outside, but on MGM property. A feeble woman was kicked in the face and being stomped. We searched for a security member but not one could be found. We even asked hotel staff to call or help us find someone, but they all said they had no way to call security. Even the ones on the shops. If I stole something, I'm sure they'd have a way to call. But when someone is getting curb-stomped, they turned their back and said, ""Oh well.""

The food at the buffet was mediocre, but had a large selection. The crab legs were pretty tasty. 

The casino wasn't anything to write home about. It was comparable to the other MGM properties but nowhere near as nice as some of the others further up the strip. In serious need of refreshing though; it was quite dated.

The hotel room was what you'd expect. While not the best, it was bearable since we barely spent any time in the room. We were up on the 26th floor and you can practically hear people talking on the street. Compared to some other hotels, it is not somewhere where you will get a good sleep. It practically sounded like the windows were open. Other hotels on the strip are almost soundproof from street noise.

Amenities have been cut (remember the free sewing kit and shower caps?), and the decor is generic and worn.  Sadly Excalibur is no exception.

Rooms were worn, and despite being on a nonsmoking floor it was a little stinky.  It may be nonsmoking, but it might not have been ten years ago--and I doubt they changed all the wallpaper and carpets since then so the smell remains. Plus, the HVAC system is just recirculating air from all over, I guess. All of our clothes smelled.

I also found that Vegas hotels do not seem to offer free wifi.  The $15\/day charge is crazy.  I think it's all part of the attempt to offer no distractions from gaming.*  Wifi would allow me to stay in my room instead of gambling. (Or, in my case, get some work done instead of trekking all over town looking for a signal.)

While check-in\/out was quick and easy with friendly staffers, otherwise the front desk was not helpful.  I asked for directions to a particular coffee shop and was met with ""I don't know.""  No offer to help me find it. Not even an offer of a phone book or anything.  The concierge seemed there only to book reservations or sell tickets, not to help with other traveler requests.  Since TSA confiscated my toothpaste, I asked about getting some (remember when they gave little sample packets?).  I was directed to the gift shop to buy a trial size for $3.50.  I needed it right away, and no one would be able to give me directions to Walgreens or CVS, so I paid it.

A bright spot: the fitness center was excellent.  It was clean, machines were plentiful and well-maintained.  There were free towels and a water cooler, as well as wipes for the machines.  It had a nice view of the pool area (which I didn't use but it looked nice), and it was an oasis of clean air.

In the end, the only time spent in our hotel room was to sleep. I used the food court wifi and the fitness center but otherwise stayed outside the Excalibur during my stay.

*The Krispy Kreme in the food court does offer free wifi and a seating area.  I am so grateful to them for that and gladly patronized them during my stay. Sign up for the text deals and you'll get discounts on coffee during your visit! Of course, the air was still stinky and made me cough up junk (ah, the joy of casino air), so I preferred the wifi at Coffee Bean in the Miracle Mile Shops, which let me breathe a bit easier.

Oh, and what's with the gaming floor carpet?  Why does a Medieval England-themed resort have carpets with a motif of oyster shells, pearls, ginkgo leaves, and sand dollars? Weird.",3,3,2

But this does not compare to being SCAMMED TWICE by the Excalibur. In February 2012 my boyfriend and I were stopped by an Excalibur employee as were walking through the casino floor.

""Are you going to come back to Vegas this year?""  he asked. Of course we are. We love this place.

After a few qualifying questions such as where do you live and how old are you, he told us we could get a great deal for returning customers. $99 for 2 nights and 2 show tickets. I'm normally a Cosmopolitan or Bellagio girl but I don't go to Vegas to hang out in the hotel room.  I am also a huge fan of Groupon and Living Social deals so I signed up on the spot.

When we arrived Friday afternoon we were told about the tour we were required to go on. ""What tour?!"" my boyfriend and I both asked it in complete horror. The 5 hour TIMESHARE tour we are required to go on in order to get our 2 nights and 2 show tickets for the $99 we already paid them. 

Long story short...we didn't have to go on the tour but we lost our $99 and we had to pay for our 2 nights. I would rather do that then spend 5 hours on a bus and lose precious time in Vegas. We booked at the Excalibur through expedia.com and got 2 nights for $170 but when we checked-in decided to upgrade to the jacuzzi suite for $50 more a night (which somehow totals $145 extra instead of $100 according to my final bill). As I mentioned before, PASS. 

But it gets better. When we initially told them we didn't want to do the tour they threatened to charge us full-price for the 2 nights and we wouldn't get the rooms. We finally agreed they wouldn't charge us the penalty if we did book on our own and lost the $99. I was angry but agreed to it. I just came home and checked my credit card to discover that they did indeed charge us for the penalty. So I've been SCAMMED TWICE by the Excalibur. I ended up paying $550 for 2 nights. For just the room. That typically goes for $70 a night. 

Suffice it to say, I will NEVER stay here again.

They have 2 towers and only one of them is newly renovated. The rooms are nicer than the other tower but of course more expensive. Room service is expensive, they don't have free wi-fi, and there is really nothing super special about their amenities compared to other hotels.

I do like the location because it is connected to other hotels so you never have to walk out of the hotel, you can just travel from the inside. Excalibur is pretty outdated looking and overall it's a decent place to stay but if prices keep rising I would rather pay for better quality.",3,2,2

They have upgraded most of the rooms and the beds, even in the cheap rooms, are quite comfortable.

I stayed in the Standard Deluxe Widescreen room - Two queen beds with a 42"" flat screen TV, safe, bathroom with granite countertops (standing shower, no tub), alarm clock with iPod capability.

I was very dissatisfied with the room.  I understand ""you get what you pay for"" but I did not pay for a DIRTY room with broken fixtures and loud door slamming by hotel maids during sleeping hours!  

Let me list the reasons for my dissatisfaction:
- The sink was terribly grimy, it actually had the previous guest's dried toothpaste still lingering.  
- The shower drain was clogged, which meant I had to shower with my feet soaked in dirty water!  NASTY and GROSS!
- The bedside table lamp did not work.  
- The furnace covering was broken.
- The WORST PART:  My room was located near the housekeeping room and as a result, I heard constant door SLAMMING throughout the night and into the morning.  Needless to say, I did not have good sleep AT ALL.  

Casino:
On the contrary, I enjoy gambling at Excalibur.  There are many games including 5 cent Video Poker (my fav).  The Poker Room is smaller when compared to other casinos but Excalibur offers a wheel spin where one can win bonus cash.  The Sports Room is also smaller when compared to other casinos.

Location:
Excalibur Hotel is located at the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.  There is a convenient walkway connecting Excalibur Hotel to New York New York (and subsequently MGM).  There is also convenient tram service to and from Luxor and Mandalay Bay.",4,1,1

Excalibur has seen better days. 

Our room was in Tower 1 aka ""peasants tower"", I've heard that Tower 2 has the nice updated rooms. When we opened the door to our room, it smelled of fast food hamburgers, not the best first impression. Our room basically hadn't been updated in decades - burnt orange carpeting, noisy air conditioner probably older than me, loud buzzing from the fluorescent light fixture in the bathroom etc. We had a lovely view of a cinder block wall. I was surprised that this place was a MGM property.

The hotel itself gives off a dingy, Super 8 vibe. Most of the restaurants are fast food or Dick's Last Resort and Johnny Rocket's which are a pure tourist traps. (avoid!) They have an arcade area called the Fun Dungeon downstairs (for the kids I guess). The Excalibur Buffet was pretty good, it has been remodeled recently. It was very clean, food was OK, good value if you are famished. There is a Starbucks and Krispy Kreme for breakfast on the upper level which was nice. 

The pool area was a good size and not too crowded. There were plenty of lounge chairs for everybody. The hotel is conveniently located on the south end of the Strip, and there is a walkway to NY NY, where we spent way more time at. 

I thought the staff were very nice and helpful, much more so than I've experienced in more fancier LV hotels. Our cocktail waitress at the Lounge was really great, she deserves a job at a much better place imo. The room cleaning staff kept our room really clean and were friendly to us.

Overall it wasn't my cup of tea, basically the only time we had spent there was to  sleep and shower. If we hadn't got such a deal I would have been gravely disappointed.",0,0,0

Also, the hotel room's toilet flushed extremely slow. Even Imperial Palace had power-assisted toilets. The food variety at the various restaurants in-house were dull, and the buffet was no better than a Hometown Buffet (not a compliment for those that like that place). Unfortunately, convenience played the key part in why I chose one of either McD's, Pizza Ht Xpress, Quiznoz, Krspy Kreme, or Round Table Buffet. 20 yrs old facility going on 50. At least my inspection of bed bugs came up clean. Oh, didn't mention the $15\/night Resort Fee for I believe the pool\/spa use, and the WIRED internet (no wireless available) both of which I didn't use.

Check in....one of the few bright spots.   Line was long but moved quickly and they opened more spots to help customers too.

Room-  Oh man where to start...look at the pictures.  The fire alarm was broken and hanging ( you shitting me?!?!).   see pic.  There was pubic hair EVERYWHERE.
See pic.   The alarm clock broken (it was right once a day at though 12:01. See pic.   The safe...unusable ( shows error and lock mechanism engaged )  See pic.  There was smears on the wall.

I have NEVER been in a hotel room this bad l well that is not true.  There was a motel downtown that the meth users stayed at was a step down.

Customer service-  HORRIBLE could not describe it.  Call the front desk.  We can't help you...you have to stay there (Thx !!!! love being in dungeons and forced to stay because you can't do anything)  My health and safety doesn't matter...nor do laws it seems.   I will sleep in my fire proof suit and air mask I brought with me....oh wait I f@$king didn't bring one.   Go to front desk.  Oh sorry we can't help you either you have to stay there...very nice.   You guys are a joke ...maybe a call to the local Fire Marshall with the attached picture will get your attention.

One bright spot was the Tournament of Kings.   Love meeting the actors after and taking pictures with them.

At first impression I thought I'd hit the jackpot as it looked kind of cool and maybe a place I'd come back to with the family.

The room was spacious and clean and I appreciated the safe.  Came equipped with all the stuff you expect at a casino resort.  Plenty of towels and consumables as far as soap, shampoo, etc.  I was really jazzed.  I threw my luggage in the room and had to go check in to conference but noticed there was the constant ""beep"" of a smoke detector which I called in and it was resolved by the time I returned a couple hours later.

When I got back to relax for a while I opened the blind.  Really?  I got a view of an alley and a place employees sneak a break or something.  (This must be where the major machinery of the hotel was too as there was a constant machine noise that I drowned out by running the AC on 60 the entire time I was there.)  

After closing the blinds on the depressing view outside I sat down to get to some quick work done using the WiFi which is included in the resort fee.  Then I started to really get annoyed.  The tablet would just sit there spinning trying to connect, my phone (which got no Sprint reception in this area of the resort) connected once, then was booted from WiFi and could not connect.

When work traveling it is *very* important for me to maintain connectivity.  I ended up spending 45 minutes with a tech that night trying to point him in the right direction on the issue (the irony is I was in town for one of the world's largest data networking events).  He was confident he fixed it and told me to ""give it time and try again"".   Poor kid was just following a script that didn't account for local issues with the AP, but I digress.

So, I would often have to take my device somewhere to check on email, etc.  Sometimes this would just be another area where the WiFi did connect for me (somewhere else on my floor to make sure I had nothing important, or downstairs to complete if I did so I didn't look weird sitting in the hallway on my tablet.

On checking out I wanted some sort of credit since this was a major inconvenience and the girl asked Enrique who rolled his eyes and made me feel like some sort of idiot.  Thankfully she went and asked someone else and I at least got a one day credit of resort fees.  My advice to have someone go up and check out the wireless device serving the area of my room seemed to fall on deaf ears too.

This day and age you would think that guest connectivity would be a big deal but maybe they want you in the casino or something.  But, this was a real pain and I missed being able to have a Facetime with the wife and kids too.  May seem like something minor to others, but it was a big deal to me.

I guess if I were to put this in the running for a family vacation I would want to verify that I wasn't going to get stuck in a room with the same depressing view and noise level and I would verify WiFi was working in the room before I got settled in  or I would bring my own Cellular based access point (but it is annoying to pay for something and not get it.)  

The location was nice, the smoke wasn't as bad as the casinos I stay at in Reno, and it seemed to be very inclusive.  It's really on the bubble and maybe after the sting of this trip's inconvenience isn't fresh in my memory I'd visit again.  After all, if I had a better view and no WiFi issue I bet I would have fell in the four-star ""I'm a fan"" range for my visit.",7,4,1

The casino I feel has the worst ventilation system of any of the hotels I have walked through.  I felt like just walking to my room made my clothes reek of smoke.  I guess I am just used to Chicago with their smoke-free restaurants and bars.  

I did like the pool area.  They have 3-4 pools with one of them having a slide.  It was nice cooling off in the water and just having down time with family.

My room is almost always pretty clean. I can handle pretty clean opposed to really clean. Why, you ask? Because the room is cheap cheap cheap. I just payed $40 a night when the next closest on the Strip was around $70. It was totally worth it.
They also know how to bust through a line. Since I drive down from SLC, I get there right around check-in time pretty regularly. Usually, the line has 50 or more people. That is also disappointing to walk into after a 6 hour drive... But the staff handles it well. I waited no more than 10 minutes in a line I thought I'd wait over an hour in.

Be prepared for this hotel to be constantly busy and packed with people and kids since it is a popular Vegas hotel for families. The pool area is nice and there are 4 pools, but like I said prepare for it to be very packed.
Bottom line, if you want a decent nice room ask to stay in tower 2 and spend a little more. If you're willing to take a risk don't pay to upgrade.",0,0,0

I know, keep dreaming. Well, I went to Vegas from SD last month and I couldn't believe how clean and fresh this place is.  The first thing I do when I get to a hotel is a inspection for bed bugs. 

I turn the mattress and boxspring around and I look for blood drops or fecal matter. Then I take the headboard off the wall and look behind it as well as take all the pictures off the wall and look on the backs of them. 

My room was extremely cheap and it was truly what I considered to be a 5 star place. 

the only drawbacks are that to get on the monorail, you need to venture to MGM (not as close as you may think) which sucks at 3 AM when you are wasted trying to come back to your room. 

I am going again in April and I am planning on either staying there or debating staying at the Flamingo only because its closer to the center of the strip.",0,0,0

Come spring break (slash economic recession) some friends and I decided to venture out to Sin City. Now, trying to spread our budget thin amongst clubs\/drinking, we were not looking to spend much on lodging. 

Badabing, Badaboom. $35 a night to be 20 stories high on the strip...doesn't really get much better than that. Free drinks included? Why thank you.

Honestly, if you do not intend to be in your hotel room pretty much ever (therefore overly aesthetic touches are not necessary), the only reason I could think you would want to stay at a more expensive hotel would be the pool. Granted this pool is no Mandalay Bay, it actually is spacious\/sunny\/large and perfect for your next-morning hangover rehabilitation station. 

Oh and it has been deemed the ""softest tables"" in Vegas, so you actually have a chance at winning here...not to mention the 24-hour food court near the casino which is always a nice saving grace coming back from clubs!

The Valet line was extremely long, there was a lot of waiting just to drop the car off. Has the MGM Signature scent when you walk in which is a great thing. The registration line was fast and easy. I really couldn't hear the lady who checked me in though, I had to ask her yo repeat herself several times. Also the registration desk are very close together, I felt like me and the other guest were standing shoulder to shoulder. It was easy to find the room. It was clean but, old. The bathroom had stains in the toilet and on the tiles. The bed was comfy and the pillows were great. They had a couple of chairs in the room too which was a good little bonus. 

Spa: I called a head of time and booked a Spa package for $145.00. It was a 25 minute Swedish, 25 minutes facial and 60 minute Pedi. They asked me to arrive 30 min in advance to feel out paperwork, which actually only took 5 mins. I got a tour, which was really nice. The spa is nice period. However they were obviously understaffed, not that I already couldn't see that but the girl at the desk in the waiting room had discussed it with other coworkers in front of me. She didn't have anything positive to see about the situation. I showered and waiting in the waiting room for about 25 min. The massage therapist came and got me and told me that the massage was only going to be Back, neck and shoulders. Ummmk, it would have been nice to have been told that before but whatever. The massage was OK, it wasn't wonderful and I definitely could have taken a taxi a few block away and gotten a  better massage from massage Envy for a 1\/4 of the price and double the time. She took me back to the front where I waited for my other services. I waited 30 mins for the lady to come and do my pedi. It was nice. I have no complaints with that part of the package. I was taken up to the front again where I waited another 30 mins. Since it was taking so long I asked how much longer I would have to wait, the front desk person told me that I only was scheduled for the two services.....ummm.. OK what about the facial?!? After she took 15 mins figuring out why I wasn't scheduled she came back and told me that there has been a ""Mix up"" and the first front desk person didn't provide a ""card"" to the person providing the facial and that is why I was left out of the schedule, so  her manager can either schedule me later on that day to get one or provide a refund. REFUND please! I was there from 9:30am-2:00pm just for two 25 min services...come on! At that point I was starving. I went up tot he front and wasn't really given an apology, they just processed my refund and said thank you for coming in. Ummm yea, no need to thank me, I won't be back. Ever. 

Pool: After eating I went to the pool, it was crowded given it being in the middle of the day and a holiday weekend. I immediately went to stand in line for a drink. While in line some guys said they were leaving and had paid $40 for the chairs they were sitting in and wanted to know if i wanted to sit there. I was like SCORE!!! being that I wouldn't have had anywhere to sit other wise. I got my drink and went and sat in their chairs. i sat there for about an 1.5hrs relaxing and enjoying just being out in the sun. At 5:40 a hotel service dude came and told me that i wasn't allowed to sit there without paying the $40 and that I would have to pay or leave...um...the pool closes at 6pm (In 20 mins), REALLY you're going to kick me out?!?! I told him that the guys that paid for the chairs for the whole day ""gifted"" them to me, but he told me that wasn't allowed. OK I guess I will have to go, because I am NOT going to pay $40 to sit here for the next 20 minutes. I understand them doing business and sells seating areas around the pool to guest that have already paid to rent rooms... I get it but REALLY?!? 20 mins, I mean come on its not like i wasn't a guest at the hotel. Whatever... 

Over all, when I think of hotels on the strip, this isn't the worst one. Honestly, I wouldn't stay here again. its old, and not my style. At the same time I don't like the idea of spending three times as much to stay up the street at a newer hotel as much as I go to Vegas. Sometimes I have to slum it, but I wouldn't slum it here again.",2,0,0

When we walked into the hotel room and it was supposed to be ""remodeled"" but only certain rooms and certain towers so that was the start of the trip. 

The wedding went off great i would suggest the chapel to anyone and the catering to anyone they are one amazing staff. the food for catering was amazing. But there is always a reason why the  rooms are cheap. 

As you walk through the casino from your rooms you try to get talked into a time share and these people dont know the meaning of the word no. or leave me alone. 
We got married on a saturday. Sunday morning we had a late appointment to get our photos so we left a few smaller items in our room. 

We came back into our thinking they would their. We were wrong. Not only did they check us out, they took our stuff we left behind. the list of belongings: 

Tiara
Champagne
Wedding Cake Topper 
Wedding Cake to save for one year. 
Picture Frame with our engagement photo in it with signatures around it

So not only when did we approach the housekeeping about my cake that was in a cooler full of ice, they said they threw it out. Who does that? how do you not look in it and see it has something inside it? It has meaning. Then when we went to the supervisor to check out all she could do was ""comp"" my last night there. There is no way she could take the pain away  of what her dumb staff did. 

When i asked for the GM all she did give me was the GM over her and not of Excalibur. they had no right to go into the room to take my belongings and throw them away. I was lucky enough to get a new bottle of champagne from the chapel.  and they had my tiara and topper on a shelf on their cart but the fact of the matter is they went in our room check us out without us knowing and took our things and assumed stuff that had value and meaning and trashed it. 

I will go to any lengths to get my point across that this is messed up. they had no write to do this to me. or to anyone for this matter. So you can comp my room but it cant bring back the memories that were taken. Yes it was just a piece of cake but it had meaning.

So the staff was not helpful. the dont care what your issues are all they care about  is how many people they can get into their hotel.",5,1,0

In the actual hotel, everything was dirty. There was trash on the ground, I tripped in two different holes in the carpet on the casino floor. I felt like I couldn't touch anything, for fear that I would need a tetanus shot. Not to mention there are many hidden fees! This really annoyed my boyfriend and I.

Excalibur certaily falls short when it comes to service. The entire time of our stay ( a holiday weekend) only one elevator was working for our entire tower's side. Then, one evening, no elevators were working and everyone was forced to climb as many as 8 flights of stairs. To me, that's unacceptable, regardless of how cheap the rooms are. Charge more and fix your equipment or offer some sort of compesation for asking so much from your guests. I know when I book a hotel I am not expecting to be climbing stairs to my accomodations.

They were all showers!!! Sucky.  Anyhow, I was upgraded to Tower 2 (which is the newly renovated wing of two) which was nice.  The carpeting was clean and well kept still which was a relief.

$1 phone access per day regardless of use.
$20 for the SPA (jacuzzi, sauna, gym, steam room, etc)
$10 for internet per day

Even after seeing the timeshare - we were still hounded by these sharks when they see us coming in and out of the hotel.
Third - the room is not horrible but it's not great. I inspected the bed and immediately had to call house keeping to change the sheets (stains and rips on the cover!). We also needed to call them again after finding out the bathroom does not lock. Horrid.

But the rooms are nice but you miss the nice view you might get from any strip hotel. I love the buffet they have. For my personal taste I don't like cheesy medieval stuff.,0,0,0

I've just returned from my first stay at this hotel, and I think it's a great place to save a little money and still get the strip experience.  It isn't luxury, and the rooms are a little super 8ish, but our room was clean and every employee we encountered was pleasant.  I'm sort of the opinion that in Vegas there is luxury (Venetian, Bellagio, etc) and then there is everything else (Bally's, Barbary Coast, Luxor, Trop, Ex, etc).  If I'm going on a weekend or during a major event, most of even the less-luxurious properties go for around $200\/night.  Why not save a few  dollars?  I used to turn to the Trop for savings on busy weekends, but no longer!  At least the Ex has plenty of video poker machines at the bars and is willing to comp any drink (Trop only comps drinks up to 7.50 - No long islands!) and is a little more centerally located.",0,0,1

This is definitely the case with Excalibur. We stayed here with a group of friends who refused to stay somewhere else and pay a little more.

Honestly, I had no choice. My boyfriend wanted us all to be close together instead of staying at different hotels. Given the fact that I had already stayed at Encore prior to this visit to Vegas, I knew I would be in for a great disappointment. Obviously you can't compare the two hotels since they are not on the same scale.

The rooms are old and the bathrooms feel like a hospital's bathroom. My clothes and everything in my luggage smelled like the room: musty, old, and just nasty. We got a room on the first floor with a view to the sidewalk as people walked by.

If you're going to Vegas on a budget, then I guess this hotel is good for you. Personally, when I go to Vegas, I like to splurge a little and stay at a nicer hotel. It makes me feel like I am really taking some time off and going on vacation.

Also, this hotel is one of the first ones on the South side of the strip. It is far from everything so bring some walking shoes!

The pool area is gross and the water was cloudy. 

I won't be back even if I come with friends. They can stay here if they want. I will stay at the MGM Signature across the street.",8,6,5

Check-in: not so smooth. It's not cool to go check in and learn that you don't technically have a room guaranteed at 3p check in but sometime between 3-5. This was not okay because we wanted to check in and get to our race. They did have rooms available to check in for additional $10\/night. We went with it because we needed to check in to get ready for race and additional $10 was fine. Just wish it was more clear, and it was booked via Expedia, so maybe not the hotel to blame. 
The updated room: was fine, nothing mind-blowing, good room for the price in Vegas. Pretty big room, 2 queen beds and large bathroom. Was clean. No microwave or refrigerator (additional costs). 
Main floors: casino area was pretty big and standard to other hotels. It did smell of smoke and eyes would burn after awhile. Plenty of food options.

Nowadays, I'm not too crazy about it.  I have not stayed overnight here in over 12 years, but I have been back multiple times just to visit.

The positive things are the following:

1.  It looks like a castle (which is still cool after all these years)
2.  They have the Tournament of Kings (Dinner Show)
3.  The Fun Dungeon (I enjoy playing games)
4.  Room rates are affordable
5.  Nice location

The negative:

1.  The ventilation is awful.  
2.  Casino is more smoke filled than most other places on the Strip
3.  The place needs to be upgraded

Well my fiancé went golfing Thursday morning and took a shower before he left, I woke up to the worst smell ever. It smelt like nair and something burning all at once.

Well of course I tested it, and surprise it was still smelling like death. At this point I'm upset because how has house keeping not noticed this smell. My mother in law walked in on Friday and asked me what that horrid smell was so I told her. Well she was even more upset and concerned about how safe it was to shower. A plumber came on Friday night and said it was the smell of sewage, so im thinking great I was showering in that. He said he just needed to use drain cleaner and everything was fine. Well woke up late sat and had to hurry off to the race track, came back sat to shower and the smell was still there, it actually got worse. I got nauseous everytime a shower was taken due to the smell. I actually was thankful that we had booked a couple of rooms for family, that I ended up showering in another room sun because I just didn't feel clean showering in the sewage smelling water.

I've stayed there 3 different times because the pricing was good for what I needed (but I have stayed at expensive hotels on the strip so I have a good idea of amenities to value ratio). For the price and the amenities you get its worthy to look into, especially if you have kids and you need an easy place for them to hang out at downstairs. 
1. Low cost rooms but clean and everything worked.
2. Security at each tower for your safety. Nice touch and they were friendly too.
3. If you or your kids like arcades, show's with horses, Medieval Castles? Here's your place but don't expect its all magical cause its a bit old. They are trying to fix the place up bit by bit but its a big job and again, its a very low cost in comparison to many strip hotels. The Tournament of Kings is a really fantastic show and a must see for visitors. The hotel offers 2 and 3 for price of 1 deals often which is a great deal.
4. Other cool hotels and shops are within a nice walk (New York, Mandalay, Luxor, MGM, M&M shop, the Arcade Shop (where there are tons of great arcade games), and a few others.
5. The casino floor is nothing original. Its a big place and its not easily marked so you have to get used to where you're at so you know where you're going. Pool area is exceptionally nice when its open.
6. Staff were cool and I had no issues with check in or out. Parking was very good.
7. My daughters are 15 and 18 and they liked Excalibur better than the Luxor, the Flamingo, & the Sahara as far as the lower cost hotels go. Next time we are staying at Planet Hollywood though as we want to be in the center of the strip and willing to pay more.

It is the most confusing place to find where to park. Unless you pull up at the front with all the taxis, you enter at the back and have to haul your belongings through the casino to check in. The line to check in is extremely long so get ready to wait. I suggest check in without your luggage. 

Once we got through that ordeal we rode the elevator to our floor and were greeted by extremely dark and depressing decor. You'll feel like you're in a medieval dungeon that's for sure. Be prepared for smoke even on the non-smoking floors. It's everywhere.

There may have been a gym somewhere. Excalibur has a pretty confusing layout actually despite seemingly being a square.

Without giving the name, he's American and is about 60 to 70 years old. He didn't greet nor smile. I was thinking to myself okay maybe his morning went bad.

So I got out of the line to call my sister so she can call in to see why my name wasn't on the list. She called me back and said that person told her my name WAS on the list. I didn't want to be helped by that man again so I waited in line again. I got helped by a lady this time. I thought to myself okay she looks nice. She's filipino,looks like she's in her late 40's. I walked up to the counter and thought I would get a greeting...and again...nothing. This is when I really thought maybe the whole staff just had a bad morning meeting. Staff room ran out of coffee? Had to come in work early? So many questions running through my head at that moment. I had to shake off those thoughts and get straight to the point. I started the conversation by saying my sister said my name is on the list but that man (I pointed to that American man) said I'm not. She checked her computer and said yes my name is on the list. I then proceeded to pay with cash. She then said no cash and said I had to use the credit card that was on file. I said the credit card on file is my sister's card and she won't be here until midnight. This is when my patience had gone out the window. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what else to say. She didn't offer any other solutions.I also found out she was the MANAGER. I just walked away because I needed to cool off. Five minutes later, I just randomly walked up to a counter that had a lady behind it. She looked mean, but whatever, I was already in a pissy mood. I am proud to mention this staff member name. YELPERS!!! Her name is LUCHIE. She is the best staff member ever. She greeted me! I told her my issue and she fixed it! Got the room keys ten minutes later and never had to deal with the other staff members again. I really wish we can solely base the reviews on a particular staff member...but LUCHIE, I give you 5 stars! Your caring nature was awesome!",0,0,0

When we arrived at the airport we caught the showtime tours shuttle. They dropped us off and picked us up at Excalibur. We arrived on Friday night at 11:00p.m the line at check in was lengthy, but they had several staff, so the line moved quickly. Our room was at the Royal Tower 6th floor. As we walked into our room it was very clean and welcoming, it had a very roomy upright shower. We had reserved a ""run of the house room,"" and ended up in a room with two queen beds. We were totally okay with this, it didn't bother us one bit. House keeping was on point! We didn't use the pools, the slots were cool. We enjoyed a buy one get one free meal at their buffet which we obtained through the My Las Vegas Slots game. The food was good and they had a good selection, they had chile relleno in the Latin section and it was very tasty! This Hotel is family friendly, we didn't go to, but they have an arcade and a variety of shows. Plenty of eateries and a few onsite shops.

With places like the Cosmo, Wynn, and Aria classing things up and doing things to suit a younger crowd, the Excalibur is definitely dates. It seems old and dirtier, and like it caters to the families now. 

But the Excalibur is by no means bad. Its perfectly okay as far as cheep hotels on the strip go. For my non-existent college student budget I'll take a $20 room any day over actually spending money to stay somewhere awesome on the strip. It's worth the walk to and from the castle to stay so cheep on Las Vegas Blvd. 

The rooms are nice sized and really all you need from a room. The casino is okay. The price tho makes it well worth my recommendation.",7,2,1

I would wager that people who post the most favorable reviews of Excalibur began their stay with an expectation of a Motel 6 type of experience.  People who post the worst reviews may have genuinely had a bad experiences, but some could just have some up tight ideosyncracies.  My advice to anyone is READ THE REVIEWS.  I wanted a cheap, clean room without any frills and that's what I got; AND Excalibur has a great location on the Southern end of the strip.  

TIP:  When booking ANY hotel room during a Las Vegas summer, ask that a ""note"" be put in the reservation requesting a Northward-facing room.  Remember, the Sun rises in the East, sets in the West and the last thing you want is a room that is facing the afternoon Sun.  A room facing the North will always be easier to cool in the summer.  It's all subject to the architecture of the hotel, but generally the order of preference is North, East (by noon the sun will be over the hotel and out of your window), South (true South rooms may catch some angle of the sun during the entire day) and lastly West.

Now I always make it a point when dealing with the front desk person at check-in is to kill them with kindness.  Remember, they have probably checked in over 50 people by the time that they've gotten to you.  So if you seem laid-back, make a few jokes and smile, you'd be surprised how willing the front desk person will be willing to make a last minute change or even give you a free upgrade.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  But it never hurts to help them help YOU.   

TIP:  There is a coupon book that EVERYONE gets when checking in at Excalibur.  This book includes a $20 food & beverage credit coupon.  Be wary when booking a deal at Excalibur that mentions a free $20 F & B credit; since everyone receives this at check in try to find a deal that simply offers a better rate.  You'll get the coupon book anyways.

There's been a lot of talk in these reviews about staying in Tower 2 for a better, cleaner, more modern room.  I decided to roll the dice and book the cheaper Tower 1 room; I always had the option to switch\/upgrade later on if I didn't like how the room looked.

The tower 1 room was clean - no smells or odors.  The bed sheets were really white...I'm talkin' either brand new or bleached well.  And they felt as if they had a pretty good thread-count (for those who are into that sort of thing).  No matter what hotel I stay in, I always undo the bedsheets to check for signs of bedbugs - mattress was all clear.  The bathroom was clean - no residue, mold, etc. in the shower or sink.  I will say that the fan vent in the bathroom looked kind of grungy, but that appeared to be the only issue with the room.  TIP:  As for the wired internet, I planned ahead and packed an extra length of 10\/100 ethernet cable & coupler so that I could plug in my laptop and lie on the bed.  

The casino was fun!  Sure it smelled like smoke, but what casino doesn't.  If you've been curious, but intimidated by Craps, check out the 12 Noon craps class.  Sometimes after the craps class has ended they occasionally offer $3 minimum bets for the first hour!

Overall, I had a really good stay at Excalibur in a tower 1 room, but it must really be luck when booking here.  One afternoon, I overheard my neighbor who was coming out of his room and discussing his stay; he stated unequivocally that he ""was never staying here again.""  And this was the room right next to mine!  No rhyme.  No reason.  I didn't ask him to clarify, but he was adamant.  I just don't understand why I had such a positive experience and he didn't.  My final advice to anyone is to just set proper expectations; think of Excalibur like it's Motel 6 with a casino and you will have a blast!",2,1,1

I had a suite at this hotel from August 8th to 11th. Everything was good and clean. I returned for one more night on August 14th and it was awful. To add insult to injury, it was the most expensive night of all. I found chip crumbs on the floor (we hadn't eaten chips so we knew it wasn't ours.) We also found a pistachio shell near the fridge which was missing the bottom panel. The furniture was dusty, there were smudges on the floor and wall of the master bathroom which tells me that it hadn't been cleaned. The toilet also had urine drop stains on the rim, confirming what I suspected.
In the questionnaire Excalibur sent after my stay, I indicated that I wanted a refund for my last night although I'm sure it's common practice to offer a complimentary night stay, if that.

I enjoyed my time in the casino, mostly due to the people I met inside, but our dealers were so fun, energetic, and made us feel comfortable.

The rooms. We had a few people in our group all at the same hotel and the general consensus was they were musty and not very pleasing on the eyes. My argument was we were only going to be in them for a few hours (mainly to sleep) so it wasn't a big deal. When it actually came time for us to sleep, that's where the problems for my room kicked in. It was just my boyfriend and I. We were lying down to go to bed with all the lights off around 1:30 a.m. All of a sudden there was a very loud, long scratch along the top of our wall. Naturally I freaked the fudge out. But neither of us wants to look like a siss, so no one says anything. Less than a minute later there is a knock on the adjoining door. (Our friends are not staying in that room - they were in a separate tower.) 
So we get up, open the hall door and here's nothing. A minute or so later there is another tap on the adjoining door but like, no way we aren't answering. I call the front desk and let them know what kind of creepy business is going on (the whole time this is happening there is also continuous banging on the wall and floor in the adjoining room. Can someone call Detective Benson?!) and they say they will take care of it and just hang up. Rude.
A few minutes go by and the occasional banging is still going on. It's not a steady bang or else I'd be like ""Okay I get it guys. Do y'all thang."" Then - this is almost as creepy as the first scratch - there is a scratch on the wall from one end (the main door) to the other (the window) on the lower part of the wall. WTF!
We called front desk again and said ""Oh yeah, we'll take care of it."" Uh yeah great fine. But they didn't. No one ever came up and knocked on the door next door, we never heard there room phone ring, nothing. And the knocking and scratching continued for almost an hour.

Its not the newest looking place, not the worst.  But it definitely does the job...hence the A-OK.

The best thing I though about Excalibur was the size of casino.  I was presently surprised on how big the casino was and how many gambling tables they had.  They also have a huge area dedicated to poker...if my memory serves correctly...I'm not 100% sure cuz well its vegas.  But yes, the casino is quite large with numerous options.

Additionally, the Excalibur has a pretty good food court as well, having a wide selection of choices.  The downside is that there are not many fancier eateries at this place, but hey can you fault them? Catering to its clientele. 

The CONS: from my experience and reading through some of the reviews, the rooms are definitely, not the best; it is basically what you would expect, or what you see in the pictures.  Just overall..one word = old.

Overall, HEY! I think its a decent choice.  If you are going on a budget but still want to be on the strip with great gambling options, in a great location.  I have a good time when I'm here, so why can't you?  It's what you make of it....",3,0,0

What does race have to do with anything! Then the next thing you know, they called the security over. They made the situation like it was our fault.

Another suspicious thing occurred at this hotel. My family went out around 12pm. I took off the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door so we could get our room cleaned. When I came back at 8pm, our room was not cleaned. We noticed that they took out the trash but didn't clean our room. That means that they came into our room but for other reason than cleaning. We called guest services and asked them to clean our room. Instead of apologizing to us, they questioned us. They said that it must be because we didn't take off the ""do not disturb"" sign or we left the room too late. In fact we did take off the sign and we left the same time as the day before. The day before they cleaned our room, but not today. This hotel practically offers customer service. HORRIBLE. I rather stay at another hotel. People working here ruined the mood. Vegas is suppose to be fun but their service killed the experience. The entire time my family was here, we kept thinking about the bad service. I suggest spending your money elsewhere.

The deal also included $20 food and beverage credit, which can be used at mostly bars, and the one restaurant I saw on there, which was the steakhouse (which is on the pricier side. Look up my review of the steak house at camelot for more info on the coupon there). Also included was a free play at the Dungeon, aka the midway arcade.

The room itself was nice. Spacious enough. The tv is large. There is an ethernet cable for you to plug into your computer for wired internet service. The internet was a bit slow.

- The rooms are still reasonable for the strip, but the current trend in Las Vegas is to tack on a daily ""resort fee"" on top of your hotel bill during your stay.  So, watch out for that...
- The Tower II rooms are revamped and nicer.  Flat panel TV isn't HD, but I didn't care because I don't watch network TV often.

Cons:
- Casino STILL looks the same.
- Timeshare people will constantly bug you (and this is a new thing)

And sleep? Not a wink.. Maybe I should get some rest. Just a short nap to re-charge my batteries......peh! yea right! If im gonna do this thing im gonna do it right!""

To the Excalibur Hotel.  
Thank you for renting me the biggest, nicest, locker I have ever had. You lent me a space to keep my things safe, and shower once in a while. I don't remember if this is true, but my friends tell me there was even a bed in there. Hmm, I wouldn't know. I do, however, vaguely recall an instance that included some nice soft towels too.  Your staff was kind, and their tolerance for a bunch of bumbling, soused curmudgeons, is commendable. Someday when I can piece together the photographic evidence and whiteness accounts, I'll have to tell myself all about it.. thanks again, and may god have mercy on your souls.",5,15,6

Since I've always wanted to try out Excalibur. I've been to a few hotels in Vegas and this by far was the worst. First we check in, as soon as we get to our floor it smelled unpleasant, we head up to our hotel. My fiancé loves having the AC on all night so as soon as we get to our room he goes over to turn it on, we noticed it started making this rattle loud noise. We called front desk and told them we wanted to switch rooms because that was unacceptable and they say ""give us a few minutes were send someone up to check on it"" 40 minutes past and nothing. We called again because it was really inconvenient waiting for them, so they agree to switch our rooms. The other room was a double bed which was a bit bigger, regardless there were multiple stains on the walls and it wasn't as clean as other hotels I've stayed at. Their were even stain on the floor and all along the lobby. I guess that's why Excalibur is so cheap. I do give them 2 stars for their pool, I had a great time there.

Came here this past weekend with a bunch of coworkers to get away from LA and work. There were 8 of us so we got 2 rooms with 2 beds. We chose the smoking rooms since we were lazy and did not want to bother going to the casino to smoke.

Damn! we all got stuffed in the 1st floor of the  casino so pretty much pointless in getting the smoking room. I know smoking rooms are at the bottom of the hotels but at least put us in the 2nd floor! 1st floor has shitty signals for our phones..we were pretty much isolated from the world! 

The room felt like a motel rather than a hotel. Actually I've stayed at better motels compare to this place. There was no ice machine on our side of the hall so, we had to walk across to the other side to get our ice. There was NO i repeat NO coffee maker in the room!! I thought that was pretty standard when staying in a hotel or motel. Although our bathroom was pretty roomy for 4 girls, we had a walk in shower! SMH!

The room was horrible - no blackout curtains on North wall that let light through around the shade (had to prop 5 pillows on one side of the bed to stop light from hitting me in the face), the carpet was stained, there were only 5 hangers, no fridge (knew that ahead of time), the ""pillow-top"" bed is hard as a rock, and the room temperature can never get comfortable because the controls are near the door and the ac\/heat is near the window - by the time the cold reaches the thermostat, it's freezing in the middle of the room where the bed is!

Lastly, the door lock is tricky (Room 21213) and doesn't always read the card right. Had to try 5 times or more to get the card to read (and I was sticking it in correctly).

The crappy buffet that wouldn't be out of place at San Quentin??  No, it's the bars, mainly the Lobby Bar (formerly known as Jester's Lounge until recently).  We've known several of the bartenders there for almost 20 years, and they've become great friends over the years, and they really run a smooth ship and provide a great Vegas experience as you slide into an inebriated state.  The sports book is decent too, a good place to catch an NFL game that you've got a wager riding on.

The hotel itself is serviceable, rates are all over the place, ranging from reasonable to a complete rip if something is going on in town, but that's par for the course all over the strip.

She took my free drink vouchers (2 per day through the resort fee) with pleasure and spent a good 15 minutes searching for a bottle of gin. Also spent a while staring at the cash register before counting out someones change, and then forgot that they were directly behind her. It was one of the most entertaining shows I have seen in Vegas.

Don't get me wrong, I expected my budget-ass stay inside a castle to be this way. Every time I want to reminisce I look at the picture of the view from my room, that includes some broken wooden pallets on gravel next to the employee smoking area. It looked like there had once been a tree, but it was cut down for obvious reasons like being aesthetically pleasing.

I would probably go back for the absurdity.",1,11,0

the room was nice, pretty new. The one thing I would change about it would be the shower head, everything was pretty new and it just didn't seem like they cared much for it. But other than than, it was a pretty nice stay.

if ur main goal in vegas is to eat eat eat, sleep sleep sleep, gamble and more eating, your room might not be of the most importance if your budget is ruled mainly by eating good food. For me: I just wanted a decent place to stay, close to the City Center, without spending a fortune on a room, that i would just use to sleep and shower. We took advantage of booking early to a discount and I spent about $230.00 for a fri-mon stay.

The perks: 
+ Large beds
+ Plenty of towels & bedding upon request
+ Decent pricing
+ Strong AC

- No free wifi! Only an ethernet hookup (booooo)
- Thin walls
- No food amenities\/vouchers with booking
- Rather far from other destinations on The Strip
- Not enough wall outlets
- QUESTIONABLE CLEANING...found some sticky pieces of caramel popcorn between my sheets...gross!

Bottom line -- if you're on a budget, Excalibur can be an acceptable deal. But you must remember to factor in cab fares & driving through traffic if you want to check out other places on The Strip.

I remember the room being basic, but clean and quiet which was nice.

The Excalibur is connected to the New York New York, MGM Grand, Tropicana, Mandalay Bay and Luxor Hotel\/Casinos so it's easy to go from one hotel to the next without having to go down to the strip which  is nice to avoid some of the crowds.

Dining options are semi limited at the Excalibur. The buffet\/cafe is OK and they have the national Buca de Beppo chain which serves average to good Italian food. They do have a really nice food court which I have to give them props for. I really enjoy the Krispy Kreme that is there, and I really wanted to try the Schlotzsky's Deli which has a small stand as well. They also have a Yogurtland which is my favorite yogurt place.

It even seems they have the same carnival games as they did almost 15 years ago. We played a few of them and we won my son a few stuffed animals. My brother and I used to play those games where you drop your quarter in the slot and it is supposed to knock other quarters off the ledge. Well, most of those were not working or taped up so you could not play them. My son liked the huge Sponge Bob thing in front of the 4D ride they have now. My son really seemed to like it down there. Since my mom lives in Vegas we will probably bring him back when we are in town. But, that would be the only reason we go back to that run down hotel.

Also, after contacting guest services for an additional pillow and clean towels, it took them two hours to bring us towels. and the lady who answered was offly rude about not having ""softer"" pillows, when I asked for just an additional she seemed rather annoyed. I also purchased my room with an addition buffet for two if I stayed for a minimum of two nights(I stayed for four), they never gave me the breakfast that was suppose to come with my room, and I actually had to pay for our buffet entry.

Here's my take: 

Pros: 

*Good price for busy weekend. I originally booked this hotel for close to $700 for three nights due to March Madness, but Excalibur offers a great price match deal if you book through their website. (I think Luxor might offer the same deal). I booked the hotel through their site and then found a cheaper advertised price on Otel.com. I sent in a claim form (kind of a pain of a process, but worth it) and Excalibur beat Otel's price and offered me 10 percent off as well for finding the better deal. I ended up getting the hotel for about $107 a night before resort fees and tax. Good deal, especially for such a busy weekend. They were advertising upwards of $250 a night for Friday and Saturday. Note: Make sure you read all the rules of the price match before you book and that you give yourself enough time to cancel if Excalibur denies your claim. You can cancel within 48 hours for a full refund. 

*Good location. This hotel is close to lots of dining and fun. It's connected to Luxor and not far from Mandalay Bay and a host of other hotels. It makes for a good home base. 

*Clean and spacious room. Ours was recently renovated

Cons:

*Weird smell. I can only imagine what goes on in some of these casino hotel rooms. Our room had a weird mustard smell that we couldn't seem to get rid of. 

*Hard beds. Definitely not the most comfortable around.

*No conditioner. This is for the ladies. I had to go buy some. I hate when hotels give you the 'conditioning shampoo'. That stuff sucks. I think if I'm paying more than $100 a night, the hotel should provide both shampoo and conditioner. 

*The fees. This is not a specific issue with Excalibur because all Vegas hotels now charge a 'resort fee'. This is, of course, just another way of tacking an additional $15-25 onto your bill daily.  All the hotels do it so they can get away with it. So, even though we got the hotel for $107 a night, we paid $420 total with the fees and taxes. That's an additional $100 tacked onto the trip.  Ridiculous. Again, you'll find this with most hotels so just consider that when booking so you're not surprised at check-in. It bugs me that the hotel can advertise one rate, and keep those fees hidden in small print because it really is a significant boost in price. Just be aware that those fees do exist and the tax is super high.",4,0,2

She mentioned that there was indeed a mail drop -- outside. I'm like WTF? Please put up a sign! Jeez.

So that's it. Good price, good location. I'm sure someday I'd like a more bougie and upscale Vegas experience but then I'll have to pay big bucks for that. Ah, I can dream!",2,1,0

The first room they gave us was in tower 1 and the entire floor smelled of pee and it was the last room on the floor, facing a corner wall. I reserved a king size bed and there were two queen size beds. We didn't even sit down. We went immediately downstairs and complained and they immediately changed our room to a king size bed room with a better view. The bed had what looked like blood on the top sheet and I asked the cleaning lady who was cleaning the room next door to change it and she quickly did. She was very nice. The problem remains is that the entire tower 1 needs to be renovated. It is the equivalent to a run down motel 6. When making my reservations it didn't say what tower the room was in and this is the first time we have ever stayed at the Excalibur so I didn't know there was a difference. I'm going to see if we can change rooms again to tower 2. Not sure if there are any available seeing this is a weekend. This is the worst hotel as far as upkeep I have ever stayed here in Vegas.

Prices for rooms are usually on the cheaper side which is nice. The place is outdated which doesn't bother me and I guess over the last year the hotels got rid of the charge to check in early so that's nice.

My low-score review comes from 1. I need water - it's a necessity. I don't mind drinking water from the bathroom sink but the water tasted like the smell of the hotel. Musty. Then if you want to buy water you're paying $4.50 for a $1.50 bottle of water. So you run out of options for fresh water.

2. It's end of October so the two bigger pools are closed. All that was open was the ""spa pool"" which is a smaller pool with two hot tubs and that was filled with children (even the hot tubs) or you could pay extra money for the ""adult pool."" Sorry I just paid a few hundred dollars to stay here I'm not shelling out extra money for a pool that should already be included! So my husband and I couldn't swim.

3. The TV doesn't seem to be ready to go. I think you need to call the service desk. I don't want to deal with them. I tried to watch some local channel and it was really bad quality and eventually turned off onto some hotel-run ad. Not sure why television isn't included.

Also, the people that try to get you to do the time share thing - that needs to stop. A friend warned me about them before my first trip to Vegas last year but we were barely in the door after a 5-hour flight and those assholes are already on us before we could even check in!!! Then three more are up in our faces harassing us from the checkout counter to the elevator. It's a small plane you don't need that many swindlers. We haven't even checked out yet but I'm so annoyed at not being able to get water or go swimming I decided to leave a review now.

The hotel is nothing like the pictures posted. Instead of a 3 star hotel, it should be a 1 star hotel. The line was very long for check in even though we started it at 1pm, way before 3pm check-in time. They adviced us to keep doing the line because that line was ""not a line"", they said that at 3pm, the line goes up to the entrance, which is kind of ridiculous, which could mean up to 100-150 people in front of you. We did get our room early, but the room was terrible. Honestly, I've stayed at hostels that are better than this crappy hotel. There were no comforters on the bed, just bed sheets and a silk sheet that was used as the comforter. Our ""view"" from our window was a white wall, which was from a building next door. The window was covered by a screen (like those used for projectors at school) which unfortunately made it very bright, and the curtains went sideways up to each side of the projector screen) meaning that the curtains didnt even cover the screen and the window. We had to use the silk sheet to cover the projector screen window. I wish I wouldve taken pictures to better illustrate that. Needless to say, the AC unit was the loudest and oldest unit Ive ever seen in my life. Excalibur needs to invest in some renovations. Location is okay if you are willing to walk. I could say that the bathroom was really spacious but nothing fancy. I think thats the only good thing I could say about the hotel room. Dont stay here. Invest on something better for a few more bucks. We will not be staying here. Even tropicana rooms are better. This has been the worst hotel room Ive ever stayed at.

Of course, I knew this wasn't a five star hotel, however it is not even a ""you get what you pay for hotel,"" as it is pretty common to have a coffee maker, mini fridge and microwave in your room now a days - at the very least a coffee maker. This place had none of those and it is an extra $22 dollars to rent one per night.

From the minute we walked into the resort, everything was pretty basic. The restaurants were all fast food, except a ""Dick's Last Resort,"" ""Johnny Rockets"" and the Excalibur Buffet. We ate one meal, late night, from the hotel at the food court and it was not very good. As for the rooms, there are basically two queen-sized beds, a TV and your bathroom. Nothing impressive about it. The pool was nothing special and not worth the $22 per night amenity fee.

I was also extremely disappointed by the customer service. I've worked a long time in the service industry as a server, etc. so customer service is pretty important to me, especially when you are on vacation, the one thing I want is for people to be nice to me. When we tried to check-in there was a very long line and I had a question, so I went to the bell desk, who refereed me to the concierge, who referred me to another line. Every person made me feel like I was wasting their time. We were also barraged with ""free tickets for shows"" opportunities and the help also tried to get us to sign up for their time share. We were stopped literally every five feet. I know this is part of what Las Vegas does, but Excalibur did it BY FAR AND AWAY the most and it was to the point it was annoying.

It's definitely a budget hotel, so keep that in mind. If you need a cheap place to stay on the strip, Excalibur does a decent job, but don't expect 5 star amenities because you won't find them here. 

I booked a standard tower room. The room itself was not impressive. It looked pretty old, but at least the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was kind of nasty looking. The toilet seat even had some yellow stains that I had to clean off, which was disgusting. I'm not sure how housekeeping could have missed those! The internet is only wired though, and there is only one cord, which could be a nuisance for some.  

The casino is pretty good if you're looking for low minimum tables. I played a lot of penny slots and had good luck with those. The crowd is a mix of people on college\/20 year olds budgets and some families. (I guess the castle theme is the closest to Disneyland on the strip. Dad can gamble and mom can see Thunder Down Under while the kids are entertained at the arcade). 

The resort fee does include a $20 credit at bars in the Excalibur and the Luxor, so you can kind of get your money's worth. The pool area is surprisingly pretty nice and large, considering that the rest of the resort looks pretty run down. I only ate at the food court, which had a good selection. 

The location of the hotel is pretty good though. You can even take the Westcliff Airport Express if you don't feel like taking a cab from the airport. Only $2!

We expected a fun medieval experience, since we chose the hotel modeled after a castle.  We did not receive a fun medieval experience.  The only thing medieval at this hotel is the general castle-like exterior facade.

My main reasons why we did not have a good time are as follows:
1. Too many people smoking in the hotel.  If you want to allow people to poison themselves while gambling, set up a sealed off smoking lounge.  Allowing people to force everyone around them (including your employees) to breath in their poisons is the same as saying that you do not care at all about your customers.

2. The valet was the worst I've ever seen (very rude, slow, lazy, and inefficient).  The first time we tried to use them, I sat in the valet line for 20 minutes without seeing a single valet.  The second time, I was berated by the rude valet for pulling into the guest lane before they told me to.  When I picked up my car, they refused to charge it to my room, then stood around in their booth chatting for about 10 minutes before going to get our car.  Horrible!

3. Realistically, there was no security.  We were in and out of our room throughout the day and night.  We say a security guard checking room keys at the elevator once, on the last night we stayed there.  When we did pass that guard, they asked for our room key, I flashed them the first card I thought was it, from my wallet, to which they then glanced back down at their phone (? maybe a book).  Turns out the card I pulled out was my M-Life card, not my room key.  They never even checked out names or anything.  I could have found a room key on the ground.  Either way, I could just go on the weekends, when there is no security.

4. Too many people pestering guests, trying to get them to go look at time-shares.  That is extremely bad for business.

5. It was rather sad that they wanted guests to pay extra to be able to enjoy a pool that was not crowded with unruly kids.  Those kids should have been the ones that had to pay to use a segregated pool.  It's Vegas, not Disney!

6. The spa constantly advertises a couples massage.  When I went to reserve one for my wife and I, I was told that they do not do them anymore, and that I had to go to the Luxor if I wanted to get one.  Aside from being extremely disappointing, that is false advertising.

7. Everything was overpriced in the Excalibur stores; but, I guess that is to be expected.  The worst part was that I could not buy a coke anywhere in the hotel.  Seriously?  Pepsi products only???  People actually drink that?

8. Johnny Rockets was a hotel fast food joint...  Not much to say, the food was under par for a Johnny Rockets (as expected).  And, everything was overpriced (also, as expected).

9. Gambling at the tables and slots was fine, until someone sat down next to me smoking.  I did not pay to sit around and breath in poisonous gases.

My suggestions:
1. Get rid of the smoking in the hotel!  
2. Get some security at the guest elevators, like all the other hotels have.
3. Fire your valet staff.  And, then go watch the free valet at the Stratosphere.  They were actually running from car to car.

The two star rating is only due to the front desk and the concierge, even though they could not get us show tickets.  The concierge price was about 50% higher than the list price on the websites.  Very odd.

I started to go out and gamble one night but fell asleep reading my kid Winnie the Pooh at bedtime and never made it. So right there you know if our perspectives mesh.

Booked this hotel because I read it was family\/kid friendly and still on the Strip (plus it was cheap) and figured we'd give it a spin. Consider it spun. 

The positive: it does seem to be fairly kid friendly for a Strip motel.

What's that you say? Like saying fairly lung friendly for a non-filter cigarette? Yes, you have a point.

Also, it's fairly inexpensive. I can't think of one that was less. 

Lastly location, location, location. Good location. oh, ok - and the check in lady was nice.

Now for what I really think when I'm not trying to be mature:

1) I' incensed over the $5.99 transaction fee at the ATM.
2) Yes, you can print your boarding passes. That'll be $7 for ten minutes on the internet please.
3) room is OK. I've had as good in very small towns in the middle of nowhere.
4) In the midst of having my four year old on the bridge getting his little brain dazzled by the blinking lights I thought to myself -why am I doing this? He was as happy playing tractors in the room.
5) how did I just spend $28 at a Baja Fresh in the hotel for a tummy ache? (two - his and mine)

Which is the point. There are at least a few hotels within a mile of the that do not charge that absurd ""resort fee"" have a much calmer vibe, better food, a much cleaner pool with less crowding and for less money. Which is what I should have done this time. And will do next time.

The M Life VIP check in was quick and we got to bypass the long reservations line because we had M Life comps. 

Now the not so excellent side...resort fees supposedly include all your necessities that a resort would cover. This hotel did not have wifi in the rooms. They charge an additional $20 per day on top of room fees (though our room was comped we still had to pay the resort fees). The wifi in the lobby was very limited and seating in the area was limited as well. They do have a few computers that you can purchase internet access on for .50 per minute!! wow, shouldn't that at least be free to hotel guests? They do include free long distance calls from the room but these days most people have a cell phone and a laptop and would rather have wifi than free long distance. As a person who travels for business\/pleasure wifi is a must!!

It would also be great if there were NON smoking sections in a casino where so many people with children walk through the area to get to the shops and rooms.

I was in town to see Michael Bublé, not really a Vegas person and don't even gamble to speak of, but go up once in awhile for a concert and have stayed at New York, Luxor, Monte Carlo and several others. I like the Excalibur for two reasons: Price and location, location, location! My room was in Tower 1 and it looked and smelled fresh. I didn't encounter any rude staff or see dirt anywhere and last I checked I am not deaf, blind or stupid. I had a great view and my only negative is no wi fi in the rooms at this hotel, just in the public areas. Crazy! But hells bells, it was cheap! You can spend the money you save elsewhere! I am just not that impressed with big fat casinos all trying to out lavish each other. I like old, classic hotels and Excalibur is kind of generic, but you aren't going to find old, classic digs in Vegas, it!s all about the glitz. It is nice to waltz through some of the fancy casinos just like the rest of the peasants but not be stuck with a huge bill so yay for me and yay for Excalibur! 3 stars for my room and an extra star for the hotel's great location. BTW, another reviewer complained about a rude waitress, if you visit Dick's Last Resort you had better do some research, the wait staff is supposed to insult you. I first heard about Dick's in Chicago and the word on the street is you should be insulted if they don't insult you.

Check in\/registration was a nightmare. Long, depressing, inefficient line. Not want you want to deal with after a long flight. Please don't include your generic: you get what's available response. That will make matters worse. Not appreciated. 

The ""renovated"" room I was (Royal Tower) in does not appear to have been renovated in a decade. The TP holder was rusted over. A roll was shoved in there so you couldn't even dispense the sandpaper tissue provided. The shower head was full of green calcium build up. There was a nasty looking stain in the shower. I wore flip flops to be safe. There was only one pillow on one of the beds. I asked housekeeping for another pillow twice but didn't receive one. Wifi never worked. Room was smokey, walls were paper thin so you can hear all the neighboring guests. Other rooms drunk dialing in the middle of the night. 

No interest in the pool. 

Water bottle in the hotel is $3-$4 dollars. This was the most egregious in my opinion. The food options are terrible and overpriced. 

The casino is dark, smokey, and very outdated. They have the nerve to charge a $30 resort fee for this dump.  No refrigerator in the room. No amenities. Just extra fees for basic services. There are several hard sell employees for timeshare tours around the hotel. Disgusting practice by this filthy, money hungry, poorly managed hotel. Harassing you every time you pass them in the hotel several times a day. 

I do not recommend. Even Circus Circus is a better option if you are looking for a budget hotel. Pay a little more and avoid a frustrating vacation at a rip off ""resort"" you plan your hard earned vacation days and money for. 

Please do not provide me with a generic response like you have with the other reviews. They are condescending and insulting. Management clearly has no interested in making this a nice hotel.

And you don't want to shell out for Bellagio or MGM.

And you don't want to stay at the no-tell motel where you have to wonder - is that stain on the sheet spaghetti sauce? blood? other bodily waste?

You get the picture. 

Well, then Excalibur is the place for you. The Vegas version of a medieval castle, they captured the ""dark that no sunlight can penetrate"" quality that is no doubt quite authentic. However, it is also quite centrally located. I had a conference at MGM and Excalibur was literally across the street, which made my life easy. I'm a walker, so I traveled up and down the Strip on foot, but if you don't want to trek so extensively,  you can easily catch the Monorail at MGM. Also, Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay are all connected by shuttle and escalators so you can wander among three casino\/hotels for the price of one! 

The rooms are budget but the cost is budget, too. The beds are clean and reasonably comfortable. There is no desk but the table with chairs is suitable for work. The bathroom is large enough, with a roomy shower stall. (No bathtub, so if that's really important to you, there you go. You'll have to shower.) Personally, my biggest gripe was no WiFi (really?) and being constrained by wired Internet. I felt like I'd been transported back to 2005. Otherwise, my room left me with no complaints. 

There are some okay restaurants and shows (the joust is fun and they have the Thunder from Down Under if you're looking to check out a different kind of sword fight) but even if you're not into what Excalibur has to offer, the location makes up for it. Seriously, just go to any one of the myriad of entertainment options within a very short walking distance. 

Overall, Excalibur is what you probably expect it to be. It's not luxurious. People crazy enough to bring children to Vegas often stay there. It's a little old and tired and depressing (especially in the casino section) but it is what you're probably looking for if you're scouring reviews about this establishment: a convenient, relatively clean and safe place to crash on the Vegas Strip.",2,1,1

I loved that we could access the Luxor via the indoor walkway. The late night hours of Krispy Kreme were also greatly appreciated. In terms of food options, donuts were the only thing I tried. Most of their options include fast food options and more family friendly places. The Champagne Brunch Buffet was decent for the price but we waited an extremely long time to get seated.

After all, the castle motif looks like the entrance to Fantasyland.  Once inside, you go from Disney to dismal.

This hotel has been around for a while and is showing its age.  Upon checking in, I was informed we would be charged a $9.95 ""resort fee""  that included a free newspaper, use of the fitness center, a reduced rate facial and massage as well as free internet usage.  To get the newspaper you had to walk down to their mini-store to retrieve it and show the coupon.  We all have internet use on our phones or Ipad so never needed their connection.  A facial--hardly!  The bottom line, we didn't use any of these and were still charged for them.  

The elevator entrance reeked of a less than sanitary odor. Upon entering the room, we noticed the hall light didn't work, there was no soap, and we had trouble getting the lamps to work.  The furniture appeared to be left-overs from the Clinton years, the beds were too soft, and the room cramped. Also, no coffeemaker or microwave.

The cleaning people did the minimal.  One day they didn't even come to touch up the room.  At 12 am, we had to call housekeeping just to get some clean towels and additional soaps and shampoo.

Took my daughter down to the arcade.  Hardly high-tech fun.  She blew $20.00 on a couple of games, turned in her tickets for some 99 Cent Store-type prizes and pledged never to come back again.

It was just ""okay""..definitely nothing special.  The reason we booked it was because of the price..which we soon learned why.  

Pros:
- It is connected to Luxor which was great since we went to LAX and the Titanic Exhibit.
- It was the only hotel on the strip that I actually won some money when playing the machines! (But, then again, I lost all of my winnings there too...)  
- The beds were comfy (we stayed in Tower 1, floor 12)
- Nice showers
- Thunder From Down Under (great show! Best part of the hotel!)

Cons:
- Being hassled the SECOND we walked in the door with our luggage..first by two guys that made you think were from the Thunder Show (they were not), then by people trying to get you to go to shows.  EVERY time I walked by them my entire trip, they hassled me..LEAVE US ALONE!
- The outlet fried my super expensive hair straightner. I later heard from other people they had the same thing happen...please be careful plugging in things!!
- The restaurants there are just mediocre.  Nothing special at all. When we got in at 3 in the morning once, the only thing open in the entire place was McDonalds and they were only accepting cash.  I thought more things would be open late...I didn't understand that at all. 
- The hotel room itself was VERY outdated.  Wallpaper falling off of the walls, an AC unit you'd see at a Super 8, no complimentary waters, creepy light fixtures.
- The line to check in was SUPER long.  It was the week of the CES convention, maybe they should get extra staff there for something like that?  
- At the end of the strip.  Next time I go to Vegas, I will be staying somewhere more centrally located.  It's definitely worth the extra cash to stay in the middle compared to the end.
- The $15 per day resort fee is RIDICULOUS.  You don't get any extra amenities...no coffee makers, no free breakfast, no WIFI (there is a router to hook your computer to, doesn't accommodate for 2013 with smart phones and tablets), the only thing is they cleaned our room everyday, but that is what you pay for to begin with.  That fee is unnecessary. 

All in all..did I enjoy my experience there? Meh.  It was okay.  Compared to all of the other hotels we went to on the strip, this was definitely on the low side of luxury.  Will I stay there again, probably not.  If you are trying to decide if you are going to stay here or not, if another place on the strip is a few bucks more..go there.",0,0,0

It was two queen beds per room, the bathroom was decent but no tub :(

My in laws room was the worst! It was the same exact room as ours but they woke up the next morning with no light! Had to shower with the door open because of that issue. I just thank God we didn't stay in the same room lol

They were constantly having to go back to the front and stand in line time after time to get new cards because the card reader on the room was not working. It was such a hassle having to waste your vacation time on having to do that.

The room had a King Size bed, large flat screen TV, large bathroom (shower stall, no tub) with hair dryer), table and chairs, and ethernet powered internet access.

The bed was very comfortable, we had no problem sleeping and woke refreshed with no pain.  

There were no problems with the room at all.  It was cozy with enough room to mill about, stash our suitcases, sleep comfortably.  The rumor is that the contemporary rooms (renovated) are in Tower II.  I wasn't expecting spectacular decor since we did not choose a contemporary room.  Aside from the carpet (not bad) and the drapes (a tad dated, but it is a medevil castle), the room felt very modern with an updated bedspread, comfy chairs and newer furniture.

We experienced a repair man that came to our room because someone called with a broken air conditioning unit and gave them our room number on accident.  (But hey props to them for wanting to fix it immediately, too bad it was the wrong room.)

The only issue was that the internet worked rather sporadically.  Even when connecting by ethernet cable it was hard to get it to work, it often said there was no connection.... this wasn't our laptop error either as it has never happened before or since.  

We DID NOT get bed bugs despite the many reviews that mention them.

We were perfectly happy.  This is a great hotel if you need to save money somewhere and don't mind a no-frills room.  I will certainly consider this on my next visit as well.",1,0,0

I am a big fan of the MGM Properties and I am an elevated Member of the Mlife Players Club, so when I was told I could get an upgraded room here at the Excalibur for basically next to nothing.  I just had to jump on it.

Big Mistake.

Amenities that were promised in the suite were not there, had to call for it but never got there.  Part of the cabinet in the sink was broken, even had the house keeping supervisor come and take a look at it, and she said she'd call engineering on Day 1.  On Day 3 when I left still broken.  A\/C didn't work either, the controls had ran out of battery so I called guest service to fix it.  Apparently they took the controls off the wall, and then cracked open the protective case for the AC unit, then and only then could I control the AC unit.

The facility itself is a bit rustic, but I mean I guess it goes with the theme.  The cleanliness of it when I went down to gamble on the floor and on the sports book, well you can tell it's been wiped down, but nothing had been scrubbed.

We planned 8 months prior, since I checked my school schedule. Just so happened the weekend we ended up going, so many events were happening, such as the Guns N Roses concert, Pacquiao vs Bradley fight and our friends wedding. We originally had no plans and just want to wing it when we arrive. My trip to Las Vegas is long overdue; many years passed since my last visit. There are so many changes! When we finally got to the hotel after our late flight through the rain and the car rental place, we pulled up to see if we can get valet parking. The valet parking lot sign said full. We were greeted by the Bell Hop who took our bags. He hooked us up with the valet attendant and we were able to get our car valeted. Leaving San Diego in the rain to go to Vegas in 73 degree weather at 10pm was interesting. We ended up bringing the rain with us to Vegas. It rained the whole weekend we were there. We went to the registration desk to check in. After waiting in line with a few families ahead of us, I noticed the line got bigger after us. We just made it in a nick of time! We were able to get our room on the 2nd floor. The view from our room was of the Pyramid and street. We kept our curtains closed. Once we got settled in the room and had our bags delivered, we walked around the casino area. The person who checked us in mentioned to sign up for an M Life players card. This card will give your perks on discounts and play credits once you earn enough points. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We were famished the first night we arrived. We ate a one of their restaurants inside the hotel. It was a little late when we discovered that there were other restaurants on the second level of the casino. When you make a purchase at participating restaurants within the hotel, save your receipt to get credit on your M Life card. Our first night at the hotel wasn't too bad. Our room was nice, but the shower head pressure in the bathroom was very low, so it took a little longer to take a shower. Although valet always seemed full, they managed to take care of their hotel guests and provide parking. Their valet guys are friendly and on point, when it comes to remembering their hotel guests. Our second night at the hotel turned out to be a little crazy. As I was in a deep sleep, my friend was woken up by two bickering girls in the room next to us, between 5am-6am. Not good! I woke up when I heard her pick up the room phone right next to me. She waited awhile to see if the noise level would go down. Since it didn't, she called the front desk to complain that our neighbors were being too loud. They sent security up to check it out. By that time, the noise level went down and not a peep came out of that room. The security guard was helpful and friendly. He said to call back if it happens again. Approx 30 min later, they were at it again. Another phone call to the front desk. Security came up the second time and actually heard them raise their voices. He knocked on their door to tell them to tone it down. They apologized and agreed, so we thought it was taken care of. I tried to go back to sleep. My friend was riled up, she ended up going downstairs in the casino to play. I couldn't sleep, because 10 minutes later, they were at it again. After my friend returned from the casino, she called the front desk one last time to see if we can be moved to a different room. They were accommodating and provided us a room on the 28th floor. This room was on the same side with a better view and the shower head pressure was so much better. Our last night there felt more like a nice, calm and relaxing vacation. Too bad we couldn't feel like that the whole weekend of our stay. I was able to accumulate some M Life points to put toward our room.

Here are a few things to be aware of before you book a room at the Excalibur:

1. Wear shoes! The carpet is FULL of hair. I had a blister bandaid on, and it picked up enough hair to weave a wig.

2. Check the MATTRESS!!! We do anyway for bedbugs, but we did not expect to find a URINE stained mattress.

3. We were switched to a new room after we encountered the pee bed. The next room was the one covered in hair, and also featured crusted boogers on the (clearly) unwashed blanket.  This was the blanket you're intended to sleep with, not the top cover. 

4. The towels were old and stained, and the room itself was furnished with items that a thrift store would probably reject.

She told me that there was no rooms available but that if I pay $20 I could get a room right now. WTF!! I have arrived at other hotels around the same time and never been scammed like that before. So I decide to pay the $20 and wait. Got to the counter and my room wasn't available so they gave me a room that was supposedly the same but then figured out that it wasn't. Ended up getting a pool Cabana for Sunday. The pool area was filthy, cigarette buds all over the ground, couch pillows had stains as well as the lounge chair pillows. When the Cabanna host opened our cabana there was trash everywhere. She quickly picked up the trash and apologized. So again, u get what you pay for.",0,0,0

I knew there had to be a catch! dang it. 
But all in all still a great deal. Its on the corner of Trop & LV Blvd. right across from MGM Grand, NYNY and Tropicana. CANT beat the location. 

CASINO: I had an old friend come into town taht was staying @ the hooters hotel - so we got this room the first night they wer ein town. We had so much fun here mostly b\/c of Casino wars. They fell in love w\/ that game. Ive lived in LV for over a year and managed to still never play the tables, can you believe it? NEVER. well I finally played and the lady NAMED KAREN was the rudest table person I've ever encountered or met. OMG she was so freakin rude to me. but nice to the young white guy -not being racial but sexual. Poor lady I pity her. She yelled b\/c I had my cell phone faced down, she yelled b\/c I had my cell fone faced up. she yelled b\/c I put it in my bra. (what do you want me to do with my dang phone lady? I dont have a purse to put it in.)  then she yelled at me b\/c about a mm of my chip was not in the designated circle. Really? 
she yelled, "" it needs to be put in the center of the circle or you cant play!"" 
wow. we took her for another $50 each (my bf and I ) and cashed out . what a wickedly ugly person. I hope that hotel knows what kind of Monster Karen is - @ casino wars @ 10pm on 11\/14\/10. 

HOTEL: now for the hotel. It was a cheaper room sO i wasnt expecting much but they had no bathtubs in the hotel, only showers so it was that sliding door business. Yuck. I was reluctant to shower there since I live in town but I wanted to wash the smell of smoke off me before leaving.. and maybe I could make it out to my car without reaking again.

Parking:  Its free but there is no connection from the parking garage to the hotel - this is strange b\/c I'd never been to a casino that didnt have this connection with the exception of excalibur and the luxor. 

BEST part of this hotel is that it connects to Mandalay Bay and the Luxor without having to go outside at all, esp. when its cold\/rainy outside. be sure to cross on the 2nd floor.",3,1,1

The front desk staff was nice, but the lady we had was new and her supervisor was monitoring her the entire time. There was 20 of us in line but only 2 people checking you in which was annoying but hey sometimes you have to be patient. The only thing I hated was the people in the hotel begging you to sign up for free shows\/promotions. It was so annoying they kept asking are you 25 and up. Advice just lie and say no. I almost gave them 4 stars because of that, but I'm pretty sure they are working off commission and its their job, but I literally got asked 5 times each day I was at Excalibur. Hotel was clean, no funny smell, they have a bomb gift shop across from Krispy Kreme and the slushy place. Cheap souvenirs. Another issue is that they had 3 pools,but only 1 open everyone was crowded in one pool made me think about community\/ymcas pool.

A cheap room with one of the best locations on the strip.  You're directly connected to NYNY, Tropicana, MGM Grand, Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  You don't get the fancy amenities of the higher end places, but if you're looking for a clean place to crash and not spend a lot of money on lodging- this is it.

The smoke in the casino might be a little worse than newer or higher-end places, but it's really not that bad.  People just have to face it- a lot of people in casinos smoke.  It's like complaining that they serve booze.  The only real negative I can say is that the beds are rather uncomfortable.

The air conditioner is a floor unit (not sure how to describe it), which sits in a cabinet by the window.  It's fairly loud, which can be distracting.

The rooms are outdated but comfortable. We slept well in the beds, and the rooms were fairly quiet. 

Below are some quick notes:

Pros:
-Gambling: The casino has a good variety of games, and it's not crowded enough that you can't find a table\/ slot machine 
-Food: There are several quick places in the hotel to eat 

Cons:
-Location: Its at the end of the strip, so you will be doing quite a bit of walking or driving
-Parking:  The hotel recently started charging for parking, and it is a complete disaster. Valet refused to park our car because they were full. I feel like hotel guests should take priority. We drove around for a long time until we found the only parking spot in the lot, parked, then carried our luggage into the hotel. We had to Uber everywhere because we were scared that we wouldn't find a spot later if we drove ourselves. 
-Bathrooms: The bathrooms are very outdated. Our shower door wasn't secure and could barely shut. The shower floor was very slick, which is dangerous. Lastly, there was mold growing in our shower. 
-Housekeeping: (Not sure if this was our room or all rooms) There is no placard to hang on the door to let housekeeping know you are in there, so they tried to come in every day while we were still asleep.",2,0,0

Thin Walls.
Kid-Friendly (which isn't necessarily a problem just something to consider)

We usually stay at the MGM Grand but they were all booked for conventions. We looked for a place to stay and decided on here because of the price being around $560 for the week. 
When we got here their luckily was no line and they told us the wait for a room would be about two hours. I was a little bummed but I understood because it was after all only 8 in the morning. They instructed us to drop off our bags at the bellhop which we did and they took them in a secured room. We walked around for about a half an hour and I decided to get back in line. My fiancée and I while in line noticed the gentleman who helped us at the front desk called us over and upgraded us at no cost to the 27th floor and it was a newer room and in tower 1. I was a little anxious because I had read bad reviews on tower 1. 
Well when we got to our room it was very clean! It smelled clean and it was very modern and updated. The bathrooms were a tad outdated but it outdid my expectations. I did my usual check for bedbugs and found nothing but clean sheets. The beds were very comfortable and we had a somewhat decent view. We didn't care too much knowing we were just in the room to sleep and get ready. 
Overall, I give the room a job well done. And the staff a job well done also. The hotel maids cleaned the rooms every night and were very friendly and also everyone at the front desk.

They apparently clean there carpets outside everyday at around 10:30am. On top of this we ended up going to dicks last resorts which is a bar to those of you that don't know. Just as an FYI if your going to vegas on a budget like I was, make this one of your stops good food, and great priced drinks. Now enough about the positive of this hotel lets talk about the negatives.
 
1. There was no fridge not a big deal but would of come in handy since we had drink. 

2. It is pretty freaking far from the strip and if you are going to go out drinking and none of you want to be DD  a taxi will run you from $4.00 - $16.00 

3. You are near the airport and from what I heard if your in tower 1 you hear a lot of noise. I didn't have this problem since I was staying in tower 2.

We stayed here with our three kids. We were able to affordably stay here and get two adjoining rooms so we had space. We stayed in Tower 2. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It was very quiet and we were not disturbed by anyone walking in the halls late at night. The view was amazing out of our room, which faced the strip. We were able to stay here for $39\/night on TripAdvisor. What a bargain. You do make some sacrifices for that though....

The hotel does not have Wi-Fi. Granted I can use my 3G and don't really need it, but it's so common nowadays, they should offer it. There is no in-room coffee makers. There are no spare pillows, you'll have to call for them. No in room refrigerator. 

The only reason I docked a star was for the valet service. It was a joke. When we arrived on our first day the line for valet service was one hour long. It took the guys so long to get people out of their cars and moving. There was only one line too. It was very frustrating. On an alternate time, we showed up back at the hotel to valet park our car (which we had done for the prior 3 days) only to be greeted by a sign saying ""VALET FULL"". Really?!? I have never seen that, especially for current guests. The up side was that we realized that garage parking was not that bad and if we'd have known about it, we'd prefer to park our own car in the future. Go figure.

The room was very mediocre. The air conditioner smelled moldy. The showerhead was caked in minerals to the point that more than half of the water dripped or ran down the wall. 

Some jerk pulled the fire alarm in the middle of the night and the fire alarm was alarmingly ambiguous. It was a loud buzzer with a voice saying stay calm, we are investigating this. Investigating what? I complained to a manager the next morning who said it was a false alarm. I was offered a late checkout but it was obvious with my suitcases that I was already out. I wish they had personally apologised in the hallway at the time.

Several of my friends stayed here as well with a total of 4 rooms booked. We decided to stay here because we purchased tickets to Thunder From Down Under (amazing show). 

I booked two rooms. A resort strip view queen ( for my sister and her friend) and a Royal superior king( for my boyfriend and I). It was a great deal and a lot cheaper than most hotels on the strip.

Spent 30 minutes checking in which was not bad and receptionist was nice. The rooms were clean on arrival. Housekeeping needs some improvement there were dirty cups left on the tables the next day. Didn't smell like they had cleaned but overall okay. 

Like I said the show was amazing. The hotel has various dining options. We dined at the food court on the first night so we wouldn't miss the show and it was good. The second day we ate at the Italian restaurant and it was amazing.

On the day of checkout we were in a rush gathering our belongings in order to check out at the 11am time. I owned a black and stainless steel make-up box. Without overstating I had about 1200$ worth of makeup in it. Including my entire Kylie Cosmetic and MAC Collection. We left in such a hurry that I forgot the box on top of the table located inside the room. I was 30 minutes away from Los Angeles when I noticed I had forgotten it in my room. I immediately contacted the hotel and they directed me to file an online lost and found form. The form indicated that they would contact me when the item was recovered.

Fast forward 5 days and still no update on my claim. Finally my boyfriend called and was told that they had found a box fitting mines description on the 5th floor ( we stayed on the 11th floor)!!! Why they didn't contact me idk. So when I finally spoke to them I was instructed to identify the items in the box to verify it was mine. By the time I was finished 75% of my box was missing. She then directed me to an officer to file an official police report. He told me it would take a couple of days to investigate.

Obviously Im not getting my stuff back but what I dont understand is how my box got from the 11th floor to the 5th. Who is responsible for lost and found items. What is the protocol for lost items within the staff and chain of control. Im very disappointed with this experience. Only a few have access to the rooms and obviously the employees need to be checked. 

My friends and I go watch the show at least twice a year but unfortunately after this experience I would no longer feel comfortable and safe at this establishment. Good thing Magic Men Live is coming to vegas. 

I will update on the issue as it unfolds including the way the hotel is handling my case.",1,1,0

The hotel itself there was no problems with, a little old and worn but you could tell that it had recently been renovated or something. Room had everything that was needed (almost), big tv, comfy bed, safe, plenty of closet space, ironing board and a decent size bathroom. The room itself, huge in size also, I mean it was bigger than the room in my house back home. Seems like hotels in the US have an overall higher standard than what you get in Europe.

I asked for a room on one of the higher floors and there was absolutely no issue switching me. The view I have to admit was pretty breathtaking, sun creeping in every morning, on the right was the busy  McCarran Airport and to the left was the strip. Room was secure enough too I have to say.

The hotel had a decent sized food court upstairs, along with a couple of shops and a full buffet and restaurants. As for entertainment you've got your shows that are constantly on, access to the pool, and arcade downstairs accompanied of course by the main casino. Prices for things inside the hotel are expensive enough, souvenirs and the restaurants that is. The little corner store inside will set you back $4 for a bottle of water.

The reason for only three stars is the downstairs lobby, casino, entrance and food court area is absolutely filled with people who are all trying to sell you time shares and each time you walk by, they stop to ask if you'll be back to Vegas next year. First day or two okay I can understand but having them approach you every day, two or more times is frustrating, they don't leave you alone. Another thing was the buffet, the breakfast was advertised both in the room and outside all around the casino at one price and we were charged a completely different price when at the till, the only explanation that the advertised prices are old. The main downside to everything was the lack of wifi in the rooms, okay it was free in the lobby, fine. But at this day and age, for a hotel that's on possibly one of the most popular streets in the world, for them to not have wifi in your room is ridiculous. They did provide wired internet (paid for of course, even if not used, part of a hotel fee) but in a tablet and smartphone age, it's about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike.

Location wise, can't really complain. If it's your first time to Vegas, stay here, you'll get a proper walk up and down the strip back to the hotel and see the entire strip in one go, if you've been before, probably go a little more central. Overall a decent stay for the money, and there is a $8 bus that brings you up and down the strip all day long.",5,2,2

Inexpensive:
We stayed on a weekend (Check in Friday\/Check Out Monday) and paid $248 for an upgraded room.  I think the person just gave us the upgrade, but anyway $248 is a freakin' steal! When you are in Vegas all you do in the room is get ready, pregame, and get some ;) so why would I spend nearly $300 more to stay at the Mirage, Bally's, Paris, or even more at any of the mid-strip hotels?  There is always the option of Imperial Palace, but have you seen and smelled that place?  Since our room was in the updated Tower II, the rooms were very nice for the price, modern furniture, 42"" flat screen TV, full-length mirror.  What more do you need people, it's Vegas?! 

Food Selection:
They have a good variety of food in their food court pizza, burgers, Asian inspired Sandwiches and snacks (pretzels & popcorn).  I am not a buffet person and struggle finishing a regular plate of food in two settings sometimes so I am not going to waste $25 on one meal unless it's gourmet.

Location:
They are located in an easy to access spot where there are hotels (New York New York, Tropicana, MGM) surrounding and connected by a bridge.  In addition, the Luxor is connected by a corridor with an automated walkway.  They also have easy access to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay using their free tram.

Con's

Timeshare Sales people:
Ok, so I will admit the people trying to sell you timeshares are annoying as hell and they partially suck me in every time until Jon snaps me back into reality.  I WILL NEVER do a timeshare meeting in Vegas again. The last time we did the presentation we actually got a free stay for going, now it seems as if all they give is a show ticket.  Sorry, my time is more valuable than that. Stay away from these people they are sneaky and try to suck you in.

Ambiance:
Ambiance is lacking...corny, touristy, and many things are outdated.

BUT SERIOUSLY THOUGH, when it comes down to it sure it's older and smells like smoke, but we're in Vegas and since people can smoke indoors that's just how it is.  I am glad I don't always follow the advice of all the reviews prior to staying somewhere because many of the previous reviews would have detoured me from staying here and I definitely enjoyed my $250 stay.

Please give him credit if possible for doing a fantastic job!!) He was beyond friendly and made sure that I had everything that I had asked for accommodation wise!!!
To make this review easier here is a list of them at this hotel:

Room- We had stayed in a tower 2 room which was very nice (I did not see the tower 1 rooms during my stay so I cannot comment on them). Clean, comfortable beds (a little firm but did not bother me.) Stand up shower - no tub. No problem whatsoever with the room. I wish they had a fridge\/full length mirror but other wise no complaints.

Pool- Very nice. Much nicer than most other Vegas hotels I've stayed at. I was always able to find a seat and they played good music.

Restaurants- I did not eat at any sit down places here but not because I wouldn't but because I prefer to spend my money on other things than restaurants. I had ate at Baja Fresh a few times and it was excellent. They also have a ""mall like"" food court located upstairs that has several options. I did have a drink at Buca di Beppo (italian sit down) where the food looked delicious from what I saw.

Casino- A bit dated compared to others but suitable. I'm not much of a gambler though except a few slots here. Also I noticed in quite a few reviews that everyone had complaints about the ""smell"" in the casino. While I did notice this smell it was no more overbearing than any other time you walk into a casino\/hotel that has a particular scent. Unnoticeable by the time you kept walking in further.

Employees- Every one was always very friendly from check in to bell hop to maintenance to bartenders to pool staff.to when I was checking out.

Location- South end of strip but still walking distance to all. I've usually stayed more center strip but didn't have any complaints. Easy pedestrian access to NYNY & MGM. Free tram to Luxor & Mandalay Bay along with indoor walkways.

I had also seen Thunder from down under (which I will review seperately) but had a great time. Definitely worth it if you're looking for a fun, easy, girls night out and you've never seen it before.

All in all I will definitely return to the Excalibur, between the excellent customer service to it being the cheapest resort hotel on the strip, I have no complaints!!!",5,1,3

The beds were very comfortable and there is a mini dining table with 2 chairs...the flat screen tv was lacking some Cartoon Network. The view out of our window was nice.

The pool area was nice and there are an adult section...the slides were fun.

They misrepresent the true cost for the rooms.  There are extra fees for internet and ""resort"" fees that are unexplained.

I found myself getting lost the majority of the weekend.

Maybe because the staff expected NYE weekend to be crazy, but I thought our room was pretty loud and rowdy.  And we continued to be loud into the wee hours of the morning.  We never once got a warning to keep things down.

Their guest rooms are so outdated.  I felt like I was on acid staring at their bedsheets and curtains.  They really need to look into changing the decor in these rooms.  The rooms are real tiny, but that is to be expected.  We rarely spent time at Excalibur, so there isn't much to say.  

Their only redeeming quality may be that Thunder From Down Under is here.  I haven't seen it yet, but I will be checking it out! Excalibur is near the end of the strip, by Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

So I came strolling up at about 7:15 pm to find that the pool was closed at 7:00.  I was told that if I pay $5, I can go in the adult pool until 9:00 pm.   I wanted to check it out first. So I was let in.  This guy came running up thinking I was sneaking in. I told him to f-off and get lost, I was checking out the pool and I was let in.  Didn't pay the $5.  I paid $30 resort fees for 2 days and I'm supposed to now pay $5 for use of the pool that's been peed in all day by 2000 people?  No thanks.  

So, I get into the lobby to check in on the first night. There must have been 300 people in line.  I have never seen so many people in line on a Monday night.  It took 90 min to check in.  I checked into my room, only to find a long black hair on the toilet.  Beds are hard as a rock.  The black out curtain doesn't block out the spotlight on the window from outside.  I had to do things to block the light from coming in.  The TV kept turning on by itself all night.  The class of morons in that place.  Uugghh.  Next time,  yes, I will spend the money, and stay at the Palazzo or the Venetian.  For some God-forsaken reason, I thought this place would be nice for the price.  I paid more to board my dogs while I was in Vegas.",1,2,0

While it is nothing fancy, its not a horrible option either.

Pros-
Spacious rooms
Right off the strip which gives easy access to the other hotels and casinos near.
Cheap food options within the hotel.. If you are looking to save a little extra, they have a lot of good quick places to go such as Pizza Hut, Mcdonalds, Krispy Kreme, a smoothie\/deli, Baja Fresh Tacos, Johnny Rockets etc etc.
Huge game room. If you have kids, I highly recommend it. Lots of fun and carnival-like games.

Cons- 
The bed was hard and lacked blankets. 
The casino was dingy and it had that old\/dirty feel to it. It felt like a casino you'd see in a slum neighborhood.
The smokiness to it!!- Now, I know you can smoke everywhere in Vegas which is COOL! Whatever floats your boat- But for some reason, this casino had the worst ventilation system ever. It was very stuffy in there and was hard to breathe. 
No mini fridge in the rooms.

Overall, if you are looking to save a few shackles, this is the place for you. Otherwise I would say there are much better options.",2,0,0

First of all, BOTH of our beds had holes in the sheets and the bed itself.. when I went into the bathroom a used bar of soap was on top of the shower as well as a used shaver.. there was some gunk on our sink area that wasn't cleaned off.. and after the first night the bathroom lock wouldn't lock anymore.. I felt really dirty in their rooms.. The Iron was not cleaned and had old, cold water still in it. Our alarm clock wasn't even plugged in to anything.. Everytime we woke up and opened the curtains you could see all of the dusk particles flying around in a huge swarm around your face.. woohoo.

One positive thing I could say is, the upstairs food court was convenient, but I'm sick of fastfood now.. and Dick's Last Resort's margarita's were yummy.. but $15

Really, it should get 2 1\/4 stars.

Chronological break down:

Valet:  3 stars - They aren't the fastest, but when the lot is 'full' and you tell them you are a hotel guest, they make it work.

Front Desk:  2 stars - Lines are crazy, and none of the staff are enthusiastic or overly nice.

Room:  2 stars (in Tower 2 - NOT Tower 1 - avoid Tower 1).  For about $67 a night, we got a ""double upgrade"", which brought us to the room you might expect BUT IN NO WAY would think it was an upgrade.  The door stopper fell off the wall.  The decor was decent, the room was big enough for our family; the tv was large and probably only a couple years old.  The bathroom had poor water pressure.  No fridge in the room.  The A\/C is a large window or wall unit, but worked well and had no odor.  The bed and furniture could be more comfortable.  Outlets are an issue, and garbage cans are super small.  The safe takes up as much space as a mini fridge, they should consider swapping that out.  BIGGEST GRIPE?  The window covering doesn't cover the entire window, and the drapes won't cover it either because they don't completely cross due to the air conditioning unit.  The noise level is almost unbearable at night, due to the outside noise on the strip.

Casino Floor:  2 stars.  Many annoying 'free show' hoodlums.  Though this end of the strip is supposed to be the better end, I feel that this casino might attract some questionable or shady looking characters.  A little smelly - which I expected from Circus Circus but was surprised that they had no odor.

Dining:  2.25 stars.  The prices everywhere in this casino should come down by an average of $1.50 per item - and I mean everything, from the stale pistachios in the gift shop to the $9 20 piece chicken nugget meal at McD's, to the $71 per ticket we paid for Tournament of Kings, to the mediocre Mexican food at Baja (the fish tacos are awesome, skip everything else because it is bland and dry).  The bars are overpriced - some drinks as high as $40 for margaritas (and I don't mean Don Julio 1942 margaritas, I mean bullshit margaritas).

Gaming:  1.5 stars.  Though check in is a mile long, the casino floor is surprisingly empty.  Not much at craps, many closed black jack and pai gow tables, the poker room has cruddy tourneys and 1 table going compared to the Venetian's 59 tables...the slots do not include the most current ones, but still have some recent favorites and good old standbys like Wizard of Oz and Wheel of Fortune.  Dimly lit.  The smell of cocoa butter is overwhelming.

Entertainment: 4 stars.  Tournament of Kings was fantastic - A+++.  Great actors and actresses, attentive service and compassionate.  The best part of Excalibur.  The underground fun dungeon is okay, much like a Chuck E Cheese meets a Carnival.  Reasonably priced surprisingly.  The pool was a lot of fun, very nice lifeguards, clean, music, 3 pools, a water slide.  Pretty good time overall.

Overall, it wasn't the worst I could have imagined.  The prices on the strip were much higher at most other places, so for the price it was reasonable.  Probably would stay here again for the same price or less knowing what to expect, but wouldn't stay here with a better offer anywhere else OR for a penny more here!",2,0,1

I usually go to Vegas to party. Meaning: I spend VERY minimal time in my hotel, it is a place for me to set my stuff, get ready and be out and about. Come back and sleep for a couple hours then start over. 
For me this hotel is perfect when I don't want to spend a lot on my room but still get a nice place where I can do what I need to do. The location is excellent, casino is cool, pools are nice, and there's a Fat Tuesday\/Dicks where I can get cheap but tasty drinks!

The lure for this decision was the outstanding rate as well as the hotel's proximity to City Center (where our daily meetings were held). This hotel has very mixed reviews, so my expectations were minimal\/ hopeful. Please note that the daily resort fee includes WIRED internet in the room.

IF YOU ARE TAKING A CAB from the airport, remind the driver NOT to take the tunnel. TWICE THE FARE that route.
The check-in line moved quickly. We elected not to pay for an upgrade so were assigned to a standard room with 2 queens in tower 1, facing the Luxor. I suggest asking for a higher floor when offered to avoid a dismal rooftop view.

I have walked through this casino and shopping area many times when visiting Las Vegas and have never been impressed with the feeble attempt at a castle theme. This stay proved that to be the case in the hotel areas as well. However decorated, I found the room comfortable and clean upon arrival. I was impressed that we could open the window a full four inches to allow fresh air in the space. 

The beds were comfortable with extra pillows in the closet. The bathroom vanity area was plenty wide enough for two women to share. Although not promised, this standard room included a large flatscreen television. If you want daily housekeeping, make sure to remove your do not disturb sign because they wont double back unless you call.

The pool was OPEN in this winter season. The area includes four separate pools that provide some seclusion from one another. Only one pool was open, but several hot tubs were available. It was a relaxing break from the conference. Please note that the pool hours are very limited, with closing time at 5:00 pm.

I did not try much dining at this hotel other than breakfast one morning in the Sherwood Cafe. Service was prompt, and the 3-egg omelett breakfast was enough for us to share. I met some very nice people working at the various hotel shops.

This hotel was adequate for our stay. If you are a traveler seeking Vegas luxury, I suggest booking elsewhere.

Believe it or not the main reason we visit the Excalibur when we are in Vegas is because they have a Krispy Kreme.  Since there is not much in the way of Krispy Kreme left where we live its nice to get our fix when we can.   (The Oxnard location is now a Chick-fil-A)

The self parking is a little on the far side from the casino...but I guess what do you expect for free?

It was so bad that we would walk to the Luxor next door to play.  The rooms are become run down and it's no longer a great deal to stay here.  You can get much better for the same money.  First the room mid week was $30 per night which is great.  Then they hit you with a $30.88 per day resort fee.  This is for internet and use of the gym.  You would think that this fee would cover parking, but now they are charging $8 per night parking.  I could not believe that all MGM properties are now charging for parking.  How is this not part of the resort fee!?  Then you go to the bar and order a Coors light and they charge $9.00 per beer.  Way too much!  I spent the day betting basketball.

The room was nice and roomy. Everything was upgraded. There was a flat screen TV in the room but it had terrible grainy reception, so it wasn't worth turning on anyway. 

What also bothered me was the fact that the folks at Excalibur always found a way to throw advertisements under my hotel door. Okay, guys. I don't want your crap, guys.

Being under-aged at the time, I couldn't enjoy much.  I thought that it was evil that when I finally turned 21, we ended our tradition.  So when I first turned 21, guess where I wanted my first Vegas experience to be. That's right...Excalibur.  I graduated from Midway's Arcade and the Tournament of Kings to Black Jack and all night drinking.  Fast forward 15+ years and I'm still coming to Excalibur.  Minus the all night drinking and gambling.

Pros:
-Rooms are cheap.  Not Budge Suites cheap, but cheaper than the Mandalay.
-Great comps:  I don't play much, but own their player's card.  I get free rooms from time to time.
-Arcade:  When my baby girl and nephews are in town, this is where we go. 
-Pool is kid friendly.  
-Beer Pong:  Only when family is in.  2 AM Beer Pong gets the competitive spirits up. 
-Loose:  Not the guest, but the slots.  My parents win here and they love their slots.
-Location:  One of the few casinos on the strip where it's easy in and out.  
-Tournament of Kings:  Half price for locals and kids should experience it at least once.
-Remodeled Rooms:  Their remodeled rooms are clean and updated.  Lacking the smell of smoke. 
-$5 Black Jack
-Poker Room:  Small but there's action from tourist that only know poker from ESPN. 
-Dick's Last Resort

Cons:
-Parking: My suggestion if you're staying is valet and bell service.
-Some rooms are outdated.  Could have changed in the last year.  If you're reserving here, ask for their remodeled rooms.  It's a world of difference.
-Old:  Needs a serious remodel both inside and outside.  
-Eats:  Buffet is just okay.  Upstairs is bunch of fast food that seems to have smaller portions and cost more.  

Since I have more pros than cons, I have to give this place 4 stars.  Plus, it's one of my parent's favorites.  Also a place where I am taking my daughter and nephews when they're in town.

We booked a room at Excalibur because our girls loved the idea of staying in a castle! I was kinda iffy about staying here due to the cheap price. When we arrived at the hotel, we were checked in in no time. The staff are very friendly, and provided excellent customer service. However, I was frightened by what we found in our room. There was hair stuck to the pillows with buggers. There was blood and dry seaman on the sheets and blankets. We called housekeeping to request clean linens. Once the house keeper came to the room, she was unable to find any clean linens on her cart. All of her ""clean linen"" were dirty. I could not understand why dirty linens were folded and stocked on the cart. Long story short, the hotel refused to give us another room because we booked our hotel with our flight. They were unable to put sheets on our bed. Rather than sleeping on a bate hotel mattress, we book another hotel and high tailed it out of there. This is an old hotel, so we keept our expectations low, but this was a new found level of low. This hotel is cheap, so it brings in lower end customers. There was a fight going on in the bar between a customer and a bartender as we were walking in the casino. There were f-bombs and middle fingers flying left and right.

The pool complex is good.  There is a pool for kids and one for 18 and up.  Also, you can get a cabana for a day for about 80$ during the week or off season.  The price fluxuates but it's always worth asking.  Can you beat that in Vegas?  The pool used to let you bring in an outside drink if you put in a plastic cup, but on a recent trip this was not the case.  I may or may not have purchased a half yard margarita, drank it, and re-filled it in the room to bring back to the pool, though.

The excalibur is great for the budget minded.  There is a baja fresh, with solid meals for under 10$.  Also walk by Dick's Last Resort and they'll usually hand you a coupon for a free jello shot.  Not bad.

The location isn't the best, but there is some good stuff nearby.  New York New York is right next door.  The Luxor, MGM, and Mandalay Bay are also nearby.  It's about a 45 minute walk to center strip.

While there are a lot of families with young kids that stay there, Excalibur somehow strikes a good balance.  There are kids around, but they hardly if ever bother me.  Nothing like a Circus Circus type place.  I wouldn't take my kids to Vegas after what I've been through there :)

We chose Excalibur for location and our activities planned for this trip and wasn't a location we have stayed at.  We took an email upgrade offer for the Contemporary Tower room and thought it was pretty basic.  Couldn't imagine what the original room looked like that we had booked.  Cleanliness was 3\/5 - room was okay; however, the bathroom could have had a few more details looked at.  If you're looking for a dark room and avoid sunlight, then I don't recommend this room.  They have curtains on 2\/3 of the windows and a flip blind down the middle larger piece of the window causing light to enter the room.  We didn't care for that.  The largest issue I had this trip happened when I stayed at Mirage in August.  On our final night we wanted to sleep in as we had a later flight and went down to the front desk and inquired about late check outs.  Our group agreed to do the 3PM option $30.00 - I told the lady at the desk what happened at Mirage and that housekeeping started keying in, knocking, talking through the door prior to our approved check out time.  She apologized for my experience there and told me not to worry as long as we had the do not disturb sign on the door nothing would happen.  Sure enough prior to the 11AM resort check out time housekeeping made several attempts to enter the room, knocking, and calling out housekeeping.  Told housekeeping we had 3PM check out.  Whatever communication\/reporting front desk does to housekeeping has a gap and not worth the $30.00 - our sleep was ruined; we were now awake - not worth it.  Next time, I'm just going to make a sign and tape it to the front door if we ever choose to do late check out again at an MGM property.

For the price, this place is a steal. They do charge a resort fee but it includes wired internet which almost every where else you have to pay for in addition to your resort fee. I think the resort fee was about 10 or 11 dollars a day and included two drink coupons (or $5 off a drink of your choice at any casino bar) and 2 games on the midway as well as the internet. 

The breakfast that I had at the Cafe was fine and Pat was a very diligent server and very thorough so no complaints there,more expensive than Denny's but better service and more convenient to collapsing into bed - you choose.

Check in had long lines, took about 15 minutes but I got put in a standard room (the cheapest) in Tower 1 and I was fine with the room and the facilities there. Check out was quick and easy but I left at 6am, it may be less easy later in the day.

I used to love staying here because I get comp from mlife for as many nights I want and with a lot of play money.  Now a day, I have to pay to stay at Excalibur, but still at a discounted rate like less than $50\/night.

The reason that I have to give such rating is because I had a bad experience in my last visit.  I was using one of the towels provided by the hotel and I was using it to dry my face.  The second I put in my face, it smelled like poo in smoke (this is how bad it smelled).  Gosh, I was so mad!! It was horrible.... 

I then called the housekeeping department and they apologized and told me that they will send someone with the new towels.  A male housekeeper came over with the towels and handed them to my husband.  He just threw to my husband's hands and immediately walked away.  He threw the towels and of course the towels dropped on the floor. .... really terrible service.... 

I also tried the buffet I think it was $32 for one day buffet at excalibur and luxor.  It's not worthy.  The food is not very good, no seafood, and not really tasty.

I wanted to stay at venetian or something like that, but my friend didn't want to spend more than 100 a night. So even though excalibur wasn't my first choice, it did fit the criteria= affordable & on the strip.

The parking was easy to navigate & to find a spot and checking in was painless. I even got a free room upgrade (newly remodeled room called widescreen) just by nicely inquiring about the rate!  The room was pretty nice too- cute decor, flatscreen tv, huge bathroom (good for girls sharing a room), nice tub, comfy beds. I'm still debating if the room would have been worth paying extra for, but I was extremely happy with it. 

The hotel itself is on one edge of the strip so if you're trying to mostly be on the mirage\/treasure island side a lot then I suggest taking a taxi. The line for a taxi at the lobby was super packed at 1030-11pm when we decided to go out dancing. We walked and ended up taking the double decker bus, NOT reccommended! ugh it was awful! Better if you just wait for the taxi, they constantly have some pulling up anyway.

There were about 4 large pools and we avoided the ones with kids in it. Plenty of beach chairs to lay out for tanning and they provide towels. The staff throughout the hotel were both nice and helpful, no meanies.

I've been a Pearl\/Gold players card member at MGM resorts for about 3 years now, so I can use the VIP check-in line. You can become a Pearl member if you just sign up for the mgm credit card, however I got mine through gambling a lot. FYI, Pearl status does not let you use the VIP check-in at all MGM hotels; most require Gold or higher.
Other perks include skipping the lines at most MGM hotel buffets, and free parking.
You still get hit with the resort fee, which is up to about $34\/night.
If you do gamble and lose a lot at this casino during your stay with your mlife card in the machines or tables, you can go to the mlife desk and they may knock off some resort fees  (only time I checked was when I was down about 1K). From what I know, you can't use your mlife card at sportsbook, so they can't keep track of your plays.
There's a food court on the second floor, and you can walk across the bridge to get to Luxor from there.
Rack up points in the myvegas app on your phone or FB, and you can get some comped rooms or food vouchers as well. The deals were better some years back, but it is what it is.
Most MGM hotels do not have a mini fridge, so I usually just grab ice in a bucket and store my drinks in the ice overnight.

You'll hear fire and ambulance noises all night. The A\/C was very effective.  No wifi. Who in this day and age doesn't give wifi???  Nothing huge but good location on the strip next to other great hotels. Clean.  Checking in was easy although Our check In clerk had zero personality.  Didn't play in the casinos so no comment there.,0,0,0

I did not give it 5 stars for 2 reasons, 1. every 10 steps you have an employee asking you if you want to go see a show etc(Vegas culture I guess as this was very common everywhere) 2. If you're gambling expect to wait 20-30min to get a waitress to bring you a drink, this area definitely needs improvement. Despite that my overall experience was pleasant and would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to save some money while staying on the strip.",0,0,0

It gives you the opportunity to be on the Vegas strip at a cheaper price compared to other hotels. If you come with kids or have a big family you are traveling with then Excalibur will offer you value in staying in Vegas.

I had a bad experience with my check in where I was offered a free upgrade offering the pool view and adjacent rooms where we could open the doors to each other's rooms. Neither of those happened and we were too exhausted from the drive to complain or change rooms. 

The pool was great for the kids. They have a single slide there for kids and adults. They have a VIP pool as well. Drinks are expensive, as you would probably imagine. We ordered a bucket with 5 beers and it cost $30.

I would stay here again and here is why: I come here to walk around Vegas, not sit in my room. I don't care to pay for an expensive hotel that I come to sleep in.",31,17,17

Another down side is u have to walk thru the casino with ur swimming gear on because the pool is all the way near Tower II if ur n Tower I.

Whilst my parents where sleeping someone managed to get into there room and steal a wallet from the counter next to the bed! Yes, you read that right, they where asleep in the room and a criminal stranger managed to get in and take a wallet from the side. That's PROBLEM 1!!
PROBLEM 2, on reporting this the next morning the hotel DID NOT offer a room change. 
PROBLEM 3, After calling the UK (for a while) to cancel all there stolen credit cards they where called at 1am to go and settle a $250 phone bill (2 days before they where to check out) The hotel did however offer to have security come up to the room and collect the cash. 
PROBLEM 4, The stolen wallet was found with all the credit cards and identification (only the cash had been taken) within 24 hrs of the incident. However nobody informed my parents. In fact the only reason my Dad got his wallet back was because he asked them to check if it had been handed in. If they had informed them as soon as the wallet was found they would not have had to cancel their bank cards and the problems would have stopped there!!!
BUT NO.....
PROBLEM 5, With no credit and no cash my parents where left high and dry. They where not offered assistance in any form. Nobody within the hotel offered to help with receiving money transfers or anything.
PROBLEM 6, RISK MANAGEMENT. After the initial report was made risk management got involved, however (in short, cause i could write 1000 words on the downfalls of risk management) RISK MANAGEMENT really means WE WILL WASTE YOUR TIME TILL YOUR TOO FRUSTRATED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN WALK AWAY.

Although on the face of it she appeared sympathetic she had no real power to make things right! In fairness she did ask her manager to authorized a refund. Be he refused! When we asked if we could speak to him directly we where told, he dose not deal with guests. 
After this we where escorted to check out (so we did not have to pay the late checkout fee) and left with my mother in tears!!

We stayed at the Excalibur because it was cheap and still in a fairly good location on the strip.  For the price, the hotel is great.  Wonderful pool area and arcade strip for the kids, huge fitness room for me, a nice spa, and easy access to other large resorts.  The rooms were decent.  We upgraded to a nice view of the strip.  There were 5 channels on T.V but we didn't spend much time in the room.  There was only a shower stall (no bath) and no fridge, free coffee or internet access (just to let you know).  

The problem with this hotel is that everybody going to Las Vegas has decided that the Excalibur is a good deal (which it is).  It is by far the most crowded hotel on the strip.  The pool area is packed, the casino is packed.  When you try to get dinner, the dining areas are packed.

Sadly, there was some bad with the good. 

First off you are hit with the undeniable stench of years and years of smoke. For a Haligonian who has been in a city with a stone cold, steadfast, smoking ban, this was the first shock.

Second bad is the sales people who pray on people naive enough to let them take their spiel. Lines like ""are you married"" or ""are you coming back to Vegas in the next year"" will lead to a sales pitch that has you putting down 200 bucks on them, and it's ""refundable at any time, with no strings attached"" which is simply the mantra of if it sounds too good to be true, it is. On top of it, it's a non-stop assault. These people are situated in front of the rooms entrances which is just disgusting to me.

Thirdly was housekeeping and I. First off, we find a sheet with blood on it. Not a huge deal, and really in a huge hotel.. not a huge surprise. Called down and the guy comes up with the wrong sheet. Again, not a huge deal. Then he comes back with a full bed of bedding and hands it to us.. and walks away. Alright so making my own bed on vacation... Then to 'fix' this mistake on their end, they clean our room with a do not disturb sign on.. and lose the remote. THEN on the last morning, open the door as they knock.. walking in on me changing. Just not good at all.

But it's not all bad... 

The front desk staff are amazing. The 20 dollar trick does work, do a google search if you're not sure what I am talking about.

The hotel is a member of the MLife group, which gives you free money in the form of discounts from it's app\/facebook game, MyVegas.. if you are headed to Vegas anytime, GET THIS APP.
I saved almost $300 dollars on a 25% discount on rooms, a free ticket to LOVE by Cirque Du Soleil and bogo for the buffet in Excalibur. Message me if you have any questions.

After security showed we were told that we should have walked away and that we should call the front desk manager, Denise, to explain the situation. When speaking with Denise she let my friend and I know that the whole situation painted us in a bad light because we did not walk away and I just seemed angry because of the comments that were made about my body. Naturally this is something that I should just accept and let happen to me because according to Denise being verbally abused is the victims problem not Denise's, not Excalibur's.

Supposedly our room came with free wireless internet, but you couldn't actually get a signal from our room. A friend of mine was staying in the same hotel, and his room had signal but it was too weak to connect. 

The walls are fairly thin and you will hear pretty much everything going on outside your room. We had the heater on most of the time we were in the room, because it was incredibly cold without it, and there weren't enough blankets to keep us warm at night. It was noisy and old, and it would run for a couple minutes at a time, then shut off for a few minutes, then turn on again, which made it rather difficult to fall asleep. On top of that, the curtains don't completely block out the light from outside, and the pillows are gigantic, so I didn't get much sleep while I was there.

If you even so much as glance at the casino floor, you will be harassed by people trying to sell you timeshares. Even around the shops there are a few people waiting to pounce.

We came to Vegas for a wedding and had plenty of activities planned so this hotel was reasonable, good location and a good choice. We arrived late Thursday (about 2am) and left Sunday night. Check-in was very easy! There is a resort fee associated with any stay in Vegas so the staff explained it covers fees such as printing boarding passes, the pool, etc. In my opinion, it seems a bit much but it must be paid. She gave us our room keys and directed us to our rooms. 

The hotel is located next to Luxor and New York New York. Its on the strip and very convenient to get to other hotels or activities around the city. The entire hotel has is a Medieval theme, which attracts kids and adults. I didn't see many children during my stay here except one morning I went to the pool area. The pool area is very big and includes a special adult-only pool. You don't  have to bring a towel from your room, just show the attendant your room key and you can grab as many towels as you need. There were several bar areas, lounge chairs and Cabana's for relaxing and\/or tanning. 

The rooms were very spacious and clean. The beds and pillows were SUPER comfy- no problems sleeping at all. They have nice flat screens also. My only concern is the room doesn't come with a microwave, mini fridge and\/or coffee maker. Its strange because there is a space right under the tv where a fridge can fit. Instead, it can be purchased for a daily fee- no thank you! We didn't have a good view (not requested either) because we mainly needed a place to shower, sleep, get dressed and this hotel did just that. We had no concerns with room service. Once we arrived we noticed the safe wasn't working properly so we called to the front desk, informed them and someone was coming to fix it 4 minutes later. I'm surprised they came so quickly, especially since it was almost 3am but he came and fixed it immediately.

There are several restaurants and shopping stores located on the 2nd floor all ranging from Pizza Hut, Starbucks, Cinnabon, Krispy Kreme, Popeye's, etc. There is also a buffet, steakhouse and a few other eating places along with nice bar areas. Need some jewelry or a handbag? Bag of chips or souvenirs? No worries as they have stores for that also. As expected, the food is a bit pricey but its very convenient. Some are open 24 hours (Schlotzskys for sure) but unsure on the others. The hotel also has plenty of slot machines and tables. I enjoy blackjack and to see they had a $5 table was heaven! Smoking is allowed but don't think you can walk around the entire place and smoke, only in certain areas. While checking in, a man was standing in line smoking and the staff politely told him smoking is for the bar area only. Smoking is allowed while gambling too. 

We were in town for a special event and seen no point of renting a car so I'm unsure how the parking is. We either called a taxi or used Uber the entire trip and that went well. They do have a designated area they pick you up (per Uber and hotel rules) which is near the casino entrance. 

Overall, I enjoyed my stay and will gladly stay here again. The customer service was great by the front desk staff, housekeeping and concierge. Its in a convenient location, we felt safe at all times and whatever we needed the hotel provided. Thanks!",18,2,5

I was mostly disappointed with the fact that customer service was bad - I waited at the baggage storage line for a long time to store my luggage for an hour or less before I leave but no attendant came. The security came over to help me ask the front desk for the attendant but was simply dismissed by the staff that the attendants would be back but they may take a long while. Another guest also asked for it and faced the same response. I think the staff can handle the situation better rather than asking the guests to just wait. How long does he expect us to wait? I don't have all the time in the world to do that.

I don't think I will return to the Excalibur again, and won't recommend it to anyone.",3,2,0

Remodeled rooms are nice enough for you and your kids (my room was clean with a nice pool side view - ask for pool view!) You really do not have to leave the hotel if you bring your kids, pool has a water slide ( get a cabana early or at least an umbrella early because they fill up quickly!) Excalibur knight show is great for kids and a really good deal (includes food) just like medieval times. Video arcade is good size. The salon was expensive just for a manicure - I wouldn't go back to salon for that but the spa was okay, gym is cool with a pool view. Another downer is they do not let you bring outside drinks into pool area even if it is bought in Excalibur! THAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH, they make a lot of money already! I bought a frozen drink at Dicks (in Excalibur) and I had to finish it or throw it away before entering the pool! I guess its a separate business but I still do not agree.

If that wasn't bad enough, when I finally got into the room, it turns out that one of the lamps was not working, the t.v. did not have a signal input, and the internet was wired with no wireless options. I can't believe this hotel seriously does not offer any wi-fi options despite the fact that it charges a resort fee like the other hotels. The Medieval theme is realistic I guess since the atmosphere is dark, grungy, kinda stuffy, and you get the idea. The buffet isn't that great either. I would recommend just saving your money and trying out the new food court (much cheaper and better tasting food).

The worst part about staying here was definitely checking in. Longest line ever no matter what time it was. We waited about 35 minutes total, but once we got up the man helping us was super friendly and got us checked in quickly.

We were in town for an event called EDC which brings tons of people to Las Vegas for about a week (150,000+ peak). It's a younger budget minded crowd so this place has a lot of guests. With that considered parking was horrible here. I spent around 45 minutes looking for a spot one morning after the event. This was by far the most inconvenient thing we had to deal with during our stay here. I'm sure it's much better when the hotel isn't so full with so many people driving vs flying.

I think it is convenient especially for family's such as mine that can never agree on one restaurant to eat at.

These employees are very rude and carry a lot of attitude when u ask them for assistance or anything such as towels, soap, or toilet paper. They are like the fast food workers who give you two packets of ketchup after you just paid for a lot of items.

Parking very easy! Registration was super fast! Here is my complaint. When I walked into my room I saw an open beer bottle. Keep in mind we just walked in for the first time. I walked down the hall to the housekeeper area and told them I had a beer bottle in my room. The last there said and I quote ""no you don't"". Serious?!? I don't even drink beer. I looked at her and said ""do you wanna come to my room and look?"" I was so mad at this point. Who are you to call me a liar? She said I just cleaned that room and there is no bottle. I walked her to my room and pointed at the bottle. She apologized and I told her do not call me a liar again. 

I called the front desk to complain. Lindsey helped me and offered two free buffet tickets. I also had the assistant housekeeper manager call me and apologize. 

I am hoping the rest of my trip will be better than my start. Stay tunes for my post trip review.

But then, later that evening, I get back to the room and now the lights in the bathroom won't work.

Overall, the room was below standard for the price I paid.  The TV quality was terrible and there was no fridge so you have to go to the casino floor to get something to drink thus ensuring you pay even more for your stay. 

Lastly, there are people on the casino floor, right when you walk in the resort tower, trying to get you to take a timeshare tour.  They offer discounted\/free tickets for shows but in exchange you have to pay a deposit and take a few hours out of your day to go tour a timeshare.

Hotels on the strip generally are priced more than I paid for the entire weekend so price wise I was impressed.

I have stayed in a lot of hotels in vegas, from the plaza (yikes), to circus circus...never..again, to the Signature at the MGM (piiiiiimp). This place was in the middle, which ladies and gentlemen..I expected.

Check in was quick and efficient, they give you a coupon book with two free drinks for the hotel bars (in case you don't want to play)...I cannot complain about this, we had a 20.00 food voucher as well.

Be aware like almost ALL strip hotels they charge a ""Resort Fee"" its the new thing..its stupid but it is what it is and it was still cheaper than normal. 

The room was clean, 2 queen beds, flat screen TV and Full view of the turrets in the middle of the castle. Needless to say my 2 year old was thrilled (don't ask...it just had to happen that way).

Parking wasn't as bad as it could have been, we used self park, and could usually get pretty close to the door our rooms were near. 

The shopping is decent in the Excalibur, I do enjoy that it is connected to the Luxor and if you have the chance go to Popcornopolis (holy cow).

Their buffet is subpar that would be my only complaint. Not a lot of options for the price, the presentation is meager at best. I would go to Paris or Harrah's before I would go back there.


If you are looking for a nice bed to rest in, and not be extremely pampered (to each their own for their Vegas trip) then this place is for you. My philosophy in Vegas is there is so much to see and do, I can get pampered at home for cheaper and sleep when I'm dead.

The reviews were not the best and some of these horror stories were frightening. A few friends and I stayed here on the weekend of July 28 2017. We arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, we waited in line, which wasn't long at all at this time, and we got checked in quickly, got an upgraded, conjoined rooms for a fee of 10 dollars per night more for each room! I thought that was awesome! We stayed at the royal tower and it was definitely worth the upgrade. Before anything else we checked the beds because my biggest fear is waking up next to bed bugs, we inspected and found them to be clean! The bathroom has no bathtub but that was no issue for us we wanted it to shower. The housekeepers were also great, always restocking and cleaning out rooms in a flash. 

The furniture is a bit run down but you can definitely see their efforts in trying to modernize the place. 

Ac worked great as well. Their food court was affordable and so many options! Perfect for us drunkies who didn't wanna walk far. 

Would definitely stay again (although we try to stay at different hotels every time we visit), and I would definitely recommend.",4,1,1

The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helped answer all of our questions. They provided us with multiple options for our rooms and helped us select the room that was right for us. 

We stayed in the resort tower. The room was on the warm side because the AC unit wasn't very effective. It was loud and would constantly turn off and on throughout the night. 

The housekeeping staff was awesome. One of our lamps wasn't working properly and within 10 minutes they brought us a new lamp. In addition, the housekeeping staff was welcoming and it's the small things like that make me want to come back. 

The only other down side to the room is that it just needs some updating. If it wasn't for the condition of the room I would have easily given the hotel a 4 star because the staff was great.",2,2,0

Less then 24 hours later we are on our way to Vegas! We decided to stay at the Excalibur because that is where his friends already had a room. Although it is not the type of place I would have picked, it had some great positive points:

- BIG rooms. I was in Tower 1, which I thought I wouldnt like based on reviews and it was perfectly fine. We were on the 23rd floor and had two doubles, which was the only thing available, but perfect because we just threw our stuff on the other bed. 

- Did NOT smell like smoke in our room, MAJOR PLUS. 

- Cheap. 

- The Spa and Fitness center is A++. Yes, we did go to the gym for a few hours like freaks, but the gym and spa is the NICEST part about this place. We each had massages and sat in the sauna and whirlpool (unfortunately for us the male and female spas are separate). We left totally relaxed and ready to party after that.

- Room service. Do it. Their ""food court"" selection sucks and its gross seeing all the other guests scarfing down ColdStone and Wetzel Pretzel. We did not even want to bother with the Buffet. We spent $100 on a HUGE breakfast and didnt have to move or change from our beds...SCORE. 

- Location. Easy to get to all the other hotels and casinos where you actually want to hang out. 

So overall, would I stay here again? Yes, because for the rate and the accessibility it is great. Would I hang out there while staying there? No. But thats ok, Bellagio is just down the street.",3,0,1

For two nights the total will be $200+ for a shitty room. Once you calculate all the ways they nickel and dime you now, I don't ever really want to come back to Vegas.  Times been a-changin' and I didn't get the memo. If I do come back I'll be staying with my family.

Well, first I must note what started my shitty Vegas vacay. We arrive late because traffic was awful. Only to find a line with literally hundreds of other late guests. Tell me why they have like 5 workers checking people in. Why? Because it is fine to have paying guests waiting for two hours to get to their room. I guess I should choose a different arrival time, shame on me. 

I mean this room is not even on the level of a Best Western (Best Westerns' give complimentary breakfast, mini fridge, microwave, decent beds, many outlets, great TVs w\/ channels that work, nice showers, etc) let alone a Marriot, but think they can charge resort fees, parking fees, and whatever other fees that I'll see once the bill is given. Fu€king ridi€ulous. Who is swimming in February? Who? Who works out on vacation? I for one dont! These are the things that should be complimentary because they are options many do not want or can't feasibly use--nobody swims in frigid weather. And now they charge for parking. Nah!! That's the limit.  

Save your money and go to an actual destination. Or at the very least save yourself from these prices and stay away from the Strip  because ish is lame af now.

We checked in on a Monday. We needed a handicapped accessible room. And that's all we got. No view, granted not all the rooms get a view. There was hair in the shower, and the shower was a glass door type and there was black stuff coming off the metal parts on the floor, dust on the furniture, pamphlets on the floor from a different casino\/hotel from the previous person, the bottom handle on the dresser was broken off and put inside the dresser drawer and the kicker was we found old boxer shorts (underwear) behind the t.v stand. It just doesn't seem like they care at all about the accessible rooms. Like I said, this was our first year with problems.

I would highly suggest the gummy bear shot. It tastes just like a sweet gummy bear would taste. I do wish it was chilled a bit more so it went down a bit more smoothly. The same goes for the grey goose shots, I wish it was chilled a bit more.

 it's so small and its the whole body! Anyway all was good during the first hour but towards the end of the show my asthma started acting up because their ventilation in the arena sitting area was very poor compared to Medieval times.

My husband and I came here from the MGM with our kids, 13 and 9, and were so thankful we did.  The first room we were given was not cleaned well.  There was food all over the floor and the toilet was broken.  I have never switched rooms before but I felt that this was just not acceptable.  We went back down to the check in and waited for about 15 minutes before the lady from VIP came over to help and called us into the VIP area to check in.  After explaining what happened with the room, she was extremely apologetic and immediately switched our room to a high floor with a view.  She was very delightful and friendly.  I don't remember her name, but she was great!

The room was ok, yes, they have updated the rooms but there is still wear and tear on the dresser and the chairs are old looking, orange felt.  But, I didn't come for the rooms; I came for a better experience for my kids than the MGM.  And a better experience we got! I must say though that the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean with enough towels and products.   Maid service was very polite and brought us extra blankets when we called for them within 5 minutes and gave us extra towels when she saw us in the hall.

We went down to the pool immediately after getting settled and even though the slide pool was closed (the main attraction for my 9 year old son), we were able to rent a cabana for $25 for the rest of the afternoon (3-6).  This was great!  You get a stocked fridge, tv, and a great host and waitress, padded pool chairs and a couch.  We spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing and enjoying the weather.  A WAY better experience than the MGM!  They happened to be running a special the next day for the cabanas at the slide pool so we immediately held one for us for the next day as we had planned to spend the entire day at the pool anyways.   Another great day and great experience.  I can't tell you how much fun my kids had and we didn't have to sit in the blazing sun (it was 100 degrees that day) and they bring you food when you order, drinks and make sure you are taken care of plus all the extras I mentioned earlier.  Thank you Excalibur for having great staff!

If you have a family and are bringing them to Vegas (which despite all the younger crowd's complaints, there is a TON of things to do with kids here) I highly recommend bringing them to the Excalibur.  The rooms are cheaper and even the food is cheaper at the food court than other bigger hotels.  The McDonald's here is way cheaper than the McDonald's at the MGM.  The pool area is way more kid-friendly and the slide pool is a hit.  We will definitely come back here for our next family vacation.",2,0,0

Top priority when looking for a hotel was 1) Centrally located so we can walk as the roads are shut down on the strip after 6pm on New Years Eve 2) Not have to pay an arm and a leg. Excalibur met those criterias and served us well.

Pros:
- PRICE - probably one of the cheapest options on the strip
- LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION - indoor walkway to Luxor & Mandalay Bay. Outside walkway to New York New York
- Decent security presence - guy downstairs verified that people had room keys, made me feel a little safer
- Staff was nice - no snootiness, no attitude
- Paid for a standard room and got upgraded to a widescreen room in Tower II which was pretty nice

Cons:
- Yes, the hotel is older and has seen better days, decor slightly dated, needs repainting, overall the medieval theme is a bit cheesy unless you are less than 10 years old
- 2 of the 5 lamps in the room did not work
- Found hairs on blanket but the linens like the towels, sheets and pillow cases were clean
- Noisy on the lower floors - room was on the 3rd floor and I could hear the New York New York roller coasters
- Slightly dirty elevators (i.e. littered with used kleenex, an occasional snot smear on doors etc.)
- No fridge or coffeemaker although there was a flatscreen TV
- Valet took a long time to retrieve our car (over 30 minutes). Try to avoid picking up your car from the valet during the busy checkout times (between 11am to 1pm) or just do self park and walk
- ""Resort Fee"" - really an additional BS fee for Internet, newspaper and not sure what else: $9.95 + tax  = an additional cost of $11.14 per day

Really, it's not as bad as it sounds. We were in the room from like 3am to 10am daily and it got the job done. I would stay here again (unless I hit the megabucks slot machine jackpot)!

No you won't sight any celebrities here, no michelin star restaurant or anything close to that. If you are looking for luxury, Vegas style and willing to spend the price tag that goes with it, then stay at the Bellagio instead.

1st problem I booked through Hotels.com 8 rooms 2 nights each I then called the hotel to make sure rooms are linked together except for the 1 room we wanted that was smoking we obviously figured that was to be in a different tower. Upon check in I explained to the lady that when I called to verify my rooms the man I spoke with insured me even though we didn't pay extra for strip view we'd more then likely get it bcuz we booked so many rooms. Well nope the lady said no we can't do that ONLY BECAUSE our rooms were already reserved so they'd be together\/ same floor. So we went to our room located in royal tower 2nd floor and it smelled so strong like they poured bottles of cleaner everywhere an our view was of a wall. So I called front desk an they moved us to floor 20 with the view of the roof. An come to find out all 6 of our rooms were on different floors!!! I'm sorry I feel like when I'm paying that mich for that many rooms we should be taken care of! Also was told via phone we'd get 2 vouchers for buffet for booking all the rooms (we were there for a wedding) an was told at desk that no they don't do that for anyone! An my non smoking room smelt like someone had just smoked in it. Also while standing by the stairs by registration a bell hop guy was pushing the cart an I was standing there & he rudely says : Can you move! As I was already moving for him but can't just walk over the other people!!! Oh an that was after they told my friend who had jst checked  in: ""were to busy you need to carry your own bags "" then turned his back to her!!!
2nd for bachlorette party we were getting a limo to a strip club an waited out front well there was a man (middle age thin blk guy white limo ) says: they can't pick u up here but I can take u so we let him take us he gave us his # to call for a ride back an didn't answer an left us stranded!!!

The staff that was all over the casino trying to give you free shows was like walking on a car lot with the sales people attacking you. The staff was very rude, all of them. The rooms were just plain rooms I could have gotten at Best Western! They nickel and dime you for everything. They charged us a $28 ""resort fee"" but refused to tell us what that covered. She said we would have to find out on our own. The staff at one point tried to sell us 3 days on a future trip for $99 but lied to us just to get us to the counter to tell us about the deal! Now I understand that the point of a casino is to take your money but Excalibur puts a whole new meaning to rip off. We went to dinner at Planet Hollywood, toured Ceasers Palace and vistied the Bellagio and none of their hotel staff bothered us walking around at all. The staff sales people followed us all the way to the elevators we had to take to get to our room!!! The hotel is old and not up to date like the rest of Vegas and their building needs serious repair. Needless to say I will be telling everyone I know NOT to stay at this hotel.

It was supposed to be a royal tower room, recently updated, with a king bed. When we arrived to our room, it was anything but royal. It was dark, dingy, and smelled horrible. We also had a lovely view of rocks and rusty maintenance carts. Less than satisfied, we went back to the front desk to speak to a manager. She was very nice and gave a refund for the upgrade charge and put us in a new room. We headed up to our 27th floor strip view room, excited to get our vacation rolling. Once we stepped out of the elevator, we were immediately overcome with unpleasant smells. We entered our room to find that the smoke detector was wrapped in a plastic bags and dirty socks were left on the floor. We also had no dead bolt on our door because it was busted off. Nice one guys. Complaining again wouldn't have gotten us far because they claimed to be fully booked.

Moving on, we decided to check out the pool which was okay. Nothing special. We spent the majority of our time in the adults only area, which you have to pay to get in! For a pool that is supposedly nicer, it was pretty nasty. The layer of grime covering the pool is nauseating and you can see a thick layer of oil floating on the water.

We asked for a room with a fridge and were told that it would cost 25 bucks extra A NIGHT. Are you serious?! We were then told there were no rooms with views unless we paid extra. Fine, whatever, we just want to sleep there. After receiving the room keys, I found that I could not stay in that room. it was floor 13 room 66, and those are just not happy\/lucky numbers to me. I went back to get the room changed and da-da-da suddenly I have been given a room with a view, free of charge.

Anyway, the room was a standard room with two queen beds. The lighting was horrible, except in the bathroom. Everything was clean, and when we asked for extra towels, they were very nice about it. The beds were comfy, and the view was decent. There was also a flat screen tv, but not much playing.

Like any hotel in vegas, the downstairs casino area is heavily polluted with the smell of cigarettes, so you asthma children beware.

So we were aware we weren't going to be getting anything amazing, but we just weren't expecting the quality to be this bad.

Our biggest gripe was that we placed the standard ""Do Not Disturb"" door tag on our room every day, but we would come back to our room cleaned every night. This is NOT OK! We thought we were going crazy until the second night.

Also, in a Deluxe Standard Room, there is no fridge, so don't bother with getting leftovers from your meals. They won't keep. There's also no coffee, tea, water in the room. The safe we had was also broken. The room was dirty. Windows and photos were covered in hand and body prints (ew). Mystery stains on the clothed headboards and chairs. The lamp had a large water (or something) stain on it. Last, the TV screen was broken, so there was no point ordering a movie.

 This castle casino is clearly from a bygone era (the 80s are a bygone era?!  I'm feeling a little old here all of a sudden!)  Whatever they used to do out in the moats is clearly over and done with.  

If you're in Tower 1, you'll get sturdy yet shabby furnishing.  But all is clean, not a bedbug in sight (whew!).  The spa was closed, but 2 of the pools were open (it's winter still so clearly it's not gonna be the biggest draw), but the pools were only open at 10am til I think 5pm--so no early am workout aside from the little gym they have. (bring your own foam roller, or fr equivalent, they don't got any).

Most of the arcade machines were older and the wack a mole machines were decrepit.  I still ended up having fun here, skeeball and some fun shooting games.

If you're a nonsmoking or exsmoker californian, you're gonna hate the casino.  Thick clouds are everywhere.  Your sinuses will be searing with pain.  I recommend you move further up North to some of the newer casinos if that sort of thing bothers you.  If not, then light up and get rid of some cash!

I've only been to Vegas twice and one time I made the mistake of going cheap and staying here. From the outside the hotel looks like King Arthur and Andy Warhol had a baby and fed that baby Gerber shrooms. Its a super colorful and ugly castle. If you're five you might think it looks cool, but Vegas was not meant for five year olds.

The inside isn't much better. The decor isn't very nice and the place is in drastic need of some cleaning. I took a souvenir home with me, a piece of the railing (the end decorative piece) had fallen off and I picked it up, couldn't find anyone to give it to and put it in my jacket pocket to find someone later. I forgot about until I opened up my suitcase when I got home. I feel like pieces of the railing shouldn't be falling off...

The casino is not great. You should probably head to another casino if you want to do some gambling. The arcade is awful. I went there with my gf at the time to kill time the day we were leaving (I was 21 but she was only 20 at the time so we couldn't do too much). It was basically falling apart and most of the games were awful. I won her a stuffed dog at the water shooting horse race game. The dog had a hole in it and was missing whiskers. When I asked for another one the lady gave me attitude but finally handed it over. Thankfully this one was in better shape.

The rooms are pretty standard. Nothing special. Two nights in a row a fire alarm went off waking us up and kind of freaking us out. After the first one I just thought whatever. When it happened again the next night I was pretty annoyed and called the front desk the next morning. They told me they'd comp me a night. When I got my credit card statement I found out they didn't. That sucked. 

Of course if you're in Vegas you won't be spending too much time in the room, so if all you want is a place to put your bags then this is a pretty good option. But it's also pretty far off the center of the strip so it can be a trek to get most places.",5,9,4

But now... you're corporatized, bland and quite frankly - horrible. The rooms are very outdated, the decor is very plain-jane, and the staff look like they've been there since the real Excalibur was known as the Sword In The Stone days.

That being said, I suppose that's why you're one of the cheapest hotels on the strip, right? Because everything else absolutely blows. Buffet is CRAP, do NOT do the breakfast or lunch buffet. Also, DO NOT eat at any of the restaurants IN Excalibur. I repeat and urge you of this.

Also, the A\/C was set at 72 and our room was freezing. My guess is bc the unit is next to the hot window and will keep kicking on. We had to set it to 75 just to get to room temperature. Our TV also had scratches on the screen and came in fuzzy. Not watchable. 

Pool: several pools and a water slide make this a fun pool spot. Adult pool is $10 pp which kind of sucks. Also the chairs fill up FAST. Me and my two friends opted for the poolside package with the nicer chairs, snack and water bucket, umbrella, and prime chair seating by the pool and hot tub for $50 total. VERY WORTH IT considering we stayed at the pool for 8 hours that day. We would have roasted without the umbrella. Pool bar also has a nice selection. $23 for big a souvenir cup and $16 refills was great. 

Casino: Did not smell at all like the reviews I've read. I'm guessing Excalibur finally sprung for some air freshener bc it smelled nice to me. I also won the most here playing slots on my trip. 

Food court: Some places open for 24 hrs was awesome. The advertise that there's a McDonalds but THEY LEFT A YEAR AGO. 

Location: Not too far from the main strip but not quite close enough to walk. Monorail stop is a hefty 20 min walk through the MGM. Perfect if you rented a car. 

Overall: Nice clean rooms and worth the price. I however won't be back until I have kids. Kids would love it but if you want something Closer to the action or aren't planning on renting a car, pay the extra money and stay at the Flamingo or Harrah's.",1,0,0

I'm assuming it's because when I checked in I had to give them my id (obviously) and it was my birthday week. But we were only given a room on the 4th floor wamp wamp. I guess no one really goes to Vegas just to stay inside the room for the view of the strip lights, in which our view was just of the pool.

The whole time walking to the room walking to the room I had a big fat smile on my face and not just because I was in Vegas but just the thought that I had gotten a free upgrade. Since the guy from the front desk never told me that I was getting an upgrade just a happy birthday and what not.

The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was gorgeous with a wall to wall granite counter top and a giant mirror. Perfect for selfies! We stayed at Excalibur for 3 nights and they really did a good job cleaning up after us every day.

Excalibur is by far the cheapest hotel\/ resort\/ casino on the strip. A little on the lower side of this strip but it's less than a 2 mile walk from the other end like to the Venetian LV. You're saving about $100 per night staying here rather than staying at the more upscale hotel blocks away.

It's really lively at night and since it is more family friendly than other Las Vegas strip hotels there were kids running around everywhere but I didn't mind that. At least the majority of children were tucked in the lower basement level of the Casino. They have a more arcade type setting where the entrance to the Tournament of Kings is located.

Ok it's a very good price for a strip hotel and the location is great. It's an older hotel but that's never bothered me. Our big draw cards coming here were the location, the price and the pool. Last year they had an adults only pool where you could drink, smoke and generally not be disturbed by those under 18 (which, staying at a themed hotel like this, is harder to avoid).

So imagine our disgust when we get to the pool on our first day of ten and discover it now costs $10 a day to use the adult pool!! This is nothing more than blatant money grabbing, and left such a sour taste in our mouths. Coupled with the resort fees that don't even cover wifi in the rooms and pushy sales people at the entrances, we were extremely disappointed.

I mean really, I know the sales people are only doing a job, but one night my friends and I were struggling down to our rooms after being at the supermarket LOADED with heavy pallets of water and food, and one of those people tried to stop us...I snapped at her ""Are you serious?!"" A little logic goes a long way!

So unfortunately for our yearly trip to Vegas we will now have to look elsewhere. It's a good basic hotel if you just need somewhere to sleep, but for our 10 days it was too long without a decent pool area and being hassled by the sales guys every day.",0,0,0

There are 3 computers for mobile self check-in, but it requires a code (received via email) to scan on the mobile check-in computer. I tried to get the code while standing in line by checking in online, but it said error, no rooms available. I waited in line for about 20-30 minutes before I got to the front. Once there, check-in was fast and the front desk staff was friendly and informative. I recommend checking in online prior to arriving, so upon arrival, guests can use the mobile check-in computer. It's much faster if there is no need to talk to a front desk employee. The computers were empty; no one was using them.

I got a room in the Royal Tower, which was convenient for me since I used Uber\/Lyft a couple of times, and rideshare pick-ups\/drop-offs is right outside the door next to the Royal Tower elevators. Otherwise, access to the strip\/Las Vegas Blvd is by the Resort Tower, across the casino.

The room itself is standard, with 2 queen beds. It has the basics - TV with option for express checkout, a desk, air conditioner\/thermostat, and basic toiletries such as shampoo, lotion, and bar soap (no conditioner or body wash). The room has a spacious walk-in shower, but no tub although it used to be a tub. The toilet is worn out with scratches and flushes very slowly. For a trip to Vegas with limited time spent in the room, the room is good and has all the basics one would need. My room had a nice view of Luxor (the pyramid) next door. I observed a nice sunset\/sunrise with a partial mountain view. The location is okay, not too bad with an easy walk to many other hotels.",4,1,1

I do have quite a few fond memories at the Excalibur when I was younger.  I remember being awed at the sight of the mystical castle with Merlin the Wizard standing atop one of the castle towers.  While the parents spent their time on the main floor gambling, there was a fun kid center at the bottom floor filled with games.  It was like being transported to another time and place.

However, now that I am older and have to fund my Vegas trips now, the Excalibur is cheaper than most on the strip but even then would NOT be my choice for budget hotel.  I booked a room at the Excalibur for my friends and me.  When we got into the room, it was small and felt like it needed to be renovated.  There was an underlying smell that could not be identified or extinguished despite our efforts.  There are more updated rooms that were available but appears for a little more.  The self-parking for the hotel was a little far from the hotel so it is not really convenient.

Plus, reasons to like it for nostalgic reasons are gone.  The Merlin that once stood there has been replaced by a billboard and the kid center is not so friendly or as extensive as it once felt.  It was good to know they still have the Tournament of Kings show where you get to see dueling knights fight each other for the crown.  Although at $60+ price tag, I am not sure I would be willing to shell out the money simply to reminisce

The one major perk of the Excalibur is the location.  Considering its price tag, it has a decent spot to most of the nicer parts of the Vegas strip.  Plus, it does have a monorail that takes you to Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  However, somehow this perk is not enough to justify the poor upkeep of the facilities.

Overall, I would say that Excalibur lacks the magic of most of the hotels on the Strip making it a lower tier recommended hotel.",4,1,2

I had been roaming the strip and gambling all day while drinking said Coors Lights and stopped back at my room while waiting for my husband.  I thought to myself, ""hey, I bet they have something I'd like at the Excalibur.""  And they did.

There was band and they were great.  You have everything you need or want at this lounge -

*Old people cutting a rug to 80's tunes.
*Smoke that hangs thick in the air (not necessary, but expected in Vegas right?)
*Low lounge chairs
*Cold drinks, not reasonably priced though

My own personal experience however was one of enjoyment and the Excalibur met our expectations.
Check in was a breeze and room was nice and clean and had everything we needed. Some people complain about the rooms being a little small ""which they are not"", not being as modern as other hotel rooms, which once again I found them to be on par with other hotel chains, plasma TV's nice decor and comfortable beds. Some people even complain they do not have a coffee maker in the room but in all honesty, the hotel does not want you to spend much time in your room. While people are in their rooms, they are not in the casino spending their money and everyone knows that is why they want you there and who goes to Vegas to sit in their rooms?
I like the little coffee\/snack bar they have at the entrance to the corridor that leads to your rooms. It was nice to get up early each morning and get my coffee and a nice sweet treat and return to my room and drink some good coffee, while getting ready for another day. 
The casino in the Excalibur is very large and I love the atmosphere there. I only ever play the slot machines and the Excalibur has one of the best selection to choose from, catering to every budget, from those with a big wallet to those with less to spend.
I do hear some complain about having to walk through the casino with their kids to get to their rooms but Las Vegas in NOT for kids.........Vegas is a theme park for adults!! If you want a kiddie friendly environment, then Disney World is where you need to be, leave Vegas alone for the adults to enjoy!
Also once again the casino wants as much as your time and money as possible and so it makes sense for them to position everything so a walk past those slot machines is mandatory but I know this going in and have no problem with that.
So to review, yes the Excalibur is older then many of the other casino's and the rooms may not be as glam as some of the others but the Excalibur is not trying to claim otherwise. 
For those with a little tighter budget, you get what you pay for and on this the Excalibur delivers. This is why we stayed there and were not disappointed. 
In the end, the rooms are big enough, modern enough, comfortable enough and clean enough for stay.
Would I stay at the Excalibur again? Sure and one day I hope too!",1,1,0

The check in can be a little long, but just apply for an Mlife card and you get VIP check in (you can apply online or in the casinos). This is one of the more kid-friendly hotels on the strip with the whole ""castle"" appeal and an arcade downstairs called the ""Fun Dungeon"". We spent some time gambling for free drinks then going downstairs to play DDR and Air Hockey, like all the cool 20-something-year-olds do. Hahaha 
The pricing is really great too. We paid 63 dollars (not including resort fees) for a 2 queen bedroom with a great view of the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Tower two is a bit nicer, just because it's the newer tower of them all. They do offer smoking and none smoking rooms. 
Parking here can either be Valet or self parking, I felt the parking lot was safe enough to stay in, and it was free too!
You do have the ability to ride the free tram to get to either one of those hotels quickly, or there is a quick walkway to get on the strip.
I love that this place has Dicks last resort... A hilarious restaurant to check out if you've never been to one, you have to take everything they say with a grain of salt, but they do have a great happy hour!

So at least my expectations were met! We paid very little for the room and were in it an average of 4 hours a night anyway - but just a few small things could have made it less crap, and for that complacency, I give 2 stars. 

Before going, you should know the following:
The hotel bar is a Dick's Last Resort. Yes, it's that bad. 
The jello shots contain zero alcohol. 

These are pertinent. Additional info:

It's well documented that it smells of smoke. That's because it is old. That's just the way it is. However, the fact that the shower is grimy and gross has nothing to do with age and everything to do with bad cleaning. The AC sounds like an aeroplane taking off, and the lifts are very slow. Again, it's old. But, the cleaning staff stand outside your door at 9am and have a very loud chat while apparently banging everything in sight with mallets, and that's got nothing to do with age. 

Mostly though, it's just bad because the casino itself is so depressingly drab and rubbish. Luxor is cheap too (and but a 5 minute walk away - so escape) but it doesn't make you want to claw your eyes out. The waitstaff look like they want to die, the dealers are robots, it's dirty, and just plain sad. The hilariously bad 'medieval' artwork will only keep you amused for so long. 

Oh, and the staff hate the guests. The 'concierge' deserves those inverted commas for her comment ""it's over there"" without any indication of where ""there"" was, then just ignoring us. The luggage retrievers take hours. 

Breakfast was the biggest plate of food ever - Excalibur's crowning glory was its hash browns. But - it is CHEAP.",5,6,4

There was a huge check in line when we arrived. Luckily we are Mlife members and were able to bypass it. When we got to our room 2 lamps didn't work. I tried to call, but the phone rang and rang. I went to the front desk and the staff member said it would be fixed right away. It wasn't. I called the next day and it was fixed by afternoon. 

This hotel attracts many families I think mostly because of cost. We reserved a Royal room which was ""updated"". It had good bedding, the best thing about the room. It had an old fan in the bathroom, the towels had some hair in them and it really didn't feel clean. On the second day, housekeeping didn't leave us a floor towel or refurbish out shampoo and soap. The air conditioning was cold and consistent. The furniture in the room was old and worn down. But I've been in worse hotels. 

The casino is smaller than other hotels and it's easier to get from one end to another. We tried the breakfast buffet. It was ok at best. A lot of food items were dried out like the potatoes. The scrambled eggs were watery. The French toast and pancakes were hard. There are food court spots like Cinnabon, Starbucks, Krispy Kreme etc which are less expensive for families. 

We went to the pool in the morning. The main pool opens at 11a so there are a lot of people just sitting around. The pool with the slide opened at 9a. It gets crowded quick as do the chairs. Mostly kids at this point. I have to say there was a lot of debris in these pools. I looked in the mail pool before it opened. I saw shiny objects in the bottom. When it opened I went in and retrieved them. Necklace parts. I handed them to the lifeguard and asked if they ever vacuum the pool out. He didn't seem very co concerned. There was a lot of debris in this pool. The spa pool had bandaids and hair floating around and the water was cloudy. I felt gross. The food shop next door was ok as and there were a couple of bars for alcohol. The pool area has a couple of waitresses taking food and drink orders which was nice. You can also rent a cabana for about $175 including snacks, tv and fridge.

I'm not sure I would ever stay here again, but here's the thing, I didn't have any high expectations so I wasn't surprised at all its faults. This hotel needs serious refurbishments. But some may enjoy the old school feel. The pool was so gross and it's freezing cold as well. If you're on a budget and don't really care about quality, you can get some good deals here.",1,0,1

We got some decent discount deal online when reserving 2 rooms (with 2 Queen size beds each) almost 2 months in advance.  Average price of $147\/night per room excluding taxes and resort fee.
Check-in process was very smooth. The hotel receptionist was very kind in getting us two rooms in Tower 2 near the elevators on the 27th floor, since one of our family members is semi-handicapped. The rooms were clean and roomy, although somewhat dated. Sound insulation is rather poor, we could easily hear conversations in the adjacent rooms. There was no small fridge or coffee maker in the room, but there is hair dryer, ironing board and a plasma TV set in the room.
The hotel offers all the essential amenities, including few stores and a Food Court on the second level from the lobby area. There are couple of Starbucks inside the hotel (one by the casino) and few other restaurants that we did not get to try. There is access to a free tram that runs from the Excalibur Hotel to the Mandalay Bay Hotel, making a stop at the Luxor. The Hotel also has a walkway to the New York New York Hotel next door. We found the location of our hotel actually quite convenient (close to the airport) despite of the fact that it is not right in the heart of the Strip, but it's still walking distance to several hotels nearby (MGM, New York New York, Luxor, Montecarlo, Mandala Bay, etc.).
The Excalibur looks a bit old inside, some carpets near and inside the elevators could be better cleaned. But overall it is a very good hotel if you are planning to visit Las Vegas and don't plan to spend much time inside the room. Once you visit other hotels like Bellagio, Mandala Bay, Winn, or Aria, the Excalibur will look and feel more run-down. It is still a practical and convenient hotel to stay if you get a good discount rate.",1,0,0

The Excalibur is dated.  I was surprised by the fact that I didn't dislike it as much as I thought I would.  The place is large and finding the steps to the second floor took me awhile, but once I did it, I was able to get to the second floor showroom easily.

I am always surprised by the large number of people that are in the casino.  Even when the economy was at its lowest, the place always seemed to be busy.

The showroom on the second floor, which is shared  by several productions, is a nice enough room.  The long tables with 8 seats per table can be a little uncomfortable as they have them very close to each other. If the show is good, you don't think of this.

Parking is good in the garage in the back, but it may give you a longer walk to get into the casino.  I generally try to find a surface spot parallel to Trop.

While not one of my favorites on the Strip, the Excalibur is OK for the reasons I go there.",2,0,1

This would not have been my first choice, but the group I was traveling with insisted we stay there since it's kid friendly. Really the only time it is kid friendly is in the morning while everyone is still sleeping, but on the weekends around 4:00 p,m. the go-go girls start dancing on the bar right next to the casino. From the main entrance to the elevator goes right past them and between two bars, stupid location with families coming from the strip trying to get to their room. 

Speaking of elevators, on the weekends expect at least 20 minute wait time, find the stairs early so you save some time. Just hope you're not on the 25th floor! 

Kids arcade was huge, but half of the games either don't work at all, take your money or don't pay off the tickets. Really needs to be overhauled and updated!

Were told rooms have been updated, maybe. They definately are not maintained however. Mold on bathroom ceiling, stains on curtains and carpet, typical vegas, not in the room much. Missing a lot of typical extras hotels provide, limited tv channels, no free wifi, found out later internet access was included in the $28 resort fee - whatever. 

Generally, the location on the strip is ideal, close to everything, rooms are cheap, its crowed because the rooms are cheap, drinks are expensive, didn't eat there nothing seemed appealing so went to the nicer hotels for dinner. Not aging gracefully and not what I was expecting.",0,0,0

They had people waiting at the front door acted like they were going to check you in when in reality they were pimping some Time share like presentation.  

Then we stood in the hour long queue line to check in. Having pre-paid in advance and thinking we had secured the room we looked at much to our surprise we got short sheeted.  

The room was dirty and obviously somebody had been smoking in the room. To make matters worse we had to walk the length of a football field from the elevator to get to this smoky room.

Long the way there was an abundance of marijuana smoke coming from this wing. 

The carpet is dirty and worn out the fixtures are also old and worn.

When we called to bring all of these items to the attention of management, they were very Uninterested in even attempting to resolve even one of the complaints or move us to another room.  Their attitude was basically tough shit, you screwed up booking a room with us. They did offer us to defumigate the room if we left for 2 or 3 hours. Can you believe that?!  Defumigate with what?  Another toxic chemical?  I will battle this with American Express to not pay these bastards!  

Bottom line, I will tell everyone I know what a miserable experience this place was to me and my wife. And I would never take my kids to this place.

MGM you need to do something about this, you have a group of reckless managers running this hotel into the ground.too bad I can't give it a zero. Offering up a non smoking room that has obviously been smoked in doesn't deserve to be paid for at the premium price

The casino is very typical vegas, noisy and smells of cigarettes, some casinos have found a way to get the smoke smell out, some haven't. This is a big hotel for families, so if you hate kids running around, maybe best to avoid. The food court is convenient for quick bites or snacks.

When we arrived at Excalibur, we were lost as usual for the expansive casino\/hotels in Vegas. But there was good signage that led us to the registrar desk.

When we got there, the line wasn't too long, as it can be sometimes on the weekends. I asked at the Mlife counter if they could print me out another card, but with a rude demeanor, the staff member said they could print it for me when I check-in. So we waited in line, and got a really nice check-in clerk. I think his name was Ryan, or Brian? Anyway, he was great. Very nice, even got us a view of New York New York when he couldn't get a room with a view of Luxor like I requested. He printed out my Mlife card for me and entered my Southwest Rapid Rewards number so I could get points for the stay there too.
He gave us a room in Tower II, 17th floor, all the way in the back of the hall. That wasn't good for the nights we came up stumbling and too drunk to travel by feet very far. One night, my friend tried literally rolling on the ground to the room because she was having so much trouble. It was very comical.

When we first arrived at our room, it seemed fine. It wasn't until I walked around without my shoes on that I realized there was a big wet spot next to one of the beds. Who knows what that could be. But we tried not to think too much of it and just wore our shoes in room. 

I also sought outlets for our phone chargers. I only found one on the lamp stand. So I moved the center table and removed the plug for the alarm clock, so we could both charge our phones. That was annoying.

The bathroom was stocked with the usual amenities: lotion, shampoo, soap, and nice close-up mirror that's good for us women putting on makeup. And the lighting was way better than a lot of other hotels' lighting in their bathrooms. 

However on the last night we were there I came home craving a shower around 4\/5 am. Unfortunately, the shower heat wouldn't go very high. So I was stuck taking a luke warm shower for what spanned about an hour (don't ask me why I wanted to take such a long shower). Finally, the heat came on and I had to turn it down to a more comfortable temperature. I stayed in for another 2 hours without complaint. Yeah yeah, I know that's forever. It's by far the longest shower I can remember ever taking. 

What I liked best about the room was the huge TV and the beautiful view. Everything else was ehhhh.

When we checked out we had the hotel hold onto our bags for us while we go to a pool party before our flight. There was a gigantic line of people doing this, but when we eventually got up front the staff were nice and we had no issues getting our bags back later.

Overall, I would stay at Excalibur again because of the price. But if I'm not on such a tight budget next time I'll definitely be staying somewhere else.",0,0,0

My room came out to less than 70 per night after my comp was applied, and got a free buffet. I won on the slots so I actually left with more money than I came with so that ended up working out for me. ***edit after I won 500 on slots some guy approached me and asked if I wanted to buy drugs which was super creepy***

The service was awesome also while playing slots. I constantly had a drink to sip on while gambling.

My daughter and I booked a room here for a night after hiking at nearby National Parks.

The check in was easy enough, using mobile check in but later I saw an extra 50 charge added to my room, taken out of my account. When I inquired, they told me with mobile checkin they automatically take 50 out for incidentals.  I was pissed that they didnt notify me of this. 50 is not much but it is the principal, especially after pre paying for the room, resort, and parking fees.

Anyway - up to our room. It was decent enough.  UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN WE FOUND BED BUGS ON top of the bedspread (see pic and video).

When I called down to the front desk to let them know - they were nonchalant and aloof and didnt seem too concerned.  This is sooooo gross.  We were worried sick we were taking bed bugs with us in our suitcase home, which I have heard is really hard to control once they are in your home.

We booked services at the spa. We both received massages which were horrible.  My 7 year old  could have given me a better massage, I am sure.

The pool closes at 6. Why??? it is 113 degrees out, and we are charged a resort fee, so open the pool.

Parking was easy but it was 10 a day. Good location.

No fridge or microwave in the room.

I was surprised by the lack of just basic maintenance and cleanliness.  The windows and doors were filthy and fingerprints and handprints were all over all day long.  Does no one take any pride or do routine cleaning? It isn't Disneyland but come on......

Everything in the hotel is expensive, water, food, etc. There are very few healthy choices.

  ... Buca di Beppo - American chain of Italian-style re-heated food
  ... Dick's Last Resort - The Applebee's of Vegas
  ... A Steakhouse with $41 Rib Eye Steak or a 3-course Sirloin meal for $37
  ... Baja Fresh - Mexican Fast Food
  ... Food Court with Krispy Kreme, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Cinnabon, & more
  ... Octane Lounge (Fri\/Sat) & the ""Lounge"" are bars for adults to reminisce
 * Entertainment is great if you're letting mom plan your trip
  ... Tournament of Kings: Jousting banquet ($66) using your hands to eat
  ... Thunder From Down Under: Mom's\/Girl's Night Out ($57 - $67) - chiseled abs
  ... Australian Bee Gees - Tribute show ($45-$60) not as fun as Fallon & Timberlake on SNL
  ... Fun Dungeon is a huge arcade full of games (10am-10pm)
  ... Pool with bar & food service full of kids taking a Dungeon break
  ... Shopping is limited to mall-style boutiques for kids and mom's
  ... A Wedding Chapel - Good luck.

I was just there in June, so trust me... one night was plenty!!!

I've stayed at different hotels the past 9 trips, from higher end (Venetian) as well as the Flamingo, Mirage, New York New York, Treasure Island, etc.  I have means of comparison.  

Since we were spending one night in Vegas...we wanted cheap, but decent.  We didn't want bed bugs.  My sister stayed here a few times in the past and said it was fine.  I also haven't been to this end of the strip my past few trips out there, so it was something different for me.

You sleep there, you take a shower... and most of the time is spent out and about so if you're traveling on a budget, or just don't really care... no need to waste money on the fancy schmancy hotel.  This was the cheapest I could find ON the strip...Circus Circus and Stratosphere may have been cheaper, but this place is closer to everything on the strip.  In the past, you could probably get away at a hotel without paying that stupid resort fee...these days, it's hard to avoid and you get things like wifi and access to the gym.  Yeah, I don't work out in Vegas...I do a ton of walking instead.  I do still think the resort fee is a major rip off and should just be in the room rate, so be it.  This place doesn't give out coupons to use AT the hotel with your resort fee like others I've stayed at.

I am at the ""pearl"" level with my MLife card so I was pleasantly surprised to beat the line with express check in ... that process was super speedy, even though I checked in a few hours after the rush time.  And yes, EVERY hotel has that 3pm ""Rush"", not just this one.

Yes, this place is dated...but it's cute, it has personality, it has a ""theme"".

It is one of the cheaper hotels on The Strip but we didn't even feel that we got what we paid for it.  It's a nice location (the reason why we picked it) but in the future I would gladly pay more for a better room than the one we stayed.

The casino and sports book are pretty small and not very exciting.  There was duct tape on the carpet holding down some temporary wires, etc.  It just felt blah inside.  The clientele and workers of the hotel\/casino reflect the care level of the Excalibur.

Took an hour to check in. Reception desk people are less than friendly. Requested extra pillows, given a hard time.  After third phone call they said they were already delivered. Not to our room.

The hotel...when we arrived a nice clerk lady attended us with giving us the roomkey, she gave us good information and was very friendly. Also a plus on this hotel is they dont take a deposit hold on your creditcard for using roomservice, the Phone, for the moviechannels etc if you dont wish to have this (with lots of hotels you are requiered to do this and they can hold up to 100 dollars for each night you stay there!! so 10 nights 1000 dollars) we also got a free upgrade to a what bigger room with dining area.. ok the rooms are ok.. big rooms, big beds, screentv, but the tv was really blurry..but really dated! only the bathroom shower was new which was most important for us... in general it wasnt a care for us because we werent in vegas to spend time in the room.. the cleaning personal was very nice, we didnt need a room clean but did gave a lady some tip for giving us new towals, toilet paper etc. Always friendly. also a big plus for me was that they had a gym!! this was very nice and i was there every day. also nice personal.. you got free water they would bring to you when you were excersizing and free clean towels. the pool was heated but i didnt go in because for me the weather outside was too cold although lots of people were in the pool... also a big plus they had mcdonalds and Starbucks inside the hotel! so in the morning coffee and egg mcmuffins! what i didnt like about the hotel, i didnt think personally that there was like a cozy admosfere.. the hotel for my taste was a bit too big and unpersonal, but this is personal taste.. a good but also bad point is when you want to go to your room.. you have to show your key what is good, but there were a few ""guards"" with bad attitutes as if they were prison guards... a blonde bigger lady screamed at me for showing my card, while i was looking for it in my purse and i didnt crossed her yet and she already has seen me before.. she was just being rude.. the price of the hotel was ok for being during the new years eve, but also not cheap, mostly because of the ridiculious high resort fees, but on the strip this is normal so... if i would go back.... no this was a one time experience, not that is was bad, but i have seen better hotels for better prices...",0,0,0

However, upon entry, one immediately notices that the air is heavy, stale, and filled with cigarettes and regret.

Following the path to the elevators through a sea of lights and sounds to distract the guests from the decaying castle, a very large sign begging visitors to enter fast food chain ""Dick's Last Resort"" is unavoidable. It seems a fitting metaphor to explain the reasoning for staying at the Excalibur, though the symbolism is clouded by the graffiti of ""I Heart Dicks"" bumper stickers and a long row of colorful frozen cocktail dispensers waiting to be poured into the yard-long containers that adorn the necks of the Hoveround drivers that crowd the walkways.

The room itself is standard, with attempts at upgrades to keep pace with the newer hotels falling flat, but still appreciated. Ideal room temperature is difficult to achieve as the wall A\/C moans and wheezes in distress, much like a Toyota Tercel attempting a steep grade in the summer. Achieving a restful night is also difficult aside from temperature fluctuations due in part to firm, dorm room-thin mattresses and the late-night battle cries of bachelorette parties reeling from the sexual arousal of the ""Thunder Down Under"" playing just a few floors below.

Overall, the guest experience at the Excalibur is not at all what I expected. But, taking a page out of Arthurian legend and seeing the quest for glory being marred by unexpected challenges and encounters, it's undeniable that the Excalibur lived up to its name.",1,1,1

Our cab driver probably put it best when we jokingly asked him on our way, if Excalibur was the best hotel in Vegas. His answer ""Yes! 20 years ago"" was probably accurate.

Check in went pretty fast, there are some hidden fees, not familiar to me. $20 early check-in fee (before 3pm), $18 per day resort fee (oh, didn't you read the small print?).

Rooms are dated but have nice flat screen TVs, nothing too exciting.

After staying here for the night, I woke up to my left side feeling itchy and a bunch of little bumps spread around my shoulder area.

If it was from the pool water, there's no way that it's just clustered around one part of my body. If it was an allergic reaction\/rash wouldn't it be all over my legs since it was submerged in water for four hours?

Prior to this stay Excalibur was one of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas.  I have been going to Vegas for the last 15 years.  Excalibur was an easy four star review for me, but has been going downhill.  Since I didn't join Yelp! until recently, this is my first review.  So here is the rundown:

1.  When I drove in cones were everywhere.  It blocked off various areas and made everyone confused.  When I drove in the valet part of the parking lot, I was yelled at.  Already a bad impression.

2.  I went to check in at around noon.  I was told my room wasn't ready.  I was fine with this since check-in is at 3PM.  However, the person at the counter said it may not be until 4 or 5PM.  This I had an issue with since I had show tickets that night.  I asked for the manager and I complained about the first issue and this issue.  The manager totally ignored the first issue, and with the second issue she kept saying it would be at 3PM.  I said I was confused since the previous person said it may not be until 4 or 5.  Then the person who was helping me said she never said that!  So I was already disgusted.  They said they would put a rush on my room.  I said it's not necessary since I was told it would be ready by 3PM.  They did anyways, though.  The manager wasn't too friendly.  She seemed more annoyed that I had a complaint.

3.  So with our luggage in hand, I checked some of it in while we waited.  My party and I decided to go get lunch at the buffet.  Keep in mind I already saw advertisements for their buffet.  So what do we see when we talk up to it?  The buffet is closed for renovations.  I'm so glad we were told that at check-in.  Oh wait, no we weren't.  We weren't told a thing about it.  So we walked over to the Luxor instead.  The buffet was closed the entire trip.  We were able to eat at other places, but it was annoying.  They posted ads everywhere about their buffet even after I checked it.  It was on their channel on the TV, on posters, etc.

4.  Once we got our rooms and settled in, I did my usual inspection.  The AC wasn't working at all and I discovered it had not been defrosted.  So I had to take care of that in order to have a decent nights sleep in the room.  The TV didn't work right half the time either.  Sure, you don't come to Vegas to watch TV, but sometimes you need to.  The room was decent otherwise.

5.  Now for the most part I broke even when I was gambling, but there were some annoyances on the casino floor.  There were hardly any waitresses around to take drink orders.  I waited a good 10 minutes to find someone to take my order, then another 10 to get my drink.  However, there were plenty of people around to ask me if I wanted a ""M Life"" card or whatever their card is.  I go to Vegas about once a year, maybe once every couple years.  So I don't want the damn card.  But they didn't stop asking.  I finally blew up at one of the people and said I am tired of being asked and I wanted to be left alone.  They said it was their job. The other annoyance is that they had other people on the floor pushing show tickets and other crap.  It was the worst I have ever seen.  I went to other casinos and did not have these issues, so it could be an Excalibur thing.  However, the dealers at the tables were nice and the casino floor was clean.  A friend of mine did have someone, possibly a prostitute, hit on him when he was gambling at 4AM.  So security could be better.

I picked Excalibur since I love castles, dragons, etc.  However, I won't be staying again in the future unless I see some of these issues are resolved.  I'll visit for the shops, the wonderful Tournament of Kings show, etc.  But I felt like I received horrible treatment by the employees there.  They were more concerned about making money rather than making sure I was satisfied.",0,0,0

Easy access to the tram that goes to Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  Bridge walkway takes you over to MGM Grand.  There is a McDonald's if you wanna eat on the cheap, and there is Dick's Last Resort which provides an interesting and fun experience.  They also have free music\/dancing at night.  The 24 hour cafe is also pretty good, especially for the price!

This place suffers from droves of cheap hoes in Forever21 outfits and their boyfriends in cargo shorts. 

But that's no reason to hate on it as much as people seem to. It's a cheap, kinda downtrodden hotel - you're getting what you pay for. My biggest criticism was our shower. NO WATER PRESSURE. No tub. Housekeeping also only seemed to appear once every couple days, but they were super sweet when they did. Staff was nice. Casino was aight.

You can kill yourself on all the carbs upstairs. Pizza Hut, Buca di Beppo, Cinnabon. Food generally stays open late, but if you miss it, there's a 24-hour store with a decent selection of fresh sandwiches.

Shout out to the gym facilities - clean and lots of options for working out. Pretty peaceful in terms of attendance. Thunder From Down Under, the Aussie strip show, has its residence in Excalibur, so on any given day you can work out alongside these hella nice bodies. That's either going to excite you or intimidate you ... I was intimidated. The spa facilities were also nice - it costs $10 to use the base level rooms, which include a TV lounge with fruit, NICE showers, and a sink area with lots of extra products and a hairdryer.

The pool ...... yeah. Don't know. Seems nice, but again, hoes everywhere. Basic, basic hoes. It is nice they have an ""adult"" pool for $10 entry - fewer people in there and a bit more peaceful. But like everywhere else in Vegas, loud music curated by a DJ.",1,2,0

The casino drink service (which used to be great) is horrific. The great little perks like the 24\/7 McDonalds is replaced by an expensive ""breakfast fast food"" restaurant, and it's basically a McDonald's! Ice machines on SEVERAL floors did not work (I told numerous staff and maintenance workers). The ""24 hour"" Johnny Rockets was closed when we stopped in at 5am! The casino machines are tighter, the machines we did play are gone, and the overall feel of the place is not as exciting as it had been in the past. NOW, the icing on the cake is the new PAID PARKING MGM resorts has implemented. What I used to love about Excaliber is the ability to park right outside my tower entrance. Now, I was basically forced to park in the farthest reach of the parking garage. The lot is redesigned in a manner, that it takes some serious navigation and driving to find your way in\/ out. What used to take minutes to leave the resort, now takes over half an hour! Out of frustration I did pay for valet one night. When I returned later in the evening I was TURNED AWAY and told it was full! So they basically sold my PAID Parking spot and I had to self park (again) in the farthest corner of the garage .

The pool closed at 7 pm (the water slide at 6pm).  What a better way to spend family time but in the pool, and a little later when the sun isn't blazing down. The pool hours really need to be extended.  You should also be able to use the jacuzzi's in the evening.  We were also disappointed on the game floor (dungeon).  It didn't open until 10:30 am, and even then, none of the carnival games were attended. The only option was video games. My son was really disappointed, as we planned to spend some time there before heading home on our last day.  It was also extremely annoying to be stopped 5 or 6 times anytime you walked through the hotel, by the people trying to sell you dinner packages and other entertainment tickets.

The room was just OKAY. =\/ It was standard, i guess.. All i needed to just get through the night. Good thing it wasn't a rat hole. It was decent. It's not like I would've been staying in the room throughout my whole vacation.

If you just need a place to crash when you're in Vegas doing your thing, then this is good. You get a decent room with a bed and a bathroom (which, if you think about it, that's all you need), then pick this. Well.. That is if you're ok with people smoking 24\/7.

They gave us a free upgrade to the newer remodeled tower two with a great view of the pool for free just for asking (thank you yelp tips).

Still it's really not a bad choice if you just want a cheap, safe and clean hotel room on the strip with a decent pool area. 

The room that we had was really nice and very big.  The shower and bathroom were huge!  If you are in tower 1 the rooms are older and smaller.  One of the best things about staying in tower 2 other than the updated rooms is the fact that the elevator exits out right to the pool.  All we had to do was go downstairs and walk through a door and we were right there.  

They also have a couple restaurants but nothing upscale and they have the Thunder from Down Under Australian strip show.  Otherwise the hotel was underwhelming.  Great I think if you have kids its seemed the hotel catered to families more than lets say Hard Rock would.",7,4,6

When we left the hotel to walk on the strip, there was vomit on the sidewalk two steps outside the hotel door.  There was somebody passed out in the bushes at the hotel.

This hotel was the cheapest vacation package I could get for this popular holiday weekend through Orbitz.  Not the caliber of hotel I tend to gravitate, however for a quick Vegas romp, this did the trick.  Actually, the ""twenty dollar sandwich"" did the trick and made all the difference:  http:\/\/www.thetwentydollartrick.com\/

My package came with a standard room.  After researching the Internet, the consensus was that Tower 1 rooms were sh*t and I needed to get upgraded.  So I discreetly inserted a folded twenty between my state ID and credit card when asked for identification at registration.  I asked if I could be upgraded and the receptionist acquiesced and placed me in a non-smoking Tower 2 Widescreen Room  with two Queen beds and updated decor.  Despite the somewhat uncleanliness of the bathroom, it suited my needs and the comfy beds helped me get some needed rest between my exploratory treks during the insanely hot days.  The air conditioner worked like a breeze and maintained a comfortable 74 degrees always.

Including the stellar receptionist that upgraded me (well, motivated by money), the staff throughout remained helpful and pleasant.  The theme and general casino was tacky (as was many of the clientele), but suited those that tend to enjoy the 90's Vegas theme vibe or those who rather spend their money at the casino rather than on a glitzy hotel room.

This was the worst experience I have ever had at any place I've ever stayed, let alone in the city of wanting to keep you coming back. I booked two rooms one king and one with two twins for my sisters cheer comp this past weekend. We got in Thursday and stayed until Monday. I booked deluxe view rooms on my MLife and they were anything but a view. Unless your version of a view is waking up at 7 am in Vegas due to power drilling a pool, and your view is an empty pool full of noise. After waking up the second day (Saturday) I decided I had had enough and went downstairs and asked to speak to a manager the manager DENISE was working on something so the Luxor manager helped me and  they said that they would be working on the pool every day of our stay!!! WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO KNOW THAT WHEN WE CHECKED IN!!! so I stayed that was completely unreasonable and what could they do my sister needed good rest for competition, they said no later than 12 we'd be moved. (I went down at 8:45 am) and that they'd take some off the price for that night. I stayed we had to be moved by noon due to her competitions and needing to get ready. By 12:15 we still didn't have a room so again went there and tried to figure out why... Spoke with Denise again and she had a paper slip sitting at her comp saying oh yes I know I have something saved let me check... So they checked and sure enough the rooms weren't ready yet (needed to be cleaned) so I said how long she said I'm rushing them shouldn't be more than a few minutes we will call up to your room as soon as they are ready... At 3:30 I finally called the front desk and asked to speak with a manager.. The rudest person I have ever spoken to in customer service to that day (worse will come after) she said she had no idea any of this was even happening not did she hear anything about us she then said that I only had 3 options because she didn't know anything about it this is all she could do (mind you she was the manager of the hotel for the day) 1. I could be downgraded and have no king bed (still paying the same) 2. I could wait for the room that still wasn't clean (from 8:45 am) and I could move into one of the rooms and move again once the second was ready 3. Or I could have a refund for ONLY the nights I hasn't stayed and we could leave. So we ended up moving to one room while the other got cleaned. At about 4 we got to get into another room. Survived the next two days until we got to check out. By booking through my MLife I had a review of my bill it was not what I was told I was being charged not is what I was charged so went to the front desk was again told that they fixed it and I would only be charged 275 then looked at the statement and was actually charged almost 100 more for both rooms went back to the hotel and they said no only 275 was charged according to them rechecked their math with the bill they printed and the price that was deducted from my account was actually charged. So I called guest services and she said despite the fact that 3 people told me I would be charged 275 for the whole that didn't include a deposit we had already paid so in total we paid 50 more than we were told. Despite talking to someone in guest services I was told by the person that I had to call back between 5am and 2pm tomorrow and speak with Denise because she didn't know anything even though she read the notes to me and we added it up she claimed it might have been a communication error and that she couldn't do anything. Needless to stay my card has still been charged 100+ more than I was supposed to be charged and I still have to call back tomorrow and I will never be staying here and I will tell everyone I know to never stay here!

I went to this place the first weekend it opened up in 1990. I was 12 and thought it was the greatest. I have since been as an adult. And you know what? It is still ok in my book. When you go to Vegas you are not going for the room. You are going for the booze, hos, and craps. Most of the rooms have been updated and are nice enough for what they are. The gambling can be dirt cheap on the right day and time. Booze, well you should bring your own so you aren't doling out money for it when you could be using said money to throw dice. Hos. They are not top notch here, as the crowd the Excalibur attracts is more likely to watch NASCAR then the E! channel. Wait I have stayed here. HMMM. Go somewhere else and find hos and bring them back here. It works. 

Bottom line: The Excalibur doesn't try to pretend to be this new fancy schmancy hotel and rip you on the room price. The casino floor has a lower ceiling and the smoke can be stifling. But there is a 24 hour Krispy Kreme where the donuts are fresh at 4am.

And no wi-fi had to hit up starbucks to get a signal. Who doesn't have wi-fi? Everywhere else had wi-fi.

    Leavin tower every day we were harassed by people trying to sell time shares and dicount show tickets that were crap. (They say free but they are not.) Big scam. Every day it was same people and same pitch. Unrelenting

     We did breakfast buffet,  unimpressive. And way overpriced. Had upset stomach the entire day after eating that food. It was all bland. Would have been better off eating mcdonalds every day. 
    
     Gambling in Excalibur cocktail waitresses we're non existent,  but when you got one they were abrasive and by comparison of the other casinos very old and unattractive and rude to match. 

     The large pool was closed all but one day! But they kept the adult pool that you have to pay $10+ to get into open with 3 patrons (4 lifeguards). I would say bad idea. Drinks were super expensive bring at least $40 cash with you to drink at the pool.

It is a cheap hotel.  4 nights $277 plus $80 for resort fees- in the heat of summer.  You get what you pay for.  The staff is polite.  We did have 2 people at the Business Center desk who went above and beyond to help us.  Check in was fast but not very friendly, just polite.  The people at the doors selling tickets to shows are aggressive!  We learned to just say ""Conference"" and they left us alone.

The hotel itself is a bit run down and needs a remodel, but everything works.  The water pressure on the 14th floor is not great and the toilet looks like it is going to overflow every flush.  The AC worked really well and yes, it was a little noisy, but that was a plus in drowning out the traffic.

The pools were nice and there is a bar\/restaurant there.  There were 3 pools and lots of children.  It was not super busy, so we had no problem getting chairs.  But the pools close early

Location is okay, depending on what you want to do.  If you are here for a convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center, stay somewhere else.  There is a free tram between Luxor-Excalibur-Mandalay Bay.  It is an easy walk to New York New York.

Wireless is in the public areas but in the room, its wired.  That means a slower connection and you must have a laptop to plug in.  It has the modem plug.

The buffet is okay= $23.  If you have the energy, I would suggest going over to the Luxor buffet  It is much better.  The buffet is over at 10pm.  You can eat on the cheap at the fast food restaurants- McDonald's, Pick Up Stix; Hot Dog on a Stick; Pizza Hut; Baja Fresh and a couple of others.  Johnny Rockets is also here.

Excalibur was definitely one of the best as a kid.  To kids, medieval anything was cool (at least to me haha).  Knights, dragons, princesses, and wizards are all images I conjure up when I think of Excalibur.

However, stayed here with a group of friends recently and man... the magic of this place is gone.  The water ""moat"" at the front is dry now.  It definitely shows its age and the crowd... is less family and more... odd.  With cheap prices, Excalibur now attracts the weird.. odd crowds and there's a lot of them.  Perfect example being this old dude with super long hair just spitting on to the carpet on the casino floor.  Nasty.  The whole place just feels... dirty.

The midway games are still there but price has gone up per play so Circus Circus is still the best. 
 
As for the rooms... old old old.  TV still the old school tubes, dark lighting, and beds creaks.  They were better than the low end hotels on the strip but it's due for a change.

My bath towel smelled like smoke.  We are non-smokers.  I know, in Vegas, people smoke.  But, it would be nice if they would launder the towels to not smell like smoke.

The window shade had holes in it.  One bedsheet was torn.  Another had a cigarette burn in it.

The shower was low-pressure and the spray pattern was poor.

Only one bar of soap in the bathroom and the body wash was terrible.

An HDTV showing all standard def and very limited channel choices.

Loud neighbors and drunk people.  As soon as we got to our room a drunk guy kept pestering us for directions to the room he was looking for.  We had to repeat the directions several times.

Yes, it is one of the cheaper hotels on the strip and you could certainly do a lot worse, but I had no idea that this place had gone downhill this bad. Most of the character has been stripped out of the decor and theme, so all you're left with is a dirty feeling everytime you walk into the place. I know this place is now 21 years old so it's seen better days, but other Vegas hotels are as old or older and still look fairly new. MGM either needs to step-up the renovations or demolish and start-over.

In the casino, the smoke is awful and the deodorizer they use to try to minimize it just makes things worse. Better ventilation is definitely needed in this place. 

The hotel room was decent enough, we were ""upgraded"" to a Widescreen Room in Tower II which is apparently ""recently renovated."" Some of the decor looked fairly old, but the room was clean enough for the most part I guess. Wired High-speed internet (which is part of their now mandatory $12.50\/night resort fee) worked well, although I would have preferred some sort of Wi-Fi. 

Best part of staying at the Excalibur is that you can look out the window and see all of the much better hotels you could be staying at, what a treat! Next time we'll book something on the north end of the strip, which is much closer to where the action is.

Its like a Motel 6 on top of a casino.

the rooms have just the basic amenities and by that I mean some lighting and a TV with a couple of channels - but who cares I was not there to hang out in the room.

I reserved two rooms for two nights so you can imagine I was on a budget - i'd have booked at the Easy 8 if it were an option.

But honestly, if I return to Vegas with say, my husband, I would not seek out the Excalibur as an option.  Even tho we had a great view of the roof.",3,4,3

I stayed at Excalibur about three weeks ago for my 25th, I used to stay at Excalibur all the time as a kid.

However, the next morning I woke up with welts ( and what clearly appeared to be bites). I gave it two or three days, and because I am a full time student and work full time I did not have time to see a doctor. After comparing pictures of my arm to google images, I realized I was bitten. I saw a doctor, pharmacist,and nurse, all of whom said I was clearly bitten by something.  I called Excalibur and was told someone would contact me regarding the incident. I waited about 7 days, and no one called. When i called back, the initial operator had not taken down my information (basically they never had record). 

Finally someone took down my information and took my statement. I suggested that I send them pictures, as I was documenting my arm and chest the entire time, and he refused, claiming they do not accept pictures. 

I was told someone would contact me within 2 days, never happened. I called back a couple days after my statement and left a message.

no reply.

I called again and was told I would be called within 5 days, since someone was going to inspect the room and let me know what they found.

That never happened either. 

I left a message, no reply.
I finally was able to get ahold of someone today, and I honestly wish I hadnt. 

She informed me that they were going to do absolutely nothing about my claim,s ince they found no bugs in the bed.  Take into consideration, its been about 3 weeks since I was there, and I am not claiming it was bed bugs, I just know it was some type of insect. 

I asked for a copy of the report from the inspection agency and was told I could not see it.

I asked for the name, and I could not have it. 

I basically could get NO proof that an inspection ever took place.



I am extremely disappointed in the Excalibur and the lack of compassion for a guest who paid $220 a night to stay in a contemporary room (which by the way is on sale on their website right now). 

I will NEVER stay at the Excalibur again.",13,0,0

1. Hidden resort fee of 18 bucks a day no biggie but then they charge u for things like using the pool fitness center prepare to get nickel and dimed 
2. Every were I turned some person was in my face trying to sell me a time share FYI if some person offers u a free show or a welcome package it's a ploy to get u to a time share sales pitch
3. Poor poor service and restaurants and very pricey not a fun place
 
In short I go to Vegas to gamble drink and see a show I don't care what my room looks like but what I will not tolerate is being treated like a pice of meat or interrupted from gambling by some low life selling time shares. Do not stay here pay more for a more central strip location",4,5,3

Within seconds of entering Excalibur, the stench of smoke filled my nostrils, my eyes began watering, and my lungs burned with each new breath. My only reason for setting foot in this hotel was to skip the tram and cross through on my way towards Mandalay Bay. Never will I make that mistake again.

I'll be straight up- This place is a hole. It's like MGM Resorts built it in 1990 and then never checked back, letting it fall into total disarray.  The carpets appear to have never been replaced, which explains the heavy stench of old smoke. Signs are placed in front of out of order moving sidewalks and doors are dirty. Their signature restaurants are Buca De Beppo and Dick's Last Resort. Gross. Speaking of the latter, the host of the MLIFE channel visits Dicks on one of their spots. Normally she is one of those people that is overly smiley and fake in every place they feature, desperately selling you on anything MGM related and telling you how everything is a must visit. Not even this lady could keep a straight face on the Dick's spot. The fear and desperation in her eyes to escape was clear and I found myself yelling at the TV, ""Get out while you still can!""
 
Hmmm maybe Excalibur is this way on purpose. Like it's a prison of sorts for bad or incompetent MGM employees, where they get left to suffer and die (or just get fed up and quit). Regardless, skip this one while you still have clear lungs. New York New York is right next door and infinitely better.",16,17,4

I had to take the king size bed and a roll away bed for the first night. The room was clean but was very noisy due to ac.  I had to call the next day to see if there were any rooms available and was able to move to a better location in the tower overlooking the strip. The hotel has very old decor and its at the end of the strip. It was away from everything and no parking at night. I was told there would be free drinks if I gambled but no one came to take our drink order. At the rio I got drinks left and right for free. I just had to tip.

Our plan was not to stay in the hotel very much and just needed a comfy bed and shower.  We set our expectations appropriately.  Our room was located in Tower 1 which is where the older rooms are. I believe you can get the nicer rooms in Tower 2 for $30 more a night.

The bed in the room was very comfortable.  The room had a TV, table with two chairs, a couch, and a shower and single sink (with a hair dryer).  The room also had a safe and an iron.  There was no mini fridge or coffee maker so plan accordingly.   There are coffee places within the hotel (do not go to Castle Coffee...stick with Starbucks or Krispy Kreme).   The closet had hangers.

WI-FI is complimentary, but it is slow as heck and has an inconsistent connection.  If you need to do work while on vacation, I would suggest getting your own hotspot to use or planning to work somewhere else.  It lead to frustration and took entirely too long (a couple hours)  to do one or two things that should have taken 5 minutes.  

The pool, gym, and spa are located in Tower 2 so it is a little bit of a walk (5 minutes) to those areas from Tower 1.  Not the worst thing except you have to walk through the casino in your bathing suit or workout clothes.  

The gym was by far the best thing about this place!  I went around 7:30am on Friday morning and much to my surprise it was packed.  There is no cost to use the gym (it's built into the resort fees) and you do have to sign a waiver before you go in.  

The gym was fully equipped with treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, free weights, kettlebells, mats, and foam rollers.  There is one stairmaster (which could probably use some maintenance, but it did what I needed it to do). The attendant was handing out towels and water bottles as we worked out.  The gym overlooks the pool so you could probably be thoroughly entertained while working out.  There is a restroom located in the spa adjacent to the gym.  

Saturday night (Sunday morning 2am) we got back to the room and wanted to eat.  We were shocked to see that room service only operates from 6am - 2pm so we ventured out to the casino to find food.  All the restaurants were closed with the exception of Johnny Rockets.  So we went back to the room and ate snacks.  I would suggest planning for that too.  How come everything is closed at 2am?  Isn't this Vegas?  lol.  The hotel has several places to eat with a food court upstairs.  Just don't get hungry in the middle of the night.  

The hotel is located within walking distance to New York New York, Mandalay Bay, MGM, and Luxor.  There is also a tram that will take you to Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  We caught a cab to Bellagio and it cost $8 one way plus tip.  

Excalibur has a couple stores where you can buy essentials (in fact they are called Essentials).  

There are 4 or 5 pools here.  We grabbed towels and planted ourselves on our lounge chairs.  There were two bars that I noticed and a DJ.  The music was great.  I saw a couple of waitresses, but I wasn't sure who they were serving.  The bar was good.  They were able to charge our room for our drinks.  Be prepared to take your ID to the pool if you want to get a drink.  They will card you.  The bar had all kinds of fun drinks (skinny lemonade was my pick) and beer with ice buckets.  My drink was $13 plus tip.  Not cheap by any means, but it is Vegas.  There was also a little store at the pool where you could buy sunscreen, swimsuits, hats, etc.  I didn't look so I couldn't tell you the prices.

Overall it was a fine experience.  It's not upscale by any means.  It is an older casino\/hotel.  If you are just looking for a place to sleep and you are not worried about image, you can't go wrong with Excalibur.",8,2,2

Really, the only reason to go there is to get on the tram - or maybe, if you came to Vegas with kids. But why would you do THAT??? 

Sure, it's cheap. And the room definitely reflects that...but I'd rather stay at the Imperial Palace - someplace less in disguise and more straight-up cheap. I can't specifically pinpoint the reasons why I will never stay there again - it just left me with a very ""unwashed"" feeling - even years later (I stayed there in 2001).

Stayed here Labor Day weekend with the fams back in 2006 when I turned 21 cause my parents are cheap and it was the cheapest hotel on the strip for the weekend and we were able to cramp 6 people into 2 beds.

Parents gave me $200 to gamble away, but I ended up spending it all on drank, bottle service, and titty money when I met up with one of my homies who's cousin was having his bachelor party that weekend and his other cousin who runs her own bachelorette company in Vegas and knows all the club bouncers\/owners was escorting us in and out of everywhere.

My fondest memories of Excalibur were as follows:

1 - Forgetting my tooth brush at home and having to buy a ghetto $3 one in the convenience store downstairs.

2 - All those THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER show posters.  This is a pretty homosexual memory if you know what posters all over the walls here I'm talking about, but the title THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER just always made me bust up laughing.

3 - Don't eat Del Taco in the hallway of where your room is drunk at 5AM or you might get escorted by a big ass 6' 6"" black security cop (that could've passed for a low quality porn star) that will escort your ass all the way downstairs to the front desk and ask your drunk ass what room # you are and call your parents at 5AM and ask them if you belong to them and then escort you all the way back up to your room.  At least I got the side of a bed to myself that night since they were all awake by the time I crashed out that night.  I swear to God, cops love me no matter what city I'm in.  Surprised my parents didn't say anything to me the next day of smelling like alcohol and cigarettes.

Ghetto hotel though, I'm guessing people only come here because it's cheap and has dragons on the towers and the monorail connects it to Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  The pool was alright, but nothing special at all by all means on Vegas standards.  They pay a person to check if you have a room key over here when going up on the elevators.  Something tells me someone got hunted down in the past over here, so they had to do that for security issues.",4,6,3

The hotel itself is dated, which is not a massive problem, but for business, the Excalibur is a terrible option.

Our group of six people (across five rooms) were charged nearly $600 overall in our five-day stay in part to access the internet. For a sum that could have bought three new laptops, we received a slow and instable connection preventing us from getting work done, as well as cheap cat-5 cables with broken hinges exacerbating the problem. 

Several in our group were almost entirely unable to access the web except for short bursts, and subsequently suffered a loss of productivity that hindered the business part of our business trip and ultimately cut into our time to do other things in Vegas. 

The tattered and seedy vibe was tolerable, but the charge for services not rendered was inexcusable.

First thing when we pulled into valet, the guy rolled our luggage to the curb and ""informed"" us that he does not share tips with the other bellmen so he would need his tip right then.  So rude!  For rolling my luggage 10 feet?  Yes, I might tip you, but never if you ask for it!  Then as we enter we get hit up immediately by pushy sales staff trying to sell shows and push another property.  No thanks.  Unfortunately, every single time we enter or leave our room, they attack us.  So tacky and rude!  Now to the smell.  Gross, yuck, disgusting, stinky hell hole.  I hope that describes it enough.  Walk into most other hotels on the strip and then walk into the Excalibur.  Tell me if you feel differently.  Blah...worst Vegas hotel experience ever and one time we stayed at the Four Queens and had a speaker outside of our window from Fremont Street!

When we put the $100 deposit take a break travel told me all i will need is to take my voucher for my 2 day stay to the welcome center at the excalibur.

I was excited to go to las vegas. Got to the welcome center and was told we had to take a mandatory tour so we can get our $100 dollar deposit, which was to go to las vegas timeshare tour again. Which we took in October and lasted almost 5 hour trying to get us to get a time share. Plus we didnt even know what we were getting into when we took the offer for free or discounted vouches.

 The people at each entrances of the hotels are volchers. Trying to get people to get discount shows and etc. Its sound like a hell of a deal but there is a hidden message and catch that they should mention. All i knew is that we were going to a tour but not for time share. They do not disclosed or requirements to get what they say we are getting. I came to vegas to have a good time. But get wheeled in to go to another time share tour . 

The person that attended us at the welcome center by the name of jay was checking us in. Had us fill out paper work ask for our identification. Then he  explaining to us we had to take a time share tour. First thing he said you HAVE TO TAKE THE TOUR TO GET YOUR DEPOSIT BACK. I was upset already just having flash back from the first tour i took.

I was keeping my cool but i was buring inside. So i told him i wasn't told that i had to take the tour to get my deposit back.  He said it was mandatory. So i was like ok fine if i have to i will but i didnt want to. He kept suggesting to take the tour same day when we got there. Not to mention we  traveled 4 1\/2 hours from Los Angeles. I was tired and wanted to relax. He as well is giving us credit for gabling and for dinner. So we ended up with a bunch of bs credits. That's included to take the tour.

Couple hours passed . So me and my husband were talking that the tour is bs. They never told us we had to take a  mandatory time share tour. So we went back to jay told him we wanted to cancel the trip. As soon as we said that things changed. He ask why. Because we didn't want to take time off our trip not to mention its our 6 year anniversary. So we wanted to cancel, he right away started type away at the computer. Then he said what I'm going to do is not have you guys take a tour. Why couldn't he just said that the first time.

Me and my husband was having a bad day when they mention i had to take a time share tour. I just can't understand why he couldn't just have us given our room only and not take the tour. I understand we have to make a living but that wasn't the way to do it. So he finally got us not to go on a tour and with no credits because weren't taking the tour. So that means only 2 night stay and That's it. Which i'm ok with that what i thought i was expecting.

I was even more upset so i walked away and they still wanted us to stay. 
P.S called take a break travel after we left vegas for my dispute at the welcome center. They confirmed i didn't have to take a tour. They even mention we never have to. It was only was supposed to be a 2 night stay thats it.

So what we did how upset we were, we got our own room so we didnt have to deal with the welcome center. Feeling like they own us, since they have all my information. Thank you to the excalibur i give them 5 stars. I got a great deal for 3 day same price with resort fees what i was spending with take a break travel. Couple hour pass. I had my husband take the voucher back and force them to cancel because i still didn't feel comfortable. 

We ended up enjoying the rest of our 3 day stay. Just knowing what the welcome center tries to hack people to go to a time share tour when they dont have to. Were i stand right now, Im now out $100 dollar negative. Because i cancel my trip. All because he said i had to take the trip, then i go back tells me i dont have to.  He had the nerve to switch his mind up. That's just shady business. Please if anyone reads this dont do what i did. There going to come after you with alot of bs info sounding that your getting discount deals nope wrong.",0,0,0

I could have opted for fine resorts north of $222 per night, with $60 breakfast daily and $100 spend for three nights, but decided instead for the $50 a night, king bed room here, I think I nailed it!

With resort fees and taxes, the $150 base rate goes to $250, for three nights.

I flew in. Got the Showtime Shuttle at $16.50 round trip from Terminal 1 to hotel - do tip the diver, friendly guy with a boom box playing. 

Upon arrival at airport, I checked into the American Express Centurion Lounge - had complimentary food, drinks and snacks there, making time for the 4:00 p.m. check in time. I also tried the Priority Select Lounge, the Club at LAS lounge, compliments of AMEX, and got complimentary snacks and drinks there, as well. By this time, it was close to 5:00 p.m. and headed for hotel.

Check-in was seamless. My room was not ready (it would have been a lower floor, like 6th floor, and was offered a room in 9th floor). I said: go higher! It's too noisy at the lower floors. I was set on the 20th - view to airport and Luxor. Pretty decent view.

I was given the option to leave the tab open on my credit card for room charges. I left my tab open for the 3-night stay and they told me they would tap my card with $350. I said: fine~

The biggest drawback for me is that the room is not sound proof. You can hear all the noise from the airport and the ambulances on the street. It appears you could even hear people on the street - noise level is constant and mild but annoying. Therefore, I'm knocking down one rating. (Mystery solved: The window was open a bit - I closed it and though still noisy from the airport and ambulances\/traffic, the white noise is more bearable with the window closed).

The TV in the room offered 2 shows for $75. You can only purchase the package in person at the Box Office (the box office at the 1st floor closes at 10 pm and the one at the 2nd floor closes at 11:30 pm). The Blue Man Group at Luxor is advertised for a few bucks more in the TV ad but upon requesting it at the box office, it's not part of the package until after New Year's. A little bait-and-switch there it felt. Same thing for the Tournament Dinner: it's advertised but not available. So, I settled for the Bee Gees and Fantasy for $75 - BUT HERE COMES THE KICKER: they add a FEE which brings the cost to $89, and you don't get the M Life discount (about 10% I was told to expect by the clerk at Players Services). So, you have to be a little flexible, I guess, with the padding in prices that goes on in here - otherwise, these little quirks could pile on to ruin your experience. I charged the shows to my room but my credit card was immediately debited via the room's open tab.

To my surprise, the hotel is not as smoke fogged inside as in the past. Perhaps because I'm comparing it to the Indian Bingo & Casinos in Southern Cal. I purposefully did not bring my best jacket or clothing because of the cigarette smoke smell factor. So, far, it's not as bad.

Tips:

- Get the M Life card -- their players & MGM hotels loyalty program -- (you'll get spammed with emails though); I had one and secured the room rate through it. The price per night was competitive relative to the same hotel compared to AAA, AARP and AMEX travel. I got a better deal through M Life but did have to pay about $55 in advance at time of booking a couple of weeks back. - They offered me to apply for the M Life Master Card credit card but I declined.

- Book your shows as soon as you get there - they sell out sometimes. 

- The $75 for 2 shows is still a deal, even though with fees it is actually $89. The box office staff are very friendly.

- Bring your own bottled water. There was none in my room - not even a pay-as-you-go bottles.

- Wi-Fi is complimentary in the room but for some reason it only worked with my phone and not the tablet. Perhaps it's only one device at a time.

- The King Tower room have a ""1"" in front of the room number and the other tower has a ""2"".

- You won't need a jacket in the casino floor - it's very warm.

The casino feels very old and tired. Beauty may be skin deep, but ugly goes clear to the bone. And this hotel is not an exception.

I realize that Excalibur is targeting certain type of people. With that said, I didn't spend any time in their casino, nor did I try any of their restaurants. There is a little walk across the bridge to MGM, but it's not that bad. You're walking around in Vegas anyway so this can't be the deal breaker. However... Excalibur...

Even stayed here once out of desparation, much to my chagrin.  All other properties in Vegas, including MGM properties, have signs clearly directing you to all the restaurants by name.  A restaurant changes, they change the sign.  But apparently Excalibur cannot be bothered.  There's just a general sign at the escalator that says ""Restaurants"" implying that all the restaurants are upstairs.  But they are not.  

Once you get upstairs, you'll find a couple of banners above the escalators that try to explain with oddly placed arrows where specific restaurants, registration, etc. are located.  But the banners make no sense. It's so annoying.

Also, this hotel was rundown in 1998 and is doubly so today.  It smells funny.  The smoke over the years has inflitrated every nook and cranny, making the whole place smell like a giant, nasty ashtray.

Since it is part of the weird, circuitious path that allows you to traverse the Strip in mostly air conditioned comfort, sometimes it becomes a necessity to come here.

They are Baja Fresh, Dick's resort restaurant, and burger place in the casino area, and a 5-min walk to the food court with McDonald, Yogurtland, Popeyes, Buffet, Steak house and others on the way to Luxor.

Its located on the south side of the Las Vegas Strip on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Tropicana. Its surrounding hotels (safe walking distance)  MGM, Tropicana, New York New York, Luxor. 

Here is the thing about the Excalibur. Its an older hotel. Tower I has the older outdated rooms with no views. Tower II has the upgraded rooms with the flat screen TVs and the views.  Excalibur is reasonable in price for being on the strip. Its definitely not the best hotel on the strip but the price is worth staying on the strip and you save money in cab fares.  There is a tram that can take you from the Excalibur to the Luxor and to the Mandalay bay. Its free. Its also walking distance to the MGM where you can catch the MONORAIL which is a tram that you pay $5.00 each way and it goes from the south side of the strip starting at MGM up to the North side of the strip ending at the Sahara. There are plenty of stops in between for the hotels\/casinos on the strip. The monorail is worth taking if you don't mind taking trams. My advice is to you is to go to any or all of the Vegas casinos and get a PLAYERS CLUB CARD or members card. They are free. You can put them in slot machines to earn points or give them to card dealers to earn points. In return they email you cheap hotel deals for the vegas strip casinos. It is worth it and it is free. That might also be another reason why I keep visiting Vegas!
 Also, on a quick note there is a restaurant in the Excalibur called DICKS. Be advised it is not a place for children or sensitive people. The staff is purposely rude and crude to people (hence the name Dicks). They hold back nothing and dish out a lot of vulgar trash talk so be warned. If you don't get offended easily you should definitely take advantage of the Dicks experience.",0,0,0

The hotel staff was some of the most incompetent set of nit wits I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.

After a long day and night of walking around the strip, we stumbled back to our room. We went downstairs to ask the front desk for a roll-a-way bed since there were four of us in one room and gave them a credit card number. After an HOUR passed, we called again and they said that they had no record of us calling or giving a credit card number ._. My roomie went downstairs AGAIN and was told that they had no record of us requesting\/paying for a roll-a-way bed. After pointing to the guy that took the information to begin with, they apologized and said that they would comp the beds and send them up.

All of a sudden, a few days later, they take away the beds, even though we still needed them, AND charged my roomie's card that supposedly they didn't have on file to begin with! The staff was rude and kept contradicting what other staff members were saying. The front desk staff literally has no business being in customer service.

Also, the timeshare people are pushy and annoying. Only one tower has decent rooms. No wifi (WTF!) and the wired internet runs at a speedy 1mpbs download and a .005mbps upload. The pool has NO shade unless you pay for it. The only good thing? A really nice worker at the craps table who explained to us how to play. Never again.

Excalibur meets some very basic needs for a hotel in Vegas. Amazingly it's the only one that meets them all. And yes I've stayed in nearly every hotel on the strip.

1. Friendly check in staff. They put you where you ask. In my case I know the rooms facing the courtyard are the queitest, and have comfy beds. 

2. Affordable. Weekday nights including resort fee are roughly $60. You get a $20 coupon to the steakhouse so it really is only about $40 a night

3. Fun casino. Plenty of slots. Fun feeling, and machines are a bit looser than other casinos on the strip.

4. Parking. On most days you can find a parking spot near the elevator for whatever tower you are staying in

5. Making you feel like a valued customer. In all of my times staying here and dealing with employees I've never once felt underappeciated. I mean heck I was using a $20 coupon at the bar and getting exactly $20 worth of food. One would think the bartender would look down on me. Nope always a smile.

Place is really a hidden gem. Other MGM properties could learn a lot from this place. As a result they probably make tons of money. With little overhead. Being nice costs nothing.",9,2,1

We didn't know our way around vegas as far as rooms\/upgrades and such since we're from Jersey, so we got stuck with a room that was located smack on the first floor. I remember it being relatively noisy, people knocking on our door all night. The room itself was a standard hotel room, no frills or fuss. It was a bit smelly and there were stains on the sheets but it wasn't anything I haven't seen before since my family and I are used to staying in budget hotels. Since I was a kid at the time, the pool was the only thing remotely interesting, and I have to say I was pretty impressed. There were several pools, even one with a waterslide and it was relatively family friendly for the most part. Try the breakfast buffet.

We chose the Excalibur because it was cheap and it was a Castle---the easiest choice for any parent taking their 4-year-old princess to vegas.  (We chose this over Circus Circus because of the proximity to M&M World & Rainforest Cafe). 

I was leary of all the negative reviews, but we took the chance anyway.
Here is our 2 cents:

1.  The 2-room suite in Tower 1 was updated and very nice.  King bed was super comfortable; two bathrooms, extra large jacuzzi tub; two tv screens.  Very clean.

2.  The double-queen room was NOT updated, but was VERY clean.  Bathroom was large, no tub, nice shower.  Nothing special, but for a $40 price tag on the strip, we had no complaints.  (There just wasn't anything ""pretty"" or ""special"" about the room.

3.  The pools are located near Tower 2.  If you want a room near the pools, then expect to pay a higher price because Tower 2 is considered ""contemporary"" accommodation, meaning ,they've been upgraded & remodeled.   Convenience is key when you want the pools, otherwise you'll be walking a mile from Tower 1 thru the heart of the casino each time you come\/go.

4.  The Excalibur is NOT the hotel for the young & hip.  Most of the crowds we noticed are older adults, or families.   This was nice--we were not barraged with obnoxious drunkards or ""sex."" as stated in other reviews.  

Yes, there are a lot of rednecks here, but this has a few positive benefits!
a.  Rednecks spend most of their time playing the slots, so they don't bother you.
b.  obnoxious youngsters trying to get laid do not hang out where the rednecks stay

I will say this:  our weekend stay was quite pleasant.  The kids & families around the pool were polite (i'm really not kidding) and friendly.  We never once felt that we needed to shield our daughter from anything.  

Based on other reviews we thought this would be the skankiest hotel ever, but it was quite the opposite.  I think theme-hotels are outdated, but there was nothing wrong with this hotel at all, unless you want to compare it to all the swanky $400\/night hotels down the strip.

BONUS:  convenient walkway to the Luxor--which is a huge hit for youngsters.  Also, a tram connects Excalibur, Luxor & Mandalay.

M&M World is 0.5miles away from the front entrance of Excalibur.",12,4,2

This was my first time staying here just last weekend and we ""upgraded"" our room on the drive from AZ to NV and apparently the ""upgrade"" was just a flat screen tv and slightly bigger room. Disappointing.  The curtains were dirty. The nightstand was dusty. Our table was not clean. The bathroom floor was not clean. The AC smelled really gross at certain times when it was running. We thought there was free wi-fi but there was only a cord to connect your laptop to the internet. We were unable to fix the clock radio to say the correct time..at least 3 adults tried and we failed.  Got into our room by 1230 or so and turned down the sheets in our bed to find crumbly stuff, not sure what it was, so we had to call room service to come change the sheets which they did.

We put our trash can out in the hall to make sure it got emptied and people starting filling it up with their own trash. So we put it in front of the janitor's door and never saw our trash can again. 

Other things I did not like: the hallway smelled disgusting (like vomit someone said)
The ice machine ran out of ice and was never restocked the last couple nights we were there so i had to go up or down a floor to get ice for my ice chest since there was no mini fridge in the room. There was a safe though.

The furniture was in keeping with the castle motif & appeared very clean & nicely kept.  
The bed was very comfortable & we had a TV in the living room & the bedroom. 

The Super Bowl Party was on the 3rd floor and there was an assortment of foods and deserts  to choose from.  Drinks were also included.   Our waitress Bobbie was very kind & kept our area clean & our drinks filled up.  She made our Super Bowl Sunday a very fun experience!",44,27,44

This is definitely not the nicest hotel on the strip and it is far from it.  But, if you're a college student who wants to stay somewhere on the strip within walking distance of most places or you can take a cab without paying a crazy amount, then this place is the place I'd recommend.  Most of the time the rooms well below what you'd pay if you stay just across the street at the MGM and for what it is, it's pretty good.  There are other cheap places to stay at on the strip such as IP (The Imperial Palace).  Even though that place is at a better location, it is much much crappier than the Excalibur.  

If you're looking for luxury, don't stay here.  Fork out the money and go down the strip to the Venetian or Bellagio or Wynn.  If you're a broke ass college student who wants to go to vegas and probably wont spend much time in the room anyways as I once was, then this place is good.",0,0,0

We were constantly and irritatingly molested by Philipinos in suits at every single entrance to the hotel and casino.  Even walking over to the Luxor we were molested to recieve ""free gifts"" that required you to give them $50 to go be at the mercy of some stupid time share demo.  Having to tell someone you aren't interested ten times a day when you use the bathroom next to the doors in the casino is unacceptable.  And they are just doing it to save money on advertising.  MORONIC!!

Now for my review of this horrid hotel:

For staying in one of the ""new remodeled rooms"", I had many baseline expectations that weren't met at all, when I put down these baseline expectations, note that we moved to THE ORLEANS after only one day staying here for 1\/3 the price and had the opposite of every single one:
1) The internet was cable only and as a computer geek, even I couldn't get it to work no matter what I did.  No WIFI to speak of.
2)  No coffee maker, something that is standard even in every Motel 6.
3)  The sheets had several rips in them.
4)  No water pressure to speak of in the shower.
5)  Old concaved mattresses.
6)  EVERY line, from signing up for ""MLife"" to checking\/out was about 30 minutes long.
7)  Computers when we finally did get up to the head of the checkin\/checkout lines, were down BOTH times.

For the price we paid for the room, approx $99, for the one night, we SHOULD'VE had:
1)  Refrigerators in the rooms.
2)  The ""WIDESCREEN REMODELED ROOMS"" in Tower II had no HDTV to speak of, the reception was so bad that the 27"" tubed tv from 1995 in The Orleans put it to shame.  Their technology should be well upgraded by now, it's 2011 and when you ""remodel"" something, it pays to update the hardware.
3)  Where is the WIFI?  This was a MAJOR complaint, for the price of these rooms, you would think it wouldn't take much to put WIFI connections throughout the building and create a sweet network.  I could do it and I'm not even a professional.

All in all, the bad things outweighed the good things, which were really nothing that great that I couldn't get it anywhere else or expect any less.  If you want to be molested by Philipino imports every second and be in a dirty expensive hotel then by all means, go here.

If you want an awesome experience with no lines, great food, wifi, and don't mind being off the strip at $35 a night, then go to The Orleans.  Great GREAT experience here.",1,2,0

This was my first trip to Vegas and I've got to say: I probably won't stay at the Excalibur again unless somebody else is paying for it.  That's not entirely true.  The room was a standard hotel room, not what I was expecting in a casino.
The bed wasn't uncomfortable, but it could have been better.  I'm probably jaded because of my satin sheets, but I slept just fine.

My boyfriend & I arrived the day after my 21st birthday on November 7th of 2014, we were beyond exhausted, I was ready to pass out the moment I walked off that plane, and the fact that I knew I had to wait until 3pm to check in already made me want to cry. 
The moment we got to the front desk, our agent was really accommodating. And even know they almost didn't accept my boyfriends company card to accept our payment for the rest of the balance I'm sooooo glad they did. I could tell the supervisor was pretty pissed and she clearly showed it on her face(she was rude) when our agent accepted our payment anyway. And she also waived our early check in fee for my birthday! Pretty sure her name was Ilene, or Ivette, something like that. She was amazing. Her supervisor (can't remember her name) not so nice. 

Now on to the room....the time before this past time my hotel experience was horrible so I made sure we stayed in one of the new rooms that the Excalibur offers. We stayed in the contemporary tower king view NON SMOKING room for 3 nights and it was amazing! A little small, but still really fun. It was really clean every time we entered the room after a long night of partying. The bed was so comfortable the moment my boyfriend and I layed down, we passed out. they could've had an extra blanket or two since it's freezing in there, but other then that so comfortable. We had a really great view and no problems with our room at all.

The rest of our stay was amazing. Except for the annoying people by the elevators trying to get you with show tickets and packages also at the entrance of the hotel. One night I had to put a lady in her place, they never hassled us again. 
So besides those annoying people, the horrible cigarette smoke in the casino(it's Vegas), and the really rude supervisor. We had a great time.

1) No microfridge in the room. Considering we're in the desert, having access to a device that can instantly chill beverages would be much appreciated.

2) The layout seems rather clumsy and it's easy to get lost, especially if you're a n00b like me. This could be a way to promote gambling though, so it's a moot factor here.

3) While checkin for us was relatively harmless on an early Saturday evening, the following day the checkin line extended all the way to Carson City. I noticed a couple reviews from last August (when our trip took place) commenting on this issue, that some people had to wait hours just to checkin. If I was stuck in that line, I'd be pretty pissed. That would deter me from ever coming back. Hopefully they've since fixed whatever the issue was.

The buffet was really good. Extensive selections and a massive dessert bar. Price was okay too. They were in the process of adding more parking which I think was desperately needed so by now that should have taken care of itself. 

Overall it's big, loud, you're gonna get lost a few times, but it's a place to stay. I'd come back, but I think after my last visit I determined Vegas just isn't for me.

There, I said it.

I'm sorry, but I do!  For the past 11 years, we've visited Vegas at least once a year and I'm pretty sure we've stayed here 6 or 7 times!  Yeah, it's cheesy.  Yeah, it's dated (I hear Tower 2 is better but we stayed in Tower 1).  Yeah, there are much nicer looking rooms at other hotels on The Strip.  But considering I'm only in the hotel room for only a few hours a day, I'm OK with all of this.  Besides, as someone who worked in the hotel industry for over 5 years, I know that just because a hotel is new and nice doesn't necessarily mean it's clean...lots of gross things can happen even in the nicest of hotels.  But I digress.

For us, the rooms are always clean, the bed is crazy comfortable (seriously - best night's sleep I've had in awhile) and it's cheap!  I'd much rather stay here and save $40-$100 to spend elsewhere than stay somewhere else that's ""nicer"".  

Also, there are a lot of good food choices near Excalibur.  Very important - we've stayed at other hotels before where they don't have the best choices and you have to venture pretty far away for a good meal.  When you're on a strict schedule, having good food close by is important.

I have to admit that I haven't been back inside the place until recently... but boy... have things changed. I would say it is your average casino\/resort on the strip and that the room prices are fair and can sometimes be some of the cheapest in Las Vegas. It has a great location right next to Luxor and NY NY and a stone's throw from places like Mandalay Bay and Caesar's.
That being said, I would use the term ""run down"" to describe my room. The walls had stains, the curtains had stains, and the carpet had stains. I even had some very small spots of mildew in the shower. Look, I'm not expecting the Four Seasons here, but I do expect it to appear clean. We also experienced problems with the air conditioner... it seemed to only blow warm air. We called the front desk and they had someone fix it while we were out. When we got back, we just let the A\/C run because we were afraid to touch it and have it blow hot air again.
As previously mentioned by some other Yelpers, the parking can be a bit far if you get stuck way out there. Not too bad of a hike unless you're stuck in 104 degree heat.

Not bad if you are on a budget.

First, we paid $150 + taxes & resort fees per night. This is probably the lower end for hotels on the strip. Secondly, we stayed in Tower 2, which is the newer of the two towers.

That being said, our room was average. It was clean and provided all the amenities one would expect out of the 3-star hotel. The plus side is that Excalibur is also a casino hotel, so you get that ""Vegas experience"" without emptying your pockets. Having the tram there is nice too.

The I'd probably give the hotel staff somewhere between two and three stars. I didn't have any trouble checking in, but my girlfriend did. The manager was able to sort it out, but not before the robot employee complicated the process.

Side Note: The lot where we were parked was adjacent to our tower, making carrying our luggage up to our room quite convenient.

I was very pleasantly surprised. Now, granted, this was *only* because I got a sweet deal - it does absolutely feel like a cheap hotel still, and the casino area feels dingy and old, but if you're only here to sleep, you only have to walk through the casino area for a few minutes. 

The room itself was... pretty nice, really. It had a comfortable bed, a decent amount of space, a perfectly functional shower, a perfectly functional toilet, a perfectly functional AC, the wifi worked and was reliably fast enough to do things on, nothing was notably dirty or dusty... I had no complaints. It was clearly not a luxury room, but I've seen much worse. There was even an online checkin and checkout system, so you never had to deal with the checkin line. 

Obviously this would depend on the price, but I was worried I'd be sorry staying there even for the price I paid, and absolutely not - I'd stay here again in a snap if I got a good price again. (Obviously I can't make any guarantee that my room was normal - maybe I just lucked out, in which case, I'm glad I lucked out.)

Only major complaint right now, which may have factored into why I snagged an almost-free Saturday stay, is that they're doing some construction on the convenient walkway between Excalibur and NYNY, which means you currently have to walk all the way around to MGM and then cross on the other side of the street (or at least that was the case last weekend), which is a pain - hopefully they finish that soon.",3,1,0

First of all, our room was very clean and I didn't come away with any ""bumps"" from any bed bugs or anything like that. Secondly, for the amount we paid ($150 for 3 nights), this place was awesome! And it was only that expensive because thanksgiving night was higher than the others. It was just like the place I remember from when I was young and we had the whole family with kids and everything.

Also, one note I also want to make is that it can be really hard to find $5 blackjack tables and they had them, however during peak hours they changed them all to $10 tables. If you were already sitting there when they moved the tables up they grandfathered you in at the $5.

One of the worst places to stay in Las Vegas. 

Its bait and switch here. The room showed online is not the room you'll get.

From the minute you walk in it will be regret if you stay here. The stinch of cigarettes and foul oder that reaks from the entire place will drive you crazy. On top of that the staff is horrible. You are honestly better off at a Motel 8. Hands down has to be the worst hotel on the strip. 

CONS:
-DIRTY
-NO WIFI
-PHONES GET NO RECEPTION
-FOUL ODER

I arrived here after booking this place for a decent price a few months ago ($195 total with tax to arrive on Thu and check out on Sun), and was immediately hit with the ""resort fee"" of $20 per night during check-in, which was over and above what I'd already paid for the room.  The woman who got me checked in (Carla) was very friendly, but it seems that Excalibur books people into the cheapest rooms possible initially, then offers several ""upcharge"" options; There's a laminated display at each check in desk with photos and options like ""Get xyz room for $20 extra...get a room with abc amenity for $40 extra"", etc.   On this trip, I simply needed a place to sleep, shower and check e-mails a few times, so I stuck with the basic room.   She asked if I wanted a high or low floor, close to or far from the elevator, etc.  She gave me exactly what I'd asked for, and I ended up with a pretty incredible view of the entire strip!

When I first walked into in the room and sat my bags down, the first thing I noticed was that everything was coated with a think layer of dust!  The side of the TV stand, the telephone, the alarm clock, etc. everything was dusty, as if simple and basic cleaning never takes place here (see the photos I posted). The chairs were stained, there was no proper desk in the room, and when I moved one of the chairs, there were peanuts and other crumbs from a past guest.  General cleanliness evidently isn't a priority for this hotel?!?

Know also that there is no WiFi at all available in the rooms.  While high speed internet (the speed actually was quite good) is free, the only way to connect is via a CAT 5 cable that I was unable to find until I picked up the dusty and crusted phone receiver and called the front desk, only to be told it was stashed under the TV.  I was a bit surprised to find that, in 2015, there was no WiFi available at all in the rooms, paid or not.

As mentioned in my last review, it's a bit sad to see that they haven't maintained this hotel better than they have.  Excalibur was the largest hotel in the world when it opened in 1990, and lots of things here are really showing their age.  IMO, it really wouldn't take much to bring it up to a point once again where it looks and feels newer while still keeping the medieval theme, starting with some newer paneling for the elevators and some odor neutralizers for the casino floor!  Seriously, this place smells like the old Tropicana did 10 years ago before her facelift.  Now the Trop has no odor at all, Excalibur should take a lesson rather than spraying the sickly sweet air freshener they seem to try and use everywhere to mask the smell of old booze and cigarette smoke!",9,3,5

This morning, my husband asked me if we had to pay for parking at Excalibur since we were staying there. I said of course not, but I will make sure. I was WRONG! Parking is NOT included in the $30 resort fee! Its $8 per night!  Umbrellas at the pool in 109 degrees heat are not included in the resort fee either! IF you want an umbrella, that will cost you a min. of $40 per day, during the week. Higher on weekends\/holidays. The reviews on the buffet (included in our reservations) were horrible! The reviews on the service at the pool were horrible. In fact, not a lot of positive reviews on anything. 
We usually stay at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson (15 min. from strip) for FREE! (because we gamble quite a bit) We thought we would try something different and stay in Vegas....BIG MISTAKE!  We cancelled our reservations at Excalibur. After paying the $53 cancellation fee, we are saving $377 staying at GVR, knowing we will have an amazing stay!.  NEVER will we ""try something different"" EVER again. 
GVR has the BEST pool, heated year round. 1\/2 sand bottom 1\/2 regular. Plenty of umbrellas, comfortable lounge chairs and amazing service. Infused water available at 2 different locations, comfy towels. You are treated like every staff member is so happy to see you.....No charge for parking\/umbrellas.

The pool cabanas are a fantastic deal if you can wait until day of around 11am to rent one last minute. $75 no minimum and no purchase of food or beverage required. Plus you can have one drink per person of your own from your room so we just took turns going up to our room to refill. There's a fun slide that you can ride with your friends and your drink (no one person at a time rules!)

Located next to Mandalay bay and Luxor with a tram that goes to both. Made it so easy. And you can take a tram to NY NY making it even more convenient. Oh and did I mention The Thunder from Down Under show is at this hotel?!?! Ladies, and men if that's your thing, go see it!

All and all, I will likely stay here again. Unless I win the lotto, then I'm staying at Mandalay Bay (also owned by same group) or Caesar's ;)",0,0,0

I know that this place is more on the affordable side of Vegas's hotel scene but didn't know it would be that bad. The air quality is definitely not as good, because it was as if somebody smoked right in front of me. However, the reason I could only give two stars was mostly because of the mediocre lunch and dinner buffet I ate here. I couldn't remember clearly, but it was somewhere around $15 for lunch and more for dinner, but the quality of food was 'left-over' kind. Nothing was hot and sizzling as they should be, and really bare minimum variety. Dinner was nothing spectacular. If you tried to have second plates then you might be filled up quicker to leave. However, I did like their seating areas, very roomy and quite nice.
The room was dark and gave out a ""haunted"" feelings. I don't know why, it just felt that way. Bathroom was fairly clean, but fan didn't work too well. The AC was thunder loud, but if you were really drunk, then you would have no problem like me.

So when my mother and I were driving through Vegas and I hit a small jackpot 5 minutes into our visit to Paris, I called Excalibur and booked a room on the spot. Much more expensive way to go about things, but I didn't care. No Motel 6 for us (see other review about Motel 6)

I didn't have huge expectations. I wasn't a child anymore with stars in my eyes. I knew it would be a standard hotel room but in a building that looked like a castle.

We checked in and were placed in a room in the ""old"" tower which basically means no view and a much longer trot to the pool. Our room was fine but the view was especially bad in this room. I'm not even sure why they bothered with windows because the only thing we could see was a brick wall and if we strained our necks really hard, we could see a little bit of sky. I wish I could remember which room it was because for someone who wants to sleep a lot while visiting Vegas, this room would be perfect as it not only doesn't allow any outside light to permeate the darkness, but it is clear at the end of the hallway. The bathroom was average, the beds were average and the size was average. Definitely not a palace. We ordered a Vegas appropriate movie (What Happens in Vegas) and ordered room service. The food was good, the movie was funny and despite the mediocre accommodations the night was well spent. We woke up rested and ready to get back on the road.


On my second stay at Excalibur, I went with friends and there were 5 of us in a room. We upgraded to one of the widescreen rooms but the room itself isn't much better. It is about the same size and the amenities are the same. We essentially paid more for a slightly better location and a much better view. We were on the 5th floor facing the pool. Facing the pool is kind of nice after a night out because you can see the other people lounging around soaking in the sun and it motivates you to get out of bed - so you can go back to sleep by the pool.

I discovered one ""bad"" thing about staying in Excalibur and that is that there is a Pizza Hut on the dining floor. I ate so many personal pan pizzas (pre-GF) that I was practically seeping pepperoni from my pores. 

Something I discovered on a more recent visit is that there is an all you can drink champagne tasting every day on the dining floor at the center bar\/restaurant. Score!

Dick's Last Resort is located on the gaming floor and is good for some wings and a few laughs. Our server was particularly inappropriate on our last visit which was great because in Vegas we like things to be more over the top. He actually made out with my friend after she demonstrated a sexual way to eat wings. Hilarious misconduct! I just wish she let me take pictures of it.

The pool area is nothing fancy but the four varying pool styles make it great for everyone. The shallow wading pool is great for cooling off and fending off a hangover. The adults only pool is great because screaming kids won't interrupt your afternoon nap. The ""kids"" pool has a slide. The first pool as you enter the area is probably the worst in my opinion. It's just a big hole with 5 feet of water. Nothing special. 

The casino floor has several $5 tables that stay busy all day.

Excalibur is one of those mega resorts that tricks you into thinking it is small. You can easily get lost trying to find your favorite machine or even the correct exit. After a few days you should be able to stumble from one end to the other without fail.

I will always go back to this hotel for gaming and the pool even if I am not actually staying there. Those two reasons alone are why this hotel gets 4 stars instead of 3. Visit here, don't stay here.

Update 2016:

I have now stayed here more times than I can count. I will continue to stay here when I want something cheap and conveniently located. The rooms keep getting little upgrades and they even upgraded the pool areas. Now the ""big hole"" pool is a useable 3ft deep pool with a sitting ledge all the way around it and more lounge areas. The wading pool now has some deeper spots. The adults area has a wading area now that was great for our floats when we rented a cabana over there. The side still exists and is a fun treat for sweaty adults and children alike. The table games are quite busy these days. I have to wait for a spot at the craps table most nights. Just like all MGM properties in Vegas, they now charge for self parking which I think is one of the greediest moves a casino can make. I will not be driving here to enjoy cheap gambling anymore. I will head to another hotel that still offers free parking.",1,1,1

Why?

Cuz they suck.

Early the day before mother's day last year, I awoke to see a stranger going through our stuff on the dresser WHILE WE WERE THERE SLEEPING!
Long story short: I screamed, guy grabs a couple bags and takes off, DH gives chase, I follow only to have the door close behind me with DS by himself, locked in the room and on the bed.  Now I'm hysterical cuz I can't get to my baby...guy got away, ditched the bags, and DH hobbles back bleeding from his foot.  Finally security shows up and I can get inside the room to DS who is now also hysterical.

Here's where it gets interesting...Security takes report and within 5 minutes starts telling us we probably LEFT OUR DOOR AJAR!  Are you f*$*@& kidding me?  Yeah, we left our door wide open just in case we were expecting guests at 6 in the morning.  We got no help and no assistance from management.  No offers to change room, would not change the lock codes...and did I mention, DH broke his foot in 2 places. 

So now I'm in Vegas with a baby, a carseat, a stroller, diaper bag, 2 suitcases and a husband on crutches.  You think they'd help us out getting to the airport or SOMETHING.  Nope.  Just pointed us in the direction of the taxi stand and if we needed a wheelchair to transport my husband down from our room, that'll be $17 per day.  Thank you very much.

Would I like to complain?  YES!  Can I please talk to a manager or someone with some semblance of authority?  I'm politely told that I need to talk to someone in guest relations.  Great!  Where can I find guest relations?  Oh, they won't be in until Monday.

I'm really glad she did. This was so much better  than I expected. After picking her up from the airport and getting some breakfast, I called the property to see how early she would be able to check in and was pleasantly suprised that she would be able to as soon as we were able to get there (it was just past noon).

Upon check in there was a bit of a line, but it moved at fairly good pace. When it was our turn we were fortunate to get Cynthia to help up check in to the property. She was very sweet and answered numerous questions without a hint of being annoyed. She was quite personable and joked with us as well. Again, I asked if Mom could be on a higher floor and when we got to the room we were pleasntly suprised. She upgraded her to one of the newer, updated rooms with a view of the strip! Wow! Fantastic! Mama got hooked UP on this trip! lol

The room was clean and spacious, and stocked with plenty of toiletries. Everyone I encountered on the property was friendly and helpful. 

As for the gambling, the machines were pretty freaking tight for us. No luck there. The property is a bit dated since it was built in the early 90's , but I thought that the sheer cheesiness of it all was also its charm. It is what it is. If you are looking for the Wynn or Bellagio, than you drank WAY too much and staggered into the wrong place.

I had heard many, many unflattering things about the place since I moved here, but I was honestly happy with how we were treated.

A-OK is right on the money! By no means is this hotel fancy! It is on the southern end of the strip so if you want to be in the middle of all the action try a different hotel especially for ladies who neither want to walk a mile in their high heels nor take a cab a few blocks away either. 

When you walk into this hotel you get that smell of oooooold cigarette smoke trying to be masked by tons of air fresheners!! Kind of a weird scent that made my head hurt the whole time.

The room was fine though the people at the front desk did hassle us about the room we had booked saying that the packaged deal we paid for had listed the wrong price and tried to give us a different room in the first tower which we refused to do so they had to oblige and give us the room we had booked. (Good thing we brought our confirmation paper!) The room was fine we stayed in Tower 2 (the widescreen room, although come to think of it our TV didn't work...) There were only poor food choices in the Excalibur: their ""Roundtable Buffet"" was gross, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Quiznos....McDonalds was the only place open late night and therefore there were huge lines at 5 am (Even Starbucks wasn't open yet!) From our room we could see about 5 different pools and a few hot tubs scattered around though we didn't go in because it was only about 65 degrees and so windy! =(

My biggest issue with the room was that it had NO full length mirrors!! Any ladies out there should know that a full length mirror is essential especially for your Vegas adventures!  I ended up dragging one of the chairs into the bathroom so that I could climb onto it and get the full view of my outfit (super hot I might add!! hehe). P.S. the only mirror worth using was the one in the bathroom seeing as the other one in the room had a low hanging lamp right in front of it! WTF!? Also the lighting in the room is terrible so you'll definitely want to get dolled up in the bathroom. (Also if you are not accustomed to so much cigarette smoke and air pollution be sure to pack your best moisturizer! After the first 5 hours my face felt super dry and it even started flaking. I ended up returning to my room several times to try and repair my skin with as much moisturizer and skin serums as possible.)

Also on a side note for the two days that I stayed there, there were four water glasses and a wicker basket outside of my room in the hall and although we knew the housekeeping had been by to bring new towels, the glasses remained there during our stay which I thought wasn't safe (what if I got too wasted I could of fell on them and cut myself!? Thankfully that didn't happen!)

P.S. be sure to book your hotel early seeing as the prices skyrocket the closer you get to your date....especially since my trip was for Spring Break weekend.

I chose this property not only for it's proximity to the arena but also for the price. I booked my room on a 3rd party site which was offering what they listed as, ""Run-of-the-house"" room. I still don't know what that means. All I knew was that the price offered was amazingly low for a strip hotel. Once the resort fee was added, however, I may as well have stayed an extra day. The resort fee was basically double the price of the room. 

I was flying into town early for the event and flying out early again to go to work the next day. On the booking site, it allowed us to request a check in time. Since my flight was landing around 7:30a, I requested a check-in time of 8a - 9a. It took a few days to get an answer, but I finally got an email confirmation saying that the property has approved my request contingent on room availability.

I arrived at the hotel at approximately 8:10a. I went to the registration desk and was told flatly that I could not check in until 11am. I told the agent at the desk that I had requested an early check in on the booking site and he just said that it was based on availability and they had none. Since I had already had breakfast before I left home, there wasn't much I could do except wait. Imagine my surprise as I watched customer after customer go to registration and are given rooms as I sit in the lobby for almost three hours, being told there were no available rooms. I even tried to use the mobile app to upgrade to see if that would allow me to register earlier, to no avail.

I finally had enough and went back up to registration where an agent finally took pity on me and gave me a room, albeit two and a half hours later. I was given a room on the 11th floor with a view of the pool. 

Decent room. There were two beds, a bureau, two chairs and a table. Bureau held a room safe. The closet had rusty hangers, an iron and a luggage caddie. The TV in the room is mounted on the wall. TV channels came in kind of fuzzy. Didn't matter to me as I only watched the TV while I was getting ready to leave for my event and when I was packing up my things. There was a large wall (on in this case floor, since that's where it was located) a\/c unit that was mostly hidden behind some sort of box. It made trying to get to the a\/c controller a bit difficult. The a\/c was not on when I arrived, so the room was a little stuffy. I turned on the until to cool the room a little. I set it to 72 degrees F and to automatically keep the room at that temperature. It was a cool day (temperature wise) so it wasn't necessary to keep the room any cooler than that. The unit was SOOOOOO loud. If I was in the room for more than the one day I probably would have complained. 

The bed was comfortable enough. There were two pillows per bed. I don't know if this is another trend for hotels, but there was no comforter on the bed. There was some decorative half sheet at the foot of the bed, white top sheet, a scratchy brown blanket in the middle and another white sheet underneath that. The three layers of blankets were not enough to keep me warm, however. Luckily, I had my own throw blanket that I was brought for the plane ride to keep me warm. I tried to up the temperature to 74 degrees F, but the noisiness of the a\/c until interfered with my attempts to sleep, so I just turned the darn thing off.

The bathroom had a large wall-to-wall mirror, large rectangular sink, and hair dryer. I don't know if it was intentional, or the housekeeper forgot to replace the conditioner, but there was only one bottle of shampoo and one bottle of lotion. The shower was fine. The toilet was fine. 

As I previously mentioned I was in town for an event at T-Mobile arena. Normally, in order to get across the street to the arena, you would use the pedestrian bridges on the street corners to walk across. However, the pedestrian bridge that went from Excalibur to New York, New York was closed. To get to New York, New York, you had to use the pedestrian bridge from Excalibur to Tropicana, Tropicana to MGM, then MGM to New York, New York. Or you could take the dodgy way by going through the Excalibur Resort tower entrance, through the ride share parking lot for T-Mobile, under the bridge and through the fences. If you're traveling with a companion or two, you could go this way. If you're solo, I would suggest going the long way. 

Oh, another thing. There were sales people pushing shows on us at every turn. They're as pushy as those time share people. I would pretend to be on the phone as I walked by just so they'd leave me alone.

So overall, it was just barely an average stay. I don't know that I would stay here again. The only thing really going for it is the proximity to the arena. Other than that, you could probably save a little elsewhere, pay for the arena parking and still pay less. Or even use one of the ride share companies and save even more money.",1,0,0

The beds were super comfy with nice fluffy pillows.

 It was a bit tricky figuring out the maze of  th ehotel and all the different entrances\/exits. Parking sucks unless you're in tower two where there is a convenient parking structure outside of it. 

The pools were very nice, overall pretty clean, staff was either very friendly or very rude. I got carded more to play cards than to drink.  I'd advise you to use your own towels in the pool. 

The decor is cheesy, but what did you expect? Its' the Excalibur and I'm all about the cheese factor. 

The best part is is that if you don't like the decor, the casino, the restaurants inside the Excalibur but want a cheap place to sleep after partying all night there are about 20 other hotels\/casinos to go spend all your money in. 

Bottom line this place gets a 3-star because it's very average, there was no above and beyond I encountered enough rude staff to negate the friendly staff but I would stay here again, probably.",2,0,0

We got the room free because hubby is a high roller. LOL! All we ended up paying was $26 for the resort fee. Not bad but I still hate the idea of paying a resort fee. Where in the hell does this resort fee go to? Hotels on the strip never had a stupid resort fee before. This is just a rip off if you ask me! That's why we hardly ever stay on the strip. Too expensive! It's cheaper to stay in old Downtown. No resort fees there. Checking in was easy but the lines were long for a Wednesday night. Crazy!

The room we had was a standard with two queen beds in the new tower. It was good for the price. It was a non smoking room with windows facing the pool.

I was pretty excited when I saw they have something like Medieval Times called the Tournament of Kings. Unfortunately, since it is a dinner show I passed on it since it was early afternoon and we do have a Medieval Times in Dallas. I wanted to do things I couldn't do or see back home.

As I walk through the inside, I see they kept up the castle theme decor. They have a Dicks's Last Resort. Cool! Again, I had to pass on that since I've been to the one in Dallas. This place seems pretty cool inside. Next time, I will check out the arcade game room.",12,4,7

Since we wanted to spend our day either hitting attractions or sitting poolside, this place did nicely as the pool area was adequate and we were able to walk or bus wherever needed from the strip. 

HOTEL \/ ROOMS: The lobby and casino does stink of smoke and air freshener, and the hallways do seem like a scene from the Shining... However once inside the rooms (even the Tower 1 rooms), while the furniture is quite dated, the mattress is new and comfy, the bathroom is clean, there is a safe in the room, an iron and ironing board in the closet, a half decent tv, and you can come up with many creative ways to make up for the fridge with ice and garbage pails. Okay, a fridge would be a nice touch but they are rare to find in 3 star hotels. As for the timeshare people, they are pretty easy to spot. If anyone in a navy blue blazer comes up just say ""no thanks"" or ""have a good day"" as they attempt to make discussion with you. 

SMOKE AVOIDANCE TIP: if you're not actually going to gamble, you only need to spend time in the casino or lobby when making your way to the pool or the foodcourt. Otherwise walk out the doors near the elevators and walk around to the front walkways and off the property.

FOOD: The food court is convenient, although much of the food is not very good and definitely not healthy. But it redeems itself for allowing me to repeatedly destroy a 20 pack of chicken McNuggets at 3 in the morning. We also got an all day pass for the buffet one day, and breakfast and lunch were admittedly pretty good even though there wasn't many people there (it was mid week and we went during off hours). We went to the Luxor for dinner just to change it up and was very unimpressed. Seemed just like lunch, but with a few extra salads and a couple new (but terrible) meats available. It was worth the price of eating for the day but I couldn't imagine eating there multiple days of it. 

POOL: nice pool areas, on the weekend they opened the 3rd pool which even had a slide. Was able to find a recliner most of the time, sometimes a bit of scouring and timing required. Only twice did I notice children in the adults pool section and we were out there pretty much every day. Service was quite spotty for getting a drink but once you actually got the waitresses attention they were typically very friendly.

That being said, they could use a few small improvements, especially in the shower area, which is badly in need of a shelf to put shampoo bottles on. My neighbor's shower was louder than mine (and they seemed to need like five a day!), so they may want to look at the plumbing between rooms 20232 and 20230. And I know they want you to go down and buy coffee from their (Crappy) Castle Coffee stand right next to the elevators, but an in-room coffee maker would still be nice as I find facing anything to do with Vegas first thing when I wake up a humongous task if I don't have at least a little caffeine in me. Also, I paid extra for a room with an HD-TV, but they don't have a single HD station on the regular cable. I was here for a wedding and didn't have a lot of $$ to go out and gamble, so the TV was one of my few sources of entertainment (especially at night), and I have to say for the price I paid it was NOT worth it.

However, the bed was comfortable and had just the right amount of bedding and pillows, and I enjoyed the fact that the window opened a couple inches so I could get fresh air up on the 20th floor. I do wish they would patrol the corridors and make sure people don't scream and yell near the rooms...I understand it's Vegas, but people still need to sleep at some point :\/",0,0,0

My family, friends and I just returned from my Birthday weekend celebration here. It was a memorable stay both with good and bad. Let's start with the good...

Pros: The Steakhouse at Camelot is BY FAR one of the BEST steakhouses in Vegas. We were blown away by how delicious the food was. we received generous portions of delicious food. The service was great. We had our own little private room to celebrate my birthday which was very memorable indeed.
POOL: We rented a cabana for our group on Saturday next to the adult pool. We were greeted by a young gentleman who was very friendly and was ready to help us have a great time by providing excellent service. We had an AWESOME time playing cornhole, swimming and enjoying the slide. Our poolside cocktail waitress was named Ali and she provided exceptional service as well. Food from Drenched poolside bar was ok not good not bad. The pool, cabana, and steakhouse were by FAR the best parts of Excalibur.

now the CONS: CHECK IN LINE WAS INSANE!!! I have stayed here before and have never waited over an hour to check in. Not only did we wait this line but our friends and family all arrived at different times and they too had their own check in nightmare stories. My dad and stepmoms reservation wasn't even in their system but they were already charged for their room. They were very upset after driving the long hot desert drive to get to Vegas to wait in an hour line to be told their was no room for them!! Luckily they managed to ""squeeze"" them in. 
FOOD: Selections are mediocre at best. Expensive fast food garbage.
SHOW: We wanted to see the Tournament of Kings show but we were not offered any kind of special discounts or group rates even when we asked at the box office. 
ROOM: ""upgraded room"" ??? Not sure what was upgraded in the room.... Looked like same old Excalibur room to me. 

We are Mlife members and have been for awhile now. Nothing as far as upgrades, show discounts, or anything was given to us for our stay. We are very disappointed in Excalibur and Mlife as a whole during this trip. Excalibur will definitely not be our first choice of hotel in the future.",0,0,0

Pros:

- Great rate! $90 for a 4 person room during Spring Break. Pretty much the best deal on the strip after shitty old Imperial Palace

- Very spacious rooms. Good amount of floor space to lay everything out, huge bathroom and showers. Our room came with a 42"" TV, which we didn't use too much but it was nice to have. The beds are pretty typical, but who really cares when you're passed out from a long night of partying?

Cons:

- The room was a bit outdated. I understand that they're upgrading their rooms, so I guess most rooms will eventually look a lot newer. Not an inconvenience, just something that could be improved.

- No free-wifi in the rooms. Not sure if any hotel in Vegas has free wi-fi, but it would've been nice.

Overall, a pretty good experience. We weren't looking for anything too fancy and wanted to keep the price low. We got what we paid for and left happy. Thanks Excalibur!",2,1,1

I went back to registration and asked to move up even just one level. They said they were full for the room we had. Okay, so I offered to pay to be upgraded, just go get off of the first floor. The gentleman said he still didn't have any other rooms available. So there were absolutely no open rooms in the whole hotel on a Monday night??!

So what, I was in high school when Excalibur was built in 1990, and the thought still holds the same magic for me.  I brought my D&D 20-sided die for good measure. 

Excalibur is one of the strip's greatest ironies.  The architecture is surely different like every eclectic casino on the strip, but it's ""Disney"" appearance is both its attraction and distraction.  Those looking for a bit of tinseltown might head to MGM, those yearning for a metropolis would venture towards New York New York and those looking for love can find it in gay Pareeee, Paris.

Despite its colored turrets, Excalibur is very in your face unassuming and nondescript. Irony.  My room and king bed was amazing - while it wasn't a suite - it lacked the smell of cigarettes - mostly, and allowed me a view of the strip, and at least a 60"" flat screen plasmas.  Not bad at all.  

Given room prices may fluctuate because of certain events going on (SEMA and championship Bullriding) in Vegas at the time, I was able to get a room averaging $130 a night for three (3) nights.  Since the hotel isn't in the heart of the strip and just off it, you don't have to fight through that tampon-snug traffic that pervades the strip continually.  

This weekend was the first time I cabbed it around Vega$ with some cool Ethiopian cabbies and learned some new shortcuts around town.  This was perhaps the most valuable.  One Russian cabbie told me he had a Thai wife and loved Obama.  I was compelled to say PROST!, but that's a German drinking toast.

I realized later that I never felt too crowded in Excalibur - just busy enough for me.  This is not to say the casino wasn't busy, but definitely, a place I'd consider coming back to.  I did hear a lot of English accents.  Go figure.  Why stay in a fake castle when you've got your own historically in Great Britain? I guess the idea is akin to visiting a Starbucks or McDonald's overseas.  Irony.",6,7,7

THE GOOD is how wonderful the staff were. 
They were very helpful from the receptionists to the housekeepers. 
Our room was a contemporary room and so we had no issues with anything in our room. We actually enjoyed it as we were traveling as a family with two boys. They liked the hotel room more than anything, they especially liked the view they had of the pool. 

THE BAD is how much my sons eyes were red and blood shot everytime we had to walk through the casino. Being a smoker really wouldn't bother you but for a child it bothered him a great deal and my other son started a cough that lasted until after we left. When my husband or I were in the Casino we had to worry about the network going down and the slots not providing us with the pay out we were entitled to. So we wasted countless hours waiting around for someone to come to our machine to help even thought the machine indicated it was in need of some assistance with the light blinking at the top. Half the time more lights were blinking than not blinking. 

THE UGLY was the same as the other reviews....The timeshare people. They are relentless and if it wasn't for my husband I would have gotten into something that I didn't want any part of. They immediately come off as if they are people trying to offer you a good deal on shows and draw you in but then they let you know that you will need to go see or do something for them that will only take 2 hours. WRONG it will take ALL day and if you only have 3 days in Vegas you now will only have 2. Good Luck!!!

My family and I will look into staying at NYNY, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, or even MGM next time as there were much better Casino's and shops within these hotels.

In both towers:
- we booked 2 queen sized beds. Comfy enough!
- shower (no tub) that only had one small soap holder to keep your stuff. Strong water pressure!
- iron, board, hair dryer, key pad safe

- spacious bathrooms

- safe located in dresser under TV
- modern interior decor with granite countertop in bathroom'

Had no problems connecting to wi-fi throughout the hotel. 

We received a coupon book upon check in which had tons of coupons for both Excalibur and Luxor. There was a $20 coupon towards 3 bars\/restaurants at Excalibur. We used ours at the ""Lobby Bar"" (located in the lobby where you check in) and got 2 drinks + 1 bottle of water! 

Some of the restaurants I could remember at the top of my head: Johnny Rockett's and Krispy Kreme by Tower 1. Baja Fresh by Tower 2. Dick's Last Resort by the casino. In the foodcourt: 24 hour market, McDonald's, Pick up Stix, Popeye's, Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, Schlotzky's.

The kids in our group went to the ""Fun Dungeon"" aka arcade often. There are only a few midway games, but more arcade games that accept quarters.

From Excalibur, you can take a tram to Mandalay Bay. There is also a bridge to New York, New York which has a bridge connecting to MGM. You're also ON the strip so plenty of other restaurants, shops, hotels, etc are walking distance!  

We experienced fantastic customer service by Seth at the front desk, another lady at the front desk whose name I can't remember, and a hilarious bartender from Sherwood's bar! 

However, we were NOT happy being CONSTANTLY approached by the aggressive greeters who would walk right up to your face and\/or keep following you. ""Are you staying at the hotel? Are you checking in?

The hotel was still affordable and had decent service (free upgrade!), but the casino floor itself had changed a little bit, not for the better.  For one, my $5 craps table was gone.  Some of the games had been shifted around as well, although reverse-bonus pai-gow had a unique feel to it.  Also, the poker room that I raved about is back to a normal poker room, which was most disappointing.  Dealers, however, were friendly and helpful.

My room, even with upgrade, was very standard.  Bed was of average comfort, but the pillows were incredibly tiny.  Sheets were also very, very low thread count, and I found it difficult to get comfy.  Wired Internet with no desk also seemed counterintuitive.

However, and again, the crux of my first review remains:  Excalibur is a 'middle of the road' casino, great for families and people on a budget.

I gotta admit though, I wish I had stayed at the other hotels like, Encore or The Bellagio, but I can't complain. The rooms were BIG, we got a room with two queen sized beds and it was able to fit 7 people in there comfortably. Though it's an older hotel, I don't think the smell of smoke is as bad as some reviewers say. I stayed in the MGM on my last visited and the moment those doors opened it was like a WHOOSH of cigarette smoke straight into your face. It's like they don't even try to filter the air in the hotel. x.x Oh, if I were to ever go here again, I'd bring a thicker blanket because the blankets that they offer us are SERIOUSLY thin and the AC is ALWAYS on even though you turned it off. 

This hotel has a ""family-oriented"" feel to it, I guess it's because of the Castle-like exterior that makes kids want to come here. The next time I'd spend a little more money on one of the newer hotels further down the strip. Maybe it'll feel more ""adult-like"" and has that VEGAS feel I heard so much about.",0,1,0

It's not a bad hotel, but it tends to fill up with families and children. I guess this is a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective. 

The buffet is probably the worst on the strip. It isn't much better than Old Country Buffet. They have a deal now where for $25 you can visit the buffet all day. You can leave and come back. My advice would be to spend $25 at the Bellaggio or Paris for Brunch. You will get a fantastic meal and wont be hungry for the rest of the day anyways. 

I do like the photo of the woman advertising the $25 all day buffet. She looks like she a psychotic clown who is about to orgasm over the shitty food. 

They also set up beer pong tables late at night. The advertisement for this shows a bunch of well dressed professionals in their mid to late 30's playing beer pong. I had to laugh, there is no way these people have played beer pong in the past 15 years.",1,1,0

As we drove up the strip to get to the hotel, our daughters were very excited to see this was the hotel we were going to spend a few days in. 

Check-in was relatively easy though the line wasn't really long and the wait was about 30 minutes. I was unable to take advantage of mobile check-in as I wanted to use a credit card for the charges (not my debit card, which was what I had initially booked online with). Thank goodness I didn't use my debit, but more on that later. 

We had ""upgraded"" to a Royal Tower room (rather than the Resort Tower). I'm not sure what the upgrade actually was. The rooms square footage is identical (two queen bed set up). There is no mini-fridge and according to the front desk, only the suites have fridges. I needed one for medication and they sent one right up at no charge, which I certainly appreciated. There IS a designated spot for the mini-fridge in the entertainment unit that is just an empty hole. I can't figure out why they don't have this particular amenity?

Cleanliness - this was a bit concerning to me. The first thing I did was go to turn on the air conditioner and when I lifted the lid to the controls there was a piece of gum, still in the wrapper and smushed.  In the bathroom there was hair all over the wall. And once we took a hot shower, you could read messages people had written in the mirror - one was the F-word (my 11 year old found that one first) and another said ""Eat, sleep, rave. EDC"" which was a recent happening in Vegas. This tells me they aren't particularly diligent about cleaning the bathroom.  The bed closest to the wall had a charger on the floor from a previous guest - so not sure the room was vacuumed because it was right out in the open. 

There is no bathtub. This wasn't a huge deal but I would have liked to have known that ahead of time since we were traveling with children. No fridge and no bathtub was kind of a double whammy BUT the bathroom is really big and that's nice. 

When I booked the room it was 50% off since we were traveling during the week. I told the computer there would be a second and third person and paid extra at the time to have them added. I didn't understand why there were still only two sets of towels for four people (because why do they ask, I know it's to collect the money, but at least give us the amenities). In any event, I called for towels and they came right up. 

Our toilet clogged and maintenance came up to fix it - they believed that the floor below us was having a problem which was wrecking havoc on the 25th floor (where we were). They had to come four times to plunge it and took hours each time. I'm pregnant and have two kids with us so the toilet not being stable was a bit of an issue. 

Finally, they had a problem with my credit card and ended up pending over $1000 on it (rather than the owed $300 plus $50 A DAY in potential ""amenity fees""). Thank goodness that wasn't my debit card because that would have created a real spending issue for us. They were able to fix this upon check-out (which meant we had to wait about 30 minutes in line rather than using Express) and even waived two ""resort fees"" which saved us about $70. I appreciated that. 

This is not a fancy hotel. It's adequate for lodging but the price is right (if you don't tell them you have four people, anyway). It's location is what I think keeps it in business - near M&M's World and Coke as well as easy to navigate to New York, New York, the MGM, and Luxor, etc.",5,1,1

The pool is pretty huge and is nice, but is more geared for people who are coming with their kids.

My husband and a group of friends were in town November 12-14th for the big boxing match up of Pacquiao vs Cotto. 
I know as much as most people know that when you go with a big group of friends- you are never in your room but a few hours to sleep, change, shower, and actually that's pretty much it. Had we brought our two kids it would be a different story. 

We stayed in their wide screen room in Tower 2. The wide screen rooms were completely renovated and looked really nice actually. Very sleek and modern. 
So we checked in pretty late on Thursday night, nearly 11pm. We then dropped off our luggage and met up with friends. When we got back to our room at 430 am we noticed there was no remote control to the flat panel TV- again were in what they called the wide screen room. Not wanting to be charged for someone else taking a stupid hotel remote I quickly called to the desk to let them know and to bring one up. You would think that at 430 am on Friday morning they would be quick to bring it up. NOOO... I called twice once at 450 in which they replied it would be any minute now, then again at 515 to try and cancel it since I was falling asleep- to which they replied they couldn't stop him since he had been dispatched already- REALLY? you couldn't get on the walkie talkie think he was obviously carrying with him to tell him the guests were asleep?!?! nope.. nada.. didn't happen my friends- 535am and ""POUND POUND POUND"" not even a gentle know but an angry pound pound pound... quickly got me to the door where a not so friendly bellboy shoved the remote in my hand and quickly left... WTF.. so of course I went down the next day and complained.. and they were nice enough to refund that whole night to me... and I got comped for food.. yay...

my question is why are they making people wait if the room is already cleaned ?
i`d understand if the room is not ready or cleaned and then for $30 they give me another room that is already been cleaned but that was not the case, it was just greed and they wanted us to wait and see when will we pay the extra $30 , that is not what I or anybody else calls HOSPITALITY!

I do understand the reviews about the age of the hotel - but you get what you pay for - if you are wanting extravagance perhaps a medieval theme hotel is not really for you. It is an older hotel so it is expected that there would be some wear. Also the overwhelming smell of coconut to cover the years of tobacco is one of the first things I noticed on the casino floor. 

 I found the staff to be very responsive - and I tend to be a bit high maintenance. Our TV did not work when we arrived and we went to dinner and came back and it was fixed. We also required a few extra blankets and towels and they brought them up by the truckload - even though I called at 4am.

As far as security is concerned; we had accidentally left our door open during the day and within 15 min security was at the door to check that we were ok. I did notice there was not a chain lock on the door and perhaps that would help with the reviews regarding thieves.  

The pool was nice even in 107 degree weather. It was full but we were still able to find 5 loungers in the middle of the day together. And the music was nice but not too loud or distracting.

I was a bit disappointed that the valet was full the whole time we were there - that is one of my favorite features in Vegas - free valet parking.  And though it was a bit unorthodox to only have a shower (no tub) but I did not miss it at all. 

Also it would be great to have wireless Internet - even if it is only for resort guest - the wired Internet was not helpful for our cellphones and iPads.

We entered in a side door near tower one and the nice gentleman checking to make sure only hotel guests entered the hotel portion pointed us in the right direction. 

While checking in the guy that was helping us seemed nervous mentioning that the only rooms left were on the first floor since we had reserved a king bed. He genuinely seemed relieved when we didn't care. He was very friendly and checking in was as smooth as I could have hoped for. 

The room itself was definitely out dated but it was clean and comfortable. As we were only there for two nights I left the do not disturb sign up all day since I prefer to not have people enter my room. Because of this I'm not able to comment on their maid service. 

As for the casino we played the slots and video poker for many hours going up and down. We also played black jack at one of the tables for a few hours. The dealer (Shar) was very nice. Ultimately we broke even, not bad for two days gambling and drinking. 

My main complaint was that the waitresses did not come around that often and on more than one occasion we went over an hour before someone came around, even when we were at the tables.

We had asked to be put all on the same floor but we were spread out throughout the hotel. When I got in my room, it smelled of extremely strong cinnemon and their spray air freshner. The window was bolted closed. The bathroom door knob was broken and the toilet handle kept getting stuck so the water kept filling the tank. I had asked for a different room after a few hours and I was moved to a different floor. 

In the new room, the bed linens were old and thin with holes in some areas. The air conditioner unit was old fashioned so it was either on or off. The only good thing about the room was that it was quiet. 

One co-worker walked into her room and it smelled of smoke... being a non-smoking room, she requested a different room since she couldn't breathe. The bedspread had cigarette burn marks on it and the pillow case was full of holes. Don't the cleaning people inspect the linen before they use it? I saw the pillow case and it looked like it should have been a rag! She was not happy with the room and requested another change. Third room was still atrocious but we were on the same floor so she kept it. 

One other co-worker walked into her room and checked out her bed. There was a bug on her pillow. She called housekeeping who denied there was a bug on her pillow even though my co- worker was staring right at it and watching it walk. Housekeeping didn't even show up. They offered her a room change which she took. We ended up on the same floor. 

The other 3 co-workers all thought the Excaliber was a complete dump and was asking why our company sent us to this place instead of somewhere more nice. Our company responded with because they were very cheap rooms! The others were not happy with their room but did not say much except that for sure next year, we will insist we are roomed at a much much nicer hotel. 

One good thing was the tram from Excalibur to the Luxor and there is a bridge that you can cross to go to New York New York. But I will never stay here again.",2,1,0

Luckily, I didn't spend much on it (2 for 1 deal = $10 each). There was a food court with the standard food you'd expect to find: McDonald's, Quizno's, Krispy Kream etc. There was also a Dick's Last Resort.

I booked the hotel through a getaway package with jetblue. The price and the review made me a little worried so I booked the contemporary room.

My plane arrived at 2 and we got to the hotel at 2:30. I got in line for check in and it was long. I swear this line was crazy. Maybe bc of the time and it was at check in time but was it long. I got to the front and ask if I can check in a little before 3 she said yes and she was very nice. Then we decided to upgrade with a view of the strip. 


When we got into our room. It was very nice and clean and a perfect view of the strip on the 27th floor. I was very pleased. It came to be like 70 dollar a night with the resort fee and all the upgrade. Please see pic below. Everyone on the floor was supper nice. The cleaning lady and staff was on point. The only draw back for the room is the noise from the street. Even on the 27th floor out of 28 you can still hear it. So consider getting a view of the pool for noise purposes. 


We stayed an extra night due to flight cancellations and they accommodate it. 

We got the 20 bucks early book and we used it for 2-3 drinks at the bar and got some coconut water. And just tipped like 8 bucks 

The spa was amazing. For an extra 10 bucks I used the sauna and steam room and my skin felt brand new

I hate the timeshare people. Get a hint when I make no eye contact.

I booked a royal preferred king room. I was a little disappointed they put me on the 2nd floor, but getting downstairs was quick. Also, I did not plan for being in the room much, I am only there to shower, sleep, and shit. Room was relatively clean. It was not immaculate, but it was not filthy. Bed was a little on the soft side (I prefer more of a stiff mattress), the pillows were a little to fluffy (I prefer more of a flat pillow). Air conditioner was a little noisy, but kept the room cool. There was a constant noise happening, kind of like being in an airplane during flight. It was not coming from the room itself, but it did bother me the first night. Water pressure was a joke, I feel sorry for anybody with thick long hair. House keeping was there daily and replaced all towels and soaps. Wi-Fi was OK, seemed at little spotty at times, but I was just checking e-mails and not trying to stream anything.
Self parking is $8.00 per day (I know people are upset about it). When you first arrive you get a ticket at the gate, but then use your room key to get in and out. Parking was charged to my room. I did not use valet parking. There is a designated Uber and Lyft pick-up and drop-off point.
Casino looked clean. I am not much of a gambler, as I live next to two Indian casinos and able to gamble when I want. Everyone I encountered was friendly. Yes, this is an older hotel. Like most casino's people are allowed to smoke. It does not bother me, but expect it. It is not as bad as it was, say 20 years ago. Ventilation seemed pretty good. Your in sin city not Disney land. There is a variety of food shops, but expect the higher Vegas strip prices. Easy access to NYNY and Luxor casinos. I did not use the pool and  I did not use the tram.
Would I recommend this hotel? If your on a budget, want to stay on the strip, and not expecting 5 star resort with Michelin rated restaurants. Well then you can try your luck here.

Like honestly, it's such a rip off. The MGM hotel that doesn't is signature and that's because they have mandatory valet service.

The Buffet is also updated in terms of type of food, and ambiance, to being comparable to other Vegas Strip hotels (unfair to compare to Bellagio or Wynn Buffet though).

Here goes: we bought tickets here for Thunder from Down Under and Tournament of Kings. They have a package deal where you can get two shows of your choice for $75 a person which is a pretty good bargain. Our Thunder tickets were for Sunday night and our Tournament of Kings ones were for Monday night. We worked it out perfectly that we would go from the Lion King show we had tickets for at 4pm to Thunder which was scheduled at 9.

As I mentioned in my Mandalay Bay and Lion King reviews, we found out that the 4pm show had been cancelled and we weren't informed. Panic ensued. When we bought our tickets for the Excalibur shows we were told there were no exchanges or returns, so we had figured that we just wouldn't see the Lion King, which was a total bummer.

We went back to Salena at Excalibur and explained to her our issue. She was very accommodating and switched our tickets for us. We were relieved and thankful. Salena was professional and made us, the customers, really happy and I'm so thankful that she was able to help us. She really saved our trip.

They have the ""Fun Dungeon"" - which is a decent sized arcade located downstairs, food court on the second level (up the escalators in the middle - open late!!), 4 pools (one is an adult pool that you pay to use, and one has a water slide), and of course, the obvious, a large casino floor.

My friend and I stayed in a 2 Queen bed room in Tower II (which is by the pool), on the 27th floor.  We had a great view of the NYNY and the strip from our window.  Our room was clean, but the beds were not very comfortable.

We got suckered into it and it was NOT WORTH the cheap show & free buffet passes IMO).

Overall, I'd stay again!",8,2,5

Check-in line was long, BUT we used one of three self-check-in kiosks and had our room keys in minutes.  Our room was a Double Queen in the Royal Tower just around the corner from check-in.  Plenty of elevators.  Room is very newly remodeled and is just right.  New carpet.  Clean bathroom.  Plenty of towels.  Minimal toiletries, but I bring my own anyway.  No refrigerator or coffee maker, but I don't require those.  Did have an in-room safe, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, flat screen TV, desk, and built in sofa that could have been a bed.  New furniture.  Very comfortable beds and good pillows.  Nice linens.  Plenty of towels and full flow shower with plenty of hot water.  Older window-style air conditioner, but it worked and was quiet.  Good lighting with those great built in reading lights on each bed.  

I have no idea where the dissatisfied reviewers stayed, but my room was great and I had no complaints.

I love this casino.  If you're a poker player and enjoy reasonably priced tournaments all day, this is your casino.  Four tournaments beginning at 9:00 a.m. with the last one starting at 8:00 p.m.  Average 2 to 3 tables per tournament with both 1\/2 no limit and 2\/6 limit spread games available before and after.  I love this poker room.  Well run with good dealers and decent comps.

The casino was being remodeled with new carpet being installed.  I look forward to enjoying it in a few months when I go back.  Good games at decent prices during the day and during the week (i.e. $5 crap table).  

Good drink service.  Several bars throughout the casino.  Starbucks in the casino.  Several eating options in casino and on second floor.  

Note:  If you're just looking for regular coffee in the morning, avoid the long lines at Starbucks and at the kiosks just outside the elevators and head to the Lobby bar.  Play some quarter video poker and drink all the free coffee you like.  No lines.  

I love Excalibur and love the location.  Again, for a poker player, there is Mandalay Bay and MGM poker rooms just a short walk away, but I spend most of my time in Excalibur poker room.",1,0,1

At over 20 years of age (opened in June of 1990), this hotel is now one of the older ones on The Strip.  The decor and furnishings in my guest room were kind of dated, but the room was clean and comfortable enough-- and had a view of New York New York and it's rollercoaster across the street.  Check in and check out were a breeze, and a $20 credit for food and\/or drinks at several hotel bars (plus a whole bunch of other coupons) was included.  The room rate for the night I was there was only about $30, but even after the $20 Las Vegas 'resort fee' was added I felt it was still a good deal.

This property is IMMENSE; I found myself getting lost here repeatedly.  Of course, I'm sure that's intentional since nearly every path leads back through the casino floor or past shops and restaurants en route to another casino floor.

The night stand has clearly visible drink stains everywhere as well. I left notes everywhere for housekeeping. If it's not thoroughly cleaned today I'll have to call guest services. I don't do nasty bathrooms. Should have paid extra and stayed somewhere else for four days. 

I wound up cleaning my shower and wiping down my room. The next day I was in the room when housekeeping came and only wanted her to clean my bathroom and wipe down the phone table area and remove trash. What I did notice was rhey only rinse shower, no disinfect is used, she half wiped the bathroom counter and used s dry towel to wipe the night stand area which did not remove the previous guests glass stains.

We stayed July 2nd-July 5th. The absolute kicker was on the night of the 4th when we went to watch the O show at the Bellagio and came back to the Excalibur in our rental car only to find out that they open all of their parking to the general public on the 4th which meant absolutely no parking for hotel guests, if you happen to be looking for one on that night, which meant we had to go searching for somewhere else to kill time until 2am when it cleared out enough to find parking spot. Who doesn't put their guests first.. That would be Excalibur. Needless to say we will be avoiding Excalibur as a place to spend our money on rooms or on the property in general. Their loss, considering we dropped a few thousand there between our room, shows, gambling, shopping, meals and drinks you would think they would do a little more to keep us coming back...

They need to install air ventilation and purification system throughout the entire resort.

There wasn't a refrigerator or a microwave available. I had some medications that needed to be chilled and had to improvise by storing it in a bag full of ice I set in the bathroom sink. 

I wasn't too worried about having a microwave since I dined out every night but not having a microwave meant I couldn't bring back my leftovers if I decided enjoy my meal again. Really, they need to upgrade their rooms with 21st century amenities.

The beds were made and the rooms were tidied up daily. The bathroom also was kept up the entire time I was there.

Prices vary. It cost me a little more because there was 4 major events happening in town that weekend. Usually, the rates are cheaper if you stay on weekdays. Weekend stays are rather more expensive.

Hotel stuff:  The room was small but fine, even for 4 rather boisterous and bedazzled ladies.  But something crazy was up with the air conditioning or something, because no matter what setting we chose, even ""off,"" the room was constantly humid and muggy.  We were only on the fifth floor!  Hotel rooms should not be MUGGY.
Also, the maid service left a bit to be desired.  We never had enough towels, and they didn't pay attention when they refilled our toiletries in the morning, so we ended up with three body lotions and no shampoo.   ??
Hotel stuff: minus.  For the price, acceptable, especially if you do Vegas right and don't spend any time in your room.

Fun stuff:  I really liked the casino- it's not too elegant and somber like some of the other hotels, making you feel like gambling is serious business and you can't have too much fun.  The dealers are wicked nice, although some of them get a little pushy asking you to throw down for them on the craps table.
I ate at the Sherwood Forest Cafe (all night) and it was a bit overpriced for what was essentially a diner, but it was nice to be able to get real food at any hour.
The pool area was not so great- just plain pools, not many chairs, and they boasted about a daily party each evening that never materialized.  Ouch.

Stuff that was AWESOME:
-Thunder from Down Under:  classy male strip show with muscle-y, accented guys who clearly have a ton of fun and don't mind if you get a little grabby as long as you ""handle with care.""  (Direct quote)  Ladies, I HIGHLY recommend this one.
-Dick's Last Resort: makes no apologies.  Loud and rude and drunk and crazy and half naked, and that could describe the waiters and bartenders or the patrons.  Kickass live band that plays anything you ask, and the final nail in the coffin of awesomeness would be the paper hats the bartenders make patrons who strike their fancy.  One fiance wore a hat on his head that said ""Hello wedding bells, good-bye blow jobs.""  And my grandma (yes I went to a bar in Vegas with my grandma) was given one that said ""I can't believe my granddaughters are such whores.""  That's right.

Excalibur:  keeps it real, which is hard in Vegas.  Not the most plush environment, but comfy, and not overwhelming.",1,0,0

Because he's rooming with another guy from his unit, we figured it would be better for us to get a little alone time and booked a hotel room at Excalibur and was pleasantly surprised. Having previously stayed there with my parents as a kid passing through vegas, a lot about this hotel has changed...and for the better, i think. Here's the breakdown:

1. Located on the South side of the strip, it's slightly far from the center, but close enough to feel part of everything :)
2.  Rooms are decent sized, have a huge bathroom and offer the usual hotel amenities. I did notice there was no mini fridge, which i thought was a bit odd, but who wants to save food in their room when you have the whole strip to walk?
3. The atmosphere here is typical vegas [loud, fun, full of music, booze and  fun!] but I was consistently annoyed by the sales people attempting to lure you into a conversation about ""free tickets"" when in reality nothing is free...unless you ""sit in a short presentation about one of our condos"" which we kindly replied with ""NO!"" and learned to not engage upon approach.
4. This hotel has expanded quite a lot since i've last been here. The second floor is now a food court\/mall combo full of just about everything you could want, including booze.
5. Because this isn't the nicest hotel on the strip and closer to the south, we found the prices to be relatively less expensive than the rest of them!

Because i didn't spend much time in the hotel [except to change or eat dinner once] i wouldn't mind staying here again.",3,0,1

They had the Captain Morgan girls there promoting, so by purchasing a cocktail we got free beach towels!

True, the Excalibur isn't the most luxurious hotel around, but I thought it was a great value and I would stay here again. I don't come to Vegas to sit around in a hotel room, so I would rather sacrifice a little luxury so I have more money to spend doing fun things around town.",1,0,0

It's a great price for what you get. We have gotten rooms here as cheap as $25\/night. The rooms are very spacious and most of them have already been newly renovated with a more elegant look and LCD flat tvs. The bathroom is large with a lot of counter space. 

The parking for the hotel is not too far of a walk, as most of the hotels on the strip are. We have never had a hard time getting parking. 

The hotel is in a good location. It's close to everything if you wanted to walk or drive.

 There is not a good restaurant selection in the hotel but they have a 24 hour food court with a McDonald's and full fledged Krispy Kreme! You can watch the donuts being made! They have recently opened up a Baja Fresh inside as well and have 2 Starbucks locations as well. 

And the best part is you have easy access to 5 other hotels\/casinos. You can go to Mandalay Bay and Luxor without going outside by walking or you could even take the tram. You can just walk across the bridge to MGM or NYNY. 

Customer service has been great and we have even been upgraded a few times at no cost. We have always had a pleasant experience here.

This hotel is MLife's cheapest and oldest hotel.  Perhaps the strips oldest...

I came in with an open mind so I asked to be upgraded in their renovated new rooms. The standard rooms are $20-32 but the upgrade added another $20 plus resort fee of 26 or something like that, the nightly rate became $100 something. 

I love the dealers at the craps table and the poker room is pretty descent.  They even have me comps for the buffet and comped my resort fee. 

So I almost gave this place a 3.5-4 stars until 7am and .... Drilllllllllling started happening next to us.  Apparently our room was so new that they put us next to a room that was still under construction. Oh boy were we pissed.  The drilling and hammering happened for 4 hrs.

So we had no sleep but I contacted the front desk and the refunded everything for us and gave us a late check out until 5pm.  So I'm happy about customer service.  Im not happy about our room being placed next to a construction room, that is a big no-no in the hospitality industry.  Hotel hell should come to this place and help them.

As a landmark in LV, they should really do something about clientele experience. It's supposed to be a castle, and we should be treated like royalty.  M life can do better for their most affordable hotel.

One was for relatives and this was their first time in not only Vegas but the USA. I really wanted to wow them with this trip. They saw the CASTLE of Excalibur and were WOWED! It went downhill from there. Entered my room and the Cheetos from the previous guest were spilled and still on the floor. I immediately called housekeeping. I wasn't upset because ""stuff happens"" and we all make mistakes. I later asked my guests about their room and they conveyed that there was still pee on the toilet seat from the previous guest. Now I am frustrated. Still, I don't make an issue of it. We check out tomorrow, and I requested a late check out beyond the 11am standard time. The lady I spoke to was nice and said she could give me 12 noon. I said I needed at least to 2pm and she said Ok. Later, it dawned on me that I did not set up the late out on both rooms. I called back and the operator says she sees no record of my 2pm out time. If I wanted that I'd have to speak to the front desk. She transferred me to Molly who says she couldn't help me unless I paid $30 additional. That is ridiculous. She says did I get the name of the original operator. Who gets names of operators on basic requests? She transferred me to some incompetent named Mark who is playing the role of a real manager. He can't possibly be. I explain my situation and he is like well you should have got the name. He finally agrees to give me the 12 noon late check out and he won't charge me. The same late check out I had before I spoke to this this this... you pick a name. In the end he ""allowed"" me a 1 pm on one room only.

I hadn't stayed with them in over a decade, but a comped room and buffet thanks to my aggressive MyVegas slot and blackjack play (http:\/\/myvegas.com\/) recently brought me back.  I don't know if all rooms are like the one I got (I think I was upgraded 1 level from the bottom), but mine was very obviously completely renovated, and super clean.

As an MGM Pearl card holder (2nd tier players card), I was able to skip the check in lines.  This is a pretty nice perk, as I believe it's usually Gold (3rd tier) and above that get that benefit at other MGM resorts.

The buffet surprised me as well..  I mean, the last two proceeding buffets I've had recently were Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, and of course it's not like those.  But at a fraction of the price, and the fact that it has improved greatly from my last time having it, I'd definitely recommend.

It was my first time in Vegas so I didn't really know what to expect.. but as the weekend went on and I walked inside some of the neighboring hotels, I suddenly realized this one was more on the low end side.
The casino looks clean and its spacious... and of course they have a girl dancing by the party pit, half naked.
But the hotel part wasn't as good.. 
the employee sitting behind a stand where our rooms were by, was VERY rude. 
My friend asked him if he knew where our room was. our paper said 8-10-48 and we didn't know what the heck that meant. 
He right away snaps at my friend and says (after sighing) ""It says it right here! 8th floor and room 1048."" daaaang can you say rude?! He was talking to her like if she was stupid.. Obviously we didn't know what the numbers meant, otherwise we wouldn't have asked!

So we get to our room and its TINY! yea it had the 2 beds we asked for, BUT there was barely any walking space on either sides of the bed. The heater for the whole tower was on I guess because it was wayyy too hot! every night I had to sleep with the AC on :(

Oh and I almost forgot to mention.. We didn't get any room service till the last day we were there (saturday) when we arrived on Thursday! and it was only because we flagged down the lady cleaning and asked her to go to our room.

As an Mlife member, I absolutely have to stay at an MGM-operated resort while in I'm in Vegas, but because I was here for business, I needed to keep costs low, and I was luckily able to secure some rooms for around $30 a night--again, not bad for a strip hotel.  Through some sweet talk, I was able to upgrade my room two tiers for free, but there really isn't all that big a difference with them.  Tower 2 has better views than Tower 1, and that's really all I can think about it.

My biggest gripe with Excalibur is that there's no Wi-Fi here (yet), so that prevented me from getting any work done in my hotel room.

The gambling here is so-so.  I like that the craps table (the minimum actually goes as low as $5) has all the bonus bets that the MGM Grand has, and I noticed that it's pretty much like that for all craps tables operated by MGM.  When I lose I normally bet at another casino, as long as it's an MGM one, and that strategy has been working.  Excalibur is within walking distance to Luxor, Mandalay Bay, New York New York, Monte Carlo, and the MGM Grand, so it's easy to stay within the mLife confines.

But what really gives this place its value is the fact that it has its own food court, and places like McDonalds are open 24\/7, so yes, it's the perfect time to stock up on Spicy McChickens when things aren't going your way.

Plus they have Dick's Last Resort!  Never tried it yet, but I felt that was worth mentioning.

Arrival
Got there around 1ish and was told our room wasn't available. THEN was was told we could upgrade for an additional $15 a night to the Royal Tower room which looked exactly like the room we booked with a better comforter... An obvious sham to get us for more money, but to get my wife and kids off of their feet after the plane ride I opted for the other room at the higher price. 
There was a special that said if you upgrade you received free buffet vouchers which we showed them on the website. They refused to honor it. 
Went to the pool and was bombarded with tons of rap music and profanity (which I personally don't mind) but thought it a bit in appropriate for my 5&10 year old daughters at the kiddie pool! 

If that wasn't bad enough there was an overly aggressive salesman trying to check out a timeshare for the place that had treated us so horribly. 

And lastly adding insult to injury we decided to take them to the ""Fun Dungeon"" arcade that supposedly was to close at 10pm but when we got there at 9:15 half of the games were already shut down and after we had changed $50 into quarters the staff proceeds to go around unplugging machine after machine. The only game my daughters were able to play were 1 game of air hockey and 1 race car game after I had to literally argue with the attendant who kept repeating ""We're closed"" despite the fact I kept showing her both my watch and phone that said it wasn't 10 yet!

I was worried about staying at Excalibur after hearing bad things about it.  

Boy was I surprised.  

Check in was smooth.  I checked in at 230am and the line was long with some folks from England???  There was only one check in clerk and someone saw me standing in line and quickly checked me in.  Why something like this doesn't happen in other hotels (or in supermarkets for that matter) I don't know.

I really liked the idea of putting a map of Excalibur on the back leaflet with my room key.  This made navigation a breeze.  Some hotels assume that you know the entire layout of the place.  

Ahhh the room..........A very, very pleasant surprise.  I rented a room on the 25th floor with a 42 inch plasma and a view of the Strip.  I got more than I bargained for.  The room decor was modern and the walls were a earthy brown.    

The first thing I do when I enter a hotel room is to sense a smell.....any smell.  No smells when I entered the room.  The carpet was extremely clean and the bed sheets didn't have any burn holes or other horrifying stains.  The beds were comfortable......very comfortable and the cushioned headboard was a welcome delight.  

The bathroom was a bigger surprise.  Granite countertops and enough towels to last me the entire trip (I stayed 2 days).  No problems with the water pressure nor with toilets that didn't flush.  

The Sherwood Forest Cafe and Sir Galahad's were OK.  I really wish that all Strip hotels in Vegas would just put a IHOP or Denny's or a Waffle House inside and spare us from eating horrible eggs and other unpalatable breakfast foods.  

The cocktail waitresses dressed in medieval costumes was gimicky, but I was there to gamble and the sports book was where I spent most of my time.  The casino itself was ordinary and there wasn't anything that made me say 'wow', but there wasn't anything there that made me say 'yuck' either.  

All in all......Excalibur wasn't a bad experience.  Really 3 and a half stars.",2,0,1

But the first thing we noticed was a blood stain on the sheet, which they quickly replaced after a call. The shower had very low water pressure and there was no tub. Also no fridge or microwave. The iron was messed up\/ no steam button. 

The smell of the lobby is pretty bad. It smells more like dust and smoke than most of the other hotels. The crowd there is pretty ghetto. I wouldn't bring kids here but then again I wouldn't take kids to Vegas! They were arresting some cholo just a few doors down, escorting him out of the room.

To top it off, the front desk customer service lady wanted to charge us $25 for a one hour later check out... on a Sunday! Then she lied about being the manager when we asked to speak to the Manager. 

On a positive note.. it's a good place on the strip if you want to stay on the South side. The bed was very comfy and the flat screen TV was cool. But who watches TV in Vegas?

Bottomline.. I won't stay there again.",7,5,2

Since they were getting married at the chapel in Mandalay Bay we chose the Excalibur because the price was right(we paid roughly $50 a night through Booking.com), and it had a tram that stops directly at the Mandalay. Our room was in Tower I, on the 15th floor. 

The pros: 
The room was very clean. We opted not to have room service, as we were only staying two nights and we managed to clutter it up pretty quickly while searching for things in our bags. :P Bathrooms are kind of outdated, but they too were clean, and had a hair dryer and fluffy towels, hot water, and a properly flushing toilet. 

The beds were SUPER comfy. Blankets were kinda thin, but the heater in our room worked(a little too well, we had to shut it off in the middle of the night because we both woke up roasting!). Pillows were nice and fluffy. 

Check-in staff were very friendly and nice. We ended up getting in MUCH later than anticipated, about 3 in the morning, and the lady at the front desk was courteous and understanding of how tired we were, and she got our room together in record time. 

It was quiet...until the morning we checked out, when a family with three loud, obnoxious, ill-behaved children checked in next to us and we could hear them running around, jumping on the beds, kicking the walls, and screaming their heads off. They woke us up at about 7am. Not okay. I informed the front desk of this at checkout and they said they would send someone to take care of it, in case there were people on the other side of them. Not sure if it happened or not, as we were on the road five minutes later. 

It has a good location. You can take the tram to the Luxor or Mandalay, and there's a pedestrian walkway right at the entrance so you can get to the MGM and New York New York quickly. Lots of food close by too. 

That being said...

The Cons: 

The resort fee, which is annoying, but almost impossible to avoid anymore. Nearly every hotel on the strip charges a resort fee now. 

Parking and getting to the front desk is not easy. The parking lot by the hotel is always full, so most likely you'll end up parking in the garage, and then lugging your stuff either through the casino back entrance and up to the front desk or around the outside of the building, during which you'll have to avoid taxi drivers and valet attendants parking cars to get to the front entrance. Both of those options suck, especially at 3am after a six hour drive. 

There seemed to be way more more salespeople harassing us about timeshares\/freebies\/giveaways\/etc. here than at other hotels. By the end of our trip we were planning out our route so as to avoid them. If you say no and ignore them they continue to follow you unless you get really aggressive, and that's just rude. 

The facility is in DIRE need of a renovation. It opened in 1990 yet the carpet and wallpaper look like they came out of the 70s. Carpet and walls in the casino and hallways reek of cigarette smoke, and look nicotine brown to match.  It's a casino, I get it, but it's really, really bad. They could at least shampoo the carpet. 

The elevators creak a lot, they probably could use some maintenance too. 

They're taking out most of the Camelot stuff. Not good, in my opinion. At this point it looks like a very gimmicky, half-baked theme that feels like whoever is in charge just doesn't care, which is disappointing. The buffet now looks like a sterile hospital cafeteria, which certainly didn't whet my appetite(or hardly anyone elses', either. It was practically empty). If this is the direction they're going I don't see it succeeding, which is sad, because it used to be charming. 

There's a lot of potential here. They have the arcade, and the Tournament of Kings, and if they updated the decor, found a good mix of modern and medieval, I can see it being a big hit with families, which I believe was the aim of it when it opened, from what I've read. 

Verdict: It's a good place to stay if you're looking to establish a base and don't mind either walking or forking over cab fare to get to other places on the strip. Is it worth the $50 per night? I think so. Is it worth the $189 per night they're charging on their website? No. 

It wasn't bad but we'll be looking at other places to stay for our next Vegas trip, closer to the middle of the strip.",6,0,0

We're talking cheeeeeap rooms here, people. I paid $30 a night to stay here for a week; compared with NYNY across the street charging $190 on the same days. When I travel for work, I travel cheap. So this dumpy place works. But no way would I skimp and book this place for a vacation. If you're like me and enjoy luxe and glam accommodations with your travel, stay the hell away from here. 

Some irksome things: 

- no one at the valet when I rolled up around midnight on a week day
- no one wanted to help me lug my giant printer up to my room (liability reasons)
- no one in general to take my luggage (so I had to make two trips)
- two lights were out when I got to my room
- cord to the wired internet was broken
- my door wouldn't auto-lock on closure one night, so I had to slam it multiple times until it decided to wise up...
- ...this turned out to be a bad idea, because I got back to my room and it wouldn't open T_T

But this whole review isn't one big downer. Any staff I actually encountered throughout Excalibur, for the most part, really amped up an otherwise lackluster stay. 99% of the people working here are all smiles, all service, all the time. It's nuts.

- David, technician, just awesome. Great personality, super fast, knowledgeable at what he does. Doesn't come on up into your space and leave a mess.
- Angel, front desk, I actually like you. I know how it is to be exhausted and just wanna go home, and you know what, I'm glad that whole thing we had to deal with worked out.
- Everyone working at Dick's who would ""compliment"" my blue hair every day. You dudes are funny.
- People trying to get you to sign up for Mlife. How can you guys be so friggin friendly after hours of getting the shutdown??
- The security officer in Tower II who was such a gentleman! I'm sure watching a tiny woman carry an industrial sized printer around would worry any chivalrous heart, haha; but he was so courteous and helpful, I'm sad I don't remember his name!

Alas, there are so many more names I can't recall. The first technician who came by to fix my internet. The guys working the valet at 1 am. The security who had to bust me into my room. I could go on and on. Bottom line, know that every one of these awesome blossoms keep the gears of Vegas well oiled and contributed to a work-stay that was far more enjoyable than it should have been. Peace.",6,7,6

So, I was super excited being able to go to the ""special"" line for the first time.  The line was very short, which was great, but Rosa was extremely rude. From the look on her face you thought she didn't want to be there. She didn't crack a smile the entire time she helped us. Seeing how I've stayed here numerous times Im use  to the staff at the front desk being friendly, she was the exact opposite. There are a few rooms with seating areas that I love and we asked her if that room was available on a smoking floor, she said no I don't have one clean, and just looked at us like oh well. This wouldn't make me upset if in the past other front desk staff hadn't been so helpful. Luis at my prior stay told us ""hey the room isn't clean but give me 30 minutes and I'll take care of you"". Not from Rosa, she didn't even care when we started asking well do you know time frame, or are there rooms like it? She seemed like she couldn't wait to get us out of her face. I even had to ASK for the coupon book that is given at checkin. Why did I have to ask for it?. Keep in mind this is the MLIFE check in, 1st experience that she completely crapped on. It really put a bad taste in my mouth. 
 Aside from the utter lack of customer service provided by Rosa.  Anthony (concierge) was super nice and helpful, Sherry(buffet) was great and suggested activities we could do that evening. The room was nice and clean as always and couldn't beat the rate. But I strongly suggest if you're next in line and Rosa helps you , allow someone to go in front of you. Don't allow this woman to start your trip off the wrong way.

Also, the cleaning staff had a wonderfully clean room and tidy lobby\/ restrooms (Way better than the treasure island).

If I must point out anything it would have to be 
the hotel lobby\/casino and hall ways. The place needs a little sprucing up in my opinion,It's a bit vintage even for medieval times.

A whole chicken, a big piece of steamed broccoli, some fried potato's, and goblet of tomato soup.  Which we had to eat with our hands.   Kazaaaaaah.  The acrobatic little gymnasts finished it out with an incredible display of athleticism.  Jumping and flipping like mad, mad I say!!

This is the farthest down I have ever stayed on the Strip. We arrived about 11:30 am. The registration line was huge. It probably took 20 minutes to get to the desk. The resort fee was $140 (including tax) for 5 days. The original $125 was bad enough and then get another $15 out of us. We were then informed that our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. BUT for an extra fee of $28 we could go to our room right now. So, what you are saying is the room I reserved will sit empty until you call me to tell me I can check in. That is just money grubbing. The room was ok. I have been in better, I have been in worse. Very touristy. It was like the cattle had been released from the barn to graze on the expensive grass. When this hotel was built it was cool. Now it seems outdated. There was no flair and no charm. The only bright spot was Buca Di Beppo. Love that place. This was my last stay on the Strip. I used to think the Strip was the shit. We had more fun on Fremont and the casinos off the Strip. The MGM Resorts company has squeezed its last nickel out of me. The best part of this review is the corporate email that will be sent to me about how sorry they are about my bad experience. Refund some of the money I spent and maybe I will accept it.",0,0,0

They are owned by the same people...

It's one of the cheaper properties on the strip, so this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. But it's a sad, tired, shit hole nevertheless. Unless you're hellbent on staying on the strip, you'd do better to stay some place downtown (even if you want to gamble).

Our room was a cinderblock tomb covered in wall paper, and furnished with two queen sized beds and a flat screen TV housed in a cheap armoire. It was kind of gross. The walls were bare--not  even bad art, or framed mirror, or anything--giving the room a prison cell feel. The toilet flushes noisily for 5 minutes per flush. This 22 year old property still has no Wi-Fi. You have to plug your laptop into this movement-hindering tether from the 20th century called an ""ethernet cable"" in order to get ""high speed internet"". Miraculously, my laptop had a port for this anachronistic plug, so we did have an internet connection. That doesn't stop Excalibur from tacking on a 'resort fee' ($15 per day) to cover this 'amenity' (along with the outdoor pool no one uses in December) like the more modern and upscale properties on the strip. 

The casino floor itself is run down and sad, and anyone staying there primarily to gamble must surely and sadly migrate up the strip to more interesting venues. The low ceiling and poor lighting are kind of depressing. This doesn't stop Excalibur from charging regular strip prices for drinks ($10 a pop) and food ($35 for the ""all you can eat"" buffet). After one night my girlfriend and I treated it simply as a a place ""to crash"", entering and exiting our hotel via the elevators near the exit, and visiting only to sleep.

It's a joke that this place continues to try to hang with the more upscale strip properties, especially without a willingness to upgrade or renovate. My advice for an old, rundown property like this? If you're going to be a cheap shit hole, behave like a cheap shit hole. Drop the premium strip pricing on food and drink. Drop the 'resort fee'.",2,6,0

This is the WORST hotel stay my ENTIRE life. Our room got broken into while we're sleeping and the bugler took three iphones and all of our cash with a total value over $2000. There were 4 of us staying at the room and even my friend's phone that's charging at the most inner corner of the room was stolen. All of us were traumatized and feared for our lives for the rest of the trip. What if one of us has woken up and got hurt by the bugler? 

The burglary happened last Saturday morning (8\/24\/2013) between 5 a.m. (when we went to sleep) and 8:30 a.m. (when we woke up). It is amazing how the bugler took his time and scoped out the room and only took cash and iphones (not credit cards\/ipad\/laptops\/jewelry) in such as short window and managed to not wake one of us up. 

What did the hotel do? NOTHING! The security came up and took statement and referred us to the ""Risk Management"" department, which conveniently was closed for the weekend. The security taught us how to ""dead bolt"" lock the door after the fact (you have to turn your door knob upward with a 90 degree angle). There was no instruction on the door for such unconventional locking method. However, after the front desk manager moved to another room, BOOM, there was a sticker on the door showing how to dead bolt the door. It led to us to believe our original room 9206 was a repeated burglary room. 

The entire Saturday was a waste talking to security, front desk manager, hotel manager and they all said they have no authority to do anything and we would have to wait for the ""Risk Management"" department to come back to work on Monday. We followed up on Monday and the Risk Management receptionist told us that ""we're still just getting the report in; you will have to wait until one of the investigators gets the report"". We called repeatedly and she just kept on referring to the investigator. Excalibur is truly amazing on how they just continuously pointing fingers to another person\/department. I called again yesterday (8\/29\/2013) after 5 days of the actual burglary, the receptionist said ""the investigator assigned to your case has just stepped out of the office"" and of course she never called me back. I called again today and Risk Managements' automatic answering machine is on again. I'm assuming they have the Friday off for the Labor Day weekend. 

We checked the reviews on tripadvisor and apparently burglary is a repeated offense in Excalibur. I'm seriously thinking to start a CLASS ACTION SUIT to get justice, and to save future customers form our traumatizing experience. If you have experience with your belongings getting stolen at Excalibur and if you're interesting in joining the CLASS ACTION SUIT, please send me a message.

I will give Excalibur a zero star for the following reasons:

1. Repeatedly burglary offense.
2. No security camera on the hallways.
3. No process in place for burglary events. 
4. Hotel manager don't have any authority to help us.",21,3,4

(Which cut into some serious drinking time) When we arrived to our second room, the window was covered in graffiti! How can you miss that?!? The house keeper threw my $500 prada sunglasses on the floor so that he could climb on to the table to clean it! 

When we told our story to the front desk manager, she lied to us about the buffet comps she gave us... so we got screwed out of that too!

Banquet halls with wenches who serve you roasted pheasant and Diet Pepsi? Didn't you know? They exist only in Medieval lit'rature! *laughs* If you're expecting a magical experience at Excalibur Hotel, you will be disappointed.

A while back, several of my cousins and their friends came to town and booked their rooms at the Excalibur (must've been a group rate).  Having not visited the Excalibur in years, I thought I'd tag along with them and see if anything changed from the last time I visited.

When you first enter Excalibur, you'll be hit immediately with the stench of smoke that's been absorbed by this place for the last 20+ years. You may also notice how dark and dreary it is (like a real castle, perhaps?). Talk about lacking in the enchantment department. 

Parents might think this place is kid friendly because, well, it's a hotel which resembles a castle that would make any kid in a stroller scream with demands to, ""go there, NOW!"" Unfortunately, parents, you're a couple of decades too late. I can speak from experience that this place was fun for kids back in the 90s, and I'll leave it as that. *hem* The only spot here for kids is its arcade, which is located downstairs. The arcade area is small, and there are too many games shoved into such a tiny space. Basically, it's a torture chamber for kids and adults.

Excalibur's ""private quarters"" aren't really suitable for a king, but hey, it's an affordable place to stay for the night, especially if you're on a budget and don't mind sleeping in sheets that: ""look like they can be used for wrapping dead people in"", as noted by my cousin's friend. The rooms may be smaller than other hotel rooms on The Strip, but my cousin and his friend were fortunate enough to receive a room that overlooked the parking lot; I thought this compensated nicely for the lack of space.

Visiting this place is one thing. If you haven't been here before, then why not visit, even if it is shabby, to say the least. But staying here for a night or two? I wouldn't recommend it; although, it is a step up from the Motel 6 and Imperial Palace (definitely not suitable for an emperor). I'd think twice about booking a room here.",4,6,2

- The customers.  Many of the customers were rude and had a lot of attitude....this isn't the streets.

I mean there are people who are out on the strip night and day handing out cards with naked women on them. This place is called Sin City for a reason and with all the places you can take your kids on vacation in the world I would suggest avoiding Las Vegas. Well most adults (with a brain in their head) feel that way but I have some sad news folks, according to Mary the Manager of Guest Services at The Excalibur they only care about catering to  families with kids and making concessions and accommodations for them. If you are apart of any other demographic, which every other place in Vegas caters to, this place could give two shits about you. Well Mary should consider another profession that has nothing to do with customer service. I was excited to stay here despite the reviews and now I see why they have the reviews they have. Thank God we got comped for 2 nights because it would have been such a waste otherwise. 

They have no good options when it comes to late night eats. They have McDonald's, Krispy Creme, and Starbucks. Wow how nice. I go on vacation to eat the same things I can get everyday at home. How about no. The McDonald's BTW has the crappiest customer service ever. They run out of everything and are pretty much useless. This place used to have a cafe that was open all night and now it is gone. Mary says that the families do not usually get hungry late at night so they see no reason to have alot of things open. Ain't that a hoot? People who are expected to gamble and drink all night are not expected to want to eat anything half way decent. 

The room was ok I guess. I was disappointed by their lack of theme in there. I realize that alot of time is not spent in the room and too that it does not matter. For me and my husband though, we pace ourselves so we do spend some time in the room so it does matter to us. I like the cheesy themes in Vegas. It is part of the fun. NYNY was WAY better at keeping the theme throughout. It is a damn shame too because The Excalibur has a wonderful theme to work with. As far as useability goes the beds were comfortable and the TV was nice and new. I liked the marble countertops also. The rest of the furniture was old and banged up and the room did not have fridge or microwave. What the crap?! Even the Travelodge has that. There was no bathtub and the shower and sinks took FOREVER to drain. This was a room in Tower 2 which was an upgrade from the room we originally booked which was a standard room. This was supposed to be one of the newer rooms. It did not really show. We only got upgraded after they had no king sized beds left when we reserved one and I sarcastically asked for an upgrade. After the guy thought about whether to take me serious or not he decided to upgrade us to the contemporary room with a view. I would hate to see what kind of room we originally would have gotten. 

As far as the casino goes I had a good time there. There was two Roulette  dealers that made it worth my while. Dave and Sandra were awesome and alot of fun. They made the table hot and even when you lost they were at least super nice so it did not sting as much. The slot machines where the same as everywhere. I can't say anything negative about the casino really. They had four 4 $5 minimum Roulette tables open which was great because that tends to be a popular game and getting a seat takes a while. They also one $10 minimum table for the bigger betters. They had some video Roulette machines and also had an Organic Roulette which has a real wheel that is spun by a machine. It has eight video stations and the minimum bet is $3 which is nice. Roulette is my favorite game and it nice to see alot of options for it. The cocktail waitresses came by often. 

Besides this place crawling with kids it is also crawling with annoying timeshare salesmen. They wait outside the towers to jump you as you leave your room. They are at the front doors, outside restaurants, pretty much everywhere. They ask you if you want free tickets to a show. They want you pay a $99 deposit for a 2 night stay at the hotel and tickets to two shows if you sit through their 3-5 hour timeshare presentation. You have a year to redeem this. We already knew this and tried avoiding them at all costs. I even told them my husband was a one night stand. You answer no to all their questions and they still don't get it. They are pushy and annoying and I would recommend that the Excalibur get rid of them. Guests don't like to be harassed. Or at the very least give them stipulations to take no for an answer. I actually yelled at one as we were checking out because she would not leave me alone. They were at NYNY also but not nearly as bad. 

Overall I will never stay at this hotel again even if we get comped! I will only come back here gamble if Roulette is lacking elsewhere and eat at Dicks. There are too many other cool places to stay in Vegas.",3,1,0

We stayed in tower 2, it was really quite nice, 2 beds, a flat screen tv, and a bathroom, we didn't spend much time in the room so it was perfect for what we needed. My only complaint was that i never got any cell phone signal in my room but i can also blame AT@T for that. The casino is kinda cheesy and I don't really like playing there, the pool was nice but the cabana we rented was kind of a let down, they advertised a platter of snacks and we got 2 fun size bag of lays BBQ potato chips LAME.

The only bad thing about this hotel- there are these reps from some hotel for time shares- they told us it would be 2-3 hours and don't want to buy and you get discounted show tickets ... LIE! 4 hours later and horrible experience there ... I think I would have rather paid full price for our shows. *** 

***this is nothing about Excalibur ... just what happened there*** 

When we got to our room- we had a view of the strip- Awesome room! BIG SHOWER! For the price- we did well. 

Only negative about our room was we had 1-3 ants every day ... not too sure what that was from? 

The hotel also has an awesome buffet- $29.95\/person for ALL DAY! You can come back as many times as you'd like. For Vegas, this is a great deal! 

Shows: Louie Anderson (if you stay here you get buy one\/get one free tickets), Thunder from Down under (didn't see this) and some cave man show (we didn't see)

Two queen beds, 27th floor overlooking the strip. It was a beautiful view at night time. 
The most amazing thing was that they had security at each entry to the elevators to rooms. They asked to see your key card each & every time. Made us feel welcomed and comfortable. 
The only down side, the main pool was closed for the season. They had 1 pool open and it was kinda overload with people, and some children. The pool that had the slide was closed too. The only part open was the slide. 
Parking wasn't as bad as I thought. In the casino they had very friendly staff and waitresses that were always quick and efficient.

My fiancé and I booked a ""preferred  King room"" , and paid the ""all inclusive"" rate in advance. 

We were stopped in the lobby by two hotel employees, who made it appear as they were checking us in, as they attempted to hustle us with a time share ""schpeel"", all while we tried to make our way to the near hour wait to ""check in"" to our ""pre-paid, all inclusive, pre-checked in...simply pick up your key"", room. 

Summation: we were told by Kayla, that our pre-paid, preferred non\/smoking, King room, ""might not be available..."", then when I said that we would contest w\/ Am Ex, she suddenly came up w\/ a room...at the end of the long, long hall, that smells of cigarette smoke--which I am allergic to--hence the ""non-smoking"" request. 

When I called to ask about being moved to an actual non-smoking room, I was denied this modest request - then put through to a manager. Her answer to the problem? ""...you got exactly what you paid for, you booked through a 3rd party, we can't do anything, we will bring in a machine, air freshener, etc., to take care of the problem.""  REALLY??!!! I was then told to ""take it up with American Express."" Verbatim. I. Am. Not. Exaggerating. Oh, and ""we will not refund the resort fee, period"".

Having travelled all over the country, and Europe, my finance traveling the country for over 2 decades, weekly, for work, and having a son in the hospitality business (5 star, and yes, this is 3 star, but really???), for a decade, I have NEVER been treated so rudely, anywhere, and blatantly ignored for a simple customer service request

Asking to moved to a non smoking room is a minor request!

We have travelled across the country for many years  So I expect much more...not rude treatment, being hustled for a timeshare, and asked to ""leave the room"" for a while while they de-fumigate and spray??!!! Spray what? What chemicals are being sprayed? Who does business this way?  Certainly not a legitimate customer oriented organization. 

What a sham!


BEWARE!!! Is this a reflection of MGM and their customer satisfaction\/customer service? 

The mantra here seems to be, ""too bad, we got your money, your tough luck, HA HA...take it up with American Express"".

I was with a large group, and I was able to warn them about the room doors not closing and that 'ruffians' roamed the halls pushing on doors looking to gain entry (I never saw anything like that, but my room door DID fail to latch tight on its own, as did many of my friends).
My standard, 2 Queen room was spacious, modestly appointed, with a large bathroom (two adults could easily be busy in here without too much trouble).  

NIce flat screen, color TV with adequate cable service (by adequate, they had AMC, which means I didnt miss the Walking Dead), no its NOT HDTV, but it worked FINE.  

No WiFi, but guess what, WIRED LAN is BETTER by far, i had GREAT thruput.

No Fridge.  No microwave.  No coffee maker.  I knew this going in, just re-iterating the irritating.

Bed, clean, not very comfortable, lots of so-so pillows.  Free in room safe.

Resort fee - why?  Nothing 'resortish' about the place.  Just because you have a pool and gym doesnt mean you're a resort!  Free drink coupons only for beer\/well drinks?  I'm in a CASINO - drinks are FREE for gamblers.  What am I an IDIOT?  When I pay a RESORT FEE at the HILTON WAIKALOA (a REAL resort), I get TWO FREE Specialty drinks EVERY DAY!  So -1 star on value because of the redonkulous resort fee.

oh yeah that AC is loud too, everyone is right about that.  Another odd thing was lack of direction if you self-park.  The lot is dark.  There's no marked walkways, no Glowing neon signs leading the obvious path to check in or the casino.  I thought that was really weird.

Good selection of restaraunts.  Oh, if you're MLife pearl or above you are 'elite' and check in in the private section - I didnt know and waited in line with the rabble.  RABBLE I say! :) 

CASINO RATING **** (4 out of 5 star)
Wow, very surprised.  I didnt see ANY of the terrible 6\/5, just standard 3\/2 blackjack, looked like they had DOA, DAS, dealer hits soft 17.  And low limits to boot, $5.
Craps, wow $5 low limit, SWEET, 3x4x5x odds, AWESOME, but the dealers were rough, WATCH YOUR CHIPS (-1* for clumsy dealers).
And player rating is MANUAL at the tables, thats very unusual these days.
They had a Great progressive video poker bank by the Baja Fresh, that I played almost nonstop hoping I'd finally hit that Royal for $2200...alas, no, but it was 8\/5 JOB, about as good as it gets.
Vegas standard, American two-zero wheel on roulette (terrible house advantage, only idiots play American roulette).
So, surprisingly, this is a GAMBLER FRIENDLY place, especially if you're new or learning with low limits.",4,2,2

I personally don't like to stay down the south strip end, because i spend most of my time mid-strip, but i jumped on a deal at Excalibur in September 08 while I waited on the city of Galveston to get hurricane-free.  I had a room on a low floor that looked out over a side street and it was at the end of the hall, but no matter.  It was decently clean and comfortable enough to live in for a few days.  They didn't clean my room every day, probably because i sometimes don't leave the room until 1 or 2pm, but i'm not so uppity that i consider that a bad thing.  II sometimes don't want to have to clean up after myself to the point where housekeeping could come in and not have to move my crap.  'm sure if I had called and requested service or at least towels they'd have brought them, as i found their customer service to be pretty good.  I didn't really play much in the casino, but it seemed to have a good atmosphere and the 24hour food court came in handy, uh, every night.  Long line right around 3am though....

Dick's Last Resort is in the hotel and they seemed to be pretty live, although i didn't stop there.  The tram to Mandalay is really convenient, as is Excalibur's location caddy-corner to MGM and its monorail (even though its a long ass walk through MGM to get to the monorail).

We both have players cards and gamble there often because the table minimums are reasonable and it's in a great location on the strip. When we gamble, we don't want to have to place $15 minimum bets. There are many tables that have a $5 minimum. Anyhow, on to the rooms. We have stayed in the older rooms as well as the renovated rooms. I have to say that the renovated rooms with the plasma TV's are 100 times better than the old rooms. They look nice and smell new. Maybe we are giving a higher rating than others because we have players cards. When we check in, we get to check in, in the VIP area. The customer service has always been excellent and the deals we get because of our players cards are always awesome. For example, we are going to Vegas in April. I received a promo for two nights free (even weekends) in the renovated roooms. I also received $25 per day in food comps. Not a bad deal and I really don't gamble all that much. I feel safe in the rooms. Also, the rooms have always been clean. I haven't stayed in the older rooms for quite some time, so I don't recall how the beds are, but the beds in the new rooms are super comfy! 

The casino also added their party pit which I found pretty fun. You get to listen to music and watch hot chicks shake their ass all while you are playing cards. Those girls know how to shake it! And who would have thought there would be hot dancers at Excalibur. Oh and watching parents walk by the dancers with their kids is HILARIOUS. Boys with their jaws dropped and moms trying to cover their eyes. CLASSIC. But back to hot chicks dancing while playing cards, what more can you ask for????

The way I see it, is if I can get a free room (which I hardly stay in anyway) in a great location, I have more money to spend on other things like nice dinners and playing cards. My suggestion is, if you go there and plan on gambling there, get a players card. You might even get enough credits to have your room comped.",1,0,1

One thing I liked about staying here is that parking is easy. Depending on which tower you're staying in, you can park in the lot right outside the tower doors. Of course, you can always valet but that requires you to walk through the casino, to get to the elevators. 

When I checked in, I specifically asked for a room that had been remodeled. (tip on yelp) It wasn't an amazing room but again, for the price it wasn't bad. My room has two queen beds, a table with chairs and a large dresser below the tv. I liked the dresser because it gave me a lot of room to put stuff on it, instead of having things overflowing from my suitcase.

The downside to staying here is the lack of restaurants. One morning I woke up super early and didn't feel like getting ready to leave the hotel so I went looking for a cafe for breakfast. Sadly, the options weren't great. They have a buffet for breakfast but I didn't want to eat that much. I ended up going to the pretzel place in the food court.

Yeah right.   Vegas has changed my friends, and for the worse as exemplified by Excalibur and the rest of the MGM collection.  Their ""$20 food and beverage discount"" is a joke you get a nickel and dime coupon book filled with ""deals"" like buy $12 worth of Krispy Kreme Donuts - and you get one for free.  Great. Or you can go downstairs into the main room and buy a completely average danish for.... $3.75.  Wonderful.  The one thing Vegas had was cheap food and steaks but now that is long gone so if you are not a serious high-roller I frankly don't know why you should want to come here.  All of Vegas now is like a huge airline terminal with ripoff concessions on every level but at least at an airport your flight arrives - in Vegas the ripoffs keep on coming and you CANNOT escape.  Also of great importance,  If you are physically challenged or elderly DO NOT come to this hotel. Your bathroom will be completely lacking in any kind of support bar in the shower stall and there is NO shower mat either to prevent a slip and fall, which I find frankly INCREDIBLE.   There is no posting anywhere of checkout time, which is a ridiculous 11 am so if you oversleep,you get boned there also.

I've stayed at numerous hotels but I always chose the Excalibur if I'm taking my kids because it's reasonable, they have a game room, their pool has a water slide and the food court satisfies my kids during all hours of the day. So this time was no different when we decided to go for the 4th of July however there were some changes that I did not care for!

1. All MGM hotels now charge for parking. Valet is $13 per day and Self Park is $8 per day! I think I would've handled this information better had it been on their website when I made the reservation. I don't like surprises.

2. They now require an additional deposit of $50 per day up to a $200 max. This wasn't disclosed either when I booked the room and the guy waived it without hesitation when I mentioned it at check in but still, it should've been disclosed upfront.

3. MGM took all of McDonald's out of their hotels. This only bugged me because it was the only place that used to be open 24 hours. I don't really eat McDonald's but when you've had too much to drink at 2am...their fries are a lifesaver! My kids weren't too happy about this either.

4. This is not a new rule but while I'm complaining about everything else, I figure I might as well throw this in here too...I never understood why their pools close at 6-7pm. It's Vegas for goodness sake and it's 110 degrees outside! Come on!!

5. I booked an upgraded room that was bigger than the other rooms I usually get. This one had a couch in addition to the 2 queen sized beds. When I arrived, the guy said oh...you're staying in our newly renovated rooms, you will enjoy it! Then proceeded to point in the direction it was in. I have always stayed in the towers next to the pool but these towers were at the opposite end. My kids were bummed but quickly got over it. Once inside the room, we were like ok? Looks similar to the other side. Nothing impressive and as I plopped down on the bed and looked up, I saw Popcorn ceiling!!! Wth?? How u gonna call this a renovated room and still have popcorn ceilings. I HATE popcorn ceilings. I swear this bugged me everytime I laid down. 

6. The sofa cushions were on top of wood so needless to say they were hard as heck! We reserved 2 queen beds but I'm pretty damn positive they were 2 double beds. We requested extra pillows but they said they could only give us 2. Idk but whatever. 

7. We went out on the strip on the 4th at 9pm hoping to see some fireworks along with what appeared to be millions of other folks only to be disappointed that we didn't even see a spark fly. We later heard that Vegas Strip does their firework show the day before the fourth and not on the 4th! This was the biggest disappointment of all especially since we arrived on the afternoon of the 3rd! Would've been nice to know. 

I'm sure we will return to Vegas many more times but me and my kids are well over Excalibur. Mandalay Bay here we come!",2,2,1

Hotel is nice but Its very annoying to get asked to go to timeshare presentations every time you come and go from your room.

Imperial Palace was the first choice, but we never even seen the hotel building before so we opted for Excalibur! We weren't all that excited about the hotel since we stayed at better ones like Bellagio and Aria before, but the price was good! 

A week before our trip, I reserved the Widescreen Tower, Queen non-smoking room for the weekend. But then a day before checking in, I found a 20% off coupon. Of course, I pulled out my calculator to see how much I would save. The original payment was supposed to be $278, but $232 after the discount. So excited, I immediately called in!

Then the call representative burst my bubble. She said I wouldn't save as much as if I did my reservation online, and since there was a $10 service fee to lower my rate, it would only be around $14. I said no thanks. Hours later, I called back and was greeted by a nice lady. She actually gave me the online rates! And surprisingly at check-in, I wasn't charged the $10 service fee!

If you really need an affordable hotel, then this might work for you.  It isn't fancy like other ones. My hotel room was clean though. I didn't have problems with the service or staff . Also, my first time with self-parking wasn't so bad either. The parking lot was out in the open and easy to find. It wasn't stuffy and dark like the ones at MGM or Paris. The inside restaurants aren't so great but not pricey. One of the restaurants, Dick's Last Resort, is considered one of America's weirdest restaurants, according to NBC. Check it out if you're in the mood for something... different. 


Beware though... if you're really against the smell of cigarettes, don't ever enter the smoking floor! I stayed at the 27th non-smoking floor but because the ice machine was slow at making ice, I went to the next floor, and oh boy,  the cigarette smell was disgusting!

However, I have heard from friends that they have some decent prices on rooms although not the super cleanest.  However, no one's ever had any major issues with their rooms.

I only walked through the casino and arcade area.  The casino was similar to most places, I thought.  I think it's a little smaller.  The arcade area was full of stuff for kids and I'm sure if I had kids, this would be a blessing!  However, for me, it was sensory overload with ALL THE FREAKIN STUFF EVERYWHERE and colors and blinking lights and to go from the casino to that was a lot.  The bathrooms were clean, yay, and that is lovely to see.  I went here for the Tournament of Kings and that was an amazing show, but I'll leave that for another review.

I think the decor at this hotel isn't up to par with the other hotels on the Strip but my tour-guide-friend said this hotel is a little older too.  I guess it's to be expected.

In high school, I loved watching the 1981 film, ""Excalibur,"" directed by John Boorman. I was able to watch it at an age (15) where could appreciate everything it had to offer such as classic sword fighting, sex, medieval fantasy, sex, allegory, sex, betrayal, sex, tragedy, and of course, sex. Did I mention sex?

In fact, it had so much sex that I renamed it, ""Sexcalibur,"" much to the delight of all my male peers and the chagrin of my female peers in my English class. Did I mention that I was a virgin until I was 30?

Anyway, when I was old enough to enjoy Las Vegas, I figured I would stay with a large group of my friends at Excalibur in hopes that I could return from my trip and tell my all of my college buddies that I stayed at ""Sexcalibur,"" got wasted, and showed a girl (or three) my ""poke-her"" face.

But this never happened. Sadly, Excalibur managed to screw up my reservation. Nothing could be done that Saturday night, unless I payed an amount that was way out my college budget. I would have to stay elsewhere for that Saturday night and then potentially return to Excalibur on Sunday night. All of this seemed way to difficult at the time since it was approximately 125 degrees in Las Vegas and it made moving around from hotel to hotel a huge hassle.

Eventually, many of my friends stayed here and I went elsewhere. I did manage to hang out here a bit. Rooms were were a good size. You can fit plenty of people in them. I was also able to gamble, drink, and grow frustrated with the fact that either the drinks were weak or the girls were weak at Excalibur since I kept drinking and girls didn't get any cuter. At one point, I took out my contacts and that still wasn't enough to make any of the girls look better.

Our first room was nasty. The people before us spilt a drink all over the phone and lamp ,they did not work, everything was sticky. Clearly the room was not cleaned thoroughly , tv did not work. Their solution was to change rooms. We did. Moved to second tower. The room appeared newer. But at 2 in the morning it was so loud car alarms going off, the room was very warm so we slept with the air on. We were in the 25th floor. With a constant temp of about 65 as the thermostat was in the entry it said it was 75. We were awakened at about 9 am to drums and loud music coming from the pool below. My husband was ill and stayed behind. U cane back to the room around 1 am he told me the window was broken. It wouldn't shut( again 25th floor). Called front desk , promised it would be fixed by noon. the maid entered 3 times even with do not disturb sign up. Got back around 11 pm no one had fixed the window. Called front again some guy came and was odd told my 18 year old he was the maid. She refused to let him in. I returned at 12. I called the front again took 3 hours for someone to come. This guy couldn't fix but pulled a penny out of the window jam and removed the entire window ( again 25th floor). Again it was suggested we move. I then realized the penny was the fix!

Trying to find the area where you check in is a challenge (as it is with most of the large hotels\/casinos in Vegas), you get constantly harassed by people in the Hotel trying to sell you shows, and the Casino is always smelling bad unlike some of the other hotels who filter it very well.

The room is very basic. No icebox\/mini fridge, very few channels, etc. Overall, the Excalibur is a low class hotel with cheap prices and is good for doing one thing: Saving your money to do other things in Vegas. This was the reason we stayed, except when you walk into the the other Hotels such as Venetian, Caesar's Palace and NYNY, you realize how low class Excalibur is.

Next time, we will likely stay somewhere else such as New York New York, if we even go to Vegas at all anytime soon.",1,0,0

Especially the 5 a.m. Roulette binder we went on after the club. Top Night!!! 

The rooms were very clean, and the staff was friendly and borough us more towels with a quickness. The only downer was that valet was full and we had to park kinda far away. The concierge was great as well, got us set up on the list at several clubs around town without a problem. However I will warn you that doing so you will have to give up your phone number for the club promo dude to contact you, and the man is relentless, a few too many texts but worth it in the end.

We have been coming to Vegas for my birthday for the past 6 years and have tried the Mgm, the signature and Excalibur. I think we have finally figured out what to do for our future trips. 

You will get the most bang for your buck here at Excalibur. By far, the cheapest rooms on the strip. I will concede that your entertainment options at Excalibur are quite limited. There are no bars or lounges other than their Octane bar which is usually not the most happening place to be... BUT, a quick walkover their bridge to New York, New York and now you're talking about entertainment! From coyote ugly, to their Irish bar, the dueling pianos at the time square bar, you have plenty of places to choose from. Feel like hitting a Vegas club? A quick walk from New York, New York to MGM and you get Hakkassan! 

We stayed in their ""resort tower"" (I believe it used to called tower II) in a room with a view. The room was perfect for our needs. King-sized bed with plenty of room to stretch out in. The bathroom was immaculate. They offered us a royal room (I believe formerly tower 1) but when our check-in attendant informed me they were still doing construction, I felt the logical choice was to stay away and not tempt fate with ruining my vacation with construction noise. Great choice by us. We had quiet nights and no issues with noise. 

We were a little disappointed to find out the pool was still closed until March since when we arrived it was 80 degrees. Oddly enough though, by the time 6 pm rolled around it became windy and it actually rained at one point in the night. The next day it was ridiculously windy and cold so we ended up not minding not having the pool available. 

Make sure to bring your walking shoes. For all you fit bitters out there, you will easily hit your 10,000 step goal if you walk between the hotels. 

Food wise, we traveled around the strip quite a bit to find the best reviewed spots. Excalibur does have a food court that we used both days but truth be told, it was strictly for McDonald's and hotdog on a stick for those 2 am munchies that hit after you have been out all night. It was awesome to know that we could eat in our hotel, jump in the elevator and pass out within minutes. 

To wrap it up, I HIGHLY recommend this strategy. Save your money on the room, stay here in a resort room and use that extra cash to try out all the amazing food and bars. If you view it as strictly your home base and expect to walk to attractions, this hotel is a can't miss.",4,0,0

And that is pretty much all you need to know about this property. It feels like an aged throwback to the days where families would come celebrate in some cheesy medieval castle. And had they stayed with that, it might still work today. Instead what you have is a relatively dingy, non modern property that screams ""I've been neglected"". A good example of this was the bathroom fixtures... moen... with the acrylic discolored from age. Yuck.

The hotel, and staff, were clearly geared toward maximizing revenue while providing only the most basic service. You will find everything to be an upgrade, and they will tell you how much that will cost. With an 86 buck resort charge over 3 nights we were suprised how little resort you in fact get. 

The casino was subpar and reeked of stale smoke. The sportsbook however was above average, until they asked us to leave because cigars are not allowed. Chain smoke your heart out, just no cubans.

Finally, the average customer of this property was either aged or foregin. If your looking for anything approaching a normal crowd, this one ain't for you.

We decided to ""upgrade"" for $20 more per night, we were moved to TOWER 2, to a smoking room, it was 4:00 pm and when we arrived to the ""second"" room, the pot stink was unbearable, I had nothing against pot, but I hate when all my clothes and stuff smell like pot...., but the main reason was because the room wasn't clean at all, the beds were unset, there was toilet paper in the bathroom floor, debris etc etc, I was soooo tired by then. Our second trip to reception, they gave a ""third"" room. This one was good, smelled nice and was definitely clean, we had a view of the New York New York, was quite nice. 

The staff is awesome !, they are willing to help at all times. We did the All day buffet, we are not great eaters, this was NOTHING FANCY, but for $29.99 you can't go wrong with this, everything was very fresh and tasted very good, like i said, no fancy lobster legs or crab cakes, if you know what i mean.... but pretty decent. NOTE: I noticed that other hotels started to offer all day buffets, i don't know how good they are but so you know.... 

The pool was AWESOME, huge, 3 pools, very spacious, the chairs sucks though, they are the most uncomfortable pool chairs I've ever used, the primary pool is only 3 feet deep, they also have a 18+ pool, the music was great by the way..... I want to attach some pics from the TOWER 1 room and TOWER 2 so you can see the difference. 

Oh, one more thing, the basic room from Tower 2 doesn't come with a bathtub, bummer ! =( 

I hope this review can help you guys, I wouldn't stay here again, unless I have very little money to go but to be honest, for a couple buck more you might find something better.... ex: Luxor, Monte Carlo.

Not a criticism though -- at least they've so far resisted the urge to build bland rectangular additions to their themed central hotel.  But I digress...)  It's also bright and lively inside, and the prices at the tables and machines are often lower here than at most of the nearby hotels.  It's definitely ageing, but it's doing so relatively well.  So why the 2?  Personal preference.  The Excalibur is a bit 'too' fantasy-ish for me compared to the other hotels.

This used to be one of our favorite hotels when we go to Vegas with the children. Not until our recent trip to Vegas that we will never go back again. We stayed here for two nights experiencing bed bugs and lack of follow-up from their customer relations team. I would say that guest satisfaction is not that important to them. I would give this hotel a zero if I could.

The check-in process was quick and easy. If the check-in person could smile a little then it would make the hotel feels much like a fairy tale castle? 

Tower I haven't been updated\/refinished in many years. The room in Tower I was very stuffy. It seems like they haven't got around to fixing the ventilation in this part of the casino. The first night we went into the hotel and had to move out to Tower II. We couldn't stop scratching our legs and arms because of bed bugs. 

Tower II is the newer and cleaner side of the casino. We had minor itching in this room also, perhaps had brought the pests with us from Tower I. 

I would go to Circus Circus with the children next time, at least the air throughout the casino is fresher and doesn't feel like an oven of smoke.

Although unplanned, I was excited recently to get a truckload going to Vegas and flew in the wife for a 2 day whirlwind occasion.  Priceline got us a $39.00 room which was amazing until Excalibur hit us with their $12.00 resort fee.  It wasn't the money as much as the trickery involved.  30% over an agreed upon and contracted price - after the fact - hello.  These fees are for the ""extras"" such as a swimming pool (that closes at 9pm), Internet and cell phone signals (which didn't work), and a telephone and tv in your own room.  Even roach motels have all that.  When I explained I didn't need incidentals, they insisted on putting a hold on my credit card ""just in case"".  ""Just in case"" means they earn interest on your money the following week before giving it back.  Their entrances are filled with persistent sales leaches who they encourage by providing them with the stations from which to badger you.  No knights or ladies with flowered halos to greet you (like in Hawaii).  While navigating this maze of blue blazered pests, you're asked by a slew of them if you would like to see a ""free show"" tonight, eat cheap and get a free nights stay..........only the shows aren't really free and they aren't tonight but you'll find that out 10 minutes into the scam.  If you pay $$$$ towards your NEXT VISIT......hey Excalibur, I didn't come here to revisit Timeshare tactics nor tell the same girl 5 times to get out my face.  If she's working your door then she needs to be parking my car or toting my bags.  I came here to be ""Knighted"" and left a ""Jester"".  Our first room had a view of a industrial rooftop air conditioners. Not below us but  directly outside our window.  After complaining, we received an older room on the 26th floor but on 3 separate occasions had to ride back down the elevator, waltz across the casino and wait in line in the lobby to get our magnetic room keys reset.  Unplanned 30 minute trips sucks at 3AM.  While watching a football game in the casino bar we noticed signs announcing a $2 special for a beer and dog.......its been my experience that Vegas casinos offer free drinks when you gamble but evidently the Excalibur wasn't told of this tradition so I found myself paying for 8oz drafts while feeding their bar slots.  At the very least, you would expect that the hotdogs would be quality......a brat?sausage? footlong?  WRONG.  How about small child's Oscar Meyer weenie in a cold bun......no mustard, chili, cheese, saurkraut, nada.......Truckstops have better.  My expectation were dashed so we chose to gamble elsewhere.  Thank God we didn't plan an entire week around it.  It reminded me of some of the seedier ""turn and burn"" bars on Bourbon St.  Of all the cool clubs my hometown of New Orleans has to offer, certain clubs have a policy of discourage locals in order to prey on unsuspecting and ignorant tourist. It's a grab policy steeped in ""this will probably be their only visit here so let's rape 'em"".   At least New Orleans has the Lucky Dog.

I stayed here when I was a minor several times, so I pretty much knew what the expect taking into account that the place had aged 15+ years since I'd last been there. 

Excalibur is far from luxury or new, but it is really adequate for a cheap stay for a night or two in town. The location on the strip is actually pretty great, and a brisk walk to MGM, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Tropicana, and NYNY. We did not use the pool, but it looked updated and actually kind of cool - although not the best choice for adults.

Stayed with husband and granddaughter (her spring break) on March 2016,  We stayed in the resort luxury suite because it had a one bedroom separate from the living room.  The first suite we were given smelled like stale cigarette smoke.  We were given a new suite which fortunately did not smell.  But the hallway smelled terrible.  We were on the 28th floor, the highest floor  in the hotel.  The new suite was missing the bath robes, tissue paper and a glass.  We got the bath robes after calling the front desk, but the glass was never replaced.  The casino was very loud and it also smelled of stale cigarette smoke.  I considered eating at the Excalibur, but the smell were too overwhelming.  We actually ate at the MGM Grand and Luxor.  Both of those hotels did not smell bad and were very much quieter than the Excalibur.  I also found on checking out that the room rate changed from Sunday to Monday.  When I booked on the Excalibur website, there was no mention of the rate changing - other websites like Marriott will actually inform you that the rate changed from one night to the next.  The difference was only a couple of dollars but if the rate increases a couple of dollars each night, you would be out $10-20 for longer stays.

Fairly easy check-in except we were told there was an additional 20.00\/night per room (we had 2 rooms) for a ""resort fee"".   That added quite a bit to our thinking we got a good rate thru Orbitz!  The pool was ice cold and opened  very limited hours so my 6 yr. old was quite disappointed.  We stayed in Tower II which apparently has been remodeled.  The beds were comfy, we had a nice flat screen TV, stand up shower and granite counters in the bathroom.   Not bad except the room was bare of any amenities.   We all complained there wasn't even a friggin' coffee pot in the room.  We had to schlump downstairs in the morning for our caffeine fix and pay a ridiculous price of around $6.00 at one of the coffee carts.   For the price, I thought they could have done a better job with the rooms as far as perks.
 
 As previous reviewers said, the whole place reeks of cigarettes.  YUCK.   I know it's Vegas and the casinos allow smoking,  but the hallways and elevators smelled really bad.

We had an amazing experience at the Flamingo and they were my 500th review. I had hoped review #1,000 would be for our most recent stay at the Excalibur in Jan 2014. Bleh! What a nightmare. I have a pretty awesome memory, and there were so many horrible things about this experience that I actually had to start writing them down so that I wouldn't forget!

We booked this trip just for fun and because Southwest Airlines had a good deal. It was less than $200 each for four days, our flights, and a rental car, plus $20 hotel food\/drink credit. Which honestly is about what you can find anytime for mid-week, off-season in Vegas. The trip was supposed to include all taxes\/fees but a mandatory resort fee for use of the fitness center and such was imposed upon arrival. Whatever, it was only $50 more.

The robot of a woman who checked us in told us there was wifi in the rooms. I asked if it was free wifi and she said yes. While the casino floor has wifi, there is none in the rooms. So her misinformation was a little annoying. But worse than that was that around every corner of the hotel, someone is waiting to ask if you want free show tickets, free dinner, free this, free that. All you have to do is listen to them offer you a deal where you pay up front to come back to Vegas in the next year... blah blah scam.  We also had papers shoved under the door in our room with the same ""please come hear our non-time-share presentation"" bull sh*t written all over them. (As well as different pizza delivery places shoving their ads under our room door.) So much for respecting our vacation privacy. The last thing you want to hear while you're getting it on in your Vegas hotel room is some stranger at your door giving you unwanted advertisements. F*ck you, Excalibur.

The $20 food\/drink credit isn't valid at the Hotel Buffet which makes absolutely no sense, so we used it at the Steakhouse which was a joke as well. Gross service; average food. Everything about this hotel is below what anyone would consider an acceptable standard. I imagine they once had their glory days... but even the carpet in Tower 2's elevators (EVERY elevator) was worn down with holes, exposing the glue. Which was sort of funny since a flooring convention was taking place while we were there. The five minutes of work it would take to lay new carpet is probably something they could've secured a good deal on last week.

We enjoyed the pool, but the fitness center that our resort fees were paying for was rather small. I still enjoyed it every morning. The adjacent locker rooms are an additional fee with locker rental for $25! Other spa prices were absurd as well. Every morning around 7:30 a.m. we received a new phone message telling us to check out their spa services. Every morning! An overpriced massage from this hotel? No thanks!

Of all the hotels we gambled at (at least 10 or more), Excalibur had the worst drink service. It was non-existent. You'd think you'd get a drink if you sit at a machine long enough? Yes, we did. We got one drink the first night we were there. (It happened to be the best hot chocolate we'd ever tasted in our lives) but in the days that followed we never had the opportunity to get another drink. Walk over to Luxor and gamble there, or head elsewhere on the strip. This place sucks.

The queen beds in our room on the 20th floor were horrible (room 20228). We slept in one the first night, (or rather, barely slept), and went to switch to the other the second night, in hopes it was better, but there were old blood stains on the sheets so we went back to the first bed. We switched to a king room on the 23rd floor (room 23269) the last night ($5 fee but they waived it for us). The bed was a lot better. Not like a Marriott mattress, but we finally got some good rest. Or perhaps we were just exhausted by then. The pillows were the best thing about the rooms. Soft, plush, large and wonderful. 

The ""contemporary"" rooms had bathrooms from the 80s with little showers spraying water with poor pressure. No bath tubs. At least they appeared clean and the towels were soft. Aside from check-in, the staff we interacted with were nice. Room service people we said hi to in the hallways were friendly and smiling. An awesome bartender brightened up one of our miserable days here as well.

My husband and I had an awesome trip. We had so much fun - outside of the Excalibur at other hotels. We would never stay here again though, no matter what sort of outrageous deal we were offered.",14,10,10

Pros

Bed is delicious.  I mean... I wish I could have taken it home, comfortable.

Staff is generally pretty friendly

Cocktail waitresses are quick (except for around 2am)

Conveinient lil food court upstairs...  not the best food, but quite a few lil fast food spots to choose from in a pinch.

Nice tram to the Luxor and Mandalay bay. There is also an indoor walkway to the Luxor, so if its hot... you don't even have to go outdoors.

Cons

Round Table buffet was HORRIBLE.  Do NOT waste your money.  The food was cold, soggy and generally just gross.  I heard that almost all Vegas buffets were good... so, I figured we'd go to the one in our own hotel.  I would NEVER even consider going there again.  It was that gross.

Airport Shuttle

It doesn't run after 4pm, unless you make a special reservation.  We checked our bags with the bell hop at around 11am and told the person at the desk that we would need to get the shuttle to the airport around 6.  She told us just to go wait in the shuttle area,  but when we picked up our bags ... they said ""oh, the last shutte left 2 hours ago. You should have made a reservation!""   So, we ended up having to take a cab to the airport.

Slots aren't very friendly.  NO one was winning...  not even on the penny slots.

I see a lot of negative reviews but I will tell you I have stayed at a majority of the properties on the strip and Excalibur is the only one I stay at now. I have never once had a bad experience there and have always found the staff (wether it be at the pool, the restaurants or the gaming attendants) to be friendly, accommodating and helpful. I even bring friends and family with me to stay at the Excalibur and they always have a great time! The location is great and a quick ride from the airport. 

The rooms are clean and comfortable, the pool is always nice (yes it will get crowded), Camelot steakhouse has great food and the casino has great slots. The food court is good for a late night bite to eat too. I do agree the people selling show tickets when you walk in can get a bit annoying but so can the ""card flickers"" on every street corner of the strip.  

And for those that like to gamble, I also highly suggest playing at Excalibur.

The pokers dealers (especially Brian) are awesome too.

I have stayed here before and had a great time. This time around it was AWFUL! 

It started with checking in, we did get to check in early which was cool! Yay this is going to be a great trip!!! UNTIL... we get to our room seemed clean except a little dusty (I'm allergic to dust so that was fun) as we are unpacking we get a knock on the door. Hello, are you checking out today... hmm no... we just checked in.. oh?! says the supervisor... great... let's hope they cleaned the room...and off we go about our day... I do say.. we had a good view that we paid for of course they didn't have any free upgrades available.. good thing I didn't tip the desk person before asking.. 

We woke up to stained sheets.. awesome... although laundered who wants to wake up to blood stained sheets?! Now the fun begins... We obviously went down to tell the front desk whom had no clue who was in charge.. ""I'm sorry you'll have to talk to the people down there (points to the other end of the LONG desk"" when we arrive there we hear ""I'm sorry you'll have to talk to the people down there (right where we just were) and OH I can't help you I'm not logged in"" hmm right.. We did get the manager and she was great. She quickly helped us and ended up getting a credit applied to our room.. plus the sheets changed.. Sounds great right? Until we tried to use this credit! Wait for it this happens later...

Off to the pool. The pool was great! Make sure you go get your drinks and food the wait staff is soooo slow! It's worth paying for the poolside seats and don't let them make you pay 50 bucks they will give it to you for 40! Just say someone told you. seems they don't have a set price. OH the food at the pool was the best in the whole hotel no joke! and it didn't cost 20 bucks for a 5 dollar hot dog! Just get up and get it yourself LOL So, we have this credit right so let's spend it at the pool right? Well, the credit wasn't on our account.. really?!  more excuses from the front desk on how it wasn't their fault that it wasn't there blah blah blah.. the manager at the spa made it happen all good again... however loosing more time.. 

The gambling (tables) were good but I noticed that the guests were not tipping so please tip people these guys make min wage! Plus it's much more fun when the dealer is happy! The slots were sooooo tight it was like gambling in Seattle horrible!

OK, we go to check out late.. called the front desk to make sure we use up the last of the credit and make sure that we use it for late checkout.. what credit.. holy moly not this again! another half hour wasted going through all the BS (Remember this is the highlights of the trip) and once again we get to hear the ""it wasn't me, not my fault blah blah"" finally get the OK to stay late and check out at 1pm. Off we go on our way... Until 12:30 when we go to retrieve our things from our room... the keys don't work... the desk didn't advise us that we had to get new keys.. really?! now that's the way to take care of your already mad customers.. we call the front desk AGAIN explained what happened and again not my fault blah blah OH and they say... we have a new system and everyone is having problems with it (that would explain why you don't get your mlife points).. they sent security to let us in.. never showed.. we had to go down and get security ourselves... 

As we are on our way to the airport we are expecting a credit to our credit card for now our free upgrade... and we get an email from the front desk that we now have a zero balance charge.. seriously??? we have to call again? 

So needless to say.. even though the MGM owns this place it seriously sucks! My friends stayed with us and didn't upgrade but... housekeeping broke her phone charger and it was like pulling teeth to get a credit to her credit card to replace the charge and went on a hunt to get a charger. awesome...

OH... the ""free internet"" was awful! so slow! I just used my iphone!",5,3,2

At check in we were greeted by Gordana, she was beautiful on the inside and out! Why do I say that because she took her time to listen to our needs and even shared some of her own story which made it feel like a much more personalized experience. 
Our room was a standard king room with a great view of the strip. What I thought was brilliant about the pricing is they have a chart at the check in window with all the upgrades and how much each one cost. No question is left unanswered!
Like other reviews said if you're looking for a lavish trendy over priced hotel this place probably isn't for you. If you don't mind a little dated carpet and decor the location is awesome!! You're located next to Luxor, NYNY, MGM Grand and about 1.4 miles walk to Paris and Caesar's palace. Truly Excalibur has a great location. 
We ate at Johnny Rockets ( another review) Baja Fresh ( another review) and spent time at several of the bar areas. Everyone was friendly and the service was amazing! It seemed everywhere we went there was a friendly bug! Sweet!
My only two criticism are 1. The swimming pool closed at 7pm! We had slept in and gone to see the Body Exhibit and ate dinner and planned to take a swim before catching our show but lots of people were turning around and leaving at the door....we couldn't believe ANYTHING in Vegas closed so early. The pool actually looked very nice but we never got a chance to enjoy the pool. What a disappointment. 2. There is a strong smell of smoke mixed with a strange perfume smell that is not really appealing. If you're spraying a scent into the casino I'd suggest to marketing to try a different scent. I've heard a hotel in Miami sprays Michael Kors original scent and they get lots of business and compliments on the smell. I'm disappointed we didn't get to enjoy the pool....but otherwise all the staff and accommodations were amazing. This is a great place to stay and bring the family or couples either way. This last visit was just my husband and myself. Give 10 Stars to Gordana! She is excellent customer service!",3,1,0

I've been away for six years so this is the first time I've come back as a tourist, so I have a new perspective (I lived here and never stayed in the hotels.) So for that 5 stars, but 2 stars for the rest. We were offered a no-charge upgrade to the ""recently renovated"" Royal Towers but couldn't see that renovation aside from updated bathroom fixtures.  Room was very clean, bed very comfortable, room service was great and reasonable. Camelot Steakhouse was outstanding, but the other food offerings were too pricey. Pool area very small, and there was one of many upcharges for an ""Adult Pool"" for $10 a head. Stale cigarette smoke permeates even the non-smoking rooms of the ""Royal Tower"" but given the age of this resort I imagine that's a given.

The bathroom counter was long and had double sinks and was ample enough for two ladies and all their gear! We stayed in tower 2 and the room was a nice reprieve from all the cigarette smoke in the casinos and on the strip.  Overall the room was fabulous it just was not located centrally enough on the strip for me.  I found myself walking much more than I wanted to on a hot summer day since everything we wanted to see was closer to the Paris, which doesn't look too far on the map but it is! The exercise was good especially with all the visiting of buffets that we did, but to get to shows and stuff 4-5 casinos down the strip all dressed up in heels the Excalibur is just a little too far to go.  If you are doing stuff at Luxor or Mandalay Bay then its not bad but in my opinion you only need to come down this far once during your trip to see these 3 casinos on the far end. This is one of the older casinos and there isn't really too much going on in here, no big attractions really but for the price of this trip it couldn't be beat so thats why we ended up here.",14,12,12

But seriously though, Excalibur is one of the older hotel\/casinos on the strip but what it lacks in modern design more than makes up for it in its charm. The room I stayed in was in the Resort Tower and is a very simple yet comfortable room. It has all of the amenities that a guest needs to make their stay comfortable which is mainly a bed and a clean bathroom. My only gripe about the room was the ridiculously loud A\/C unit. Thankfully it wasn't really warm and I just turned it off before I went to bed. 

The casino floor offers the newest in slots and all the table games offered anywhere else on the Las Vegas Strip. It's pretty sizable and a gamer has many opportunities to try their luck and not have to wait to play. I wish I can say the same about the tables. The craps tables were all full and crowded as well as the blackjack tables. When I was able to sit down and play, the dealers were all very friendly and were very helpful when I had a question about the game I was playing. 

The Excalibur also boasts (at least in my opinion) one of the best shows the City of Las Vegas has to offer which is THE TOURNAMENT OF KINGS! (You thought I was gonna say The Thunder from Down Under, didn't you? LOL). It's a really great show that boasts some incredible live action jousting, sword fights and overall great entertainment. The food isn't bad at all. You eat with your hands (in keeping with the Arthurian theme) and the drinks are sorta stiff. 

The hotel also offers some fast food eateries on the second floor of the casino level if you'd rather eat quickly and the hotel also has a killer buffet. 

The parking situation kinda sucks and I highly recommend parking your car and leaving it there until you checkout. If you must leave, take a taxi or else you're assed out on parking. 

All in all I really enjoyed my stay at The Excalibur. Although it wouldn't be my first choice, it certainly wouldn't be my last either.

Well I booked third party and am actually glad I messed up because since my event didn't work out, I was able to check out without any hassle.  I did wonder why the hotel still felt the need to charge me then refund me when I checked out early.
On to my stay....check in was easy.  I booked online so there were no complications there.  Isabel (front desk clerk), she was great.  Pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable regarding any questions I asked.  Even when she had to tell me no, she was always polite about it.
I go to my room.  Open the door....the most musty stale smell ever!   My first thing, check the bed for bugs or anything weird.  No bugs, but I did find hair...and lots of it!  I go to the bathroom; same thing...way too much hair & it wasn't even mine...it looked like a mixture with dog hair as well.  I call housekeeping.  Some rude chick named 'Brenda' and says ""we'll get there whenever because we have more people ahead of you"".  I say okay & go talk to the manager (her name starts with a T).  She was pleasant.  She even gave me some extra accommodations and fixed the issues I had with my bill.  All pleasant attitude and helpful.    They change me rooms and I still find eyelashes and a few hairs in my bathroom, but after a 6 hour drive, I just end up saying forget it.
This hotel seriously needs an upgrade tho....the internet IS NOT WIRELESS!!  I literally had to plug my lap top in....so if you are an ipad, tablet type, no internet for you.  The resort fees are a bit much especially for things that should come with the hotel...who pays to use a gym while on vacation....the TV doesn't have any hook ups, no HDMI, no USB...so you won't be watching your own stuff and there are no cable channels!
A few good things; there are a lot of restaurants inside and places to eat with variety.  So you can get practically anything you want inside the hotel.  I ate at Bucca....very good food.  I'm not Italian so I have nothing to gauge, but I like what I eat there.  The service is quick and the utensils and plates are clean...

First I have to say that some people that have reviewed this hotel really need to be more aware of what is going on before leaving reviews. You people leave negative or lower reviews based upon stuff you know nothing about, but think you do. For instance:

#1 - 1 reviewer sad that the Excalibur does not even have amenities like ""WIFI."" News flash genius, yes they do. I have stayed here for many years and they have had WIFI for many years. In fact they used to have hard wire internet in each room with a modem in each room and then they went to WIFI. That reviewer left that review pretty recently so i know it is when this hotel had WIFI. I would recommend that you learn how to operate your devices to connect WIFI on them before saying this place does not have it. 

#2 - 1 reviewer said that the WIFI internet (Weird since the other reviewer said it doesn't exist) was slow and terrible. Again, learn what you are doing before leaving a bad review over something you do not understand. Like stated previously, I have stayed at this hotel many times. I have NEVER had an issue with the internet service. It has always been super fast and I have never had any delays. It should be noted that I am a computer technician of over 21 years. In my experience, when someone thinks that the internet is slow, it usually has to do with their devices. usually their laptop has spyware, malware, or even viruses on it that can slow things down quite a bit, in addition people in general do not really know the difference between slow internet and a slow computer. When I read the review of slow internet (While I was connected to Excalibur's apparent non existent \/ terrible internet) I tested the internet speed and the result was over 50Mbps. So again, learn your equipment before you criticize something you know nothing about. 

As Forest Gump would say, ""That's all I got to say about that.""

Now, as far as the property. I have always loved it. The rooms have always been very clean, there is good quality entertainment, food choices, the buffet is great and I have ALWAYS had great luck with the staff. Not one staff member has EVER been rude as another reviewer said. 

The reason I left only 3 stars:

Resort Fee: Now Excalibur, I cannot sit here and tell you that I understand a resort fee. Because i don't. I believe this is just a B.S. way to suck more money from your customers, But back when it was $10 I did not mind so much. As you are aware a good 95% of people are not going to even use the services that you claim are covered under the resort fee. The #1 service is probably the internet. I am sure a good percentage of people will use that. But come on, who the hell is going to want to receive a fax while in Las Vegas? What is a fax anyway? Is this not the year 2015? Who is receiving faxes? People from the past? $26 for a ""resort fee"" is a little excessive and the bad thing is that you guys know it. 

Please do not be that hotel that people start shying away from because of this because in all honesty I looked elsewhere for the first time in a long time because of your resort fee. The only reason I stayed with it is because of the reason I was in Las Vegas and the location was convenient. I found many other hotels cheaper that yours and if I were there for pleasure I would have chosen another one only because of the ridiculous expensive resort fee. I really hope you guys consider this or have been talking about lowering this cost as it is ridiculous. The resort fee alone is more than some places charge for a room. 

Overall I love the place other than the resort fee which is what would make me look elsewhere for my future trips to Las Vegas. Bring the fee down please.",3,1,0

The only reason I am giving it 3 stars (and not 2) is because their pool is better than the tiny one at NYNY. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere in the vicinity of the Hard Rock's Rehab (down the road) or even it's neighbor, the Luxor - but it's fair - to say the least. 
So, why did we stay here? Because it was CHEAP. But then, you get what you pay for. 
I will say that the buffet isn't any worse than it's neighbors. After all, It's pretty hard to screw up mashed potatoes or roast beef. However, it was overpriced, like all the other casino hotels. Gone are the days of $1.99 buffets. That went bye bye with the Rat Pack.  
I can't say our room was all that bad, but the free show in their moat is embarrassing. In this day and age, anyone over 5 years old would snub their noses at the obvious tracks and archaic robots. Again, at least the pool is decent. 
Also a plus is the location. It's across the street from NYNY - which has a roller coaster and MGM, which has the lion sanctuary (and a fan-freaking-tastic pool with lazy river, if you can sneak into it).

My biggest problem with the hotel is their customer service. We checked into our room and when we opened the door there was still decorations, old pizza boxes and empty soda bottles left over from the previous guests. I honestly felt like I had just walked into a cheap motel in the skevy part of a neighborhood. The manager that I spoke with, Toria (or Gloria) was not very apologetic. She reacted as though this was not a common incident. She did send someone up with keys to a different room but did not fulfill my request to have at least one more key (this hotel acted as if drunk people do not lose keys and it was crime to have more than 2). The second room went to was pretty much the same type of room as the original minus the extra garbage everywhere. However, after being in the room for about an hour the toilet stopped flushing. Needless to say our visit was crappy. I felt there should have been more accommodations for their foul ups but instead we were given the passive 'we know you're upset...but no we will not refund you...'

Got response from Excalibur guest relations today.They have apologized and refunded me the upgrade price and promised to review their practices with front desk employees.Also I am offered Royal Superior Room on my next visit to Excalibur.

I appreciate the commitment and customer service I have received.




Update:
Hi Lorie,
I have sent mail to the email id 3 days back.I have not got any response.


Review:
We checked in to the registration counter at around 12.30 pm on 11\/26 and was offered Resort tower room under the ""Run of House"" category.Upon checkin I was told my room is not ready yet(no concern over this) and I should get a call before 3pm when my room is ready.Me and my wife waited 
for the call till 3.10 pm and then I contacted registration counter again around at 3.30pm.
I was told that my room was not ready yet and they have time till 5pm to clean the room.
We were very tired and was feeling sick.We asked for alternate room and were told that, no room in my category was available, and I must pay extra if I need to enter the room right then.
We asked for complimentary upgrade because as per hotel policy checkin time is 3pm , it was already 3.30pm and we were refused.
After that I paid extra for the upgrade as we needed few hours of rest badly and could not wait till 5pm.
This was our 2nd visit to Excalibur and is really disappointed with the way we were treated.This is not expected from a MGM group hotel.

Would request you to kindly look into the matter and refund as needed.In no way, I should have been forced to pay extra just to get into a room post check in time.
I have also sent mail to the guest relations mail id, till now no reply.

Other than this, room was comfortable and conveniently located.",1,0,0

Excaliber is an old hotel and you can tell when coming in. The ventalation is bad, not Reno bad though. I could smell smoke billowing through the hotel and rooms, at least in other hotels you feel the air ventalating with a hint of smoke.

The room needed a steep upgrade. The air conditioner was a floor unit that used cool air to cool the room not COLD air. The decor was old and drab. The phone was the best in the room, it hummed or buzzed every 15 minutes, with a low escalating buzz\/hum. 

The pool was only a plus, The pool was free with a DJ and there was a good amount of people there.

Normally we come down for EDC in June and stay here, but we've also stayed here for random spontaneous Vegas vacations. Rooms are priced fair, cheaper than most of the strip. This is an MGM hotel. 

The front desk staff is usually rather pleasant. Check in lines can get very long, especially during summer. Beware of the pushy salesmen near the main entrance trying to convince you to buy their cheap tickets for shows - it's really for a time share thing that takes like 5 hours to go do, it's not worth wasting your time. 

The casino is pretty big, lots of updated games. Lots of tables. Well laid out. Good size bars. Dicks Last Resort is a hotspot of this hotel. If you go downstairs there is the Tournament of Kings and some sort of arcade, I've never been down there before. On the second level is a food court, the buffet, Buca Di Deppo (restaurant), and The Thunder From Down Under. I've never dined at any of the restaurants. I did go to the Thunder From Down Under, and I highly recommend it. My mom and I went together on my 21st birthday and had the best time haha.

The rooms are...eh..basic. A bed, desk, chair, and a TV in the rooms. AC units seem to have improved. The beds are so sad looking... no blankets, and two tiny pillows on a king size bed. The bed and pillows are not very comfortable, very stiff. The shower SUCKS - there's like zero water pressure so the water trickles out. I suggest bringing your own hairdryer too ladies or you could be drying your hair for hours.

There are 3 pools - one has a waterslide, one is just a normal pool, and then there is an ""adult pool."" Lots of kids. The adult pool has a $10 cover charge - it's a tiny pool with plushy chairs set up, not worth it - the only positive about the adult pool is no screaming kids. There is a hot tub, showers, and a bar near the pool as well. 

Our most recent visit we noticed a lot of, um, sketchy, people hanging out outside the back entrance door in the early morning hours. We saw one man follow a girl to the elevator trying to talk to her and she just kept trying to walk away. We had planned to run up to the room and change to go back down and gamble, but were rather uncomfortable due to that situation so we ended up just going to bed. 

Parking is $10, unlimited in and our privileges, and you can park at any MGM resort with your room key.

We only stay here for EDC because it's the cheapest option and we are barely in the room for that week anyways so it doesn't matter. If you're looking for something modern and comfortable, I suggest elsewhere. But for a cheap option, it isn't bad. This place could definitely stand to be updated, as it shows its age.",10,1,2

I guess my advice would be this:  if you wanna stay on the cheap, this hotel is much better then other cheap hotels like circus\/cicrus.  also, its worth spending another 10 or 15 bux to get the remodeled rooms.  i'd say 4 stars if you stay at a remodel room and 3 if your staying in one of the classic rooms",2,0,0

It was the first week of August, and the place was packed!  We arrived at the hotel around 4:30 PM, but the check-in line was crazy long!  Thankfully, my in-laws had already checked into their room.  We stored our bags in their room, then went off to dinner at the Tournament of Kings.

After dinner, I went back to the check-in line.  It was shorter than before the show, but still took me 30 minutes to get to the desk.  (Note to self:  next time, use the mobile check-in option).

Here are my comments for our stay:

Room 3 stars.  The rate we got was pretty good ($65 for the room and $34 for the resort fee).  We had a 5th floor room at the Resort Tower, with a view of New York, New York & West Tropicana Avenue.  Our room was pretty big, but it was missing a few amenities.  Refrigerators are not standard and are $25\/night.  There was one less lamp in our room (compared to our in-law's room), and the TV service was not HD.  But the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was serviceable.  

Poker Room 4 stars:  we played in a morning tournament.  9 AM seems early, but there were almost 40 players (with re-entries) for a $40 buy-in (the later dailies are $45 each).  It was almost all tourists with a couple of locals.  I busted out early, but my wife got 4th place and got $110!  There are about 10 tables in the room, but I never saw more than 5 tables used at any given time.  There was usually one tournament going on as well as a couple of cash game tables.  No frills, but the poker room had action.

Casino 4 stars:  I played at least 6 session of craps during this trip.  Most of the time, I'd stay only 15 or 20 minutes, but a couple of them were about an hour long.  There were both $5 and $10 tables, which are rare on the strip (most casinos have $10 and $15 tables now).  During the day, action was steady, but not busy.  But each night, all the tables were hopping!  My wife & I wandered through at least 10 casinos during this trip, but the Excalibur seemed to have the most action at the tables.  My only complaint about the casino floor is that the music was a little too loud at night, and it was difficult to hear the craps dealers.  I liked the music, but they could have turned it down a couple of notches.

Fitness Center 4 stars:  one morning, I went to work out in the fitness center.  While the facility isn't huge, all the equipment was very new and well-kept.  Staff came around and offered bottled water to guests as well as wiped down unused equipment.  While the TVs weren't on when I was there, I did have a great view of one of the pools.  (I didn't have a chance to enjoy the pool, but it was packed by 10:00 AM when I was at the gym.  Make sure you get there early to get a chair.)

Staff 5 stars:  during my stay, I can say that the Excalibur staff were very friendly and courteous.  Even during the slower times, the staff were upbeat and engaged with the guests.  Since I played a lot of craps, some of the dealers and pit bosses recognized me.  While I'm not a high roller, it's nice to be acknowledged.

Overall, we had a great trip.  We received good value for our hotel stay, and the gaming was fun and vibrant.  I'm looking forward to our next stay here!",9,1,1

Unfortunately the kid sticking his fingers in the dessert didn't help my opinion of this place.

I got a kick out of the Chinese people eating the Chinese food at the buffet because even this white girl can tell that was some really bad white people Chinese food. I started wondering if they weren't eating it just to see what white people thought Chinese food was.

Fortunately my room in Tower 2 was nicely updated and had a full view of The Strip. Despite the bed being very hard, it was my little oasis away from the gross casino downstairs. 

Pros: 
- Front desk staff were helpful and courteous 
- Easy access to Luxor, MGM, NY NY and Mandalay Bay
- Generous room service portions. The egg whites and vegetable breakfast is the bomb. 

Cons: 
- Hotel is outdated and gross
- Restaurants are mostly fast food. I had to look elsewhere for a good meal after 2pm 
- Room service is only served 6am - 2pm 
- Calling guest services is a joke. They clearly want nothing to do with you. 
- Much like the food options, shopping is essentially non-existent
- Tacky, tacky and more tacky

- The hotel wifi went out for almost 24 hours during CES week.  Of all the times to crap out, this was easily the worst. I had to venture to nearby hotels to do work, check my email, etc. Not cool!",8,3,1

Exterior:

The exterior of the hotel is bright and definitely stands out, especially at night. It actually looks quite magical. However it does not seem ""child-like"", as some may have mentioned.

Interior:

The interior of the hotel is nicely decorated and fits with the theme of the medieval castle. And yes, when you walk into the hotel there's a smell of cigarettes and cigars. That's because you have to walk through the casino to get to the check-in desk. Although I can say most hotels did have a smoke odor since you are permitted to smoke in there. The hallways are also musty and have a distinct smell, however that didn't bother us that much since we knew we weren't spending a lot of time at the hotel.

The check-in desk:

Was fast and friendly. We had no issues with check-in.

Our Room:

We had a basic non-smoking room with a king size bed. Though the room was nothing to rave about, it was comfortable, and we had a spectacular view! It seemed as if they were in the middle of trying to upgrade the room as some things looked newer, while other things looked older. It was clean though and comfortable. My only complaint is that there is no tub, only a stand-up shower. At times I just wish I could have soaked my feet, but that's okay. We had a hair dryer, plenty of towels, and all the normal hotel necessities like an iron and ironing board. I should also mention that our room DID NOT smell. It was only the hallways.

The ""Time Share People"":

Yes, there are people ALL OVER the hotel trying to get you to go on a four hour tour to buy a time share. They will try to bribe you with money, free tickets, free dinner, etc... Just know in advance that it's a big waste of time, so unless you're broke and need the money, DON'T do it. NOTE: These people WILL hound you and follow you around asking questions. At first it was a bit overwhelming, but finally we realized that if we told them we were leaving that night, they pretty much just left us alone and told us to have a good night. A little white lie never hurt, right? You will also encounter these people all over the strip. We used the same trick on all of them and it worked every time.

Restaurants:

Excalibur has several restaurants to choose from, including their buffet.

Dick's Last Resort: Yes, it's fun. But I just don't understand their logic of giving crappy service and making fun of their customers. They make you silly paper hats with crude comments, pretty much throw your plate of food at you, and slam your bill on the table. What gives? I have a sense of humor and could laugh at the hats, but the rest of the ""act"" was just stupid.

Excalibur Buffet: We were really wary about eating here. It was significantly cheaper than most other buffets in the area, but we decided to give it a try. In all honesty it wasn't bad. But it wasn't great. They had a nice variety of foods to choose from. (Just don't eat the scrambled eggs! Yuck!) This is also the only buffet I've been to here that you had to get your own drinks. I was okay with that though. No biggie. It's worth it to go to for a quick breakfast when you don't feel like cruising the strip for a place to eat.

Other Stuff:

Pools: Yes, Excalibur does have several pools. Compared to other hotels, they're just mediocre, but if you're just looking to spend a few hours there, it's no big deal. To me, a pool is a pool. The only disappointment was that the largest main pool was closed for the season.

Thunder From Down Under: As if it's not bad enough there's advertisement for it everywhere you go, but now when you walk into the hotel there's a ""station"" that has two strapping young lads from the show with minimal clothing on. As you walk past they give women very sexy looks and try to lure you in for a picture with them, which you have to pay for. On several occasions I had the ""thunder from down under"" guys say, ""Do you want a picture taken, sweetie?"" Well no, sweetie, I do not want my picture taken with you. In all honesty is seemed a little creepy and I felt like I was being propositioned by a male prostitute.

So all-in-all, Excalibur is a decent hotel for the money. Would",8,4,1

Ever since I was a kid, I always loved stories of knights and wizards and castles and all the other nerdy stuff that goes with it. So the Excalibur was always one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas.

Now that I'm older, I think it's still a great hotel, but it's certainly lost a bit of it's luster. The overall maintenance of the seems to be lacking a little bit. The hotel is not quite and posh as a lot of the newer hotels on the strip.

The hotel offers pretty much the same amenities as all the other hotels on the strip... a nice casino, lots of slots, shops, eateries, bars. One of the benefits that this hotel has that others do not is their ""Fun Dungeon"", which is a video arcade with midway games down in the lower level of the hotel. It's a great spot for kids or adults looking for some innocent fun.

The buffet at Excalibur is one of the cheapest on the Strip, but also one of the least impressive in my opinion. They do offer an nice deal where you pay a $35 fee to be able to eat all day at the buffet at both the Excalibur & Luxor. So the Excalibur buffet may be a good choice for the budget-minded, but not for the hardcore foodies.

The room rates are some of the cheapest you'll find, but the rooms will be fairly basic & small.

Overall, the Excalibur is a good option for families and those traveling on a slightly tight budget. Not as upscale or modern as many of the newer hotels, but you'll still get nearly all the amenities of a major hotel\/casino.",1,0,0

However, it was quite nice to go when it first opens and you can have your pick of beach chairs.  Very family friendly with the arcade and everything.

Our room was stated to be ready by 3pm at the very latest. Our flight landed at 11am so we did some exploring and gambling to pass the time. By 3:30 we were quite tired carrying our things around, but after we waited in the 25 min lineup, we were told the cleaners had JUST got to our room and it would probably take another 45 min. By 5pm we were finally allowed to check in and we were exhausted. Our bedside lamps were burnt out, the hairdryer and it's frame had completely fallen off the wall, and they said our room had a great view.. of a cement wall. The dust in our room was out of control and with my allergies, I've never been so stuffed up, dizzy and teary-eyed in my life. It made the experience so uncomfortable because I'd be sneezing 16 times in a row. Oh, and when we checked our bed, there was a semi-fresh blood stain on our sheets. Never. Again. We'll stick with the Luxor again next time.

Excalibur is a big, tacky reminder of this failed attempt at good clean family fun (with a little bit of naughty mixed in). 

The rooms are cheap and the location is great and if that's all you really care about, I say go for it. Because its Vegas, and all you really need a room for is sleeping and storing your stuff, right??? WRONG!

The hotel isn't centrally located but its in a great location for quickly getting to and from many of the typical touristy attractions.  Its very family friendly and kids were running all over the place when I stayed here (I've been in and out a few times since relocating here and its not that bad now) Its still family friendly and affordable. 

I've made use of their Parking Lot a few times just because its an easy place to get in and out of and it's a quick walk to the Tram or the BLVD depending on where\/what you are doing.  The staff is very accommodating and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome.  I've picked up tickets a few times for shows at other casinos there so that should tell you how customer centric the entire casino staff is. 

My room, well I didn't spent too much time in it but it was clean, the beds had fresh linens and was easy to get too. I've stayed a few hotels were they make it a challenge for drunken tourist to locate their rooms as they want you to stay on the floor but here it was very nice to experience. 

We picked the Hotel\/casino as it was the cheapest hotel at the time and I know they are still rather affordable but have increased their room rates a bit.  If you want a clean safe Vegas vacation that allows you the opportunity to sneak off and explore the underbelly of the city this is a great place to stay so you won't be expose to too much all at once.",3,0,2

Late night hunger can be satisfied by McDonald's and an early morning sugar high can be accomplished by the warm Krispy Creme donuts both located in the food court. However the second stay was horrible, to the point that I will not stay again. The first room that we stayed in was supposed to be a non smoking room. Whoever stayed in the room prior must have locked themselves in the room for days with several boxes of smokes. The room was saturated to the point that the cleaning crew came in and sprayed it with air freshener only to created a flower scented smoking room. They also changed all of the linens which didn't help. It was in the carpet and the curtains. My husband and I moved to a second room which was dirty. About an inch of dust was on the bathroom vent and the bed covers had stains on them.

However, the other two elevators smelled very bad too. I reported to the security right the towel II, but he just said ""Uh uh"" and did nothing than stared at a sexy girl walking by.

I don't know why the hotel maids love to slam the doors while people are still sleeping. First time, I thought the customers next to my room, but days after I looked out and found out the noise was made my the hotel maids.

Another thing is the hotel let Grandview Co use its lobby for solicitation for the RCI, a cheating company. They solicited customers for a timeshare plan with RCI. You can check RCI through http:\/\/rci-timeshare.pissedconsumer.com

Casino: the first night at this hotel, I was walking around the casino to get an idea about playing cards. I'm over 30 but when I was watching people playing at a Blackjack table, the Chinese female dealer asked me for I.D check.

We stayed in an upgraded widescreen room. The room was clean and the bathroom was actually quite nice, however, I could not get over the smell in the room. It could almost  knock someone over upon entry. It really didn't get any better throughout our three night stay. 

The casino itself was fine. The waitress service, however, was poor at best. People were actually mixing their own drinks at the roulette wheel because the waitress never came around. I've stayed in many different hotels out there and this was by far the worst. The elevators were really slow. While we didn't go down to the pool, our room did overlook it. It actually looked pretty nice, but I never went down there. We received a comp for the buffet which we used and were pleasantly surprised by the food after reading some of the past reviews. They had a wide variey of items which were all quite good.

Some of the people staying at the hotel were younger which contributed to some problems. For example, a group of guys were still up drinking from the night before when we went into the casino at 9:00am. They were fighting with people as they walked by. Security dealt with this quite quickly. There were two females staying in the room next to us who started fighting with each other at 2:15 am. This went on for about 20 minutes and sensing it wouldn't be ending any time soon I did call security. They promptly responded. 

While this certainly is a bargain price wise, it attracts a different crowd because of this. I will not be staying here again.

The worst part of the stay was the salespeople that the hotel had strategically placed at the entrance to the hotel rooms and food court.

We were diehard Excalibur loyalists but this place officially now sucks eggs. Want blankets or a fridge? Request them a day before you actually need them, since front desk seems to have better things to do. Think your linens were changed? So did we, until I turned down our bed to find my slippers shoved down at the foot where I'd inadvertently left them. My artfully folded towels still had the lipstick stain from the last woman who made out with them. 

The buffet is nothing special; we always eat at Luxor anyway. And the casinos, wah. Children run amok (we were thoughtful enough to leave our child at home with Nana), and trash is everywhere. But then there's The Room. That mother-effing room. We booked a Contemporary King in Tower II and essentially got a Tower I room with a shite view and a Contemporary II bed. If you're into parkour, then I guess it's a dream location. Just jump out the window and you're right on the roof. Which you'll want to do within minutes of arriving, as your neighbors are all loud families with screaming kids running up and down the halls at all hours. America!

Anyway, we called front desk and complained and were moved to a much nicer room, but I was already in a bad mood compliments of a cabbie who tried to longhaul us from McCarran, so Excalibur didn't make things any better. Start to finish, it was not just ""meh,"" it was ""bleh."" Oh, I nearly forgot to mention that the TV channels have gotten worse. No Mlife channel in our room, but you get TWO Excalibur channels and one channel running something M-lifey (1) in black and white and (2) without sound. Wee. I remember when you'd get channels for all three adjacent hotels (Excalibur, NYNY and Luxor). Whatever, I'm scraping the barrel now, but you get it.

Other than the castle trappings, it's no different than any budget motel off an interstate exit.  We got the cheapest room, no upgrades or even a bathtub.  That wasn't a problem, since I'm not into soaking my body where thousands of feet and other body parts have gone before me.  I was originally interested in booking the room with a jacuzzi for 2, but decided that for the hundreds extra that would cost over the length of our stay, we'd be better off putting the money into a fund for our own hot tub back home.

My only real complaint is that the mattress was about 10 years beyond its expiration date.  It didn't hurt me to sleep on it, thankfully, but it was completely flat and cushionless.  The under-sized, deflated pillows were no better.

Outside of the room, we didn't spend too much time in this hotel.  I liked the ambiance much better at the NY NY across the street.  We did try the pool one day, which was disappointing.  4 pools, and none of them deeper than 3 1\/2 feet.  Plus they had 2 slides built into a fake rock landscape, and both were closed.  They had also closed the biggest of the pools (maybe to save money on lifeguards?).  

On the plus side, the hands-off lifeguards were just there to collect a paycheck.  They didn't care if guests drank liquor in the pools, and they did nothing to break up the homoerotic frat boy wrestling match that had the potential to end in an accidental drowning.  Maybe they didn't take their jobs seriously considering the pool level only came up to our waists.

They had 1 pool reserved for adults.  It was in the back and about 10 ft x 10 ft.  Meanwhile, the little brats had the run of the bigger pools.  I like kids when they are in an appropriate setting, but Vegas is not that setting.  And I don't appreciate a hotel in one of the world's renowned adult playgrounds catering to the handful of parents who didn't have enough sense to leave their kids at home, while the hotel's adult paying customers get stuck in a pool too small to swim in.

When we got home I checked out the room price of the nicest hotel we visited, the Venetian.  It would have cost us double what the Excalibur did.  Considering how much we were out and about during our stay, I'd consider saving money at the Excalibur again and just visiting the better hotels during the day.",1,0,0

I stayed in Tower 1 a few months ago and the elevators were dirty. The floors had rooms crammed with people. The room was dirty and had pubic hair on the floor. My boyfriend found a pair of shoes that didn't belong to us on the 3rd night we were there (strange and still unexplained!!). It seemed like they only made the bed. Tower 2 is worth the extra $$- you also get a sweet view of the pool. Our Tower 1 room had a view of the monorail. Actually we were on such a low floor the monorail went right past our room allowing no privacy!! The pools are nice and I've also used the spa service which was excellent.

1. The elevators were AWFUL. There was always a huge line to get on them and they were so slow. It seems like only one or two were in service at a time or something. 

2. The buffet was totally disappointing. Vegas buffets are my favorite and this one was cheap yes, but delicious? no. 

3. The pool was ok - nothing too special and they could definitely use a better laundry service for their towels. They had this pink\/orange colored towels that were faded and dingy...just had a ""gross"" feeling to it.

We didn't use points & aren't ballers but wanted the points & chose this ""resort"" for it's cost effective price because this was a last minute trip. Those are usually the best aren't they? 
I will stay anywhere safe & clean so I was not expecting Mandalay Bay or Bellagio anything. Just a remodeled clean room that the Mlife promised. Which is basically what I got. It's an older property so again I wasn't expecting much. But everything worked & nothing was too questionably unclean so it was all good. 
My issue is 1,000% the way we were treated on check out day. I booked the room under the hubs name but used my travel CC. Now my travel CC had more than enough on it for the room, parking, taxes, fees etc. when I booked this last minute room. However one night out in Vegas I gave the wrong CC at another Mlife resort restaurant & handed them my travel CC by mistake. So fast forward to check out day we get a call letting us know the mistake & that we need to come down to the front desk when we check out vs the quick checkout. My hubs apologizes for the snafu & we continue to get ready to check out. Mind you this is an hour & 15 before check out not hours. I hop in the shower & we still have 45 minutes to spare before check out. I hear a knock at the door & hear a loud man talking to my hubs. I'm like ok that's not house keeping plus it's too early.  I turn the water off & the voice had lowered but was still in the room so I get dressed quickly. I go into the room I find my hubs is being escorted by 2 older security guards like some kind of criminal or card shark (not in cuffs) down to the main desk to check out. Mind you the bill is far less than $500 because it was weekdays room charges etc. So this to me is Ludacris to say the least. I was disappointed & embarrassed for my hubs who was basically mortified by this behavior on the resorts part. I could see if he was even a little lippy to the front desk or we hadn't been loyal to the Mlife porperties for the last 10+ years or didn't have an Mlife account (which we've only had for a couple of years) but this wasn't the case at all.

I would recommended stay here if you want cheap stay, I mean your not going to be in your room that often any ways, so if you don't want to splurge on accommodations hit them up.  Was $75 for 2 nights stay, with a bunch of coupons for the restaurants\/gambling\/retail. Got tower one which I believe is the older of the 2 towers. Its not next to the pool, so if you want pool access request Tower 2. It's a clean and well kept hotel, but it's definitely not been updated with modern times, HEY gives it more of a medieval feel, right?, ha! Had a clogged bathroom sink, which was quickly remedied when we called it in. 

Again I recommend this room if your not looking for the fancy flare accommodations, you really shouldn't be unless you got great deals, cause to be honest if your hanging out in your room, you obviously aren't there to be in Vegas.

As said in my first review our room was messy when we arrived after checking in and felt downgraded after switching. I didn't want to spend my time waiting in line again and just let it go. But I appreciate that someone from the hotel reads these. Maybe I can help....

This was my first time staying at a hotel on the strip. It's convenient to be right on the strip. 
Pros
Price for location 

Cons...oh so many
Maybe I didn't notice when booking but this hotel room did not have a microwave, coffee maker, or a fridge. It would be nice to have a microwave and fridge for my left overs. 

Wifi only works in public areas and not in room. And even if you are on wifi so are 1000 others so it's impossible to connect. 

The resort fee is a joke. In the room pamphlet it says the resort fee covers wired Internet...what's the point?....daily news paper, and phone calls. If it was pool and other things resort related that I would actually use then I wouldn't mind. I think it was about $25 a day.


The other thing i was super annoyed with was the promoters for the new time shares. When we first checked in (even before checking in) we were stopped asking how long we were staying and if we wanted a free show. We talked with them and realized you have to go hear the talk about it. We didn't decide right then. We were tired and wanted to check in. The problem is that there are 2-3 people at 2 exits (one by out elevator and the other by the main entrance) and every time we were coming or going we were stopped. One one way trip we were stopped 4 times!!! We hadn't even left the hotel. We would walk a long way and they would still come over to us. That turned us off and we never went back to get our free show. We were probably stopped 50 times during our 3 days there. Give your guests a wrist band or something so those know that when we checked in we talked to them. I understand that you want to talk to the visitors too but it's a bit excessive when we are stopped immediately coming out of the elevator.

When we checked out I tried the text option. It sends you a link (which I had to use my data since there's no wifi in the room). It didn't work. Tired sending my info 3 times and it said there was an error. Just called instead.

So knowing all of this I'd recommend it for someone that didn't want to spend a lot of money on a hotel. But for me I'll probably try else where next time.",2,0,0

We checked in for a $65 dollar rate at the escalibur and got a tower room that was beautiful and great to sleep in.  Overall the best thing about the Escalibur was their all you can eat buffet for about $35 bucks all day. BUT PLEASE NEVER INTEND TO SLEEP HERE!!",1,0,0

Things right with Excalibur:
1) A pool is actually open through the winter
2) Cheap rates
3) They recycle

Things wrong with Excalibur:
1) Dated, dingy, very low quality room furnishings - and this is in ""upgraded"" rooms. Bed sheets and towels were great quality, but everything else from mattress to wallpaper is cheap cheap cheap and uncomfortable.
2) Non-smoking rooms that are clearly not non-smoking.
3) A staff that refuses to move you to a truly non-smoking room - and lies about the hotel being fully booked - until you call Travelocity to have them intervene.
4) Terrible proprietary dining establishments.
5) No room service in the evenings.
6) No mini-fridge in-room.
7) The total absence of any of the nice little touches that make it pleasant to stay in a hotel.",2,2,0

We arrived Friday night at 8pm..... came in from Tower II parking lot. I didn't think parking was that bad. 

Check in was super easy! I had already reserved and paid for our hotel online through hotels.com ( $100 for the weekend) I read the fine print before even booking that shows a resort fee so wasn't surprised when I had to pay an extra $40 at check in.

Signed me up with Mlife card which really does give you awesome discounts when used. 

Our room was clean and at this price on the strip you should be happy that it is clean and cheap. Of course our room was only for sleeping. Come on people, it's Vegas how much time are you really going to spend in your room?

Loved the upstairs food and shopping areas! That is very convenient and to be able to travel directly to The Luxor and Mandalay Bay without leaving the hotel is awesome! 

If you are going for a weekend getaway and want to spend more money on other things then a really nice hotel then this is your spot.

The reason I wanted to stay at Excalibur was because of its location and for the price we were staying there for, who could pass it up? Before this visit to Vegas, we would find ourselves travelling to the side of the strip where Excalibur was. So, we would always be walking or spending money on monorail tickets when we should have just booked a room here in the first place. I didn't really enjoy their variety of slots though, so I'd usually walk to Luxor to gamble... 

Their food court isn't too shabby, but you can always count on their buffet, Roundtable Buffet to get your fill. We tried The Steakhouse and the food was great, but the atmosphere was a bit weird... it was your typical dimly lit steakhouse, but the music playing did not fit, it was like 80s new wave or something like that...

The room upgrade was alright, it was a standard hotel room, on the 26th floor with a view of the colorful ""castle"". The only big difference was probably the colors of the room and the flat screen tv. The only thing we did with the tv was express check out... so it was pretty pointless. At some point, the tv didn't work, but we assumed it was the power strip it was plugged into.. One call to the front desk and when we got back to our room, it was fixed. 

Being that it was New Year's and we were in Vegas, we brought HELLA acohol with us so we needed ice to keep it cold, but the room didn't have a fridge or anything. So of course, we went straight to the ice machine. I don't know how ice machines work, but the one on our floor was malfunctioning and wasn't make enough ice. For example, I wanted to fill the bucket for my room, and it took forever to do... and there was  guest behind me waiting for the machine as well. I don't think there was even any ice in the machine after I walked away. A friend of mine used his head and went up to the 28th floor where it seemed that there was no one occupying that floor. whenever we needed ice, we actually had to keep going up and down the elevator.

But where the Excalibur's Poker Room lacks in good drinks and decor, they make up for in great staff and so-so players (which is a good thing).  The staff all seem like they've each been there 15+ years.  Dell, Daniel, and Laurie just to name a few of the dealers are all excellent dealers and fun to have dealing cards.

The hotel is perfectly fine.  It's no frills Vegas.  It is comfortable enough.  

We had a nice view of the North end of the strip in our room, but I recommend asking for floor 11 or higher so there is no turret directly in front of your window.

My sister stayed here for a few days on the same trip on the 13th floor and her room was significantly nicer than mine.

PROS: 

- It's a castle.  Kids love castles.
- It is on the South end of the strip off Tropicana, making it very easy to get to other parts of Las Vegas without having to brave all the traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard.

CONS: 

- The Fun Dungeon makes games difficult for kids, which is in stark contrast to Circus Circus where they actually WANT kids to be happy.  The prices are also more expensive than the games at the big pink tent.
- It would be nice to see some beefed up security.  The security guards I noticed were always clustered together near the exit just joking around.  There was a murder the week we stayed there and the second night there was a guy getting arrested for something having to do with having a gun.  We walked past him on our way out and heard him say repeatedly ""But there is only one bullet.""
- It is on the South end of the strip, so if you want to be near the action... you should go to the Center strip.
- $15 a night resort fee for no real amenities.

If you look at it from the glass is half full perspective, it has been around for a long time, it has served as the backdrop for many Vegas memories, and it is a really notable landmark on the Las Vegas Strip.

However, I cannot forget the smell when you walk inside, the glass windows at the entrance that seemingly never get cleaned of the fingerprints that cover them literally from top to bottom, and the overall 'quality' of the place.  It was built by the Circus Circus company in the 80's and opened in 1990, and I truly believe they are still running on the original format.  All the way down to the rooms.  Yes, I once visited a room at the Excalibur for a short period of time...don't ask.  I heard they renovated 2,000 rooms with updated TV's and furniture in 2007.  That would'nt be enough.

If you enjoy bad service, dining at the Excalibur might be perfect for you.  They have a Dick's Last Resort on the property.  Ever been to one?  It is hilarious, if you understand that the staff is paid to be rude to you.  ""Shut up and eat your damn food!""  That would be an appropriate response from your server if you asked for napkin.  Good stuff like that.  I grew up in Dallas with one at the West End.  We used to go down there as high schoolers, get drunk, and argue with the staff.  Oh, the memories.

They also have a medieval dinner show (Tournament of Kings) where actors and actresses fight with swords, joust, and prance around on horses.  Can you say appetizing?  Meanwhile, you get to eat with your hands after you pluck the chicken and slaughter the cow.  That is actually false, apart from the eating with your hands part.

I don't know what other restaurant options they have, but I am sure a 24-hour cafe\/diner is in the mix, at the very least.  If they have a 'fine dining establishment' I would recommend eating elsewhere.  They have some shows.  Louie Anderson, Defending the Caveman and The Thunder from Down Under is what the website is currently showing.

As for the casino, I have had a lot of fun here.  The dealers are friendly, the tables are cheap compared to other nearby properties, and the people who play here are usually in good spirits.  The casino is the best part of the Excalibur, hands down.  Besides, you get used to the smell after a few minutes and then you can start focusing on the crowd.  As Elizabeth L. said, lots of fanny-packs, jorts, and sleeveless shirts.  Yee-haw!

One thing to note is that the thing that makes this Las Vegas Strip property unique is the actual exterior itself.  Just seeing it at night is what it is all about, and you don't have to be that close to do this.  As a matter of fact, the further away you are, the more impressive it looks.  Once you get up close, the facade looks pretty cheap and dated.

Other than that, the Excalibur doesn't have a shark aquarium, an indoor waterfall, impressive gardens, a volcano, world-class shopping or anything else noteworthy (at least not for the right reasons).  Instead, they have a dingy looking moat, which has been empty for the bulk of the past 10 years, a weird looking dragon thing that I have not seen working in the past 10 years, a kiosk selling items with flashing LED lights on them, and a tram that takes you to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  I am not even kidding.  The tram is definitely the best attraction.",0,3,1

They said that they upgraded our rooms, which were supposed to be standard conjoined rooms. When we got it we were disappointed. It was hot, there's no mini fridge or microwave, the beds are hard, no view, and top it off we wake up to the bright sun in our eyes, turns out there's no blackout shades. Honestly never seen that in a hotel here in Vegas. The bedding was not comfortable, really nothing special about this place whatsoever.

Tower 1 being much older than Tower 2 you may want to request a room in tower two as i was told tower one was kind of sketchy. The base of tower two is where the pool entrance is and also has better access to the parking lot in the back. 
The resort as a whole, i think was very versatile in that is has pretty much something for everyone. The bottom floor where the Tournament of Kings show is has a huge arcade that any kid would eat their vegetable to be let lose in for an hour or five. On the casino level there is a Dick's Last Resort for the adults to get rowdy and have a few. The food court area was decent and has a little bit of everything to cure your hangover and then some. Unfortunately i didn't make it to the buffet, I that is mostly because if you planned to do the buffet its a better value to pay for the whole day (breakfast lunch and dinner) $35 than pay for individual meals. I didn't want to have to be in the hotel for every meal as Excalibur is in a great location to explore the MGM, Luxor, and New York New York.

TRAVELING COUPLES: Excalibur and many other hotels will target you on the casino floors and ask you if you want free tickets to a show....of course you do. This is a timeshare pitch that will suck 3-4 hours out of your day which I found out too late.

The employees would be dressed in medieval style uniforms, the king and queen and their entourage would go around the casino for photo ops with the guests and the Roundtable Buffet was the best in quality. 

Over the years the quality has gone downhill ever since MGM MIRAGE bout out Mandalay Resorts Inc. and has just gone downhill in quality. 

The Excalibur still holds the title as, ""Most Tacky Theme"" in Las Vegas
Some renovations have been done with the hotel mostly on Tower II, removed and added new restaurants, increased the size of the pool area, removed all the child friendly areas and replaced it with bars and 2 Tier restaurants. Also that has been thrown out is the Merlin out on the castle by the strip and replaced with Dicks and the free dragon show outside in the so called moat near the strip entrance. 

My room was in Tower II and was recently remodeled, I get good deals through Mlife so I always book the renovated room and the weekend rates are cheap. No WiFi here just an 90's ethernet cable. The 2nd level has a foodcourt for budget travelor and it's connected to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

The Hotel itself is not that bad. I agree that it may need some renovations because a lot of the furniture and overall design seems very dated. It would be great if they make them more modern and maybe add a night club inside that can attract the younger crowd. 

The room that we got was pretty neat. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. I love how you can  just check out via their autmated e-mail (link to a website). They also have machines by each tower that allows you to check out faster. 

My only beef was the $15 ""resort fee"". Actually, It was not too bad compared to other Hotels who will charge you an additional $20 a night. I did not like how the Internet was wired. I'm sure it wouldn't be too costly if they were to upgrade their systems to wireless. A little tip, if you want free wifi access, go upstairs to the food court and hang out in Starbucks.

However, this summer we had some BIG issues. Here is a copy of the letter I sent to Excalibur's official email for customer service to be greeted with no response. I'm sorry, but if I take the time to write out a letter, you sure as sh*t better, at the very least, acknowledge that you received it. I never got a response from them, and I sent it about six or seven weeks ago:

To Whom It May Concern:

I am very upset to have to write this letter but I feel that it is important to contact you about my recent stay at the Excalibur. My boyfriend and I had booked three nights at the Monte Carlo hotel from June 3rd to the 5th. We then discovered the MyVegas Facebook app and accrued enough points to redeem them for a free night at Excalibur the day after we checked out of Monte Carlo on the morning of June 6th. We had an amazing stay at the Monte Carlo and had previously enjoyed our stay at the Excalibur so we were very excited to put our MyVegas points to good use in order to extend our vacation.

We arrived at the Excalibur around 11:30am and we were told that we would receive a phone call around 1:00pm to tell us which room we had been assigned to. When we checked out the room, we had been assigned to a Tower 1 room, which is (as you know) the tower that has not been renovated. It was not NEARLY as nice as the room in Tower 2 we had stayed in last year, but I thought it would be okay considering it was just a comp room and we weren't actually paying for it. The room was extremely small and not even half the size of the room we had previously stayed in. Again, I was willing to deal with that because it was a comp room. I was not, however, ready to deal with the other aspects of the room. We wanted to take a nap after we checked in. I pulled back the covers of the bed and there was a big curly black hair right behind the pillow. Obviously, I was grossed out so I flipped the pillow around. There were three big brown spots on the pillowcase. It was definitely not clean. My boyfriend went downstairs to speak to someone and when he was away I felt something on my foot and I was disgusted to discover that it was a big spider. Thankfully, your staff at the MLife desk were fabulous and transferred us to a Tower 2 room. 

Unfortunately, our stay did not end on a pleasant note. Being that it was our last night in Vegas, my boyfriend and I stayed out very late. We didn't get to bed until well after 4am and we had set our alarm to 10:30am so that we could have plenty of time to collect our bags and check out before 11. However, at 9:20am there was a loud knock at the door. I know that hotel walls can be thin so I assumed it was a knock on the door next to ours and tried to ignore it. I then heard even more knocking and then the sound of a card going in and out of our door. I finally got up and saw that housekeeping was outside and told her to leave. Thankfully I had the dead-bolt up because if I had been woken up by someone else walking into my room I would have been extremely startled. The best part is that we had our Do Not Disturb sign on!! How can your housekeeping staff not know that? And even if it was not on, why would you be pounding on our door literally an hour and a half before we had to check out, when the sheets would have to been changed anyway? We were very irritated that we got cheated out of more than an hour of sleep that we really needed before our long drive back to LA. It's not the way you want to wake up after a night of partying.

Between the uncleanliness of the room and the rude awakening we received the morning we were due to check out, I am not willing to stay at the Excalibur again. My boyfriend and I were both very disappointed in our stay. We were especially disappointed because we had stayed at the Excalibur in June of 2012 and enjoyed ourselves. Unfortunately, this stay was simply not up to par. I'm very upset to say that you have lost customers due to our recent visit.",0,1,0

My group of friends and I booked this hotel for New Year's Eve weekend. Hotels are a lot more expensive during holidays but Excalibur had the lowest prices. We got a regular widescreen room was was actually a good size and clean room for what we paid for. Regardless, we are out of the room doing things most of the time.

Excalibur is great location-wise. It's right at the intersection next to New York New York, MGM Grand, and Tropicana. It's also directly connected to Luxor which directly connects to Mandalay Bay. Basically, you can hit up six major casinos without having to walk far. It's also very easy to get in and out being right off Interstate 15.

Excalibur also has a food court with a variety of places (even a McDonalds) which is good for people looking to eat cheap.

The bottom line is that if you are going to Vegas during the off-season, there are nicer hotels you can get at a low price. But during a time like New Year's, this is one of the best places you can stay at.",0,0,1

Normally we have stayed at the swanky hotels, but this time we went for the $39\/night Excalibur. Not because we had to, because we chose to. I did take a lot of things into consideration though when making the choice.... 1. It is only across a bridge to get to New York New York or the Luxor. 2. It has a free tram to Mandalay Bay. 3. It does have a Dick's Last Resort restaurant (which I always enjoy).

Well, I must say I was pretty happy with our selection. For $20 more\/night we could have upgraded to their new totally remodeled Tower II ~ but we didn't. Our room was not bad. 21st floor with two queen beds & strip views. Beds were comfortable & the shower was great. I figured we saved at least $200\/night on a hotel. Plus the Excalibur has lower priced gambling tables (we didn't gamble too much). It's a quick walk to Planet Hollywood (I love Blondies for lunch there), we did actually go to Mandalay Bay (Had an awesome hamburger at the Burger Bar (@ $20\/burger the 2 hamburgers cost more than our hotel room)), we did go to the Luxor & we did walk part of the strip. And, the Excalibur is only a $20 cab ride to Fremont Street. Other pluses: it had a nice pool that was not too crowded & they offer FREE Valet parking (with all our equipment, that was nice).

The two downsides I can think of: 1. Tower I is far from the pool 2. It was a much older crowd. Other than that, the hotel was not too smokey and it has a lot to offer....AND, you cannot beat the price.

Other quick Vegas tid bits: 1. Fremont Street ~ GREAT as always and the cheap beer and tables more than make up for the $20 cab ride...Not to mention the GREAT people watching & the live shows & the videos. 2. Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay ~ Pricey but GOOD! 3. Blondies @ Planet Hollywood ~ ALWAYS Great!! 4. Dick's ribs & wings were awesome...",0,0,0

Yes, possibly one of the affordable hotels on the strip. The exterior of the Excalibur reminds me of how I am entering some really cheesy-looking castle and once inside, there are some good things and some not-so-good-still-worth-mentioning things.

The Goods:
- Affordable. If you're on a budget, it's possibly worth it. Just don't expect superb services
- Somewhat convenient. Loved the fact that I can take the tram from the Excalibur to Mandalay Bay (the ""last"" hotel on The Strip) or walk on the bridge to New York New York without having to walk on the street
- The employees were nice although I found it a bit strange seeing a supposely middle-age woman dressed in skimpy clothes. Then again, it's Vegas.

The Not-So-Goods:
-The elevator smells like weed.
-The Hallways smells funky. Reminds me of cocoa butter lotion
- Since we ended up in Tower I on the 3rd floor, there was no reason to open the window shade since the castle's wall completely blocked our view of anything. Instead, we would either be staring at the wall or stretching our necks high to see the sky.
-Cracks on the wall, 
smoke alarms looks like it was about to fall and crush one of our heads, 
previous occupant clothing label stickers on the wall, dirty-looking sink, 
toilet not doing its job properly since my friends and I kept thinking someone went #2. Thanks to the toilet, we had to hold any #2s until we got to the casino floors to use their toilets

The decor is a bit dated, especially the dark carpet in the rooms.  They have started to remodel, and some of the regular price rooms now have flat screens.  But honestly, if you care what the carpet looks like or how big the TV is, you're in the wrong city.

I've never had a problem with cleanliness or room quality.  The beds are comfortable.  In Vegas, you don't really need much more.  Can you find nicer rooms in Vegas? Most definitely.  But why pay so much more for a room you shouldn't be spending that much time in?",3,0,1

The Valets are downright surly.  The signs all said ""VALET FULL"" but we were just checking in, dropping off the bags, and leaving.  I asked if we could pull the car up and leave it for 5 minutes.  He said ""You gotta park in SelfPark"" and muttered as he walked away.

Not a great first impression.  But since we didn't intend on using the Valet anyhow, I ignored him.

Their check-in desk is huge, long, counter-ish.  There are some old leftover sconces and Camelot-Theme-ey things involved.  You can easily picture this hotel, in it's heydey, calling its' guests ""Kings and Queens"" or ""Lords and Ladies"" and *really* getting into their theme.  Giving out crowns and princess hats or something.   Swords and Lances and junk.  Now it's kind of just an afterthought.  

Right on the counter where you check in are their ""Upgrade Offers""... Complete with PRICES.  Hmm.  Usually, when I check in, I make friends and ask for a FREE upgrade.  And I get it.  (I certainly did at T.I. down the street!)  Guess that's what they want to avoid, though.  

The hotel is large, and the castle theme follows throughout.   The rooms are about on par with a Motel 6 or Super 8.  (We had newer, cleaner accommodations at a Roadside Comfort Inn on the way home.)  But, for what you pay, it's acceptable.   We had a King Deluxe room.  The brownish carpet had seen wear, and there was a stain on the blanket.  (That fuzzy, staticky kind.  Certainly NOT Down Comforters here.)  The bathroom has a stall shower, and was fairly clean.  The Headboards look Castle-Themed (From the 1970s of course) and there are sconces for lights, Castle-ey mirrors, etc.  The bed and pillows were comfortable enough.  The elevators came quickly, which was nice, but the walls were very thin, and we could hear people walking, talking, and stumbling in late at night in the hallways through the closed door.  Not enough to wake me up, though. 

There are security personnel at each tower's elevators, who will check your room key.  They were nice.

Caution:  Just past them, on your way into the casino, there are Vultures.  You will not know that they are Vultures, because they are wearing Jackets and NameTags, which Vultures don't usually do.  But they are, indeed, Vultures.  And they will hound you with offers for ""Discounts"" and ""Specials"" and ""Deals"" and will not take ""NO"" for an answer.  I swear, they were like those awful TimeShare people.  
I looked them straight in the eye, before they could even say anything to us, and said, in perfect, unaccented English:  ""I DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH."" and kept walking.  
Seemed to do the trick.

Upstairs, there's a shopping area with a Gift Store and ""food court"" with McD's, Krispy Kreme, Cold Stone Creamery, and more.  There's also a walkway to the Luxor.

So here's the bottom line:  We paid $46 total (including ""Resort Fee"") for one night.  Included were 2 complimentary alcoholic drinks, and 2 free Games in their ""Fantasy Faire"" area.  The hotel is located close to the center of the Strip. It's an old property.  The castle-camelot theme is cheesey.

A friend and I stayed here for a few days in Vegas, mainly because the price was really low. I'd been to the casino in Excalibur before so I knew we weren't staying in the ghetto or anything. The hotel is okay, it's pretty old and dated, but chances are you're not coming to Vegas to spend all day at the hotel. I was a bit suprised how normal looking our room was, no cheesy knight in shining armour statue or King Arthur quote on the wall. It looked like a regular hotel room, so if you want something really themey in your hotel Excalibur isn't the place. Then again I don't know if any of the other hotels are any different. 

One thing that was really frustrating about this hotel (and I'm sure most of the hotels on the strip do this) was the fact you couldn't get wifi in the rooms. You had to go down to the casino (and not just to the food court, but to the casino) to get onto the wifi, and then it would kick you off after about 10 seconds. I'm not super hooked up to my ipod (I didn't have a smartphone so I need to use wifi), but I wanted to be able to check in at home and let me family know I wasn't dead and such. 

Excalibur is on the far southside of the strip, so bonus is you're pretty close to the airport, but you're far from some of the other hotels. If you want to go to Mandalay Bay or Luxor there is a free tram that was pretty handy (although finding the pickup and drop off spot at first was a bit difficult). The bus stop for the strip bus and the bus to the outlet malls is pretty close by. 

There's a weird smell, kind of perfumey and musty in the hotel room we were in, which was a bit off putting. The food court isn't big, but I liked that some of the restaurants we opened pretty late. The casino itself looks like every other casino in Vegas, except Excalibur has a Medieval theme going on. Still if you've seen one casino in Vegas you've pretty much seen them all (except some of the ones on Freemont  still take coins). 

This was my second time in Vegas and if I ever go back I'd stay off the strip and try to explore other areas, but I don't regret going to Excalibur. If you're looking for a no-frill hotel on the strip this will do fine.",5,1,0

Not my choice (as my family chooses) but honestly, as a 24 year old male, it's not bad.
I don't party in Vegas, but if I did, this wouldn't be a bad place to stay. 
It's affordable, there's a massive food court, and if you happen to party a bit too hard, it's on the strip with a walkway escalator to take you back into the hotel so you don't have to stumble back home.

There's an arcade and 'knights of the court' show that's great for kids. 
Poker room is ok. MGM is better (and Excalibur is within a five minute walk).

Highly underrated due to the fact that it doesn't have that cool Vegas-y feel. But I do appreciate the nuances that many miss out on.

Every hotel\/Casino in Vegas has a theme. Along with that theme is the ""crowd"" it tries to attract.  What was Excalibur's?

As soon as you walk in (from the Tropicana side walkway, there is Dick's last resort on the right.  Depending on the time, you might catch a gogo dancer across the way at the bar.  And on your left, is a statue of sponge bob and signs towards the arcade.

(I should be thankfull, the line was even longer once we had been registered)

I have to wonder - these casinos know how much each guest spends, on average, per hour, so surely having 100+ people in line for 1 - 1.5 hours, for 2 or 3 hours per day, MUST warrant opening some extra check in counters, but no, half of them were empty.

It's no wonder we got a surly attendant for the check in process - he was probably sick of dealing with grumpy guests hour after hour.

Talk about getting off to a sour start.

Follow it up with a 20 minute wait to be served at the pool bar, leaving only 35 minutes before they close the pool (7pm), before making our way back to a room with a view of a brick wall, and I for one will never come back, and I'm going next door to play the slots - out of spite.

I should say that having stayed at hotels like the Bellagio, Palms spa resort, Palazzo and the Cosmopolitan, my standards and expectations are on the higher end of the spectrum.

When I checked in I was offered a $10\/night room upgrade to the Royal Tower, which was supposedly recently renovated. The upgrade seemed to be a mismatch of old furniture moved in from another hotel (I've heard rumors that the old stuff from Mandalay Bay was used). That said, the overall appeal was lacking as the carpet and wall coverings were still severely outdated.

The bathroom seemed to be in better condition and more recently updated, but was filthy. The first morning I took a shower, looked over and there were several hairs above my height stuck to the wall. Long hairs. Pretty much impossible to miss if you were cleaning a shower, and they were not mine. There were also several long hairs underneath the sink, keeping a collection of dust bunnies company. Coupled with odd sticky substances on the inside of the bathroom door and all over the room's window (on the inside of it, not the outside), I shudder to think what stains the carpet has if you were able to see them; fortunately the color and pattern prevents that. I wore flip flops at all times.

On the bright side, my initial bed check revealed no bed bugs and so although I was disappointed in the overal cleanliness of the room, I didn't make a fuss.

Other cons:
Length of time to check in.
Salespeople at EVERY ENTRANCE. Seriously, get rid of these clowns!!
Casino and room hallway smell. Very distinctive and cheap\/gross smelling compared to other hotels.

Pros:
Fitness center. Although small, it's clean and well stocked. It doesn't smell weird, either. There was an odd gal doing crunches on the ab machine for about 35 minutes straight one evening that gave me pause, but there's nothing Excalibur can do about weirdos :)

All told, I'd forgive the outdated look and over-the-top air freshener for the supposed cheap price (although, once you factor in the resort fee, it's really not that cheap anymore), but I can't forgive sloppy housekeeping. Even my daily tips left in the room for staff didn't get me better service. The room this visit was honestly gross, and I will not stay in this facility again.",1,1,0

The Good: 
-A wonderful newly rennovated pool area.  I was very impressed.  (Get a cabana, its worth it.)  They also have an adult pool where you can avoid cannonballs.
-Brand new spa
-Great location on the strip close to MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay

The OK:  
-Only get the rooms in the newly renovated Tower 2.  Their clean and decently appointed for what you pay for.  You don't want to know what the Tower 1 rooms look like.  They are scary.
-Good table minimums during the day in the Casino.

The BAD:
-You will get hounded by the timeshare people every time you walk to your hotel room.  Just smile and say no thank you.  You get used to it after a while.
-People will smoke on all floors regardless of where you are.  
-There is no security guarding the room towers.  This bothered me a bit since any yahoo off the street could wander up into the room floors.
-Bad Bad restaurants.  I recommend walking to the Luxor or Mandalay Bay Shops for food.

The wallpaper in Tower 1 looks original; we were on a nonsmoking floor that had to have been a smoking floor at some point. The room had two small lights. One lamp by the bed and an old kind of hanging light over this ugly small table. They do not have wifi in this hotel either. They did have an ethernet (if you have a laptop and not a tablet!).

All electrical outlets are loose and you have to be careful or you will get electrocuted.  

Excalibur was dong fine with wired internet, but this year, decided to go wireless and just screwed everything up.

The outside oversized sleeping beauty castle exterior is impressive ill give it that, And the staff is curious and helpful so also a plus. They have a Starbucks on the premises which is convenient and the rooms are clean enough. The beds are comfy but outside of that however I feel its down hill from there. 
The decor is outdated by decads to the point where the carpet is frayed and rolling up. The medieval theme is not well done and could be amazing if any effort was given.

I was very happy with the place! We had a tower view room with a king bed on the 27th floor, nice view of the strip! The room was clean, bed was very comfy except for the pillows, and the bathroom was nice and big! Only minor complaints are the fan in the bathroom didn't really work, the shower head was a little corroded, and the pillows were very soft and uncomfortable. Other than that, the room was great. I liked that they had security at the tower entrances. The pool area was also nice even though it was far from our room. It was annoying however that they had the largest pool closed...it was cinco de mayo weekend, and the other three pools were so packed you could barely move!! They have the pool area open to the public for no cost, which makes it extra busy since it is a really nice area, so they definitely should have had all pools open.

The five stars are given based on what you get for the money.  Sure, it's no Wynn or Bellagio, but if you want a large, comfortable hotel room with a comfy bed, large bathroom, and good TV, all at a bargain price, this is it.  A couple of things the room could use is: a coffee maker (I don't drink it, but my wife said she would want one) and a refrigerator. They don't sell lo carb monster, so I would have liked to buy some and stash it in the room for a pick me up.

The amenities that we (my wife and I) used during our stay were great. The workout facilities were great with really good equipment. The pool was closed for remodeling but they gave you the ability to use the Luxor's pool (and another, I think) as alternatives, but it was too cold anyway. 

The Casino was awesome, not smokey at all (I'm not a smoker, hate the smell, and can't figure out why people still do it, but whatever), it was pretty well ventilated and nothing like some of the older casinos.   

I'm a small stakes blackjack gambler and love that they have $5 blackjack tables all times of the day.  I spend quite a bit of time there while waiting on my wife to get ready. She also like the slot machine options, but she doesn't gamble much at all.  I play poker at my home local casinos, but I generally do not play in Vegas and I cannot offer insight as to the play here. 

The wait staff and dealers are INCREDIBLE!  Seriously.  Incredible.  All the time while playing, I was never wanting for a drink, whether it was water, beer, or a shot of tequila.  The servers, especially one that I wish I could remember her name, were extreme attentive AND NICE AND CORDIAL (which, unfortunately, is lost in some of the casinos on the strip).  Every time I was brought a drink, she said ""you guys enjoy your beers,"" and joked with the table. As someone who plays blackjack purely for recreation, I really enjoyed the added friendly banter and service with a smile the Excalibur dealers and servers provided. 

As for food, I spend a lot of them on TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc, trying to find cool, off the beaten path places to eat.  That was, on the whole, a waste of time, effort, and money.  We didn't eat at the Excalibur until our last 12 hours and found it to be really good. We should have spent more time here.  

One thing that was good about us venturing ""off-site"" was that we found that the resort has a very nice and convenient spot for Uber & Lyft pickups, which we used almost exclusively. 

The only bad experience we had was out in room phone didn't work when my wife tried to call room service. This turned out to be a good thing, but it helped speed up her getting ready to go to dinner. They would have brought a new phone if we asked, but we didn't need one.  Bottom line, if you're expecting Bellagio type surroundings for Excalibur money, you will be disappointed.  Though the hallways and decor of the room were dated (this is really not a factor for me at all because the room was clean, bed was comfy, water was hot, and bathroom was big), but if your looking for a quality resort, hotel, and casino on the strip, all for a fair price, look no further: this is it and I highly recommend it.

I came frugal-minded, knowing that I would not do much sleeping and keeping in mind a certain Yelper's admonition ""you get what you pay for""

I got even less than what I paid for. 

I booked a week in advance, for Saturday and Sunday night.
I picked the cheapest standard room for Saturday and a Spa Suite for Sunday, Sunday being the much cheaper night of the two.
 

When I came on Saturday, they sent me right to an upgraded room.
This would have been cool if it was a Smoking King bed like I wanted instead of a Non smoking double.
My 6 foot big ass boyfriend and I cannot fit in no double bed.

I called room service to get this rectified and came in contact with the rudest, bitchiest motherfucking concierges I have ever encountered.

These assholes need a lesson in customer service from my foot in their asses.
They told me I was in no way guaranteed the room I ordered, and that I should be happy they upgraded me.
I said I didn't give a shit, and I want the room I paid for.
I asked them what guarantee I would have that the next night's spa suite and they said ""none""

I promptly cancelled the next night's reservation.

We did have to stay that night  in the Excalibur.

So i might as well review the room.

Which was shitty and had a shitty view and hat the shittiest bed linens ever.

The only downside is that there's no fridge\/microwave\/coffee maker\/kettle, which is no biggie for me since I don't personally use those things anyways. I pretty much got a giant bucket of ice twice daily and was good with that. However, I can understand how not having those basic necessities can be an inconvenience to others.

Seeing it from the air or from the Strip, it is one messed up eyesore and you might dismiss it. It is amazing that a place that looks like the over-sized home of Bozo the clown passed the planning or design guidelines and is found on one of the more coveted corners in Las Vegas.  However, once you're inside, you can cool your jets a little.  It isn't as bad as the exterior might suggest.

The last time at the Excalibur, I was in one of the upgraded standard rooms and it was very tasteful, with nothing suggesting the stupid Excalibur magic castle theme.  The parking is right next to the hotel and one can usually get lucky and snag a close- in spot.  The health club is top notch, again much better than what the hotel exterior might suggest.  Even their buffet is good.  How is it that a lower price point \/ major hotel on the Strip has a better buffet than the very presentable Monte Carlo a few properties up the Strip on the same side of Las Vegas Blvd.?  I don't know.  Finally, the location is at the second best corner on the Strip, after the next one further up at which the Bellagio is found.

So, if you can get past the shock of the schlock, the Excalibur is a decent price\/quality ratio hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.",5,1,1

 - the rooms are decent in size, clean, and comfy (Tower 1)
 - it has connecting walkways to the Luxor and New York New York 
 - they have non-smoking rooms to stay in... thank you baby jesus


BUT, it is crappy because: 
 - the buffet kinda sucks, but its cheap... but it sucks
 - the ventilation inside the casino is crap, so it stinks. the cigarette smoke just circulates (the Venitian on the other hand has great ventilation)
 - they try to trick you into a ""discount"" trap by asking you to visit a new hotel\/casino (its like what happens when you get tricked into a timeshare)
 - they have 3 pools, BUT they only open the biggest pool for use during the summer months.... the rest of the year it is closed, so the other smaller pools are over-crowded

 - just so you know, they do not have Wi-Fi, but they do have a data cable you can use for free in your room with a laptop

Yes, the hotel is a little out of date and yes, their casino reeks of smoke, but if you're not going to really spend a lot of time in your room then who really cares? Although old, the rooms are still clean and the staff are all very friendly and helpful.

Casino is huge. Hotel is safe after hours. Security is at every elevator and you have to show your room key to enter the elevators for the guest rooms.
I had a regular room with 2 beds on the 6th floor in tower 1. Room was nice and clean. I have no complaints. Cleaning people came daily and they were nice. I would stay again. 
Went into the pool for free around 4 pm. It wasnt hot but the pool was heated and war. Jacuzzi was good but not hot.

Bed was comfortable enough, and check in and check out was good. Staff seemed nice enough, friendly and all. Nice pool area.  Buffet was very expensive, but got a credit to use there, and for good reason. Main courses did not look good, salmon was grey when you cut into it, alot of fried options. Deserts looked very good, with a crepe bar.

The stole my mother in laws purse and my daughters purse. The hotel security came and took a report and said the door was pried open and has marks near the key pad. My in laws keys were in the purse and they could not get into their vehicle and go home. They called AAA and had keys and it cost them $400 to do so. 

After they keys were made, the hotel staff found the purse with the keys in them. I asked to see if there was anything they could do about reimbursing them the cost of the keys.They said Risk Management did not work on the weekends and they could help us more on Monday. 

We called Risk Management and they said we left the door open and the pry marks were there before and it was not the hotels fault. They say they have a law in Nevada, that if they provide a dead bolt on the door and a safe in the room, they are not liable and you are basically SOL. 

I cannot believe that a hotel that makes Billions per year could not even split the cost of the keys with us and would rather lose our business for the future rather than giving better customer service so that you want to return there to stay and gamble. 

If I was you, I would never stay or gamble at the Excalibur or Luxor again. They own the Luxor hotel too.",0,0,0

The theme was just so ridiculous.  At this point I am just hoping things are clean. I head to the bathroom and there is a nasty filth all around the sink. I was extremely grossed out and called housekeeping to please come and clean it. Took them a really long time to get to the sink. Next, I check the bed to make sure it is clean, and it was, so that's why the 2 stars. The bed was actually fairly comfortable, although could have used more pillows in my opinion. The next day I had to call room service 3 times to get them to clean the beds, they didn't end up showing until about 7pm. Overall I would not stay here again.

The hotel kinda sucked. It seemed like a Circus Circus to me. I guess this hotel is mainly for family's with kids. 

We had dinner both nights here with the company. I would say that would have been probably the best thing about my experience here. (Once again food, my weakness =P). Anyways the first night we had dinner at Sir Galahad's. I had probably the thickness prime rib I've ever had. On the menu it said 12 oz Kings cut, but it seemed like it was 2 1\/2 pounds. I guess because we had such a big party and was buying so many drinks they decided to give all of us who ordered the Prime Rib a bigger slice. The second night we had dinner at the Regale. It was Italian food. I would also say this was a nice place. I probably took like 11 shots of Patron, so I cant really tell you much about how the food tasted. 

You ask why I say 3 stars for a hotel I hated? Reason why is the restaurants are good. Even though this hotel is no Wynn or Belagio. =)",1,3,1

We stayed just one night with out 6 year old who, who was bitten pretty bad. At midnight we called the front desk to let them know not only did we find bugs but our child was bitten. We where then moved all the way across the casino with a sleepy six year old in tow. We then had to fill out a report and they took pictures of the bites. It was near 1am before we got done.. They offered to wash our clothing for free ..we did do that..but spent another hour pulling all the sheets off the bed (as the night manager watched us) to be sure it would not happen again... We then had to shower our little one...so it's now about 230am before we all get to bed. For our trouble we got bites, and a slightly less dingy room... We still paid for parking and less then half a nights sleep (maybe 5 hours..hard to sleep when you itch all over) NEVER AGAIN!!!",3,0,1

On arrival the hotel is clearly lacking an adequate cleaning staff or their attention to detail is just horrible. Everything from the outside of the hotel to the casino floor was for lack of better words, disgusting. Glass doors tagged, scratched and covered in finger prints. Gum stuck everywhere. The water feature in front of the hotel was 90% empty and filled with trash and algae. Our room was no winner either. We actually had to get a new room because our first one seemed like the forgot to clean it. Aside from all the cleanliness issues, the hotel no longer feels like a medieval, or castle like atmosphere. Had I not known what the hotel was known for, I would of never guessed it was supposed to be a castle. Its quite a shame.

We also opted for the buffet they offered....Do yourself a favor and pass on that. If you want to feel like your in an old hometown buffet and eat horrible food....Then go for it. Otherwise go down the strip to damn near ANY other buffet. My fiance tried a number of items from the buffet and finally gave up, she ended up eating watermelon and drinking water. Everything is clearly reheated and none of that was even done well. Every thing we ate was cold in the middle. It was almost comical how consistent this problem was. The eggs felt like I put a sponge in my mouth. Both texture and taste. My biggest failure with the buffet was the ""chow mein noodles"" (ramen). Even this was not cooked all the way. Hard uncooked noodles were just as prevalent as actual edible noodles. An employee asked me how my meal was and i told him it was utterly disappointing. He smiled and said ""good."" I don't believe he spoke English. But he was working hard which is less than I can say for the cleaning staff. (if there is one...)

Now for the biggest problem of all. The timeshare salesmen........
Immediately upon entering the hotel (and especially while holding luggage) you WILL be approached by a timeshare salesmen. They will try to rope you in with offers of free or cheap tickets to shows and dinners. The offer works like any other timeshare presentation. They give you something but  only after you go to a presentation to purchase a timeshare in the hotel. The presentation however, is of course in another hotel....So you have to opt for a ride to this other hotel where you will be stuck until they agree to take you back or you just decide to walk. You can decline and go about your day but the problem doesn't stop here. Going to your room? Prepare to be approached by timeshare salesmen. Going to the casino? Timeshare salesmen again. Entering or exiting the hotel? Timeshare salesmen....Going to Dicks last resort? (which btw is this hotels only saving grace and consequently their most heavily promoted attraction) Timeshare salesmen!!!!!! I cant stress this enough....You WILL be approached by them constantly and consistently.

Don't waste your time with this hotel unless you are for some reason in an outrageous need for a timeshare. And even still, don't buy it from here. If the hotel is any indication of the product they are selling....Your gonna have a bad time.",4,3,2

I wanted to post this right when I found a bug on my pillow at MGM EXCALIBUR HOTEL but did not as I wanted to be sure it was a bedbug first. They did some test to find out what type of insect it was and a week after our stay they called us to confirm that they did find MULTIPLE BEDBUGS on our bed! I still feel itchy just thinking about it! I was so afraid that we might have brought it back with us so we had to fumigate our place because they let us go home without even offering to clean our clothes! If you think I got a full refund for all the troubles they caused well... they did not! I still had to pay half of it! They should have offered to give all my money back as soon as we reported there was a bug on our bed! Not only is this hotel disgusting but also have poor customer service! Also, it's ridiculous that the hotel operations manager wanted me to sign a release of claims just so they can give me all my money back! I will not be signing anything! They can keep my money if they want! They probably need it to fumigate their hotel! Good job for ruining our vacation! I will never stay at any MGM hotels anymore!
