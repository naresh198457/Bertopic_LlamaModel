You walk into the place and it is dripping with elegance and very worthy of its 5 diamond rating. There's so much to do in this place that it is a vacation in and of itself. I think it's fitting that this place stands where the Sands used to stand. The Sands in its heyday was the height of class, and the Venetian proudly carries that torch.

They spent a tremendous amount of time, research, architectural detail, and of course money to make this place what it is. I've gamed there many times and what stood out to me was how nice and friendly everyone was, right down to the pit bosses. 

The only thing that keeps me from staying there is that constant incense smell that is overpowering when you walk in. Yes, it smells nice, but it dries my eyes out and stuffs my nose up, so I've always defaulted to choosing the Bellagio over the Venetian. But I love visiting and just spending time looking around.",1,0,0

All things considered, this is the best value for the money!!  Its location on the strip is pretty central to everything and it has our favorite restaurant, Table 10, and our favorite store, Cuadra.  Obviously, the shops with the canal are breathtaking and we also spent hours at the $5 video blackjack, but still trying to figure out if it's fixed (j\/k)!

The pools weren't terribly impressive, but we managed to find a couple of free lounge chairs, the breakfast both at the food court and at the upscale restaurant we had a coupon for were just so-so.

I'll likely try to stay here again.",0,0,0

The check-in area isn't quite as nice, especially when you consider that invited guest check-in is just a small podium (compared to Mandalay Bay's separate lounge).  However, the rooms are quite a bit nicer and very comfortable.  Finally, you don't have to watch TV sitting in bed!  Venetian gives you a separate sitting area and a separate TV from the bedroom area.  Mrs. C really likes the small stool and make-up table in the bathroom as well.  

I think the food choices are also pretty good at Venetian.  There are 2 different food courts if you want something quick, or just want to run downstairs and bring food back to your room.  There's also Grand Lux Cafe.  I have been to Bouchon twice, and it was ok - maybe French Laundry s just an entirely different experience because you're in Napa Valley.

Two more great things about staying at the Venetian: you are centrally located on the Strip and very walkable to Forum shops, Fashion Show mall and many other hotels.  If you had a race between walking and driving from the Venetian, I'd bet that the person walking would win.  Also, guests at the Venetian get 50% off a day pass at Canyon Ranch Spa, and Mrs. C went crazy when she got to experience that place.  I get to gamble, and she gets to hang out at a super fancy spa.  Everyone wins!",4,2,3

I come to Vegas several times a year, mostly for business (well, you always can mix in some pleasure here in Sin City). So I prefer to go to an off-the-strip hotel, like you might find in every other city. 

Why the Hades would I stay at a Courtyard, Embassy Suites or other such businessperson's hotel  when I go to Vegas  you ask? 

Because if you are trying to make business calls, and drive around town as a humble worker bee toiling his trade, you want to be able to get in your hotel and out of your hotel, usually easily and quickly, like you do in Bakersfield, or Missoula, Hackensack or anywhere else Johnny Cash used to sing about. (""I've been everywhere, man!"" I can relate!)

So the last thing you want to do is be with the prolitereate masses of rookies, wanabees, country bumpkins, and drunk douchebags, waiting in line for 20 minutes for your Valet car, 20 minutes for your bags, walk through endless casinos that stretch for blocks, and fight through oggling crowds fixated on free shows on Las Vegas Boulevard. 

But sometimes you have to make exceptions, like I did today. 

The deal:Luxury Suite on the 33rd floor of the Venetian, with oversized bathroom with marble floors and double doors, a separate commode room, large bathtub and separate glass enclosed shower, vanity, his\/hers sink, king size bed, 3 flat screen TVs, step down living room with gold sectional couch, large coffee table, desk with fax\/printer and WIFI, separate dining table, remote control automated curtains, 2 terry robes, sensor mini-bar, and luxury appointments. 

Wait, that's not all! 

Add $25 in slot money, complimentary golf club rentals, 50% discount on a round of golf at Bali Hai or Royal Links, 20% off your bill at Restaurant Charlie, 2 for 1 well drinks at Salute in the Palazzo Hotel, and 20% off at the Pinot Brasserie. 

Cost on a Thursday night in June?

$300? (WIlliam Shatner scoffs! Go lower, he whispers)

$200? (Bill says, Mamby Pamby! Lower)

$150? (Shatner is asking to be beamed up!)

Try $109. Yup, all that for $109. 

And Bill Shatner had nothing to do with it. Neither did Price Line. I just saw their show, Jersey Boys last year, didn't even stay here then (I was at the Embassy Suites!) and they emailed me the special. 

Turns out I turned the $25 free slots into $60, took that to the Craps table and turned it into $300. So I came out way ahead. 

And instead of seeing businessmen in business casual wear at the Courtyard, there was nothing but lovely women showing a lot of flesh in their little strapless mini-dresses. Las Vegas gives women the excuse to dress like a hooker, and they all do when the sun goes down. 

Only problem is, they can't wear that same mini-dress back in Peoria or Poughkeepsie or Petaluma! Not at the local Marriott at least!

Which reminds me, didn't William Shatner play a ""Hooker"" on TV?",13,17,13

A gondola ride or a spa treatment at the Canyon Ranch is a great way to spend your time.  Service here, however, is substandard.  It seems to take forever to get your car from the valet, and calling the front desk for anything you can expect a wait up to three hours for items.  The amenities, with a burnt orange smell, may not be for everyone, but were very nice, and I love the tub and shower.  The Venetian is following the general trend of being cheap in the name of eco-friendly, so they make you beg (and wait) for a robe instead of providing one, and don't wash or change sheets or towels unless you request it.  The beautiful furniture and art and high tech televisions and window coverings were a nice touch.",3,1,3

This place is so beautifully made the ceilings are high and it's just amazing how nice it is. I had a room across the street at the Mirage which is alright but I couldn't believe I spent most of my time at the Venetian.

I spoke with a very nice representative ""Lisa"" who credited back $150 on my credit card-even she couldn't believe all of the notes on our account nor the fumes we had to deal with. They are also looking into other things for us so I am glad I called. 
Upgrading to 2.5 stars and this review might go higher depending on what else happens.
_____________________________
I had high expectations for this hotel-and even higher given the fact that we upgraded to a fancy pants suite to celebrate my 40th birthday. While the hotel lobby is beautiful and the poker room giant, the rest of our stay was just okay and I promise to post pictures of our room once I get around to it. We had some really nice service and some not so nice service given what happened here, and I will do my best to outline it.

-Check in time is supposed to be 4pm. Our plane was late and we arrived at 6pm to find out our suite (that had been booked since mid September) was not ready for us. We were offered a lesser suite on a lower floor, but it was a smoking floor so that was a ""NO"". We were then told they would have our kind of suite available in an hour so for inconvenience, we were offered free drinks at the bar (husband does not imbibe) and $100 food and beverage credit (not to include tips). We said that would be fine, brought our bags to the Valet area and went to look around a bit. As promised, an hour later, our room was ready and we had a suite on the 26th floor-all the way at the end of one hall.

Upon walking into our suite, we were blasted by the smell of what I thought was new paint. When the Bellman brought up our luggage, he advised us that this was a newly remodeled suite and that we were the first ones to stay in it. This is usually a good thing, but the smell was so overpowering I felt dizzy and like I would pass out. I called down to the front desk, was on hold for about 15 minutes (word to the wise-if a major rodeo is in town beware for lots of cowboys and no room availability). I was told the hotel was at capacity (7,000 rooms) and they would send housekeeping up to refresh the room with air freshener. Luckily, we didn't stay in the room that long and we did have a bedroom door that shut and we couldn't smell the fumes with the door closed. 

The next morning, I woke up with a bit of a headache and at about 6:45am, I told the husband I was going to get coffee from Bouchon. First, I made a beeline for the front desk.
-I let the front desk know about our room smell. Again, I was advised the hotel was at capacity and was credited another $50 towards food and beverage. I was told that they could have housekeeping come and ionize our room but it would be a 5 hour or so affair. I told them that was fine as we had planned on going to Caesar's for the day and would call when we were leaving the room. I also advised that the jets in our tub were not working properly, there were lightbulbs burned out in the light fixture over the dining room table and that the makeup mirror provided did not work. I was assured everything would be taken care of.
- We were gone all day. Left the Venetian around 9:30 and arrived back around 3:30 with a full expectation our room would be better. When we returned, the ionizer was still going full blast and whilst the bed had been made and the towels and ammenaties replenished, the bathroom was still not cleaned, lightbulbs still not replaced, etc. etc. I called down to the front desk and was on hold for about 20 minutes and was finally connected to a ""manager"". At this point, we were running short on time as we had dinner plans with a couple of my friends and my Mom and her friend before we had tickets to see Jersey Boys. I was advised by this manager that they were at full capacity but they could have another comparable suite available to us but we would have to pack up and be ready to go by a certain time. I reminded him that we were on our way out the door to dinner-meeting people BEFORE our showtime. He was an ass-and I ended up telling him so and we left for dinner and I tried to suck up how furious I was about the room and the smell. Luckily both dinner and the show were enough to take my mind off the room and I did get a call during dinner on my cell from the asshole manager telling me that someone was coming to repair our tub, thoroughly clean the bathroom and that the ENTIRE hotel was out of the particular lightbulb to replace above the dining room table. Hard to believe, but by this point, I was done.

There are other problems with this hotel but there are also some great things. The front desk clerks were awfully nice, the hoochie mama dresses worn by most guests made for great people watching and the overall aesthetics of the hotel are magnificent. I enjoyed the restaurants, the window shopping, etc.

I may stay here again, but probably not and definitely wouldn't waste our money on a suite here again.",11,3,6

Having that extra room in a suite provided much needed square footage for the lil one to roam in. He was thrilled being able to roam from the sunken living room to the bedroom. 

Pool: Venezia Gardens pool is perfect for kids. Not as packed as the main swimming pool. The smaller pool is heated nicely and the entire pool area was shaded from the towering building.

Parking: Valet at the garage parking structure if you are staying at the Venezia tower. That is closer and less hectic from the registration valet.

There is no fridge or coffee maker in the room. When ordering crib, they also provide a free bib for the baby and a box of J&J toiletries.

Buffet: breakfast buffet at the Grand Luxe for $19.50 includes waffles, omelet bar, fruits, eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, hashbrowns. There is also a less crowded Grand Luxe at the adjoining Palazzo.",4,1,2

My two friends and I decided to visit Las Vegas for a week during our first week of summer vacation. We stayed in a Bella Suite in the Venezia tower. I speak for all of us when I say that I have never encountered such thoughtful service in any hotel before. Aside from the remarkable structure of the hotel itself and the pure beauty of our room, the services offered were remarkable. We ordered in-suite dining one morning only to discover fast service, a remarkable table set up, delicious food and coffee. The cream cheese on my smoked salmon plate was moldy, and after calling to request another cream cheese, a server knocked on the door in minutes with an entire new platter of smoked salmon, a new pot of hot coffee and extra condiments, along with a sincere and unnecessary apology. We were so pleased with our experience dining in our suite that we ordered it again three more times during our stay. One day, my friend dropped an earring down the sink. Within minutes of phoning in, a plumber arrived and happily retrieved the earring. Moreover, our turn down service each night was such a nice gesture to come home to when we needed a couple hours to relax. The concierge downstairs was always patient with us when we asked him to make us restaurant reservations, asked about shows and events and even printed us directions to numerous places. The Venezia pool is incredible and is not as crowded as the large pools at the Venetian tower. We made a habit of visiting the Venetian pool in the mornings and then returning to the Venezia pools at night. In fact, the only downfall to our trip was that we didn't spend that much time outside because we were so in love with our hotel that we spent most of the time in it. Overall, our experience was exceptional. The Venetian made our vacation incredible and left us aching in the heart when it was time to check out. It truly became our home in Las Vegas, and we cannot wait until our next return to Las Vegas and the Venetian.",3,0,0

It's certainly not the newest place on the Strip, but it has a good casino, the best poker room in town, and a bunch of great places to eat.  Also, Venetian has nice casual options such as Grand Lux (the best 24 hour coffee shop in Vegas) or Public House in addition to the expensive places.  There is a requisite food court, and choices on the canal shops.  Lots of dining options, and some excellent ones at that.

The rooms are larger than typical, with the sunk in living area and large couches.  You can easily sleep another person on the couch.  My buddies and I have done that on more than one occasion.  

The staff is excellent, and the front desk works people through in very quick fashion during busy times.  

The location is solid as well, right across from Mirage, near Caesars, and if you want to gamble lower, a short walk to Harrah's and other places that generally have cheaper gambling.  Highly recommend the Venetian.",2,1,1

When entering the hotel, I felt like if I was intoxicated enough, I would never make it to bed in this confusing hotel room.  I think just getting to my room, I had to take two or three elevators, cross a bunch of halls, I didn't have an ice bucket, and there weren't any blankets on the bed!  When calling for some down comforters, they said they changed the decor, and I called again and another person said that they will send them right up!  When we received the ""blankets"", I thought they just ran from the Days Inn down the road to borrow some sheets.  FAIL!

As for the decor of the hotel, it was beautiful all over!  I was just so disappointed in the size of our suite. 

I stayed at the new and improved Planet Hollywood a few months back and they definitely kick the Venetians ass on all levels of service, house keeping and making me happy!

The particular thing about the Venetian that I would like to highlight and recommend is the exhibits that they have near the front desk when you walk in.  I have been to both the Leonardo Da Vinci exhibit that they had and the National Geographic's Best Photos Exhibit.  Both were wonderful!

The Leonardo Da Vinci Exhibit was amazing, they took his famous notebooks that he wrote and they built a lot of the items in them so that you can see the concept come to life.  It also features a huge blow up of the Mona Lisa and a history on it.  I am well read on Da Vinci and love him, and there was even information in there that was new to me, like about the water spot under her eye because Napoleon used to own her and hung her in his bathroom (Really, Napoleon, you giant jerk?)  Anyways, it was a great experience.

The National Geographic exhibit was also awesome.  It was a gallery of their 50 best pictures, or top 25, I can't really remember, but it was amazing.  I took my sister to this and she also loved it.  The exhibits tell the background story of the photograph and some include the frames that were shot along with the photo.  The photos are beautiful and the stories behind them are just as beautiful.  Definitely worth going to.

The ceiling in the entryway when you come in off of the strip next to Tao and the Candy Store thing is beautiful, you can lose track of time looking at the beautiful detail.  The Gondola's are also worth seeing.  I haven't ridden them, but they are so neat to look at especially if you have kids.  The St Mark's Square area is also pretty cool.

Yes, the rooms are big and gorgeous but I did not find it that clean. The table beside the couch was extremely dusty where you could SEE a layer of dust. Eeeeek! 

This is what brings me to my three star review. I was coming back from running an errand and had some stuff to bring up, so I decided to valet. Since it was a Friday or Saturday night, I guess valet was getting full and they asked me if I was staying there. Yes, I am staying here....he asked to see my room key which I did not have on hand since I knew the other guests I was with were in the room and they were running their own errands around the hotel. Essentially, he was a big grouch and lectured me about how I should carry around a room-key if I want to valet. To me, this was extremely unwelcoming. So if someone was staying at another hotel but wanted to come to a restaurant, they would be forced to self-park? RUDE!

So, not only was it a problem to valet, but every time I did valet it took between 15-20 minutes to get my car, totally unacceptable with cars that are in valet are very close.

The Venetian was lovely. The service was good, the place was clean, our suite was perfect and it took us two days to even care about going outside--there is that much to do here.

Loved all the dealers I played with. I'd do name shout-outs but I don't know if that sort of thing is kosher. Drinks came around at a good pace and if they didn't, dealers or floor supervisors would call for them. Everybody in the place seemed to be having a great time and the food was good everywhere we ate.

Buchon, which I will review separately, is not to be missed!

Only thing I missed at Venetian was a convenient, casino-level chill bar--think Parasol Up at the Wynn or Eyecandy Sound Lounge at Mandalay Bay.

You will find countless people taking pictures of the architecture here at the Venetian, and if you're lucky enough, you may even be asked to take the picture. This happened to us a few times but hey its Vegas. 
There are gondola rides available that will take you through the Venetian shops with the cloud painted ceilings with a singing Gondoliers. 
While searching for a bakery we discovered on Yelp we walked through here seeing all the great shops. There are high end to magic shops for kids. 
The LOVE sign is famous and you will have to wait your turn for a shot at a picture. 
The casino here was one of my favorite that we visited. I play slots mostly and this seemed to have the most themed variety; from Betty white, The Simpsons, Michael Jackson, to Sharknado(yes Sharknado!), plenty were open and available.
A con or pro depending on your opinion is that the Venetian as well as Palazzo are under a different rewards system,called Grazie, than most casinos of the strip (which are mostly Mlife or Total Rewards). This was our first time gambling here so we will see what kind of discounts we see! We would love to stay here! If you do sign up for the Grazie then you get discounts on Madame Tussauds ,Hertz rental cars, and shops there at the Venetian and Palazzo. Must check out The Venetian!",1,0,2

The hotel is pretty darn nice and fancy, and thank god I split the suite with 100 other people. Just kidding, only 6 of us. Well since it was EDC weekend, the price for the suite was around $825. But you know what? This price is pretty good because I got a great view of Encore beach club, the Trump tower, Treasure Island, Mirage, etc. The suite I got was so nice and big. The couch that was given to us was an L shaped couch, which its long enough for 2 people (one short friend and one tall friend). The two queen size beds were comfy and they feel clean. The beds are definitely not for people with back pain because the beds are super soft and bouncy and you will sink in. The bathroom is big but not that impressive. I guess the only cool thing about this is that there's a TV in there. Yes, I was watching family guy while taking a shower. Speaking of shower, there's a bathtub and separate shower stall. So if you're not going to use the bathtub, then use it to fill it with ice and put your alchies in them. My toilet room was really dark and the door to it was sorta broken because it wouldn't close all the way. The overall door to the bathroom is a double door so the gap between the two doors had a gap. So if you are staying with a creepy friend, be careful.

Other than the rooms, everything is nice. The elevator is fast, the staffs are nice, and security is high. The restaurants are expensive here, and same with all their bakeries like Bouchon and that Cake Boss dude. The shops here are more on the high end. The cheapest store I know here is actually Walgreens and maybe Sephora. Im not sure if they have any buffets here though.

The shoppes are nice, there are tons of restaurants and gaming, and you can also walk over to the Palazzo for their shops. You really don't need to leave the hotel complex unless you are attending a show at a nearby hotel. Everything you need is here.

The downside, or things that I didn't like: The towels were terrible. This is a five star hotel, so I was expecting better. The mattress wasn't great either. The televisions got bad reception (I know, I know, who is in Vegas to watch tv?). The tap water is terrible, so plan on buying bottled. The hotel is really inconvenient to the monorail.

Pool areas are fantastic, heated pools, nice lounge chairs, towels and chair covers, lots of bars (they make a lotta $$ off those $10 cocktails)

As for all the complaints about bad\/inferior rooms, remember you always get what you pay for...if you book the lowest category or lowest priced room when making your reservation and the hotel if full, it is inevetiable that not all of those rooms are going to have a fantastic view of the strip. You can assure yourself of this by paying the upgraded prices for the better view rooms, but if you are paying the cheapest price, or if you bought on priceline, then don't expect to get a room on the 30th floor with the great view!!

Casino is very nice, and well lit. Yes, the perfume smell is very annoying at first, but after a while you really forget about it. (but gosh darn they sure do pump the place up with it!) Paybacks are very skimpy, but no more so than of the other big hotels. If you want good payback head to the riviera, sahara or downtown.

I called room service and asked why it hadn't been cleaned. The room service manager had apologized and asked about my check out day and time. I passed it on to them that I would be flying out after 5pm and they would give me a late check out at 3pm due to the inconvenience of the room not being clean in which I was ok with.
My final issues were with the final day we stayed there. We called the front desk and asked about our check out and about them holding our bags until our flight left. The front manager told us to leave our bags in the room and someone would pick them up.  We proceed to the casino and mall level and had lunch and gambled a little more. When it was time for us to leave and catch our flight we went to pick up our bags and they couldn't find them, we had over an hour and half until our flight. They ran us around and then escorted us to the back and asked us if we could identify our bags and we couldn't.  We looked around and they escorted us to the security area and then the front desk. We spoke to the front desk manager and we later came to find out our bags were still in the room.  Now, they said it was policy for them to pick up the bags while we were still in the room but we were told over the phone that they would pick them up from the room and had told the room service people that were cleaning the room at the moment that they were going to pick up the bags they still didn't get our bags.
I will tell you we missed our flight. All said and done after we found our bags, we had less than 45 mins to leave the hotel and check our bags and get on a flight.  The hotel offered us a refund on our resort fees, $132 and a $200 food credit and an extra night at the hotel.
Not a comp for my 3 evenings in Vegas. Not a comp for our missed flights. Nothing! I will tell you I am pissed that I ended up having to rent a car because I didn't want to pay an additional $750 a flight to get home for two of us to get home for a 19 hour drive back home to san San Antonio. 
I ran through the process of security and trying to get refunded through the hotel. I spent two weeks, back and forth, on the phone with Lean Davis, in which she finally concluded that I would have been able to make it to the airport and had our bags checked within 45 min from the hotel, and did not deserve a refund for our stay. I further more asked her to speak to her supervisor and she told me he would not speak to me and he is too busy of a person to speak to me. I told her that I followed the steps and process that they asked me to  and she responded to me and told me that I should write a letter. I asked her why she didn't tell me to do that in a first place and she told me she would have done weeks ago and that I am ""A GROWN MAN"" I should have done it weeks ago.
I will say I have let it be. I will also say that it fired me up that my work colleague got a card in the mail offering him 3 night stay for free when they couldn't even comp my nights after causing us to miss our flights and drive over 20 hours home and can't even recognize fault.
Lean Davis, here is my official complaint. I am sorry that your boss was too busy to talk to me and honestly no one can make it to the airport from your hotel and check their bags in less than 45 mins for you to find value in why you should refund me a couple night stay because I had to drive 20 hours home because I didn't want to pay over $1500 to fly home.
Yes, ""I am a grown man,"" thank you for sending my colleague offers for free nights. When you could have done more for our stay.

That is good; because it needs it. Otherwise, the property is about the same (relatively high, but not highest) quality it's been since it was built 15-20 years ago. 

Pluses
+ Large standard room (suite)
+ Large bathroom, good soaking tub
+ Generally comfortable - good mattress, nice couch, sitting area, etc.
+ Good, central, ""Strip"" location

Minuses
- Dead linens (unforgivably bad)
- Dark room, worn carpeting, aging decor
- Construction noise
- Interior room noise - poor soundproofing from the hallway - bad news in Vegas

General Comments:
The hotel's ""suites"" (standard rooms) are large, as they always have been - comfortable for families or for more than one-two people. The property is well kept, apparently clean (rooms, grounds). No complaints there. 

Check-in line was long, but they were quick to address the issue, opening a second desk and sending people to redirect some of the line to the second desk. Good job there. 

The bathroom is large, spacious and keeps true to the Venetian theme with generous use of marble. It has a separate frameless \/ glass shower and soaking tub. There is a toilet room (which is very dark). The design is original, but it is classic enough that it is fine. 

The pool area is slightly boring, but nice, consistent with the ""Venetian"" theme.

Re: the ""unforgivably bad"" linens, I will say a couple things, but start with this: even if the hotel is undergoing renovations, there is no excuse for old \/ dead linens & towels at a luxury property. 
- The bedsheet we have is old, thin, scratchy and cheap feeling. 
- The towels are old, light, and unworthy of a hotel at this level (wasting away from years of washing). My photo (attached) shows the first towel I grabbed this morning (outside the shower door), with extensive fraying and (more difficult to see) there was hard \/ melted plastic or metal on the towel. Whoever folded it would have seen it. I didn't until I took it off. Looks obviously dirty. Horrible, inexcusable.

The linens wouldn't have passed at any Holiday Inn I stayed at in college, let alone a $200\/night (or $400\/wkd night) premium property in Las Vegas n 2014. 

I won't be back until the renovation is complete. And even then, I've much preferred recent stays at the Aria and Mandalay Bay. 

Room Tip: Ask for a renovated room. As of 7\/29, they apparently have worked their way down to the 23rd floor...",1,0,1

I did however use the pool cabana on the Venetian side. The Palazzo pool is where all the families go. The Venetian is where the TAO beach club happens during the day. Since we were there with a bachelorette party we opted for the Venetian.

So why get a cabana you may ask? You don't need one but it's nice for special occasions. The weekend we were there it was 110 deg during the day. There isn't much shade by the pool. That makes sense since people want to lie out in the sun but I couldn't take more than half an hour of the sun and even then sweat was pouring down my face. The only way to cool off is to go inside, go into the pool or into your cabana. Since we were there with a group of girls with varying desires to tan the cabana was perfect. Half of us took turns outside in the loungers while others hid out inside the cabana which is shaded with curtains to keep in the lovely cool air from the a\/c unit. Yes, only in vegas can you get a poolside cabana with an a\/c unit, mini fridge and tv. The hostess came by every 20 minutes or so to see if we needed anything. You can order food from the pool deck restaurant and have it delivered. In our case we brought a grocery bag full of snacks and also our own liquor. I'm not sure if it's technically allowed by they didn't say anything. Without the cabana we wouldn't have been able to spend the afternoon together by the pool as I'm sure some would get overheated and tired and end up leaving. This way we were able to hang out and do ""bachelorette"" things. 

If I was there with a smaller group of people I probably wouldn't bother with a cabana at $500 for the afternoon (you must checkin at 10 AM and the cabana officially holds just 8 people).

The pool is nice though it's really for standing around and drinking. It's only 3 ft deep and gets crowded so you can't really lie around (no floaties anyways) or play in it. If you have a drink you need to stay within arms length of the pool edge. The lifeguards spent most of their time whistling at people trying go escape with their drinks.",2,1,0

I ended up filling one of my bathroom sinks with ice and keeping my drinks in there for the week.  Not the classiest thing but it worked!

Also, it is a serious hike to get anywhere in this super confusing hotel, and even more confusing if you ever try to leave it!  It took me and a friend over an hour and directions from 3 different employees to finally get outside the damn place!  I work in a shop and am pretty used to being on my feet and walking most of the day, but this place made that seem like nothing!  Even a few days after being home my feet are still hurting (and no, I wasn't tromping around Vegas in heals, I was wearing sneakers.  I don't even own a pair of heels!)

I would definitely stay here again if someone else was paying the bill.  Next time I'm in Vegas for fun, I think I will try to find something a bit more... casual...",0,0,0

Additionally, a few bulbs in the room were out and the soap shelf in the shower was chipped.  If you try to drain the tub at the same time that you are showering (ie after soaking in the tub then jumping into the shower) the drain in the shower will not drain.

The room was ok overall.  It is getting a bit outdated.  The beds were a bit soft, the sheets were not soft at all and the pillows were all shaped differently.

My hotel of choice, partially biased by the memories of my best trips to Vegas happening when I stayed at The Venetian, is of course The Venetian.

I like this for so many reasons:

1) They are adjacent to many good restaurants

2) The clientele is a good mixture of eye candy and people one can say ""aren't obnoxious knuckleheads"" that you'd see at a few other spots in Vegas.

3) The proximity of the location is perfect on the strip, walking distance to the heart of the strip, which I consider from Bally's to the Wynn.

4) The rooms are spacious, as every room, as they say, is a suite.

Overall, I prefer The Venetian over the Pallazo, Wynn, Encore, Mandalay Bay, Aria, and the others I think are in the same style and price range.

*) Interesting note about their customer service.  In one breath, they're great if your cell phone battery dies, you can leave your phone to get a free charge, which is a convenience many don't know about.  On the other hand, once, when I left, I'd left a pair of prescription eye glasses in my room, checked out of the hotel, and called them that day to inquire, and they seemed nonchalant and didn't seem to put much effort to instill confidence in me that they even attempted to look for them or had any white glove treatment follow through to confirm or deny with a courtesy status update.  So, I'd give that a coin toss.

Also, on a side note, I thought I heard a story where the security at the Venetian years ago once mistakenly mistook a high roller's daughter dressed up in typical night club attire hanging out at the hotel for a hooker, which caused a major issue, so going forward the management supposedly turned a blind eye to avoid making costly assumptions, so that's why you might see more girls selling their wares than other hotels... urban legend and myth or ?  There's only one way to find out... j\/k",0,0,0

This was my second stay at the Venetian (first one in 2009) and once again I can say that this just one of the best hotels in town and for sure the more impressive if we talk about atmosphere (with the beautiful lobby and the amazing Grand Canal Shoppes).

Check-in was just quick and fine, people were very friendly and polite. I also had to use the concierge service and the lady was again friendly, polite and very helpful. Same for the guy at the keys desk who tried to help me with my boarding passes and the Valet service that has been fast and reliable both on return and pick-up.

Rooms are possibly among the best I've ever seen, the smallest room is still a suite and comes with 3 televisions. Furnitures are lovely and there's more than enough space.

The choice of restaurants covers pretty much everything (especially if you think the Venetian and Palazzo as just one huge resort) although we limited our experience to the Carlo's Bakery for breakfast (similar experience to the original in Hoboken... including the queue :))

If I have to find a negative aspect, it has been extremely loud both in the casino and in the room corridors... but that's just the guests being unpolite (in fact a security guy showed up pretty quickly when people were making a lot of noise outside our room during the night).

Or, how many of the 4- and 5-star reviews were written by people who stayed there for free? Unlike many other reviewers, we paid more than $500 for two nights this week, and we were extremely disappointed.

If you're thinking of staying there and you are the one paying the bill, you should know:

They charged my card as soon as I made the reservation.

The lobby is loud and chilly. To get to our room, we had a long walk through the casino (also very cold all the time) to the elevator and another long, icy walk to the room. The first key cards we got didn't work.

The room had used dental floss on the floor and a used band-aid next to the bed. We complained to housekeeping and were told, ""I'm sorry. Do you need anything else?""

We couldn't use the fridge because it was crammed full of their stuff for sale. There was a display in front of the TV of those small, $9 boxes of snacks sitting on sensors so they can charge you automatically if you pick one up. We knew better than to pick them up, but one of the spots was already empty! We told the front desk, and so far we haven't been billed for it.

They had signs in the room saying they wouldn't change the bed every day so they could save water--but the toilet ran the whole time we were there. Also, there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom.

The view was of roofs and backs of buildings.

A sign on the desk said Internet access was $12.95 a day.

The ""$150 in resort extras"" we got  were 2-for-1 drink coupons and 20% off restaurant & spa coupons, none of which we were interested in using.

I'm serious--an $80-100 a night Best Western or Comfort Inn would have been far more comfortable--we'd have been able to park near the room, it would have been clean, we could have used the fridge, we wouldn't have to worry about being charged for snacks by mistake, and we would have had free Internet access and breakfast.",4,3,1

It was well furnished as it came with a king sized bed, 3 TVs (if you count the one in the bathroom), a long lounge sofa chair, and a a living room area complete with a round table and a 2 large sofa\/couches with a small coffee table.

The bathroom itself was large and contained a stand-in shower and also a bathtub and a large countertop containing 2 seperate sinks.

The AC was crisp and cool and was such a relief when coming outside from the 100+ degree heat. 

The only thing that really irked me was that the stereo\/alarm clock hybrid machine next to the bed did NOT have an iPod docking station!! WTH? Of all places, especially a suite at the Venetian, I would have expected them to have some kind of iPod home docking station for my iPhone or iPod so that I can play music...I actually called front desk and they told me that I could rent an iPod docking station for $35\/day...I was thinking in my head ARE YOU SERIOUS? Major fail right there.

But I suppose I could overlook that little blemish there, as the casino is easily accessible on the first floor as well as other misc restaurants and eateries. (e.g. Grand Lux Cafe, Noodle Asia, etc.)

Overall, this hotel was one of the more enjoyable hotels to stay in as they have all the modern amenities of a 5 star hotel + more!

us: ""nope""
random lady: ""oh, are you guys just living together then?""
us: ""nope""

Staying at the newer towers in the hotel (away from registration) are a lot better just because the beds, bathrooms, etc. are nicer and the guest elevators are closer to the shops, food court and casino.

The Venetian pools are great and you have the option of using the Palazzo pools because they are connected by a short walkway. Both pools are great. Venetian has Tao beach for people that want the club experience in the daytime.

Venetian also has the nightclub TAO in the front of the hotel. This has probably been the most popular longstanding club (5 years) on the Strip and it still gets as packed as ever. DJ Skratchy or DJ Vice keep it happening and are my favorites for movin the crowd. Packed is not the word for this place.

1. The line for check-in was ridiculous, we got in line at 4:00 and were scheduled for a 7:00 show at Paris, we barely made it and were unable to get dinner because of the amount of time it took in line.
2. We started our vacation at The Mirage, they freely upgraded our room to an amazing suite because it was our ten-year anniversary, we didn't expect any favors, but after having that kind of service at The Mirage we were disappointed when The Venetian did NOTHING.
3. After checking-in, we went to our room to quickly change for the show and a maintenance worker walked in! I was in the middle of changing my clothes. He said he was there to clean the carpet. He left after talking with us.
4. We immediately called the front desk and there was no answer, we had to leave for our show.
5. We called after the show to report the mistake and to make sure we were in a clean room. There was an I'm sorry that he walked in and that was it. 
6. The pool was closed for a wedding in our tower. We went to the other pools and kids were everywhere. We love kids, but wanted a quiet pool, but all of those pools were closed. We didn't know until walking there and finding they were blocked off.
7. It is too difficult to get around in the hotel. We had to take 2 elevators to get to our rooms in a separate tower.
8. The escalators were broken the entire trip.
9. There are timeshare reps everywhere trying to get you to sign-up for a tour!

I was generous in giving 2 stars because the bed was comfortable (but short) and the in-room breakfast was great. Also, Yardbird had great food in the hotel.

Suites...1 star
Smaller than what we get at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay. Quality is not that great at all.  It is definitely an older hotel that is showing its needs for some major renovations.  Our suite was overdue for some major repairs! First, the door couldn't close so we asked to be transferred to another suite. Instead they made us wait for someone to come and fix it and if it couldn't be repaired than they would let us move. We had to wait over 2 hours. Second, there was putty wherever there were pipes leading into the walls in the bathroom. They really couldn't just change the wall paper as well? Oh and don't spend the extra money for a strip view, it is horrible! We've even had a strip view suite at TheHotel and even though it's at the other end of the strip close to the airport, we had a much better view there than we had at the Venetian. Too much construction going on!

Check-in service...3 stars
She seemed to be a bit robotic. Her customer service wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.

Bell service and Valet...5 stars
Everyone was extremely friendly.  Our luggage came to our room quickly when we arrived and bell service arrived quickly to pick up our luggage when we were checking out.

Dealers, Cocktail Waitresses, Pit Bosses...5 stars
Mandalay Bay has got nothing on Venetian when it comes to customer service in the casino area.  All the dealers and pit bosses were so friendly! Cocktail waitresses constantly came around and asked you more personally if you would like anything to drink.  The Casino itself was way more smokey than a lot of the other hotels, they should consider better  ventilation.  

So assuming you haven't stayed anywhere newer or bigger you may find this hotel to be extravagant, but being a regular to Las Vegas and having the opportunity to stay elsewhere, well...I'm having a difficult time giving this place 5 stars.

The only reason I would stay here is because of the Grand Canal Shoppes, The Shoppes at the Palazzo and the friendly atmosphere in the casino.",1,2,0

The front desk also prints boarding passes for flights which was very helpful at checkout. Another plus is that they have security checking for room keys as you head to your room. 

We did have some dislikes which led to the 4 stars. The elevators to the rooms are tucked into the hotel so you have a bit of a walk to your room. When we first arrived, we did have some dirty sheets that housekeeping changed promptly. $35 resort fee is a bit much for decent wifi and access to the pool.

Venetian is a slot machine player's paradise.  They usually have tons of entertaining penny slots that whoop and jingle and get you excited even though you aren't even making your original bet back.  But that is the evolution of slots today...making it feel like you are winning even though you are losing.  There is a separate non-smoking slot room for those who want to minimize their second hand smoke exposure.  The High Limits slot area is a bit outdated and sparse in offerings.  If you are male and here alone, you will most likely be propositioned by a lady of the night.  I dunno what it is but they like to roam the area here. You will know because they almost always ask if you are having fun.  Then comes the next question - if you want some company.  Just remember you are really not that good looking and if you answer yes, you will have to pay for it! Ha! Their table games have a nice variety and their Blackjack is as good as odds get on the strip.  Most are shoe games, but there are some double deck hand dealt.  MS Stud is also offered, but it is usually only one table. The real perk of gaming here though is that if you join their Player's Club, they offer slot tournaments with free stay almost every week of the year.  My mailbox gets inundated with these and I have yet to pay for a stay here.  They usually have all the newer machines before the other casinos. As far as the odds go, they are ok.  Most of the time I break even here and don't lose my shirt.  

Hotel - 4 stars
If you are a claustrophobic, you will love the rooms here.  The amount of space that is afforded as a standard room is huge.  Great restaurants and shopping at the Grand Canal Shops make it almost pointless to leave.  Rooms do show a bit of wear and tear but are not too shabby.",3,3,2

First off, the lobby is just elegant. Something about walking through with my rolling luggage amongst the marble floors and painted archways made me feel like a million bucks. And it just kept getting better. Once in our suite I discovered 2 plush queen size beds each with a beautiful lounge chair at the foot, a sunken living room with an L-shaped couch, desk area AND dining table, and THREE flat screen TVs! One in the living room, one in the bedroom and a bonus one in the bathroom!  The bathroom was the best..with 6 ladies having to doll up each night to go out, we could all do our hair\/make-up comfortably without having to sit on eachothers laps or rub elbows! The bathroom has a separate sink area (2 sinks), vanity area (with seat), toilet room, glass shower stall, and deep tub. Oh and ofcourse, double doors leading to a full length mirror, marble floors and excellent lighting. It was every girl's dream. 

We were able to try out the Spa and at $150 for a one hour massage, you get an experience you wish could last forever. I work hard for my money so once in a while I like to get a little (ok a lot!) pampered. The fluffy white robes, the attentive spa attendants, the complimentary juice and fruits, the soothing voice of the masseuse, the MASSAGE itself...all left me with a huge perma-smile for the rest of the day.  I cannot wait to go back! 

Other great perks at the Venetian besides the beauty and central location - home of Tao Restaurant and Nightclub (my favorite vegas nightspot!), lots of high end shopping and adjacent to the new Palazzo Hotel, a foodcourt if you need something quick or if on a budget, and ofcourse...the GELATO in the middle of the shopping area is something you cannot miss!

Our room had two pillow top queen size bed with the most comfortable sheets, I want to say its Egyptian cotton. Two flat screen TV, not including the one in the bathroom, there's one in the living room and one in the sleeping area. The living space have a dining table, private work area with telephone and printer copier, but also a L-shaped sofa that have a pull out bed. Cool thing about the room was that there was a remote control that open the shades and close them. The bathroom is huge, its like 1\/3 of the size of the room and it have a standup shower and a roman tub for soaking... it was very spacious with an area for the ladies to sit and put on their makeup. My husband thought it was cool that there was a phone in the bathroom (Like Joey from Friends)... 
The pool was nice too, it wasn't crowded like other pools I have been to. They only allow hotel guest and there wasn't many kids.

Pros:
- Liked the size of room. 
- The room was clean
- I left my laptop out, rayban sunglasses and some casino chips out that weren't stolen while room was cleaned!
- Got to check in early because they had room available(not a good view, but I didn't care)
- Grand Lux cafe makes all their food perfectly. (like the one in Chicago, but Chicago is better)
-Drink ladies are pretty quick in the poker room, but slow on casino floor

Cons:
- Biggest con was they over billed me. You get an itemized bill that shows a different way of showing totals than I've ever seen before. Very confusing to the point most people would just accept it as opposed to crunching the numbers. 2 phone calls on morning of check out didn't correct it. Email to them didn't still hasn't gotten a response back now 36 hours later. I received attitude from the front desk lady. I went over the bill with her 3 times in which she would cut me off while explaining. There was even one point she did her funny math and said ""it looks like we didn't charge you all your resort fees so I can add the correct resort fee and to the bill."" I Finally asked to speak with the manager. I had to go over the bill 3 times with him before he refunded the correct amount. I had to ask him if he thought I would ever stay here again after having to argue and explain over and over on the overcharge in which his reply was, ""it happens all the time, and it happened at the Wynn when he worked there too"" I beg to differ since the last 3 times while in Vegas I stayed at the Wynn and had no trouble at all. At the end of the day the itemized bill made it look like I was overcharged by $300, but was really $50(in which I showed him). Way to stressful of a situation to end a trip on. Imagine crunching your numbers and then having to argue them 9 times like i did! I can't believe a guest who wants to vacation at your place should have to argue to fix your problems. 
- Room keys hardly worked. The last night with food in hand I couldn't get into the room and had to wait for security to let me in. I asked them to bring me up some room keys that would work in which they said they would, but never did. 
- Card room. Dealer\/Manager mucked my hand while it was in play and cost me $$$. Called for review of hand via camera(common during discrepancies) in which it got resolved, but not before the dealer\/manager lied about how the hand transpired. Thank you to the other players for calling the liar out. Most of the other dealers were good and friendly though
- They don't take cashiers checks. Not sure the reasoning was, but it sucks when you want to gamble, but can't. Weird thing is they said they would cash it with casino credit?

Overall they left me with a sour taste in my mouth. If the Venetian is reading this, please don't send me one of your shallow cookie cutter responses about how I liked the pros and telling me to email you about hearing more about my check out issues. I'm exhausted from explaining and 10 times is too many! I can't believe a multi-billion dollar business that makes money offering guest experiences, can fail so miserably.",11,0,2

When we finally reached there by 9am, they allowed us to check in early which was nice. We requested for a room next to our room for our friends coming the next day and also a crib for their 1 year old kid. They said they would try and refused for the crib but ensured it would be available the next day for them to use which was alright. She asked us if we would like to upgrade our room for $45\/night to the 19th floor and we refused. When we went to the room, we had a terrible view of our 5th floor room. It was the back side of the building overlooking all generator units and terraces of building. We went back to the reception and requested for a room on the other side. She told us we can get an upgrade for $45\/night and move to the 19th floor. We explained to them we DON'T want to move up to see the view of the strip but merely just the front of the building. They said that itself is the view to the strip, so we cannot. We were disappointed but agreed. Next day our friends came around 9am too but they did not let them check in early, neither did they have the room ready for them at the check-in time. They said they would call them by 2pm to let us know the status of the room. They did not mind since our room was available so it was okay to wait. We went out for lunch and waited till 4pm for their call. Finally at 5:30pm when we reached the hotel and they asked about the room, it STILL wasn't ready. The receptionist was VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and rude blaming everything on our friends for coming early and for requesting a room next to ours and hence the delay which was all BS. After arguing for 15 minutes which wasn't required by the receptionist, the manager came and she was ALSO RUDE just one level down. She finally gave them a room on the 6th floor and the only concession they made is they allowed them a late 6pm check out which was good for us since our flights were later in the night and we had to check out of our room at 11am so we could use their room until 6pm and then leave for the airport. Finally after all the issues, we went to their room on the 6th floor and lo and behold.... they have a view NOT OF THE STRIP but the resort pool which is basically the other side of the building. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD REQUESTED but the rude receptionist said that's the view of the strip and it will cost us $45\/night. LIARS.

The suites are HUGE, more than enough for 2 people. I feel like they could house 4-6 people (5 if you have a suite w\/ a king bed, sofa sleeper & someone brings a sleeping bag; 6 if you have 2 queen beds, sofa sleeper & a sleeping bag). 2 LCD TVs, 1 in the sunken living room and 1 by the bed(s). There's also another TV in the bathroom, which is nice to have something to listen to when you're pooping or watch when you're getting ready to start your day. The bathroom has a bathtub and separate shower, 2 sinks, vanity area. Overall, plenty of room for a group of people to get ready for a night out on the town.

The downside to the suites is that it's quite a journey to get to them, especially if you're staying the Venezia Tower. Feels like you're going through a labyrinth. It may help you sober up or it may feel like the walk of shame back to the hotel room is just a whole lot longer.

The location is great; walking distance to most places that are centrally located on the Strip (Palazzo, Rockhouse, Mirage, Treasure Island, Caesar's Palace, Fashion Show Mall, Wynn\/Encore, Bellagio) so some of the nightclubs aren't too far away (JET, Christian Audigier, PURE, XS, Tryst, Blush, The Bank, etc.) But even then, you still have Tao inside the Venetian and Lavo at the Palazzo if you don't feel like leaving the hotel.

As for the nightlife, Tao is great if you've never been out clubbing in Vegas before, as it was my first Vegas nightclub experience. But I feel like it isn't as great as it once was when it first opened or maybe it's because I've been to other clubs on the Strip. If you're willing to try it out, you might want to sign up to receive e-mails from the Venetian about promotions they might have. They sometimes have complimentary admission for 2 people to Tao. Another option they have is the V-Bar. 

I'm taking a star away for the dining options that are seemingly cafeteria-style in comparison. Not something I would expect from a hotel like the Venetian. 

It's true that for how much money you spend, you're only in your room to sleep and get ready throughout the day and before going out at night. But it's also not bad if you wanna shell out the money and live it up for a weekend when you're in Vegas.",1,1,0

Overall, I was satisfied but I don't know that I'd stay here again. My biggest complaint was really a complaint about Vegas itself: the smoking. Everywhere the smoking! Any time I walked through the casino, the shopping mall, or really any public area except the gym it stunk like smoke. Plus, they pipe in some sort of perfume (lavender maybe?) to try to cover it up, but it just ends up smelling like lavender-y stink. Gross.

The actual room was nice. We requested two queen beds, but when we checked in that wasn't available (?) so they upgraded us to a suite with one king bed instead. The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was gigantic. There was a living room area with an L-shaped couch and TV, which was nice. However, the couch was some weird mustard-colored crushed velvet material and seemed really old (there were several visibly worn spots where people had sit, these were the spots right in front of the TV). Our windows faced the pool, and so they were heavily tinted- I don't know if all the rooms are like this or just the pool-facing ones. The tinting meant the room always seemed dark and I could never tell if it was sunny outside or not. We got hit with minibar charges at check-out even though we opened nothing, because we picked up a few items to look for prices (none were listed- bad sign!). Apparently everything is on a sensor and if you touch it\/move it they will try to charge you. We explained the situation and they took the charges off our bill, but still. Shady, Venetian.

We had a problem with the electrical outlets in the bathroom and on one side of the bed not working. We called the front desk to let them know, but nobody ever came to fix it. We did find the reset button for the bathroom outlets, but we were never able to fix the bedside outlet (so I had to charge my phone across the room). Although they never sent someone to fix the electrical problems when requested, they DID send someone to fix the TV when it wasn't broken. 

This was very odd, a guy showed up and said he was there to look at the TV. I told him there was nothing wrong with it, and he asked if he could come in anyway to take a look. I said no, because I'm a girl alone in a hotel room and I'm not letting some strange dude in, especially when he says he's there to address a request I never made. The whole thing seemed weird, although I did see him around a few more times so I'm pretty sure he did actually work there. It just gave me a weird vibe. 

I was in and out of the room a lot, and frustratingly had issues with housekeeping coming. One day, one of the housekeepers knocked on my door just as I was leaving, so I said ""oh, I'm just heading to lunch, perfect timing. I'm going to grab my bag and I'll go."" She said okay, but I'm not sure if she understood me\/understood English, because I left and purposely lingered over lunch, staying out of the room for over 2 hours to give them plenty of time. When I got back, still no housekeeping. They had finished our hallway and never came back. We called the front desk that evening to request fresh towels, and when we mentioned housekeeping never came the guy was like ""we suggest not putting the do not disturb sign on your door if you want your room cleaned."" Really dude? 

I was also frustrated with the pool: I went three days, and everything was fine until the last day. I had to move four different times to get away from people smoking cigarettes\/cigars. I realize we're outside, but when you're lying in one place for long periods of time you really get a lungful. I did finally manage to find a smoke-free spot in one of the back rows around the pool, which is fine, I didn't need to be near the water. But there's a grate that runs around the edge of the pool deck and it stunk like sewer, so at that point I just left the pool. I was so frustrated. Be warned that between the smoke and the sewer, the pool at the Venetian can be a very fragrant experience.

The location on the strip is great, and there are a lot of great dining options in the hotel. There was a National Geographic ""50 Greatest Photographs"" exhibit in the lobby during my stay (you had to pay admission though) and it was very cool. The decor is very pretty. There are a lot of good shopping options for all budgets in the shops. The gym is nice and has lots of machines (although it was weirdly very hot, even though the rest of the hotel is on AC-overload). The staff were friendly and helpful for the most part.",1,1,0

July 2009 Vegas trip for Blink 182 I booked the best hotel suite my money could afford . I didn't realize I was going to be trying all the amenities the room has to offer. 

*Couch, so comfortable for someone who must sit up for 5 hours and can't sleep. I adored you. 
*Automatic curtains, when I forgot the sun does rise even when you have not slept, you were right at my hand to save me from the desert sky. 
*Shower, thank you for being so large and warm. It did not help my pain but you were lovely the two times I used you in a 5 hour period. 
*Tub, you made me feel like a kid again - just not any better (note I always wipe out my shower's with my own Lysol wipes and they were both clean) 
*King comfy bed, you my friend are a doll. I loved sleeping in you! 

I didn't venture out to the hotel much, but the cafe was wonderful and the staff was always friendly to the party of 1. 
Walgreen's being attached is a plus for many reasons-I will go down saying, this is one of Vegas' silly little attractions go in at 3am it's awesome!

It's a widely-accepted standard for hotels (esp. those ""nice"" ones) to offer free wi-fi and fitness center access.

It's an Italian themed hotel with lots of Marble and has a canal running through the shops. You can rent a Gondola ($75&up\/person) and the person navigating the boat sings in Italian. 

The reason that this hotel gets three stars: 
Rooms-Incredibly spacious (650sq ft) with a sunken, attached living room w\/sectional couch. You get a king bed w\/great linens and a spacious bathroom with TV bath and separate tub & shower. Rooms are clean and class-fully dressed with automated curtains w\/remote control. Essentials included are typical shampoo, body wash and conditioner, Que tips, shower cap, sewing kit and cotton swabs. There is also a safe available in the closet. A real negative is the lack of a coffee maker in the room forcing you to go in search of $8 coffee in or around the casino. They also have a weighted tray with various drinks and snacks on it. BEWARE - Their is no price list for any of it but if you LIFT anything off to even look at it, it will get billed to your room. You can have the charge reversed if you catch it. 

Access- room access is another big negative. After check in you must navigate successfully through several hallways and the casino to find the elevators which are tucked away and hard to find. We often joked that it would take 30 minutes to get to the strip from our room. Casinos being a confusing labyrinth to keep people in them lent to difficulty in finding our way back time after time. Three days in and we finally started to get the hang of it from the two doors.

WIFI - is very weak and undependable. At least it was on the 27th floor for us and another couple staying with us.

Pools - We two different locations with a total of five pools and four hot tubs. Area one was on the fourth floor of the Venetian Tower. It had one kiddy pool, two full sized adult pools and two hot tubs in a very large area. Towels were readily available and you had the option to rent a cabana style shelter with ceiling fan, TV and private seating in and outside of it for a fee($300\/day) We didn't stay as it was quite busy at this location and so we went to the Velezia tower pool on the 10th floor. It is easily accessible although you don't want to be running around in just your bathing suit as you pass a restaurant and it can get cold with the A\/C. The other location has two smaller pools side by side in a beautifully decorated Greek style garden adorned with lots of tile and marble. One of the pools has a colder temperature and the other is warm - about 90 degrees. The hot tubs are side by side, although I didn't bother to use them in 100+ temperatures. No cabanas were available but servers from the restaurant nearby came around to take orders for food or drink. 

Shopping\/Mall Entertainment - The Canal is the large draw of this hotel for mall entertainment but it doesn't touch TI Sirens, the Atlantis in Ceasars or the volcano. The charge was too much to justify a 15 minute trip up a busy mall with people gawking and taking pictures of your ""romantic"" ride. As a mall, it is comparable to other malls on the strip although more on a higher end scale. 

In closing, it was a great experience for our first time at this hotel but due to the constant inconvenience of getting to our rooms, as well as(I like my morning brew) a lack of a coffee maker(I like my morning brew) I would not likely stay again. If you are looking for a really nice room and don't care for a cup of java, then give it a try!",3,1,2

I'm confused on how they missed those items.

During the stay housekeeping knocked on the door at 7AM and immediately entered without announcing themselves or waiting for a reply. Then did it again at 8 despite me saying we don't need them as we were sleeping in. The last day of my 4 day stay they didn't even knock!! They just walked in!

We specifically stayed at the plazzio side of the hotel. The room was not as nice as when I previously stayed at the Venetian. With both hotels the room layout is the same. There is a small closet, nicely appointed bathroom with cool double doors, and a sunken  living room. The room was a good 15-20 min walk from most all of the eating spots including Bouchon. You spend nearly an hour just walking from one side of the resort to the other. The gaming side is also on the other side of the resort, essentially everything is on the other side of the resort. This is accurate and annoying of both hotels there is no fridge in the room, there is one for their mini bar but of course everything is on weight sensors don't dare breathe on the can of coke or you will be charged. I made the mistake of bringing some cut fruit and veggies for healthy snacks. Post arrival, to keep everything cold I ended up taking the removable trash can liner filling it with ice and putting my fruit within to keep it fresh. Even with all this effort, I ended up tossing about half of it because it started to rot... Sad times.... This was the icing on the cake came at checkout with a 13 dollar charge for a 2 min phone call to California. We are paying 30 dollars a day in resort fees, and I am charged 13 dollars for a 2 min phone call. I had to use the phone because the hotel has NO cell signal.

-The doors slam.  This is very bad in Vegas.  Whether you sleep at 4 AM or 4 PM, you will be constantly awakened by loudly slamming doors.  It is so loud that it rattles fixtures inside your suite.

-They charge you for using the gym.  It is $40 for the day, and there is no option to just buy a 1-hour pass.  Who has time to use the gym for the entire day?

-Wifi is extra.  I'm maddened by the fact that the more expensive a hotel gets, the more they charge you for stuff that's free at the Comfort Inn.

-Crossmarketing is ubiquitous.  The elevators are stuck on a constant loop of ""Big Girls Don't Cry,"" and then you're assaulted with the soundrack from the Phantom of the Opera upon exiting the elevator.

The upsides of the Venetian are Bouchon, it's central location on the Strip, and Barney's New York.  The prostitutes found lingering around the Venetian are much hotter than those around MGM.

Overall, this hotel, like much of Vegas, has a surface feel of elegance, but that patina is very thin.  The sheets and beds suck.  They still use those disgusting bedcoverings instead of duvets.  The towels look fancy but are thin and the same quality as the Comfort Inn.",1,1,1

We were automatically upgraded to a Hospitality Suite - free of charge. We really didn't know what that entailed, but we went along for the ride. 

The Hospitality Suite is approximately 3000 sq. ft., that's bigger than my apartment! It looked like a condo or a small house. There was a bar area, a living room, a dining room, a bedroom with a king size bed, two bathrooms; one with a jacuzzi tub and stand up shower adjacent, a flat screen and a phone inside the toilet room. i counted 4 flat screen TVs inside...sure made me feel like I was at some sports bar but without the douchebags or sports. 

The one thing I HATED the most was the tall mirror by the main door. Talk about MAJOR insecurities. This mirror wasn't the least bit flattering - whatsoever. It was slightly curved and made me look short and stumpy. And short and stumpy I am NOT! It was like looking into a fun house mirror at a carnival. It didn't seem to matter that all the other mirrors were fine and made me look normal -- but once I walked out to the front mirror, I looked like an Oompa Loompa. Fix that, Venetian!

Anyway, the room looked pretty pimp that is until we caught a whiff of sewage water. We traced it back to the master bathroom, which was a complete FAIL. We called front desk and asked to be relocated, and we were. 

Our second room was the same layout but slightly smaller in size. Just as we unloaded our luggage and uncorked our wine, a strong scent overwhelmed us. We walked to investigate the familiar SKUNK scent only to walk right into a cloud of marijuana smoke from the room next door. I made the mistake of opening the neighboring door only to be hit with a major contact high. 

I don't know about YOU guys, but I like my hotel rooms to smell of LYSOL or some sort of cleaning product. I like CLEAN. Not rancid poop water or the Chronic. It's all about the atmosphere and if your sensual atmosphere is shot to hell by scents that make you cringe and cover your nose, then you are NOT in a comfortable and relaxing state of mind. 

I did get a bit cranky and urged my BF to call front desk once again, which he did. We didn't really want to kill our neighbor's good time, so we just sucked it up and stayed put. I mean, we ARE in Vegas and people like to PARRR-TAY. Who am I to play Sgt. Party Pooper? 

The Venetian is just like any of the other high-end hotels in Vegas. Loud casino below, stores galore, dance clubs and bars and five-star restaurants. Try Delmonico's Steak House -- pretty spectacular. They have a Starbucks inside, if you fancy a cup of crappy java. They also have a cafe with fresh baked goods! 

I am not much of a gambler, so the only thing for me to do s to observe, drink, eat and sleep. The Venetian is a pretty hotel with a lot of ground to cover. Perhaps the next time I am in Vegas, I will feel adventurous and roam around to see what else this hotel has to offer...in the meantime, I will save all my lodging for the Monte Carlo.",11,12,12

I just had to throw that out there as there isn't a sign. To be clear, it is definitely a five star hotel. I would stay here again in a heartbeat as the suite is amazing, the bathroom more than enormous and every staff member we encountered treated us like royalty. Numerous restaurants from food court to five star and great shopping on the high end. Hello, Michael Kors clearance. So why just four stars? For one, the lack of a sign on the top of the TV credenza about the refreshments. There is one on the fridge itself within the credenza but human nature might cause one to pick up the water on the top of it, even if just to take a look. Luckily, we didn't. Also, due to the design of the shower, it's really, really difficult to shave your legs. Near impossible. So I took a bath and that was equally as hard to do. And the toilet paper quality was kind of low. Not even Charmin standard.  We had better on our drive to Vegas at a La Quinta and Comfort Inn. Ah, the things you notice while on vacation. But, but, but, it's an outstanding property and an amazing hotel suite. If you're going for the first time, review the hotel website and get familiar with the property because it really is the size of a city. Fantastic place and we hope to go back in a few years after some football team is playing there. I will not say which team as I can't stand them! Opposite football team marriage. But the residents of Vegas seemed really happy to be getting them.

The quality of the entry level suite(Venetian only has suites) was perfect for our group of 3 as it was spacious, clean, and elegant. Beautiful paintings on the wall, neat decor, and a nice bathroom with a glass shower and bathtub. If you happen to get a suite with two queen beds, you can comfortably have 6 people in a room as the sofa does have a pull out bed. 

Aside from the excellent rooms, another reason to stay here is that the Venetian is located near the middle of the strip, so walking to other casinos\/hotels is fairly convenient, especially not having to take out your car to drive into traffic on Las Vegas Blvd.

Also, let's not forget to mention the TAO Beach pool party here along with the acclaimed Bouchon restaurant that make this place worth staying at. Obviously, the rates here are going to be expensive as it is a 5 star hotel, but if you book ahead, good rates can be had.

I'm not a gambler, only my friends are, so I can't comment on the quality of the casino, but walking through it and hanging out with my friends, I did notice one thing that set it apart from the other casinos:  it did not reek of cigarettes.  A few other casinos were pretty bad when it came to that, but I was able to breathe comfortably at the Venetian.

The rooms were amazing.  They are all suites, and even the smallest choice is still pretty big.  There were a few things that could be fixed, like the dim lighting and bad wi-fi connection, but I didn't stay in the rooms long enough for it to become an annoyance. I do wish that the towels and robes were a little bit more plush, but then again, it's a small thing compared to the overall greatness of this place.

I called guest services in the afternoon on the day we were first supposed to check in to explain the situation and ask if there was anything we could do. The man I spoke to first was wonderful and said that he could pull our reservation and we could use it at another time as long as we used it before the promotion we could use to get the third night free was over. I was shocked to receive an email from the Venetian several days later saying we had forfeited our deposit (which was the entire cost of the stay ). I immediately called yesterday's to find out what had happened. The guest services member I spoke to this time said that the only way that we could rebook and not lose all our money was to book on the spot and pay again and at some point in the future receive our original money back. When I explained that I didn't have the money for another weekend at the moment he said there was nothing he could do and we would be losing our money. I understand that policy is policy. Had I been told the same thing the first time I would have understood and tried to find someone else to take the weekend so that at least someone could have enjoyed the hotel we had already paid for.

(avoid that room) it smells like sewage. my husband checked in our family next to us. he came in and said it smelled and we needed to get out of there right away and not inhale that. IT WAS REALLY BAD. I vomited in the hallway tried to hold it in my mouth to not dirty their carpet. so embarrassing. I go vomit all over me and had to face his family like that. I called the front desk.. no apology. just ok so you want to move your room? yes of course. they tried to send us 5 floors down. we wanted to stay near our family. the front desk manager said they would call us on my cell when the room on the floor was ready. I cleaned up real quick. we went downstairs to stay nearby. after 4 hours of waiting no phone call. we went to front desk we had reservations at 6 so we needed our room. again no apology. we got our room. the next room was clean. 
then when we got home.. I noticed not only did I already pay 2 weeks  in advance for the room reservations but they charged my account $ 128 per room and still had $ 284 on hold. I was told they were waiving the resort fee. an extra $ 540.00 I then had to spend time on hold to reach a manager to clear this up the next day. for $ 540 extra plus the $ 457.50 for the 2 rooms that's $ 997 I could have used to stay in Italy. 

I will say though the little Italian Restaurant Trattoria Reggata was great. the food was awesome. the managers however can tone it down a little with yelling at the staff in front of all the dining guests. 

the beds are awesome!!!

Stayed here with 4 of my friends and managed to sleep\/live comfortably in 1 room for 2 nights this past June.

Love this hotel! I stayed in about a few hotels on the Vegas Strip and this is the best hotel I've ever stayed at...so far!

ROOM-
The room that we had was just the basic room but definitely not basic to me. It had 2 double beds and a sofa sleeper on the sunken living area. 2 flat screen\/LCD TVs, a hallway mirror\/skinny table that can be a vanity, desk table with chair and the bathroom is a just amazing!!! 

BATHROOM- Bathtub, separate shower with jets, the toilet is another room, two sinks, vanity with a chair, lots of eletrical plugs to cater to me & my girlfriends when were getting ready to get our club on! LOL

We were on one of the top floors and our view looking down was the pool...really nice.

I like that this hotel has shops, has 2 Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf coffee shop, nice restaurants & food court (yummy Nathan's Hotdog), huge casino (where I won the most but not a lot!!) & connected to Palazzo.

My Dislikes:

Oh yea, TAO nightclub is located here (ugh, i'll review this one too. tip: not too great)

The room is sooooooooo far from civilization. I.E. front desk, shops, restaurants...you get the gist of it, I hope. So basically, when you are ready to hit the strip, shops, club...make sure you don't forget anything. It's just an adventure going back to your room.

There are 3 TVs, one in the living room area, one in front of the two beds and a small one in the bathroom. The bathroom has two sinks, a separate tub and stall, and a private room for the toilet. 

The hotel gym is nicer than the 24 hour fitness that I go to. It includes a rock climbing wall which is $25 if you want to use it. There's a spa which is $300 for 80 minutes.

(Im bias cuz i love chocolate.) But there is also Gelato in St. Marks Square that is good.

The stores weren't my thing, but there is a magic shoppe, the typical vegas shoppe and TENO (which is cheaper but luxurious jewerly) Also the Dumb boys store is funny. 
Tao is hella trendy to find celebrities. I saw Vin disel there. And V bar. Wayne Brady was there. Actually his show his at the Venetian and worth it. Also there is Blueman, which is different... and Phantom of The Opera. (Which is good but not my thing) also there's Madame Tussauds which seems freaky, but have some drinks and imagination because that place was fun. 
Oh and the gambling! I lost. But i don't do vegas for the gambling. 
One last thing~ the Canyon Ranch Spa is the coolest place to go. The massages are pricey but, i didn't feel like i got ripped off either. THe place is huge, and it even has a rock climbing wall (which i'll do next time!)",1,1,1

Come to find out he was just trying to sell us show tickets and wasted an hour of our time. Once he realized we weren't  buying any show tickets, he told us where we could buy them. He also told us my daughter  was too young to ride, she is 2.5. Once we got outside, they said she could and we couldve bought the tickets out there in the 1st place. So we get on and the ride was nice, too short though. Same price as 1 of the pictures they try to sell you at the end.

As any bride or maid of honor can attest, it's incredibly difficult to organize and collect payment from multiple people for a group stay. The Venetian did not make it any easier; in fact, their latent charges, poor communication, and failure to compensate me for their error, turned a hassle into a nightmare. I even tried to talk through the charges with Venetian's Guest Services rep, Beverly Borromeo, but she declined to help and knowingly left me dissatisfied and disgruntled.

If you're going to Vegas, especially for a group party- bachelor, bachelorette, birthday, etc.- I do not recommend the Venetian\/Palazzo group hotels. Go somewhere that will appreciate your business and endeavor to make your stay as easy as possible; I suggest the Cosmopolitan.",14,3,1

Nothing prepared us for the scale of the hotels, including the Venetian.  This is rococo to the hilt.  The hotel is impressive but the floral smell assaults you as soon as you enter.  As someone with a very sensitive nose (I have sinusitis), I could barely breathe.
We got a great great deal on our room (bella suite for $199\/nt incl taxes).  However, while waiting in line to check in we decided to ask if they had the rialto available or even concierge level suites.  Well that was like opening pandora's box.  The check in clerk was very friendly but went to great lengths to point out that the Palazzo had the same size suite available at the concierge level for $100 extra.  When asked what this would give us - breakfast, snacks in the afternoons, hors d'oevres in the evening, dessert at night, discounts to the casinos and restaurants, and free access to the health club.  Well, turns out that with our existing deal we were getting all that but the food.    So glad that we didn't fall for the song and dance since the food court is so accessible.
Anyway, the room was gorgeous.  we LOVED it.  housekeeping was awesome. The pools were so much fun; our kids said that it was just like going to Hawaii only better.  Bouchon is a dream restaurant. The food was so good, I almost cried.  Also went to B&B, Mario Batalli's restaurant.  Ambience was good, food so-so.

Firstly, the lobby is beautiful with the high ceilings with beautiful Grecian styled paintings. The front desk attendants were all very kind and patient. They even gave us an upgrade. We got a room with a view of the pools! After walking through the casino to get to the room towers (which wasn't too far nor was it difficult to navigate), we headed up to our magnificent room.
It was spacious, clean, and so gorgeous. I really like the theme of the Venetian, makes you feel like royalty! The bathroom is the first door when you walk in and it was huge. Separate shower and bath. Great vanity space which also had a light up desk mirror in addition to the double sink. 

The room itself was also very spacious. Giant king bed that was so comfortable. With extra living space with sofa with a pull out bed. The two T.Vs were on the smaller side but we didn't spend much time in our rooms lounging so they weren't a huge issue. The mini bar was expensive but there were multiple Walgreen's close by so we didn't purchase anything from it!

The service was impeccable. We didn't have the room cleaned everyday but when we needed it to be cleaned, we would call down and leave the room for an hour or two for a meal and it would be quickly cleaned by the time we were back. 

The pools are also really big and lots of chairs available. There's little to no kids and there's even an adults only pool! 

The food options are pretty decent. There's a couple of late night spots opened as well. Most of the time we wandered off the strip to try new things but there is definitely a variety available in the Venetian.

The rooms are top notch at decent rates (and getting better all the time!)  With 2 queen beds and a sofa bed, you can comfortably fit 5 people to a room.  Yes you all actually have a bed to sleep on!  No  Also you get three LCD TVs (granted one is a tiny one in the bathroom but still).  It almost makes you want to stay in the hotel.....almost.

The Venetian Casino and I have a very rocky love-hate relationship going on.  Currently, it's on the rocks, but who am I kidding, I'll be back at the blackjack tables sometime soon.  Unlike other casinos *cough* Mirage *cough*, the dealers are social and genial so that it isn't as depressing when you lose hand after hand.

It wasn't even a tight squeeze.  

Another great thing about the Venetian is the fact that TAO is right inside of it.  Now, I normally hate TAO.  In fact, I've written a pretty bad review about how overrated it is.  However, when you're actually staying in the hotel, it's a super convenient place to after-party.  Also, if you're a girl, at some point throughout your stay at The Venetian, a promoter will surely walk up to your group and hand you VIP passes to get in for free.

So...something I have to mention:
In light of Chinese New Year, they put up some fancy decorations in the hotel lobby.  Among these fancy decorations were rows and rows of orange (tangerine?) trees - I guess they're for good luck or something like that.  Towards the end of the night, as we were walking to TAO, my friend suddenly shoved a segment of orange into my mouth.  When I turned to look at her, I saw that she had a few more mini oranges stuffed into her bra.

Came here for my Bachelorette weekend 4 of us stayed in a suite.

It wasn't until the next day Saturday that one of my bridesmaid notice her charger and beats headphones was missing. She called hotel security they took a report from her and that was it. The next day Sunday my maid of honor received a call from her credit card company telling her they notice fraud activities.  They told her over $600 was swiped at different stores. She had 3 cards with her and one card she left in her bag in the room and that card went missing Friday room service came in our room stole her card and went on a fucking shopping spree. We called the cops and called hotel security again they did absolutely nothing this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel this hotel ruined what was supposed to be a fun great weekend.

The Venetian is bigger than the Palazzo next door. I love gambling here late at night. Lol, thus the winning. They have gondola rides, several hot restaurants and awesome places to go shopping too.

i can see myself just staying in the venetian and not having to step foot outside all weekend! in fact, i think we did that on friday and half of saturday: we had dinner at grand lux, clubbed at tao, ate at noodle asia, bought yummy treats from bouchon bakery, worked out and relaxed at the canyon ranch spa, and shopped at the canal shops.

we enjoyed our stay except for one thing -- the really strong floral scent that accosted us on the main level of the hotel. luckily that scent didn't pervade the guest rooms.

While many of the newer hotels on the strip might have stolen the spotlight for this once highly popular luxury resort, the Venetian remained one of my preferred places to stay.

All of their suites are spacious with excellent floor plans. The separate sunken living room has large sofa and a decent size dining table are great for having friends over. Be careful with the stairs though. The wooden floor could be slippery. 

Rooms were in overall pretty good condition. Decor was slightly dated but amenities were well maintained. Ladies will love their bathrooms. The vanity table with the lighted makeup mirror really came in handy. You will have everything you need to look pretty.

The casino and lobby area were always busy with the main aisles crowded with  guests dragging their luggage around . Use the Venezia tower elevators if you could. It might be a slightly longer walk but you can bypass many of the traffic.

We came here for my best friend's bachelorette. Both my bestie's sister, myself and another bridesmaid came in early to take care of the rooms and decorate for our bride. 

The check-in was HELL, UNPROFESSIONAL, and pure OBNOXIOUS. Shirley, greeted us with a smile at check-in but that was all she was gonna give us.

Like chill out.

Then we had issues getting both rooms, because although the bride's sister payed with her credit card she put 1 room in the bride's name and the other in her sisters. We then had to call Hotels.com to change the reservation, but Venetians system was slow to update... then we find out there is a $10 charge for connecting rooms and she rubbed it in our faces how she was doing us a favor to comp the $10.

She put us in the Venezia Tower which is in the boondocks of the hotel. Very chic but not good when you are walking in heels.

I am a local and we decided to take advantage of the summer discounted rates and finally check out the rooms. Still not cheap by any means, but as God is my witness ... Worth. Every. Penny.  I have stayed at the Wynn before, and I think the Venetian has it beat on every level.

I slipped the front desk a $20 and asked if it might be possible to get an upgrade, and he easily accommodated me with a beautiful Strip view suite in the Venezia Tower.

I highly recommend the Venezia Tower for anyone interested in experiencing this hotel.  The Venezia has its own registration desk and it is much less crowded than the main front desk. But the BEST part of the Venezia Tower suites is accessibiity to the tower's private garden and pool area. What an elegant and luxurious pool area.  I spent some time taking pictures out there with my new wide angle lens and had a blast capturing the beautiful statues and greenery. 

Service at this hotel was amazing from start to finish. For example, when it was my turn at the front desk, a smiling young man greeted me in line and escorted me to the next open window. A very classy touch, I thought.

Also, this is the first hotel I have ever stayed in where the temperature inside the room was perfect when I unlocked the door.  No waiting for an hour for the room to cool down, because they cranked the air up to 80 after the last guests left.

Gorgeous view from our suite, beautiful decor, and elegant surroundings at every turn. The Venezia Tower lobby even has beautiful gaslight lamps on the walls ... with LIVE flames! Very cool.

Waiting at Valet on the day of our departure felt a little like the day after Christmas ... Kind of a bummer.  Can't wait to return!",2,0,1

We booked the Bella Suite and the size of the room was perfect. The beds were comfy, the flat screen televisions were nice, and the living room had a full office setup if you needed it (which one of our guests did). I'm a big fan of nicely done bathrooms and this place didn't disappoint (not as good as Aria's though), but I never understood why some of the nicer hotels don't believe in locks for their bathroom doors. My biggest (and only) gripe was navigating through the hotel. We were located in the Venezia tower and we had to take multiple elevators and go down several halls to get to our hotel room (which is not an easy task after a long night of Vegas antics). Also my cousin parked in the garage and that took quite some time to find because of the specific elevators you needed to take to get there. Even the employees gave unclear directions.

The actual hotel was great. There is a large shopping mall attached if that interests you and also tons of restaurants that are actually worth going to if you are looking to splurge a bit. The crowd here is generally a little older than some of the more ""hip hotels"" (which can be both a good and bad thing). I'm not a fan of TAO, but the hotel is located close enough to Wynn\/Encore so it's easy to go there for all your clubbing needs.",1,0,2

This is my 10th time to stay at the Venetian. Let me start this review by saying that I'm not a big fan of Vegas. I come every year for a conference and spend 3-4 days. 

Pros: the customer service is great. People are on their A-game and are all-pro. The rooms are large and comfortable. The bathtubs are AMAZING. 

Cons: everything is far from everything. Long walks. So expensive. Everything from the water to the tables to the food, tips and gift shops is expensive. The check-in lines can be long. The ice dispensers are FAR. No in-room coffee maker. No pre-order breakfast. It's always hot in the lobby, hallways, casino, etc. hot and stuffy. 

Maybe there are VIP or member\/rewards benefits but I haven't found them. It'd be nice to have a way to get a better room and early checkin\/late check out and table incentives and meal discounts, etc. 

I like to think of this place as a giant fake diamond. It's polished and made to look like more than it really is. I've stayed at a few others in Vegas and it's really MOTS.

Not a gambler and not the hugest Vegas fan, but got a good deal, so figured what the hell?  Overall, was reasonably pleased with the room, probably because I got a good deal, but let's talk about what went well and what didn't.

First, the bad.  

I really don't have the hugest of expectations when it comes to customer service.  I figure they're all getting paid about minimum wage and I'm not a high roller, so they couldn't care less, but every now and then, I'm truly stunned.  

So, ordered room service one morning and it was marginal, but what took the cake was that after breakfast, I called to have them remove the dishes.  (Had to since they had set the table in the suite rather than leaving a tray that I could set outside the door)  So, I called and they said they'd send someone right up.  So I wait, and I try to be patient because it's a big hotel.  But I'm waiting and I've got plans, so I'd like to get in the shower and get ready.  After an hour, I call and say what's the deal?  They say they'll send someone right up.  A minute later, they call back and say they couldn't come get the tray because I had the Do Not Disturb sign on my door.  And I say, well, I called for a service.  Clearly I wanted the service.  Could someone not have called me and said something, I'm sitting around waiting and no one's going to show up or tell me why??  To which they respond well, they can't call because there's a Do Not Disturb sign on the door.  Uhm, WTF???  Did you not just call me two seconds ago???  Did you not deliver the breakfast with the sign on the door???  How is that different??  I get that they want to respect the sign, but seriously, the idea that you just don't provide a service I've specifically requested and don't tell me about it and expect me to just magically figure out why, is mind boggling in its absurdity.  The attitude by the room service person was pretty much too bad, your fault, deal with it.  

I complained later at the front desk and got an apology that at least sounded somewhat sincere, but that was about it.  I wasn't looking for freebies, but a call from a manager saying that the issue had been addressed with the responsible staff member would have been nice (and would have been what?  customer service??  Hmmm, novel idea.)  But, that's asking too much.  I know.  What on earth was I thinking??

Oh, as for room service, it's INSANELY overpriced.  Seriously.  I don't mind splurging for the comfort of eating in my room, but this was outrageous.  ($8 for a bowl of oatmeal?  $7 for a small glass of oj?  Are you kidding???)  By the time you add tax, the $4 service charge, and the mandatory 18% gratuity, you EASILY spend $35-40 for a simple meal for one person!!  Insane for food that was mediocre at best.  Oh, and the glass my juice was in was dirty.  So.  Needless to say, there was no more room service for the rest of my stay.

Now, the good.

Location was excellent for walking to other attractions.  The room was nice - not *fabulous*, but perfectly fine for what I spent.   Sure, the sofa was a tad worn, and a couple of the pillowcases had some frayed spots, but I'm sure rooms in Vegas get some hard partying usage, so I could live with that.  The room was an excellent size.  There was a big king size bed with plenty of pillows, flat screened tvs in the living area, sleeping area, and the bathroom (!).  Though the tv was behind the bathtub.  What's the point of having a flat screen tv in a bathroom with a huge soaking tub if the tv doesn't fact the tub??  Silly.  But the bathroom was huge and nicely appointed.  It could have used a more thorough cleaning (there was a layer of dust on the tank cover of the toilet), but for the most part, it was ok and the room as a whole, was ok.

Other than the room service incident, found the staff generally friendly and helpful.  Yes, it was a loooooong walk to everywhere, but that didn't bother me much.  Just wish I'd brought more comfy shoes.  Did notice the scent everyone complains about.  Actually found it kind of pleasant and not overwhelming.  

Now, the excellent.

The Canyon Ranch Spa was A-MA-ZING!!  Seriously, absolutely amazing.  I looooove my spas and this was the best I'd ever been to.  And it's much more affordable to go there then an actual Canyon Ranch Spa (which is about $5,000 for one week!).  I will probably return to Venetian JUST to be able to go to this spa again.  I know you don't have to stay there to go, but there's something really nice about only having to hop in the elevator to get to your room after being all blissed out from your massage.  

So, Venetian folks, thank Canyon Ranch.  They saved your review and because of them, you will probably get my repeat business.",1,2,1

if you need to work, they have a fax, internet hook up and a nice table to spread all your paperwork out. a sunken living room for doing my yoga was cool. another big tv here.  good security as you're always asked to present key card before entering a elevator.

i really like the big window with a view, that way if we feel like nasty exhibitionist we can  just do it by the big window.  yes that was us on the 20th floor.  how's that ole vegas saying go? just bullshitting, OK?

the pools were all heated and not crowded. food is great from the deli to the higher end resturants.  the gym was nice with all the cardio to weight equip you could ask for. plenty of classes to choose from . they have a huge rock climbing wall.  it's about 80+ feet up so you better trust your belayer

the spa was closed for remodeling so i got to go to the Palazzo spa.  a very nice set up with huge sauna, steam, cold ice room=big walk in fridge, huge whirlpool roman bath thing. the nicest treat was this special shower room that you enter and push a button for the desired affect.  i tried all of them, tropical rain to carribean storm.  unreal maze of shower heads, heated lamps with a cool sound system.

I won money ($128 to be exact) during our stay (on Texas Hold'em machines). I don't think this has ever happened to me during all my Vegas trips.

Food options are great. 

We rented a cabana by the pool one of the days, which was definitely worth it if you plan on spending a day by the pool. Gives you your own space, and AC'd space to escape the heat for a few moments. You get your own waitress, and food prices are the same as room service.

Tips:
* Unless you are staying at The Venetian for business or plan on spending a good amount of time in your room, DO NOT splurge for any of the upgraded rooms when you're checking in.  Their basic rooms are swankier than most other casino resort rooms.  When you check-in, they'll bring out a big binder of rooms and lists of amenities, but the upgrades are expensive.  Given that you'll be out and about a lot, you probably won't use all the extras unless you plan your day around returning to your floor for whatever cocktail or hors d'oeuvre reception they're having.

* The rooms are not really suites, in the sense that they're separate rooms.  It's essentially one very large room with a few steps and a divider leading into lower level seating areas with large sectional sofas and a couple of tables.  The bathroom, compared to most of the other casino resorts on the Strip, is nirvana--a soaking tub, shower, toilet closet, and large vanity with two sinks.  It's spacious and beautiful.  The bathroom hospitality amenities are nice.  There's a robe for you to enjoy, but the towels are washed in bleach and feel cheap and scratchy.

* At most hotels, the hospitality bar is inside a cabinet or fridge.  At The Venetian, a few things are out on a pressure sensitive box.  DO NOT even pick anything up to look at it; charges are automatically billed to the room.  Remember the scene at the start of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when Indiana Jones picks up the solid gold idol, then the darts start shooting at him?  Same theory here, except your room bill will get the darts.

* You can ask for a good view, but you probably won't get it unless you're lucky or pay for an upgrade.  So that you're not close to the elevators or looking down at just rooftop, ask for the highest floor available and--if you don't mind walking 100-foot hallways--near the ends of the hallways.

* The casino isn't all that great for gaming.  The casino was in the middle of a major re-set of machines and walkways when we were there.  It'll still be a relatively smaller gaming area compared to other casino resorts.

* The pools are not heated and can seem chilly.  My guess is that they're around 80-82 degrees.  Be ready for a mild shock if you're not used to it.  Otherwise, the main pool is large and had lifeguards when we were there.  Check for pool hours; the main pool closes at 5 or 6pm.  Also, like most other Vegas resorts, the water depth averages a paltry four feet max, so you won't be able to lap swim.  There are a couple of ""adult"" pools that charge a separate admission--adult, meaning a smaller pool with a little more intimacy and topless, loud music and poolside drink service.

* The fast food court on the second level is convenient and has a decent selection of fast food shops.  It's clean, open late, open to the public and offers great food options.  Speaking of food and necessities, there's a large, well-stocked Walgreen's about a 10-minute walk away, reachable through the hotel.  The first floor food court next to the casino had a smaller, expensive mix of fast food restaurants.  If you don't like tobacco smoke, go to the second level food court.

* The Internet connection was fine but a tad spotty.  Don't expect T1 speeds or even DSL speeds.  It's fast, but it's probably not as speedy as what you might have at home.  It's the same unwritten mantra at other casino resorts: they want you downstairs playing the odds in the casino and not updating your Facebook pictures or downloading apps.

* If you're from a place that has tobacco bans in bars and restaurants, prepare yourself and your lungs for non-stop smoke at The Venetian and most other casino resorts.  The only place you usually can't smoke is in your hotel room, and even then you'll swear you smell cigarette smoke.  The family-friendly approach of the 90s and the sex\/VIP approach of the 00s are gone from most casino resorts.  The 10s are all about bringing in gamblers from smoke-happy Asian countries, and they smoke ad nauseum, ad infinitum.  Again, prepare yourself.  

* Make the effort to spend some time in the entrance lobby to snap a few pictures.  They put a lot of effort into making this area look fabulous, and it's sumptuous.  Best time to visit is during the wee hours at night or very early in the morning...if you're up that late or early.",8,0,1

First of all, the property is huge - this isn't your normal Vegas venue.  There is no buffet or coffee shop, and the people here are generally the types that look like they restrict themselves to staying here, the Bellagio, Wynn, Trump, or equally extravagant venue.  With the addition of the Palazzo, this property has tons of restaurants run by famous chefs, great designer shopping (including a Barney's New York!), and the lowest full service restaurant is the Grand Lux Cafe.  The casino is large, the gaming tables in the center of all of the slot machines.  The limits on tables are usually $25 mins on weekends and $15 at other times.  There is a fairly large poker room with mid to high level games going on at all times.

The rooms are huge.  Probably the largest ""normal"" rooms on the strip, they rival the square footage of many studios here in Los Angeles.  They come in arrangements of 1 King size, or 2 Queen size beds, with a lower level that has a pull out sofa-bed, dining table, and desk.  The bathrooms have separate showers and baths, as well as a separated toilet room, and two sinks.  The larger suites have are very spacious and some have amenities such as elliptical machines, guest bathrooms with bidets, large televisions, huge bathrooms, and nice formal living rooms.  It's very easy to just get a normal room here and share with multiple people - 4-6 can sleep very comfortably for the same cost as other establishments.

The negatives I have are kind of derived from the positives.  The place is just too large.  Because of the way the hotel was built, with the original venetian first, then the Venezia, and then the Palazzo, it's a wonder they've been able to layout everyone on the limited amount of land they have.  Aside from the fact that pools are above the mall, and the canals rest above the casino, the various towers and rooms start on totally different floors.  The Venezia tower, for example, has a lobby that is equivalent to the 10th floor of the original Venetian.  Because of this, people get lost very easily, and it takes forever to get from one place to another if you're trying to meet people up.  Also, if you're trying to explain where things are, it gets very confusing to people who don't know their way around the property.  

Size issues aside, the only other quip I have is that because of the old world elegance that the Venetian is emulating, it's not going to have some of the same luxuries as say, the Wynn, or the Trump.  There are no electronic curtains in the rooms.  The beds don't have down comforters.  These are things some people who are paying for a 5 star resort may come to expect.

With the negatives aside, I still really enjoy coming here.  Add that to the fact that it houses two great Broadway shows in the Jersey Boys and Phantom of the Opera and it's hard to miss out whenever I come and stay here.",1,0,0

The suite I stayed in was fairly nice and we didn't have to worry about having more than 4 in a suite large enough for 10. The bathroom was gigantic enough to accommodate a bunch of high maintenance women getting ready at the same time and we had enough space in the other areas to drink and dance before heading out for the evening. The pool area is huge, but you have to be far too proactive to grab a good chair after a long night of drinking. Although it sounds ridiculous, it can be very easy to get lost in the labyrinth of Venetian hallways, but that could of course also be blamed on the booze.",1,1,1

The room (a Rialto suite)  was awesome, even with 5 guys in it. More room than we really needed, but considering we were a group of five guys, we did a lot of pre-party drinking in the room, so it was worth doing it right.

The casino was gorgeous, though a bit expensive for us. Which leads me to why 4 stars not 5. If you are planning on doing the cheap drinking at O'Shea's, Casino Royale, Bill's Gambling Hall, OR plan on seeing the younger crowds at the Cosmopolitan, it is a loooooong walk. Even longer in 105 degree heat. So it's a 5 star rating in a 4 star location on the strip. Still, if I was staying here in the future, I wouldn't complain at all.

While a decent premium over the regular hotels, the luxury, comfort, and class of the Venetian is well worth the price of admission.  Each of their standard rooms is about 75% larger than most other rooms on the Strip, and maybe even twice the size if you include how large the bathrooms are!

When one walks through the Venetian Hotel, you won't smell smoke wafting through the casino air, nor will you see drunken youths meandering around the premises (at least, not for too long).  The Venetian staff is very professional, and every time I've asked for directions or questions about the hotel, they've been able to provide accurate and simple answers.  While I am not a gambler, the tables @ Venetian are well-designed & make you want to dress up just to gamble. The best one can do is look classy while losing money :P

The hotel rooms are great for group trips to Vegas as they can EASILY fit 6-10 people (depending on one's girth, though people will have to sleep on the floor).  Futhermore, the rooms are packed with an assortment of furniture bits that one can easily transform into sleeping device(s).  For example, this past weekend, I moved two ottomans side-by-side and formed a 3\/4th bed for myself to sleep on. Yes, my feet were dangling or positioned upwards, but hey, it was comfortable and I didn't need a mattress! (I was also intoxicated....so that made it alot easier)  The bathrooms are probably the best part of the room as they have separate showers and a huge tub, dual sinks, a 20"" LCD tv, and a separate bathroom stall (so people can stink up just that room, rather than the entire bathroom lol)

As for shopping options, if you are a baller and have plenty of $$$ to blow through, the Venetian has a huge assortment of high-end establishments that a rich mofo could spend to their hearts contents.  An actual lagoon & Italian-inspired gondola allows you to take a romantic sojourn through the clear waters of the Venetian Hotel, which are undoubtedly cleaner and safer than that of actual waters in Italy.

While it doesn't have the views of Bellagio and isn't as chic at the Wynn, you get a well maintained property with a cool theme, gondoliers, and good eats.  Most importantly, every room is a suite - well, not a suite in the sense that there's not a separate wall separating the living room from the bedroom, but you do get a giant bathroom, a nice sized bedroom, and a sunken living room.  Plenty of space to hang out or for your friends\/family to couch surf for the night.  

Although the Venetian's location is on the north end of the strip, and not quite as convenient to everything else as perhaps Caesar's, it's still very easy to get to TI, the Mirage, Harrah's, the Wynn, and the Fashion Show Mall.  And with all the other hotels going to paid parking, the Venetian still has free parking, which is a small but meaningful bonus.",0,0,0

The overall stay was positive and we will continue to stay here when we go to Vegas. The thing that closed the trip was not a positive. We attempted to take the shuttle the hotel contracts, we waited over an hour for the airport shuttle that is supposed to run every 30 minutes (when running during the day). The hotel contracts a shuttle service. This is the start of the saga and issues. First, the area designated to wait is not marked (the uber and taxi areas are well marked). Second, the contract shuttle is not marked noting it is the contracted service for the Venetian. Third, the shuttle did not run every 30 minutes as stated and repeatedly told to us as we stood there. Finally, as well done and professionally run the hotel is, this service (which is a good thing if it works), was very poorly done. It is recognized that we may have just had a one off bad experience, but really it should not have been a possibility. Disappointed in this element of the service.

There's no coffee maker, I was kicking myself for not bringing my travel water heater and french press, since I easily spent 10 bucks a day on coffee.  

The lights were way too dim, there was better lighting in the bed than the bathroom, should have done my makeup there.  There's a hair dryer in the vanity.

- HUGE bathroom with spacious shower, two sinks, makeup station, closet, and tub for our liquor and ice that we bought from Strip Liquor near an All-You-Can-Eat BBQ place off the strip.

- Two TVs: College football on one, Basketball on the other! 

- Two queen beds and a fold out couch allowed us to fit people in along with A LOT of floor space for overnight guests =)

- Automatic curtains allowed for awesome dance shows

- Mini fridge for our recover center consisting of bottles of Powerade and H20. REMEMBER: DO NOT DRINK HOTEL BOTTLED WATER - IT COSTS $5 A BOTTLE. We woke up on our last night and found out someone had opened a bottle and left .. we're still hunting for the culprit.

- Enough dressers, tables and desks for places to place bottles and red cups

- Great room service, gave us a lot of extra towels, bathrooms supplies, and coat hangers for our clubbing gear

I've stayed at the Palazzo numerous times so I expected nothing less from the Venetian.
Boy, was I wrong. I will NEVER choose to stay at this hotel again.
There was miscommunication the entire process, causing a headache for us and even their own staff.
I had called on the phone to make sure my friend could check in to our room prior to my arrival and they assured me that would be fine. She went to the front desk as told and they told her she wouldn't be able to check in without me, meaning she had to wait an additional 2 hours.
Finally, I arrived and they offered to waive the resort fees and give us late check out... it was a start but honestly not much of a resolution for our wasted time and efforts.
We checked into our room and then found that it wasn't properly cleaned as there was trash (some half-drunken fat tuesday bottle lying on the floor) causing us to question the cleanliness of the room and ask for a room change. The front desk then apologized and offered us $100 resort credit for food and drink.

I thought I was done dealing with their incompetent front desk until 3 days later, I find a  huge charge on my credit card from this hotel.
I called billing to figure out what the issue was and she told me the charge was for the resort fee, and food I had ordered from the cafe downstairs.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
The hotel staff offered these services in the first place to make up for all of our trouble, repeatedly assured us they had made ""notes"" on the reservation to ensure we wouldn't get charged, and then I got charged anyway and had to AGAIN take it upon myself to figure out THEIR mess.
What was the point in leaving these notes in the first place if their coworkers can't even bother themselves to read them? I have to bring it to their attention in the end anyway.

PROS:  Nice, spacious rooms with a comfortable living area, a desk area, and a large bathroom with a separate bathtub and shower stall.  There are 3 TVs if you are into watching TV.
The housekeeping staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating.
The fitness center is available for no extra charge (except for the ""resort fee"" that everyone has to pay).  Most of the equipment is in good working order.
The malls and common areas are very nice.  The restaurants are good, though expensive.
For the most part, the convention center rooms are nice and spacious.

CONS:
The fitness center has limited hours.  This is Las Vegas!  Closing at 8 pm seems ridiculous. 
The downstairs between the casino and the convention center was always stuffy and smelled like one big fart (constantly - every day).
The food in the convention center was OK but not great.  It wasn't particularly tasty.  I'm sure it was over priced.
There is no refrigerator and no coffee maker in the room.  There is a stocked bar.  If you touch anything, you pay.
The beds are squishy.  I don't ""do"" squishy beds.  I found it difficult to sleep.

1.The hotel is located in the middle of the strip 
2. Comfortable 
3. Immaculate (I get paranoid about cleanliness)

The shopping center inside is fun to walk around in. Something about the fake sky and the little canal makes me feel like I'm on vacation mode. The cheesy gondola ride full of tourists amuses me.

The Bella Suite with two queen beds and a pullout sofa was perfectly sized for our girl party of three.

The bathroom was beautiful with a large bathtub, standup shower and a vanity. We had a lovely view of the pool, which was in use, surprisingly, as the temperatures during our stay were in the 50s with very little sun. 

My biggest complaints would be the amount of noise we heard from a private party on the lowest floor that made it up to our 11th floor suite. My friends were more than a little disappointed at the lack of a coffee maker, as our room was so far that going to grab a morning coffee was not a quick and easy task.

The Venetian has many high end shops and fabulous restaurants, which we took full advantage of during our stay. We found ourselves lost one evening looking for one of the cocktail lounges, as the premises are quite large and not clearly marked. The trek to our room was a bit further than we were expecting, this kept us from going down to the Casino a few nights after going to our room to change into more comfortable shoes.

The room did not impress me for the price ($420+ per night). But what topped it off was the horrible room service. 3 friends and I were going to see Jennifer Lopez at Planet Hollywood so we ordered 2 pizzas through room service since we didn't have time to grab something before the show. For one the pizzas were overpriced at $24 each which I understand because it's convenience but when they gave me the total $68 and change I repeated it and the guy taking my order kind of chuckled. Is it funny that I repeated it or because it was $20 more then the listed price so I questioned it. Either way we work very hard for our money so to laugh I thought was extremely rude and showed horrible customer service. So now let's jump to when the pizza comes. My 3 friends grabbed a slice while I was showering and noticed it was burnt. They tell me when I got out and I couldn't believe it. How could a high end place like the Venetian serve their guests what they had sent to our room. I called and complained and the same rude guy that originally answered answered once again. Again horrible customer service, said he would only refund 1 pizza because the other was consumed. Ummm half of it was still there and how else is someone supposed to realize it's burnt if you don't begin to eat it. I told him he had to be kidding and that wasn't ok with me so I asked for a manager. Ricardo the manager was nice and said he would give us a full refund but didn't offer to make us new ones and never had someone come pick up the burnt ones. He told us if they couldn't make it up before we left to just leave them outside our door and someone would be by to pick them up. Well next morning on our way to check out they were still there. The lack of customer service was astounding. All they had to do was apologize profusely tell me they would make 2 more pizzas pronto and send them up in addition to the refund to make sure they provide excellent customer service. But I guess not everyone is taught the same form of respect and customer service. Needless to say I will never stay here again and pass the word on to all my friends.",0,3,0

Cons: 1.They charge a daily resort fee of $25.00 per night that gets you free wifi, a coffee and newspaper...that should be an option not a must. $125 of internet for a 5 day stay is ridiculous, I never read the newspaper...Pfff.
2. They have a mini fridge in the suite filled with drinks...if you dare to even move one (even if you dont drink it) you get charged for it!! Who the hell puts mini fridges in a suite with $10 drinks (as a tramp I see it)..Ridiculous....those fridges should have 2 bottles of water and be empty for whatever the heck you wanna put em.... 
3. First hotel I ever stay in that doesnt even offer a courtesy bottle of water, yes there are a few bottles of water in the room when you arrive, but the same system as that fridge... drink one of those waters and you will be charged $8.00!!

For all the decor, flat screen TVs and such, they really cheaped out on the mattresses though. They were the only glaringly obvious shortcoming of an otherwise nice room (Venezia Bella View Suite). 

The hotel itself is divided into two parts (three if you count the Pallazo); the Venetian tower and the Venezia tower. Getting to your suite the Venezia tower is a little confusing, there are a few elevators and a fair bit of walking. And going anyhwere other than the pool deck is a major trek from the Venezia. The whole strip is like that, but the extra hiking chain of elevators to get to the Venezia adds to it. 

The mall area between the Venetian and Pallazo is quite nice (though a bit Disneylandish). Dining options are numerous, and all that we tried were good. Most are somewhere between ""way overpriced"" and ""ridiculous"" but again, the whole strip is like that. In this regard, the restaurant ""First"" is a surprising find. It almost seems too cheap for what you get (see separate review). 

Hotel checkin was way understaffed. Fortunately I didn't have to wait in the 100+ person long space mountain like line, because waiting an hour to checkin would have seriously soured my opinion of the place. 

Oh, one tip. Signs tell Venezia guests to go to the Venezia lobby to check in. When you get there, they'll smile and tell you to go back to the space mountain line and wait to check in at the Venetian check in counter. You'd think with the sheer amount of currency that moves through that place daily that they could afford to take down the misleading lobby signs, but they didn't seem to be in any hurry to fix it.",0,1,0

Honestly, Sin City is not one of my favorite places. The smoke-filled casinos, the bacteria-ridden buffets, the scores of unsavory cattle flocking around the Strip -- uggh, it can be downright depressing, really. The Venetian, however, is a refuge. 

After arriving into town on my last visit, it was mid-afternoon by the time check-in was complete. There was an initial intention of going out for dinner, but alas, exhaustion dictated otherwise and room service sounded wonderful. Luckily, I had Luela who took wonderful care of me. A bottle of a Sauvignon Blanc was in order to start my evening off and Luela hurried it up to me in nothing flat. After enjoying that, my stomach began to become needy and Luela responded by shuttling up a delightful dinner: Wedge Salad, Baked Potato with all the fixings, Grilled Salmon, and, for dessert, an array of delightful cookies. Everything was magnificent!

The bathtub is large and inviting. Sipping a nice white in a bubble bath was just what made me forget about my week. (Hint: Bubble bath can be purchased in a shop that is adjacent to the tower elevators).

Staying indoors in a Venetian suite is the only way to visit Las Vegas. Oh, and did I mention how much I LOVE Luela?",2,2,4

My children loved watching the gondolas and we saw a few of the performers.  There are so many fining options including some inexpensive options as well.  

This hotel also has a great location on the strip.  My kiddos and I were able to walk to a lot of the ""must sees""  for kids like Circus Circus and the Bellagio fountains.  We could even see the Mirage volcano from our hotel room.  

I also love that you are able to use the Palazzo's amenities as well,  especially their pools.

My boyfriend was there for a conference.  We checked out the day the conference was ending and they had someone near the elevators pointing guests to a special check out area and directing those than needed baggage service to a ballroom designated for conference goers checking out but not leaving yet.  This streamlined the whole process and we were checked out within about 5-7 minutes which is amazing considering the number of guests checking out.",1,0,0

As soon as we pulled in to valet our car it was as if we stepped into another world. The resort itself is a piece of art that I believe not everyone appreciates, my hubby just stepped aside as I began my picture taking. The suite was beyond our expectations, it had everything you could ever want & if it wasn't for the resort being such a spectacular place well then you'd never want to leave your room. We chose against even going to the pool because it seemed more of a singles scene with the beyond risqué clothing, etc. Instead we chose the gambling in their casino & there we had a blast, it definitely wasn't like the other casinos. There was a definite limit on the trashy people their & the smoking wasn't that bad for us non smokers. Since we relocated to the west coast recently we are definitely counting down the days for our next visit back to the Venetian.

I believe the best way to review the Venetian is to describe my experience.... here we go.

I was in town for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and my trip definitely started out with a bang, as my driver was pulling into the Venetian she was directed to go into a particular lane, so she did, and within seconds some other valet was yelling at her, literally yelling through the window on how stupid she was to do such a thing, this was the land for Venetian cars only, not normal limos... hmmm sure says welcome to the Venetian if you ask me.

No line at check-in (one of the few pluses), but as I was checking in the attendant mentioned I had one king bed in my room, I responded by telling him I had two queen beds confirmed the day before, he said impossible (pretty much called me a liar), I said OK, can you check to see if any are available and he pretended to look at his computer screen for 5 seconds and promptly said NO, but for $40 more a night we can make that happen for you. I do the bogus upgrade for something I was already guaranteed and angrily make my way to my room, once I unpack I call the front desk and complain, they did remove the charges and apologize, so I still had some hope for this place. Next, I jump in the shower, get out and step on some broken glass, after hopping around the bathroom to grab a towel for my cut foot I notice there is broken glass everywhere! I call and complain again, and as I am doing so I find some more broken glass in the main room... the Venetian promises to thoroughly clean the entire room from top to bottom and at no point shows any concern of real care for my inconvenience. I returned from a meeting several hours later and just take a guess what happened, I stepped on another piece of glass (thankfully I left my shoes on)! I call again and let them know this is ridiculous and the snotty desk attendant literally asked me, ""Well, what do you want me to do about it"" in the most cocky voice imaginable. After some arguing they upgrade me to a different room which had some lovely cigarette ashes in the bathroom! I didn't even bother to call because I knew the management could care less and weren't going to do anything. Quite the first night in what is supposed to be a luxury hotel. After this point, I equated this place with a motel and didn't pay attention to another detail because it would have just upset me. I will mention that four days later those cigarette ashes were still on the counter in the bathroom.

I hate this place and I will never, ever, go back... the free shuttle to the convention center is nice, but unless they start handing out gold bars on it, it isn't enough to get me back here. The only positive is Cut Steakhouse (which is technically in the Palazzo). Do yourself a favor and right before you go to the Venetians website to book a room, give the Wynn's a look, you won't be disappointed.",3,2,1

The staff at the front desk was very accommodating and gave us two Queen beds instead of one King free of charge (initially they wanted to charge me for it).  The room itself is very large for Vegas standards and I like the living room area even though we did not use it.  The bathroom is also large and enough rooms for 3 girls to get ready in.  Our view was horrible as we were on the 10th floor facing the roof.  My only two complaints with this resort are 1) the room is kind of outdated and the couch in the living area looked like a lot of intimate times took place there and no one cleaned it.  In addition, the door to the ""toilet room"" was very hard to close as it was so old  2) it took us 1.5 hours to get out of there during check out time on a Sunday because the bell hop took 40 minutes to arrive in the room and the valet was so swamped that it was another 50 minutes to get the car out.  Overall, the resort is very central and has a good amount of restaurants to choose from.",0,0,0

She helped me get in touch with the woman who ironed my wedding dress and my hair\/makeup girls.  The ceremony was more than I could have dreamed of with a gorgeous wedding chapel.

You need a map for the Venetian alone. There are so many different parts. Clubs, eateries, shopping, gondolas, Walgreens, gambling. Everything is here. Literally. No. Litch'rally. That's how much is here. I had to purposely misspell it. When you drive onto the property, which the parking lot in itself is massive, you have no idea what you're in for. Then you walk inside and see the majestic art on the ceilings and you know you're in heaven. Also, there's this pizza place in the food court area that's open 24 hours. Big slice, great eats, cheapest price you may find. FYI if you're coming in late one night and need some foodage.

The rooms are so nice! The bathroom is big with a host of mirrors, a tv and a large tub. Relaxation here we come!!!! The bed is just....ok. no words. Love it.

First complaint:
When you stay in the Venezia tower, getting to your room is a fricken maze.  It was so many twists and turns and you had to go into two different elevators.  Not fun when you're drunk, tired, and feet hurt from dancing in high heels all night.

Second Complaint: 
So there was 11 girls in our suite.  I know, waaaay to many chicks.  So of course, we ran out of blankets.  At around 2AM, we called housekeeping and asked for more blankets and pillows.  They said it will be a one hour wait because it was so busy.  That was cool, cuz we weren't ready for bed quite yet.  One hour went by, then two.  I fell asleep, and ended up waking up at 5AM with still no blanket.  I was totally drunk, so I went into the bathroom, grabbed one of their luxurious robes, wrapped it around me, and took my ass back to bed.  We had to complain the next day about them not bringing blankets.  After we complained, they immediatley brought up blankets and pillows.

Other than that, this hotel is amazing.  It's beautiful, and all the rooms are SUITES!  We had the Bella Luxury Suite.  It was beautiful.  The bathroom was humongous and had marble and gold trim.  There is a sunken living room and your own personal fax machine and data ports.  We also had an awesome view of the pool garden.  So pretty!  You have to totally stay here!!!

But - we got the room for free, and my parents aren't even high rollers.  The casino is fantastic.  It has a great poker room that doesn't take half an hour to walk to, and the dealers are friendly.  I would also like to thank the slot machines - my mom hit a $3,000 jackpot on a $1 machine, and my dad won almost a grand in around three $5 spins.

ROOM 
-  SPACIOUS:  Being a suite, I had a lot of space to spread out and work.
-  CONNECTED:  FREE hard line Internet and it was FAST!
-  PRINTER:  LOVED that the room came with a printer.  (I had to ask for paper and it was sent up quickly, but if I was in a hurry, it would have been annoying.)

ROOM SERVICE
-  FAST: Placed online and my food got to my room by the time I got out of the shower.
-  DETAILED:  They complied with my request of replacing the starch with more veggies without any problems.
-  DELICIOUS:  The bone-in ribeye steak arrive PERFECT (which rarely happens with room services). 
     - Excellent quality of meat and seasoned just right.  It was medium rare from edge to edge and served piping hot (which is very hard to do because to keep the food hot, it would have had to be in a warming oven.  At such a large hotel, the time it took for the food to get to the room, it would have cooked the steak to medium).  
     - The Bearnaise sauce was complex and rich with the flavor of the wine.  More importantly, it wasn't overly salty.  
     - Every piece of the vegetable medley, including the baby carrots, haricot vert, white asparagus and heirloom cherry tomatoes, had different cooking time.  Remarkably, they were all tender and crispy.
-  REASONABLE:  At $45.00 it was a steal.  It could easily have been a $65.00 dinner downstairs.  

STAFF & FACILITIES
-  CLOSE:  Having to be at a convention for 4 days, it is a blessing that the conference rooms and exhibit halls are at such close proximity to the guest elevator (especially compared to the design of the space at the Mandalay Bay).
-  CHOICES:  The plethora of quality restaurants is staggering.  From quick comfort food like Panda Express, to high-end dinning to entertain customers like AquaKnox, there is no shortage of choices.
-  EFFICIENT:  With such a large number of attendees, traffic at the hotel was remarkably speedy.  Less than 5 minutes wait for check-in and check-out.  No lines in the elevator lobby.
-  GRACIOUS:  Every employee I had met always greeted with me a smile.  Staff was knowledgeable, proficient and confident.

it is the most awful smell and i couldn't figure out why nobody else was gagging and holding their nose - until i heard a little kid say ""mommy... why does this place smell like soap?"" 

i'm nauseous writing this... it smelled like air freshener from the dollar store... used in a trailer... filled with women who are sweating and wearing cheap perfume and lady products.

I didn't stay here, but friends of mine and I went here for an early b-day dinner celebration.  Her actual b-day was on a weekday, but since majority of us flew here to Las Vegas, we decided to have it before we all flew out.  We dined at the Grand Luxe Cafe and it was pretty awesome. Spacious and luxurious, among other choice words to use.  

Had the avocado burger with french fries, and a Amstel Light.  After the meal, a friend of ours decided to treat us all, so that was pretty amazing.  After the meal, we decided to walk around the hotel and into the Grand Canal Shops.  The Venice canal motif was pretty bad ass, as those people in the boats sang with people holding each other.  I'm guessing that ain't cheap to get. I had personally stayed here myself, but it was years ago and with family.  But this time around, I was by traveling with myself and meeting friends and just having a good time.

I do love this property for what it is. The decor and the ambiance could not be beat. Maybe next time I will stay here instead.

I say mostly because I ran the tub and by the time it filled there were lots of particles of dust, definitely not a deal breaker though. The rest of the room seemed clean. I would definitely stay there again. Few things that sucked is that we were tricked into a time share. Also going from the parking garage to your hotel can be very tricky, at least for us.

I have come to realize that the Venetian has an endless amount of choices of food.  You can find fast food, cafes, casual dining, and of course fine dining as well which means you can get away with spending very little on food, or go with higher-end food establishments.

If the rooms had more of a ""wow"" factor, I would give this hotel a 5 star rating because with the combination of strong food\/restaurant choices, casino, free entertainment around their canal shops, shopping, and shows, this is one of the best spots on the strip.The rooms at MGM Signature still beat the Venetian basic suites, I must say.",0,0,0

We stayed in the Venezia tower, and straight up, it is amazingly confusing. It is like a damn maze trying to get around in there to and from the elevators, took like 10 minutes to find the ice machine (I thought I was just stupid, until I had like 5 other people ask me if I knew where it was when they saw me coming back with a bucket of ice) and there isn't a sign like anywhere else saying ice machine with an arrow pointing somewhere. To get to the main Venetian hotel, you either have to go through a maze in the Venezia tower then through the casino and up some escalators, or go through the maze of the Venezia tower, then across a bridge hallway to the main tower, and then to where you would like from there. This includes getting to the pools, food court, and palazzo which I got sick of very fast. Along with that, almost everywhere they have security asking to see your room key to make sure you are staying at the hotel. At first it was kind of nice, but got annoying super fast having to walk with your room key out all the time

Personally, the pools were not that great. I didn't go to Tao beach, but the regular pool had a gross layer of sunscreen and other crap along the edges which grossed me and the people in my group off

The resort is huge, we we stayed here in June08, and I felt like we never had to leave.  They seem to have made the hotel so you never have to leave.  

Check In process was excellent.  Not a very long line and well organized, but , maybe it was because it was only noontime.  When we got to the counter and informed the clerk that we would end up with more that the 2 people in the room, we expected to pay the extra persons fee.  Nope, she said it was fine and not to worry about it, took their names and moved on.

Concierge services really made you feel important, seeing as this was our first 21+ trip to Vegas, we headed to the concierge to help make nightlife arrangements.  The concierge went above and beyond and got us show tickets, dinner reservations to Tao, comp passes to Tao(I now know that this was just comped by the hotel), and guestlist to Tryst.  Not only that, but he followed up after each and every event to make sure everything went off with no issues.  Now that's customer service!

Beds were very comfortable, and the room layout helped fit the rest of my group comfortably for the weekend. The huge bathroom was a definite plus, although I kinda wish they put the TV in the toilet room instead of the bath tub area.

There was a food court within the hotel which had your typical mall fast food joints that really saved money for more partying.

I do love their casino because its big and is connected to Palazzo side so you have more choice on where to gamble.

I love shopping there because you can find almost anything and many restaurants to choose from. 

So why three stars? Well, suite we were staying in had a  problem. I was about to jump into shower and as soon as I opened the shower booth, I seriously could not breathe and almost puke. I was about to vomit any second. I realized theres this unknown black residue left over the shower booth and it smelled really really bad! I am assuming that there might have been plumbing issues and so the water was actually backflowing to leave the shower booth so filthy.

I immediately called and the head manager upgraded our suite but ugh, I cannot forget its smell. Later, I lost something at the suite and I am almost certain that the housekeeper stole it. Filed a report and I am waiting on what will happen next.

The suite was very similar to a standard suite but it was larger by a couple hundred square feet and included 2 queen beds instead of a king bed. We also had a beautiful view of a wall. 

We stayed here once before when we got married at the Venetian so we expected a lot. In 2007, everything was very impressive and the staff definitely made our trip feel special. This time, there were problems with customer service. First, when we checked in the employee working the front desk acted like a complete dick for no apparent reason. Our room was not ready and we were asked to give our phone number so the hotel could call us when the room was ready. Well, 3pm came and went. I sent my husband over to the hotel to see if he could pick up the keys. Our room was indeed ready but no one had bothered to call. 

I had called at about 11am to ask for additional towels and linens for the pull-out bed. First, my phone call got sent to a voicemail box and then dumped. Then, I had to sit on hold for about 15 minutes with the front desk before I could make my request.  Well, at 10pm nothing extra had been brought to our room and we had to call again. Housekeeping had thought they already brought the items to our room but I suspect they just wanted the extra opportunity for us to tip them (?) They did offer us complimentary late checkout as a result of this lapse but I thought that was completely lame. The person who slept on the couch reported that it was more comfortable to sleep on the couch itself and not the pullout part. 

I was also annoyed that housekeeping took away our extra unused towels from the first day and then gave us back the standard 4 sets of towels every day when they cleaned our room. It is just another hassle to continue to call housekeeping to get extra towels when I thought it was obvious that we needed them in the first place. My husband and I ended up sharing a bath towel the entire time so there were enough to go around. This is not the kind of thing I expect to do in a 5-star hotel but it overrode my desire to call housekeeping and fork over more of my gambling money. Overall, I find that the Venetian looks very much the same as it did 3 years ago but they need a big kick in the ass in the customer service department. The next time I want luxury I am going to try another 5 star property. I just hope I can find one that knows how to deliver real customer service.

Also, I think the rialto suite doesn't really work for 5. There is a single bathroom and the toilet is in a separate little room but you have to walk past the main part of the bathroom to get to it. This means if someone is taking a bath or shower the toilet is likely off limits. The clothing closet is also located in the main part of the bathroom so there is a bit of a bottleneck if everyone is trying to get ready to go out or go to bed. This suite would work best for 4 people max. 

We had complimentary use of the gym and went one morning. The cardio machines all have individual displays where you can watch television or hook up your ipod. I did not use the free weights but my friend said he liked it. The locker rooms are off-limits unless you want to pay a $20 upgrade. I did use the locker room the last time I stayed there and I remember it being pretty posh (hot tub, sauna, cucumber water, etc). 

Overall, the level of service at the resort has dropped dramatically, but if that doesn't matter to you then I would recommend staying at the Venetian.",1,0,1

Even so, their service lacked a bit, and I've enjoyed better amenities, comps, and freebies, at lesser hotels.

 I had to call for face towels several times throughout my stay. The room wasn't properly stocked to accommodate two guests.  I also had to request another robe for my husband, which should have already been in the room as I indicated upon booking that there would be two guests. I also indicated that this was my birthday trip and expected a small token of appreciation from the hotel or casino, seeing as though I spent over $2000 on my stay. They charge a $29 resort fee, I guess because it's pretty, because I didn't even get a mint on my pillow. Additionally, there was no HBO, nor any other premium channels available on the television, which I found outrageous, as that amenity is offered in even cheapest of motels. I only got basic local cable. There's no coffee maker in the room, no fridge, nor mini  fridge to store delicious leftovers from their restaurants, and no microwave in the room either!!!

I did not enjoy as a luxurious stay as I had planned. However, the room and facilities were gorgeous. I also expected the pools to be open later. They closed at seven, which was really early in Vegas time.

The gondola ride was the world to me. The gondolier sang happy birthday to me in Italian. Priceless. The wax museum was great. We also ate at several restaurants in the hotel that were awesome. Delicious food, though over priced at times. We ate at one cheapo breakfast buffet in the downstairs food court that was disappointing. The food was ice cold and not very tasty otherwise.

I loved the place, and it is definitely a must see, but I would probably stay elsewhere on my next visit to Vegas. Don't get me wrong, this place is amazing, the product just isn't worth the price.",0,0,0

It's classically elegant and beautiful and all the rooms are suites. I've stayed here on a number of occasions and there are a lot of great perks to this hotel. The rooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfortable. There's a lot to appreciate as you're walking around and admiring the scenery. 

Although The Venetian is nice, I actually like their sister property, The Palazzo (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-palazzo-las-vegas), a little better. It's more sleek and modern in decor and easier to navigate through. They are connected so you can easily walk through the shops to get to either one. The shops at the Venetian is like an alleyway through Italy. There's a gondola ride you can take through the canal, I've never done it before, but I'm sure it would be a lovely experience. There is also a food court located near the shops, upstairs from the casino, that has cheap, quick food such as Panda Express that you can eat at if you don't want to spend a lot of money or want to get something to eat fast. My two favorite restaurants in The Venetian are The Grand Lux & Noodle Asia. Both have great food and I believe they are open 24 hours a day.

All in all, this is a nice luxury hotel and it is centrally located along the Vegas strip. Tao is also the main nightclub that they have, but I haven't gone there in years. Just because there are better, newer clubs in Vegas nowadays.",2,0,2

We arrived early around 8:00 am, left our bags with the valet attendant as we got out of our Uber, prechecked in and was told they would text us when our room was ready. We were given the keys so we had them available and wouldn't need to return to the front desk once we got the text. We were given a claim ticket for our luggage and were told to call the number on the ticket once we made it to our room. The check in time isn't until 3:00 pm so we headed to get breakfast and planned to do a little site seeing, however, as soon as we finished eating breakfast the text came that out room was ready. We were in our room and had our bags all by 9:15am which was only about an hour after we arrived. Fantastic! This gave us a chance to take a quick nap. This was my second time in Vegas. My first stay was at the MGM. The Venetian is a much prettier hotel. The room was beautiful and a nice size. At first we only saw the view of the back of other buildings until we looked out and saw the beautiful mountains in the distance. My only complaint was the fact that there was not a air vent over the bedroom area.  On my first night I was uncomfortable because I was hot. Once I adjusted the air as low as it could go and turned it ON instead of AUTO it was nice and cool over the bed area. I'm not sure if it was just this suite or it all are the same but that would be my only complaint that there is no air vent in the bedroom area. The hotel appears to located in a nice area on the strip. We were able to do the nighttime Gondola ride with another nice couple and had a good time. The wax museum is also located right next to the hotel which made for easy access. There are plenty restaurants, a food court, and stores for shopping. We ended up walking to the Palazzo side and it is beautiful as well. I visited the Dorsey bar in the daytime and it has a nice atmosphere. I didn't enjoy the bar at the Venetian as much as I enjoyed the lounge bar at the MGM. We didn't get to enjoy the pool but did get to view one of them and is was an intimate setting.

I stayed here with my parents and my husband (yep in 1 room... honestly it helped to save money for gambling, lol) during the summer in one room, the Bella Suite (which came with 2 queen size beds). We had a short weekend trip to celebrate one of my mom's client's businesses. 

The room itself was really perfect for 4 people, as we had 2 beds and the couch itself was surprisingly comfortable enough to sleep on as well (this was before my husband and I were married). This room was pretty big, especially much bigger than the rooms I usually would stay in, but figured to splurge on a nice room since I was traveling w\/ my folks (yep, they are worth the money and so much more), and plus we were able to get a special discounted group rate as well. 

What I loved about this room, besides the spacious room itself, was the huge bathroom! Double doors to enter the restroom with a huge vanity mirror. I remember opening the double doors the first time upon entering the room and it made me feel all fancy, lol. I also liked that there were dual sinks in the restroom as well so that 1 person can brush their teeth while the other person can wash their face or something in the morning or evening. It was kind of neat to see a TV in the restroom too. 

The bed itself was comfortable, but I would prefer a firmer mattress (but that is just my own preference). Plenty of clean sheets and pillows, so no problems here. 

Upon checking in, we had no problems at all. In fact, we were able to wait in the special business line since we were staying here for my mom's client's celebration (where she was able to reserve a number of rooms for her employees and guests to stay at) so we didn't have to wait at all. Also it was a nice touch that we had valet as well (Complimentary)... rolling in style!

Now on to the hotel itself... What I love about the Venetian Hotel is the layout and design of the hotel itself. I love the grand canal shops and architect that replicates part of Italy. To be honest, I am not that much of a gambler (but yes, even in Vega$ I may dabble in a little bit here and there... sometimes lady luck is by my side) so I really like to just come here (if I am not staying in a room here) to walk around and shop or look around. 

A few things though I must mention is that I wish this place was pet friendly so that I can bring my dogs with me (I ALWAYS bring my dogs with me when I travel to Vega$ since it is so close to Southern California) and stay here again. I also wished this was a smoke free hotel like the Trump Hotel... but I understand, this place has to make a business, so I am accepting of that. But every time I walk through this hotel, I have to rewash my hair again before I sleep to get rid of that disgusting smoke out. Also, I am just not a fan of letting my lungs be filled w\/ smoke that could possibly one day kill me (a little extreme, I know... but just trying to make a point... and yes I realize Vega$ is not a smoke free place). 

Overall, beautiful hotel with exceptional accommodations (just not for the those traveling w\/ their furry pets) and I would recommend to anyone (plus during the week day, nightly room rates are pretty reasonable for the size of the room you are getting).",4,2,2

When we got the front desk our room was ready (and the upgrade was really pushed on us). We upgraded to a bigger room for an additional cost and went right up. The luggage however took over 3 hours to make it our room. We called for it 3 times. The upgraded suite was no big deal. The breakfast buffet in the lobby cafe was disgusting and over priced.

The typical room (which we stayed in) is still a suite. It's close to twice the size of the typical Vegas hotel room, with an L-shaped coach (and 2nd full size flat screen TV) for relaxing.  Speaking of TVs, I was surprised there were actually _three_ in our room.  I'm not sure who watches that much TV in Vegas, let alone needs 3 different shows going at the same time, but hey, it's Vegas.

The bathroom is spacious & elegant.  Lots of space for two people to get ready for a night on the town.

Judging on the room alone, I would give them 5 stars.  So why 4?  Surprisingly, everything else at the Venetian is sub-par.  The spa is absolutely _terrible_.  (A single hottub slightly larger than a bathtub?)  Like some of the larger hotel, it's a fairly long walk to your room.

I assumed I would love the Venetian. I had always enjoyed walking through it. I heard great things about the pool. I figured I couldn't go wrong here. Next time I will stick with hotels I know are my style! 

The rooms are beautiful here! The room I stayed in was probably one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever slept in. That just didn't make up for what is lacked in other areas to me. I would actually suggest this hotel for a couple looking for some romantic time. I was with friends and just couldn't enjoy all of the amenities the room had to offer. Again, not their fault, but you should know if you are looking for a wild girls weekend. 

Check in and out was fast. The line for cabs was always moving steady and well organized. I ordered room service once and they were fast and VERY friendly. All of the employees were friendly (except casino). I'll get to that.

You could get lost for days in here. Most staff can help you but I ran across a few that were just as confused as I was. I would recommend spending a day just exploring the different areas within the hotel (if you have time to kill).

The pool was nice. I liked the scene. No real @%#h0l&es hanging out here. Drinks are crazy expensive (but average for Vegas prices). The server we had was excellent! She took great care of us and kept the glasses of ice coming. I wish I could remember her name. She was adorable! 

I also appreciate that the staff immediately moves belongings from unattended chairs. Don't attempt to save a chair at this place while you sleep upstairs. I went down about 10am and had no trouble getting a good spot. 

Only half the pool is actually in the sun. It's the more crowded half. I was over heated after 20 minutes so I guess that can be a good thing. 

The casino is where they lose me! Minimums on tables are pretty average. I was annoyed when I went down to play Pai Gow Poker one morning and I was the only person playing (8am) in an almost empty casino and the minimum was $25. Whatever. 

The real kicker is drinks! I gambled for 4 straight hours before I ever saw a cocktail waitress at one point. The other wait times averaged anywhere from 10 minutes-2 hours. I would say average was an hour wait for a drink. Totally unacceptable. I was never offered water, etc. 

The girls were sweet when they came by, but finding them was beyond ridiculous! Good luck purchasing a drink there too. Sky high prices which put me over the edge as I was dropping huge cash in casino and couldn't get a damn Pepsi!

I have recently stayed at the Venetian for my 21st birthday. Their customer service was terrible. First, I arrived into my suite and did not realize that there was a sign on the fridge that mentions that we get charged if the beverages were removed. I removed it without knowing and put my own beverages into the fridge. Then I realized that I would have gotten charged I immediately called the front desk and they offered to send someone in to check the fridge to make sure that nothing was opened and to waive the fee if nothing was opened. The following day  I was still concerned on if anyone has shown up to see the refreshments and I called the front desk again to ask for someone to come up to check.  Also, there were many things broken in the room and a repair man came to help fix them so we could avoid and charges happening after our stay. My boyfriend was inside the hotel room all day and did not see anyone come to check our refreshments. We made another call and a person at front desk said that they will just waive the fee for us. We were not informed anything about refreshment ""restocking"" fee.  On Sunday morning we called for more blankets and pillows at 5:48am and still did not get them until I finally tired of waiting for them until 6:45am outside my room. I went down to the front desk and tried to get them myself and finally around 7am pillows and blankets were sent to our room. Finally, Sunday afternoon someone has come up to our hotel room to check the refreshments. This was a very misleading situation because we were informed that our refreshment fees got waived. We were really confused because we have been informed that it has been taken care of. I have talked to many front desks employees and managers that were informing us that the refreshment fees would be taken care off. I am really upset with the customer service that I have dealt with this past weekend. I left to come back home still feeling unsure about the refreshment situation and my bill. I called today to try to find out how much I was billed and the front desk did not want to help me and said that they would just email me my receipt and tried getting me off the phone not answering my question. Then I have called the Venetian again and spoke to a male front desk person and explaining him the situation about the refreshments and informing him that there were the repair man and the front desk person reassuring us that we would get our refreshments fees waived. He was very understanding about our situation, but wanted to run through the manager. At first the manager stated that I was informed many times about the $50 restocking refreshment fee, but that is totally false. They argued that they have it on their notes that I was informed. Then they tried to say that I stated that I had the drinks in the bathroom. I have meant that the drinks were my own beverages in the bathroom. I am very upset with the way Laurie\/Lauren the manager that refused to waive the charged and hung up on me when I asked I wanted the person's name that made the note that was informed because I wanted to get them fired. What kind of service is this? I had to call back and ask for her again and tried to get compensation, but she insisted that she was not going to waive the fee and that was that. I am very upset with the Venetian and the way they handles their customers with their policy and their miscommunications. I want to request if there are any taped recordings of my phone calls with the front desk because the manager I had spoken with had claimed that I was notified on every conversation concerning this matter and claimed that I had made statements that allegedly admitted ""facts"" that I had never said and the contradictory reasoning that was used to deny our claim.  This experience has been a complete disappointment to me and my guests.  I have never been this upset to make a formal complaint, but based on this experience, I will be making sure that neither myself nor anyone that I know will ever be staying at this disgraceful hotel again.",6,4,2

The hotel, of course, is beautiful.  You know that you're in a five star hotel the moment that you pull up to the valet.  It's as close as you can get to Venice without leaving the country.  I also liked that it was connected to the Palazzo.

Our suite was huge!  We had three flat screen TV's - one in the sunken living room, one in front of the bed, and one in the bathroom.  The sunken living room had a sectional couch, coffee table, and work desk.  We had a party in our room, and our suite was able to accommodate all of our guests.  The bed was beyond comfortable so we were able to get good sleep after a long night of partying.

We also got all the hook-ups when we were there.  Right after we checked-in and on our way to our suite, this gal asked me if I wanted to be put on the guest list for Tao.  I said yeah!!!  Tao was in our itinerary so it was great that we were offered to be put on the guest list without having to call concierge.  The next day, the gal that hooked me up sent me a text message and told me the she also put me on the guest list for Tao Beach!  The hotel also gives you complimentary line pass and admission to Lavo.  It was great to get all hooked up!

It was also nice that we were able to get account services through the television.  There's no need to fall in line downstairs to check out.  We got everything settled right from our suite.

I did love my dealer at the Blackjack tables, very nice and also didn't deal at lightening speed, which I hate. Nice and average pace, and more concerned with interaction with the gamblers.

They replied that they could only move us to another room. Now i travel a lot and when ever there is a slight issue the front desk always does something to make up for the mistake. and In this case we revived nothing. there was no manager to speak with  at this time.

She replied yes of coarse just come down stairs and fill out the paper work, As our other friend was checking out I went to sign the paperwork. She then told me (ok now your checked in I need you to get your bags and then at 2:00 you can check back in) Now had I know this I would have brought my bags down in the first place.

It's nice to have a suite and have housekeeping service 2x a day, but it kind of misses in execution.  You only get 2 sets of towels which gives you limited flexibility if you need more, the provided accompaniments in the bathroom are not high quality and miss some of the nicer ones you would want, and they don't give you enough hangers.  All of this is fixable with a phone call so it's not tragic, but just makes the Venetian fall a little short of a true 5 star experience.  

One Note of Caution:  My date and I are not really sensitive, but the standard sheets on the bed made us both itch terribly.  We suffered for 2 nights and then called and told the desk.  We were afraid they were bed bugs.  They brought us some hypo-allergenic sheets and said they have to do that alot and we didn't have any more problem, and those sheets were just as comfortable as the standard sheets.  I don't know why they don't just make them standard.

Checkout was a nightmare.  Even though the line was small, it took forever.  I can only imagine what it would be like at peak time.  Checkin was a breeze although you will have to deal with a lot of upselling pressure to upgrade your room which isn't very attractive to me.",0,0,0

The only thing keeping me from voting the fifth star is the gawd awful bitter orange scented shampoo, soaps and vapors they keep pumping into the public spaces.

* A living room that includes a dining table and a full-sized L-shaped sofa.

* A huge bathroom with two sinks, a Roman tub (bring bath bubbles!) and a separate glass-enclosed shower.  The toilet is separated by another door.

Towels and toiletries were not replaced nor rubbish taken out. We ran around so much that we were unable to use anything that fell under the resort fee. Upon check out I explained this to the desk agent and asked if there was something they could do about it. She said that she couldn't waive the fee but because they were holding our bags for 3 hours before our flight left I would be utilizing some of the resort fee. So we ended up spending $77.00 for someone to store our bag for 3 hours. Glad we had the opportunity to stay but we will definitely stay somewhere else next trip.,0,0,0

We stayed here Saturday and Sunday, and took advantage of everything it had to offer. The room was great, even though the sofabed was lumpy. Luckily, we didn't have to share the room on Sunday, so Cal and I got the awesome King bed that night.

There were three flat screen tv's! One facing the sofabed, one facing the bed, and one above the bathroom sinks. How awesome is that? Adam G. mentioned how empty it seems, and maybe he's right about everyone staying in their rooms because I was reluctant to leave it! 

Cal played in the Poker Room, and I got to lounge on the comfy couches in there during my slot machine breaks. They serve you Fiji water in there, so that was nice. The pools (yes, there were several) at the Venezia tower were beautiful, with fountains everywhere. This place is pure decadence. Good thing there was a promotion on the rooms, or else I may have never experienced the luxury of the Venetian. Oh, and the robes and slippers sealed the deal on a return visit!

I really wish I could stop here and live happily ever after on my vacation but I have been here only a few hours and am very unimpressed with the customer service in this hotel.  My first clue should have been when I called a couple days before our trip to see if we could get some special accommodations for a medical issue I have.  The woman that answered the phone was very unapologetically not helpful.  My husband then called the concierge thinking being in the customer service only business would certainly yield better results.  She was unable to help without a $70 per day charge, which would be fine but, again, she was very unapologetic and flippant. 

Today, after we went through the, in my opinion, tacky, line to get to check in we were told of a $28 per day resort fee.  RESORT FEE!  For use of the pool and fitness room!  I don't need the fitness room and I have never had to pay to use a hotel's pool.  This vacation was given to us from a friend along with a stipend that I planned to use on some spa services but now, since I HAVE to pay (no option to opt out) a resort fee that will equal $140 I won't be indulging.  Again, the employee was totally flippant and could have cared less that I was taken aback at the charge.  

Also, as said in previous reviews, the refrigerator in the room is weight censored.  I get that.  I have stayed in many hotels that have the censors so they can charge what you use.  If you even pick anything up to look at it or set anything on or in it you will be charged!!  I am aghast at that kind of treatment of guests.  I do not feel special here at all.  

I have 5 days here.  I hope they end up better than they started.  As of right now I will definitely not be staying here or recommending it to anyone.  It is a shame because when I told people I was staying at the Venetian everyone was impressed and really thought it was fancy.  The appearance is fancy.  How they treat their guests is a completely different thing altogether.

Edited -  After a little more research on the resort fee we went to customer service in the morning and it was taken off.  She also accommodated us in letting us use the refrigerator free of charge for medical purposes.  Also a guest services  representative, Francesca, called this afternoon to make sure everything was satisfactory with us now.",1,0,0

I think the rooms are very nice and very big, and also well-maintained.  They are pricey and they do nickel and dime you for everything (namely room upgrades) but I enjoy staying here, even without upgrades.

It is a bit of a factory as far as check in goes.  You arrive, have the option of giving bags to the valet, line up to check in, tromp to your room, etc. but they have so many people coming in that I actually appreciate an organized process.  The property is big and sprawling and confusing (as all big casinos trying not to let you leave are) but once you spend some time here, you get to know your way around.

They have a lot of restaurant options, most of them quite pricey, and some shopping which is definitely not the best in Las Vegas.  But, when it is super hot outside, I do enjoy strolling along the fake canals.  

I also enjoy their sports book even though it is not the biggest or best in Las Vegas.  The book takers and the bar staff in the sports book are very friendly and helpful.  I also think that the dealers at the tables at the Venetian are very friendly.  I admit that I have only played craps here but the friendly dealers have been responsible for keeping me at the table even after the minimums have been raised to more than I want to bet.

I also think the decor of this casino is very nice.  And, we actually ordered room service once and it was great.  I like the big bathrooms with two sinks, the big tub, the toiletries and the bath robes.  It's also cool to have three LCD TVs in each room.  You can watch TV while taking a shower - I totally did this!

I will definitely stay here again.  The only thing I really don't like is that it's pretty pricey for everything here.  If it was a little cheaper, I'd be in heaven (and they'd get five stars).",1,0,1

I was impressed upon entering the hotel at how HUGE the hotel was and all the amenities available...the 2 pools (1 which we visited), restaurants, etc..  I reserved 2 conjoining rooms so we'd have more of a group feel, since 8 of my friends were going to be joining us for the festivities.  The rooms and the bathrooms were spacious and accommodated all of us comfortably.  With having 8 girls staying in the hotel room, you need a lot of mirrors especially if you're in Vegas...just to minimize the time you need to get ready to go out and our room had enough making it functional and less time consuming.  

The staff was very helpful and polite at all times.  They were really big on customer service and openly assisted us if we had any questions about anything.

They have always taken care of me for the past few years and have made me a loyal patron after bouncing around other properties on the strip for prior stays. They also take care of their rated players (speaking from experience).

I guess you could call it a more sofisticated experience. There is no buffet (thank God), and the property seems to not appeal that much to the short-wearing, beer-gutted slobs that you see all to often elsewhere on the strip. I'm not saying you won't see them here, but there is definitely an air of relative class at Venetian that is lacking in most other proprties on the strip.

And for those new to the strip, the Venetian is located on the end of the strip that you want to be on. Close to all of the shops, restaurants, and casinos worth going to. All within walking distance. You won't need luck in having a great vacationing experience when you go here. A sure bet.",0,0,0

The only gripe I had was checking in on Friday.  The line was super long and slow.  

Also a side note, I swear we were in the middle of Jersey Shore, because there were a huge amount of Jersey Guidos all over the place in line.

After I got up to the counter, it took forever to check in.  Apparently they didn't have our suite ready and she had to get manager approval to get a suite unlocked, which took forever.

The suite itself was AWESOME.  Huge bathroom, shower and bath, two sinks.  Two huge queen size beds and a living room with a pull out sofa.  Great view of the pool, 3 TVS! 42 inch plasma in the bedroom, 32 inch plasma in the living room and a 17 inch HD tv in the bathroom.

WTH no fridge either?  The only fridge they had was the mini-bar which I was paranoid to touch because it has those weight-electronic sensors that if you take something out you get charged for it.

The other annoying thing is how early the maid staff starts working.  After a long night of partying, they are knocking on peoples doors for ""house keeping"" at like 9AM.  I'm freakin trying to sleep!  WAAAYYY too early.  They even ignore the ""please do not disturb"" signs.

Lol, my roommate was out in the hallway and the maid walked in on someone in the shower.

Maid: ...Housekeeping? *opens door*
Man inside suite: NO! NO! NO! GO AWAY!
maid:....okay I come back later?

It was seriously something out of Family guy lol.

First off, out of all of the hotels, I found this one to be the most confusing when it comes to getting around. Even on our way out we were still questioning ourselves on where we were going. 

Our room was great. It was comped, so we opted out of the extra $50\/night for a strip view, but still got a decent view of the mountains. We've been to vegas enough to know what the strip view is like.

The only cons I found in the room were as mentioned in other reviews, the mini fridge was only for the mini bar on sensors and there's no coffee maker, but I get it, you want us to either come down from our room and get a regular coffee at a latte price at one of the cafes or order room service.

I loved the layout of the room and the bathroom was my favorite place.  The decor had touches of Italian with modern accents.  The drapes can be controlled with a remote so that was great too.  The BF and I enjoyed our room so much that we barely even left.  We watched the NBA finals from our comfy bed and ordered food and ate in the living room area.  It was a great little home away from home.

We also visited the pool area.  We weren't able to go to TAO because his ID is expired, but it didn't really matter to me. The pool area was clean and the girl serving drinks was a sweetheart.

Service was great throughout our stay.  I would definitely stay here again, especially if its free again :D",2,2,1

Most recently I had a mini stay-cation when one of my friends came into town. If you are a person like me who loves a luxury kind of hotel then this place is one that you have to stay at least once!

Standing 36 stories high, you will find this 5 diamond hotel and casino giving you the home away from home Venice, Italy feel. I've never been to Italy yet so I can't say how spot on the replica of being in the actual city of Venice is but based on what I've seen on the travel channel they do a pretty stellar job! The Rialto Bridge at the Venetian is one of my favorite spots because you get a great view of the Gondola rides from second floor balcony just outside the casino. I encourage everybody to do one of the Gondola rides whether it's on a romantic kind of ride or just with friends. Tons of attractions and beautiful artwork through the Grand Canal Shops! 

Check-in was a breeze as my friend plays a lot when he comes to town so we had a VIP check in experience and who doesn't like a fast and efficient check in? The front desk agent was so polite and even was able to get us upgraded from our originally booked Rialto Suite to the Piazza Suite! Awesome! I'm a member of the Mlife and don't really stay at other properties not in that family so it was nice to step outside of my comfort zone and experience another luxury property. This suite was AMAZING I literally didn't even want to leave the room! I'd suggest splurge if you can afford to and get into one of these suites!

It's really interesting how non-liberating and controlled Vegas is. I mean you can stay up late, drink while walking along The Strip and do a few other things which are uniquely legal in Nevada. That being said, you can't buy a stick of gum without showing your photo ID. In the hotel everywhere you go you have to show your room key. There's absolutely no physical way to jaywalk on The Strip which is painfully obvious when you're in stilettos at 1AM and your choices are to walk for miles or wait forever in a cab line. And getting into the nightclubs - even when you're in the VIP line at Tao you're roped off into crowded pens and herded like cattle. I understand the reasons for it and I appreciate that it probably shields me and thousands of other tourists from crime. Still it's an interesting contrast that's worth bringing to light.

We had a great time at the Venetian. So beautiful. Our room was gorgeous. So large and lovely and comfy beds and a little living area\/lounge with a comfy sofa and two flat screen TVs. The bathtub and the shower were divine. The pools were really fun. Overall we got a great value on the price because we had done a package deal so we were happy. We weren't so happy with the gotchas at check-in. For example, $17-a-day resort fee. And we had to spend $100 minimum at the hotel. Which we did - at Bouchon - and then there was a big mix-up over trying to charge stuff to our room. 

It also cracks me up how the hotel plays the soundtrack to Phantom of the Opera - nonstop. Over several days we practically had it memorized because the SAME songs were playing every single time we walked down the hall or got on the elevator.

I was there during labor day weekend, and despite the high traffic we were checked in very quickly and courteously. Everything was smooth and flawless and even though I only paid $150 for a room that normally costs upwards of $300, the service that we received was definitely no indicator of how much we paid. There was a broken ironing board in one of the rooms and they were so apologetic that they had to change it (although none of us were planning to use it) they brought a ton of extras as comps.

We booked through Expedia and opted to pay a bit extra for a room in the Venezia tower.  Once we found the Venezia check-in counter (it is not marked or all that obvious) we were directed to our room which was in the Venetian tower and NOT the Venezia part of the hotel, which we thought we had paid for!

But once you get inside of the Venetian, it is rather large and confusing, so we didn't realize that we weren't in the Venezia section until after we had already unpacked and decided that it wasn't worth packing up again to move and complain, etc - so we just left it.  Although obviously not too happy about it.

As well, possibly because we booked through a travel company (Expedia) rather than with the hotel directly, but - our room was on the 4th floor.  Yes.  The 4th floor.  Sucks, I know.  And not only that - it was looking out onto a brick wall.  It literally felt like we were in a basement and\/or a cruiseship - below decks.  Waaaayyyy below decks.

Again - I didn't want to move at this point - it's Vegas - you should only sleep in your hotel right?  Well, we DID ONLY sleep in our hotel room because it was such a terrible room.  I don't understand how they can give ANYONE a room that faces a wall.  We seriously couldn't even see the sky!!!

As well, the maintenance was not very good.  The floor boards and stairs were badly scuffed.  The bathroom door had a large gouge out of it, like someone had kicked it and it splintered!  And the T.V. in the 'bedroom' had really bad reception.

Finally, the housekeeping service was just okay.  They basically came in and made the bed and gave you new towels, emptied the garbages and that was it.  Other hotels I have stayed at also tidy up the coffee tables, etc. - this one, not so much. 

After the initial confusion about getting around this hotel, it was fine as far as that was concerned for us, but we did see a guy calling his friends to help him find his room at 4am, and when we were first getting to our room and looking at the hotel map we got a few ""Good Luck's"" - so that could be a bit of an issue for people with directional problems.

Rather than invest in decent ventilation or just let the smoke smell linger on it's own, the Venetian pumps cheap perfume throughout the hotel and casino, which is entirely headache-inducing, and does nothing to actually cover the smoke.  In short, it only makes things worse.

Everyone seemed so pleased to learn that I would be staying here, but it was quite the disappointment. I'll give you the rundown:

1. The above-mentioned toxic fumes.
2. We arrived to visibly broken furniture in our room that we had to call down about.  Housekeeping had been in there, so there was no way it went unnoticed, just unreported or unfixed.
3.There was a pile of room service dishes sitting in the hallway when we checked in at 1:30 that were still there when I called and begged them to take care of at 4:30 the next day! People had been tripping over them and subsequently spreading them around the hallway.   
4. The housekeeper left a dirty rubber glove in the middle of our bathroom, long pieces of string in two different parts of the room, and tried to come in and clean our room before 8:30 in the morning.

Everything is as you would expect in a luxurious Vegas hotel and the Bella suite didn't disappoint us. My only gripe about this place is really the proximity of the Venezia to the casino area. You literally have to take two different elevators just to get to the casino level, which made it seem like a journey all on its own. Not even the elevators were very large and were almost never private. 

This hotel has a vast array of shops and levels that I can never keep up with. The casino area is very nice and the people that frequent this resort are more mature here.

The security is first class at the Venetian. We had an incident in our suite where some random stranger was knocking repeatedly on our door (he had the wrong suite) in the middle of the night around 5 am. I phoned the front desk and they sent security up right away and they handled the situation without further incident. They even check room keys before letting u to the suite area and that's obviously a huge plus.

Pros: Very Luxurious; Shopping; Mature Patrons

Cons: Lots of walking; Maybe location on the strip; Okay restaurants",2,0,0

The hotel itself looks classy, sophisticated, something you def want to check out when your on the strip because of their incredible paintings and shops.  

It's elegant none the less but I honestly thought the rooms were going to be a lot more elegant.  The amenities like the soap, lotion, shampoo etc smell great!  I took extra home with me :) We had room 27 on floor 18.  

As soon as we got there, we were lost.  I guess they're rebuilding inside so we had to walk sooooooooooo much just to find parking, find the elevators and wait about 10 mins because so many darn people are trying to get on the elevators, then we had to go downstairs and walk a couple more minutes until we found the check in, then we waited to check in, walked a couple more minutes to find the escalators to go back up the stairs, find the elevators to take us to our room, go down this long hall until FINALLY we get to our room.  

Valet waiting here is about 10 mins.  That's how long we waited.   Just park your car, it's a lot faster.  Save yourself a couple of bucks.

I liked how the had a tv in the restroom so when I would take a warm bath, I could just flip the tv on :)  (The tvs looked kinda old, they really need to upgrade their tvs)

Our toilet for some reason would just keep flushing itself, talk about a waste of water!

Overall it was ok but I think it's a little to highly talked about for what you get.  I'd rather stay at the Vdara.  :)

For $199\/night on the weekends and $119 on a weekday, the Venetian offered complimentary Phantom\/Blue Man Group Tickets (the best seats in the house, btw), $50 game play, free admission and drinks at LAVO & Tao (with your play tickets), and food & drink discounts. Needless to say, we booked that trip fast. Vegas MUST be struggling to be handing out deals like these!

Our trip was immaculate, as expected. The Venetian houses suite rooms with a fridge, two tvs, extremely comfy beds, a HUGE bathroom with vanity, standing shower, and tub. It's one of the few times that I don't mind staying in a hotel room ALL day because of the amenities that it offers. You'll get bathrobes in the bathroom and even a little box with a sewing kit, nail file, q-tips, shower cap, and cotton pads. Hey, I'm big on the little things.

It's famous for its painted, beautiful ceiling and fancy interior and exterior as well as their canals indoor. I mean what could go wrong in terms of their service, rooms, or quality? 

Surprisingly, many things. The front desk lady that we happened to be stuck with was rude and unhelpful. After getting us our cards to our rooms, she simply just didn't give any more information about the hotel. We literally went in hanging on to the hotel brochure everywhere we went. There were many times when my family had to blindly walk around, trying to figure it all out ourselves. We got a suite, and it happened to have a terrible and just bad view. 

When my family and I first went in to our room, our bed sheets smelled like old, moldy clothes.  In the restroom, there were coins left on the counter.  One time, the maid left a dirty rag beside the sink in the restroom. One thing for sure.The maids have a very strange way of cleaning things.

Even the small toilet room in the restroom had a small lingering smell of mold or wastes. The sink drain didn't working, so the water took time to drain. The shower stall drainage didn't work either. We had to call in the plumber. I mean I felt like I'm the one in charge of making sure everything works and the place is clean. It's not like we're staying at a Motel across the street for 60 dollars per night. 

We're paying so much to stay here, and the room was left in an unkempt and sloppy state.   It makes me wonder what else they left behind or what else they left behind to clean. This is the most basic thing a hotel should be on target with: sanitation. 

Another thing that I strongly recommend to take note: This place is not kid friendly! The rooms are at the backside of the casino, so you had to go through the Casino in order to reach your room. Ladies in revealing clothes and couples smuggling each other are all over the place when you're simply trying to go to your room. If only the location of how it was built might have been different, this place would have been better. 

Sum it up: The Venetian is for 18 and plus. Not for kids. It is a major attraction, commercialized all over the media, but does not even hold up to decent sanitation. Service people treat you like you're an inconvenience. High-end brand name stores if your pockets are overflowing with money. A lot of bars, expensive restaurants, and cheap food court ones. 

It's beautiful on the outside and atrocious on the inside. It's like those colorful and gorgeous flowers you find in the jungle that are really poisonous.",8,3,1

But now that pot is legal in Nevada, the stink of weed is everywhere in this hotel. I can tolerate it by the elevator or other common areas. I can't tolerate it when I walk into my room and it reeks because someone in another room is toking up and the odor has carried through the vents. The Venetian's current solution to this is to send an air purifier and air freshener to your room. Unacceptable! Increase the fine for smoking in the room, and bring a drug dog around to sniff under doors-- you'll ""weed out"" the smoking guests quickly that way. 

I can't believe a 5 star property is allowing this to happen! Hope they take more decisive action soon.",6,5,0

Maybe it's because I had just come from the real Venice in Italy when I visited this hotel; I found it totally pretentious and way too pricey. There are reproductions of famous scenes from Venice and the Vatican which are unnecessary and obnoxious. Maybe they are trying to emulate the real Venice because the last time I was there (April 09) I got clipped for 38Euro for two cups of coffee and a piece of cake in the Piazza San Marco. 

Vegas hotels and casinos make enough money from their gambling operations to discount food and lodging substantially - this is not the case at the Venetian. Greed is the name of the game here. 

I had a one-room suite with a living room. The room was very spacious and clean and the beds were soft and comfortable. It may take some time, a military co-ordinance map, and GPS to find your room - but once there they are great.

I've been to Vegas 6 times and this was my first stay at the Venetian. I've stayed at The Hilton, The Bellagio, The Tropicana, The Luxor, and New York, New York. Aside from The Luxor, the Venetian has been my most disappointing stay. Granted, the disappointment probably came from my expecting more of a luxury experience. It was no different than staying at New York, New York and given the price different, I think it should have been. 

When we arrived at around 11AM on a Wednesday the check-in line was insane (we noticed later that there was ALWAYS a line). We ended up waiting about 45 minutes before getting our room key. Once we did get our room key, the walk from the front desk to our room in the Venzia tower was a good 15-20 minute CONFUSING walk. Nobody even offered to carry our bags up to our room, not that I often accept the offer, but with that walk, I probably would have. Now, I will say, our room was pretty big and would accommodate 4 people nicely. It is pretty much how it appears in the on-line pictures. I also loved how big the bathroom was. As I understand it, all of the Venetian rooms are suites, which is nice. But, once we looked around our room a little, we discovered leftover food in the minibar and dirty pillow cases. We called the front desk on THREE different occasions, over the course of two days, before they actually removed the food from the minibar. For the star rating the Venetian gets, I expected more. I did not feel very special, as a guest at the Venetian. I feel that way at most Vegas hotels, but really, I though the Venetian ranked higher than the average Vegas hotel. I was wrong. 

Anyway, the decor is old and run down. If you walk next door to the Palazzo, you can see a marked difference. If I had it to do again, I might opt to stay there instead. Definitely newer and more nicely kept. We did walk through to the spa\/pool area in the Palazzo, which Venetian guests can use, and it was very impressive. 

Anyway, aside from a few restaurants I've eaten in and enjoyed at The Venetian, it definitely didn't impress me. I would not stay there again. If you get a really, and I mean really good deal, then it MIGHT be ok to stay at the Venetian, but for their normal rates...no way.

If your company is paying for it, though, you may find the prices around the resort to be quite high.  That was our situation - we didn't have to pay for the room, but we sure spent a lot in the rest of the resort!

The check-in process was reasonably smooth, and check-out was easy with their Express Checkout service.  The actual hotel is not particularly fancy - the rooms are enormous and well-appointed, but the hallways are pretty dismal.  The high-speed internet works fine (but bring your own cable, theirs is way too short) and the fax in the room is a nice touch.  You will not be able to print to the fax machine unless your laptop has a parallel port, though - and most don't anymore.

But don't expect to spend a lot of time in your room, anyway.  There is plenty to see and do at the Venetian!  The casino is fairly highbrow all the way around, but there are plenty of nickel slots and a few penny slots too.  Table limits vary and are comparable to other casinos.  The shopping mall area (""Grand Canal Shoppes"") is very nice to walk through, but if you don't have a lot of cash, you'll just be window shopping!  If you catch one of the Living Statue displays and want to take a picture...leave a tip, it's the nice thing to do!

The Venetian's main attractions are Phantom of the Opera (which is indeed on all the Muzak pipes) and the Blue Man Group.  I didn't see either one, and I only saw people going to Phantom on one night even though I was there for a week.  The other big attraction is Tao, which is an exclusive restaurant\/club with an Asian theme.  The bouncer let me through to peek at the menu, and the prices were astounding!

I do want to give commendation to the business center and package center staff.  Both were incredibly helpful, friendly, and courteous.

I ate at several places at the Venetian - the food court, the gelato place (both in the Shoppes), the Grand Lux Cafe, Zeffirino, and Noodle Asia.  I have written a separate reviews for the restaurants I visited.  The food court was by far the best value - Shake'n'Burger was especially inexpensive, although the food was mediocre at best.",2,0,1

I was lucky that The Venetian was selected as my hotel after booking a 5 star hotel on Hotwire. This was for my birthday weekend, and they offered to upgrade my luxury suite to the hospitality suite for a low additional cost. 

Our suite was twice the size of a luxury suite with a bar and double door entrance to a beautiful bathroom. My experience here definitely made my birthday weekend simply amazing! Service is always superb and staff was very friendly and attentive. I always recommend rooming here, especially if it's for a special occasion or if you just want to splurge for the luxurious experience.

Great location towards the North end of the Strip. Close to all my favorite places so cab fare is never a killjoy.

And of course, one of the best things about The Venetian is that Grand Lux Cafe is downstairs and open 24 hours!",3,0,1

Tao is in house, so with a mere phone call upon arrival, you're on the guest list.  

There's also shopping on the property, with the gondola and the faux perfect sky ceiling - which creates the sense of being outside without having to brave the desert heat.

Grad Lux is on site.  They're connected to the cheesecake factory, and have a varied menu.  The bread is yum.  The drinks are yum.  You will find people here in all stages of undress and fanciness...and soberness.  EXCELLENT people watching.  Coming here and ordering something to go will be faster than room service.

1. When I arrived I found a beer bottle cap on the couch, yuck is that how they cleaned the rest of the room?

2. Not enough towels, only  three small ""bath"" towels for the suite

3. No headphone cord to plug my MP3 player into the radio or TV.  When I called to request one they said the IT department was closed for the night.  Every other hotel I've stayed at provides those cords automatically in every room.

4. Staff at Morels restaurant (in the Palazzo) are rude, even the manager.  The manager refused to provide us with a 20% off discount because I forgot the coupon in my room.  So, I had to walk to my room in the Venetian and go back to the Pallazo (10 mins walk each way).  Rude!  When I came back he said he took the 20% off anyways, that he just misunderstood me...whatever I speak clear English and everyone else at our table of 6 understood.

5. Staff at clubTao were also rude.  The concierge desk confirmed that we would be on the list for free entrance but the ""bouncers"" would not even check for our names.

6. When I spoke to a ""Jacob"" (he said he was the manager) at the front desk he said there was nothing he or the Venetian could do about the restaurant or the club because they were separate from the hotel.

In summary, stay somewhere else.  The Wynn and Aria have much better customer service.  Don't waste your money and don't let the Venetian ruin your fun in Vegas.  Stay elsewhere.",2,1,1

He had NO idea it was coming and was totally stoked when I told the cab driver to head to the Venetian. The place still has a good name for itself.

The hotel is central to everything on the strip - and if you know Vegas, you know location is vital. We got a great rate on a luxury suite (their most basic room), which was a nicely sized split-level suite with an L-shaped couch and a big comfy king-sized bed. Overall the room was clean, but the furniture was very old and dated.

It can be hard to snag space by the pool, mostly because rude people try to save their chairs with towels, or abandon their seats without picking up after themselves. Just snag one of the pool attendant girls and tell her you're having trouble finding a spot and she'll make it happen while you order a cocktail at the bar. Problem solved. Tip them for the trouble they save you!

You can get pretty yummy and affordable breakfast at Grand Luxe downstairs. They had great coffee!

The Venetian is a pretty solid hotel, and I would recommend it to friends if they found a good rate, but I wouldn't go out of my way to repeat our visit because I prefer more up-to-date decor.

The room has a separate tub and stand up shower, the toilet has a door and private area away from the shower so you can handle your business, 2 sinks, a separate vanity area for you to get ready, huge mirrors in the bathroom and a full body mirror on the way out the hotel room so you can make sure everything about your outfit is Hawwtt!

True, I've never been to any of the other fancy hotels, like Geoff D. mentioned (the Mandalay, Mirage, MGM), so I have no basis for comparison, and I have to admit that if I'd actually had to pay for it, I might have been tempted to take off a star or two, but luckily I got to stay there as a guest. The Venetian literally makes me suck my breath in. I almost gave it 4 stars (taking off a star for the fact that you need a GPS to navigate your way around) but... I just can't do it. Aaaaaagh. 

The Venetian Hotel is a lot like Gavin Newsom, for 5 reasons (I'd give Mayor G 4 stars but since I got to stay at the Venetian for free I feel like I should give them a higher rating).

1. It's ridiculously nice despite its shortcomings (there was a staff member at every other corner making sure you didn't get lost). 

2. It's not afraid to take chances. Mayor Gavin will forever be dear in my heart for standing up for gay rights, despite what it looked like to the Republicans... during election time... ok lets not go there. But I still love you Newsom. Likewise, who'd have thought painting bright fluffy white clouds over a blue sky on the shopping mall ceiling would work?! But It's awesome.

3. Yeah, it's a little messed up and can cause a state of confusion (and not just the should-I-cheat-on-my-husband \/ Ruby Tourk type). I am very bad with directions and got totally lost trying to find my way around (Wait...  you mean... uh... go up to the tenth floor to get to the first floor? Whaaaa?). I heard 3 people say ""I feel like I'm stuck in a MAZE!"" 

4. No matter how many times I see it, it still makes me think, Ho-ly Jesus how did God come up with something so pretty to look at (and dudes, do not EVEN try to say you wouldn't think the same if Cindy Crawford was mayor). I LOVE the design and layout of the rooms. The colors, everything. The draperies were gorgeous, and it's great to feel like you're in a parlor, going down a step or two to the next level where the TV (SECOND set) is.  Huge fluffy bathrobe in the closet. Fine toiletries. But the very best thing for me is the shower. It's a bit like standing in front of a fire hydrant and getting blasted with hot water. Totally awesome. This place doesn't leave details to chance.

And lastly,

5.  Loooord only knows what kind of down and dirty stuff is going on behind those closed, fancy white doors. 

Geoff D. had a good point, if you only spend a few hours a night there, $350 is a big wad to drop (what is that, almost 90 bucks an hour?). But if you're allergic to crowds like I am, it's not a bad place to hole up in.",2,2,3

Finally i stayed here after receiving 3 free nights.

Let me start off by saying WOW!

Rooms was a suite as all rooms at venetian are. King bed. Sofa and 2 solo seats. Office table. 2 tvs. Bathroom had tub and shower seperatly. Vanity table. 2 sinks. Toilet seperatly. Carpets so clean i could of slept on it. Place was super clean.

I'm rarely in the rooms but it's nice to come back to a nice room such as this.

I shall stay again if i get it for free. I can't see myself paying $200-$350 a night depending on days.

We had two full bathrooms and a powder room, two living room areas, two bedrooms (one with a king, the other with two queens), two couch beds, another living space, dining room, and foyer.  This was a great idea for our group because we all had a meeting place, somewhere to comfortably keep our stuff, and plenty of bathroom space.  Our room was spotless and the maid service did a very good job of keeping the place clean.  The bathrooms were huge, especially the one off the king bedroom.  The bathtub was huge and had water jets which was very relaxing.  The toilet was closed off from the rest of the bathroom making it easier for a group getting ready.  The rooms had plenty of closet space as well.  

The reason I have to take off one star is because there wasn't a kitchen in a suite that could accommodate so many people.  There was only a refrigerator and a sink.  Also, half of the stuff in the refrigerator is weight sensor and part of the minibar, so you can only use half of it really.  It would have been nice to have had at least a microwave in there.  

Other than that, the room was very comfortable and had plenty of space.  The windows were huge and made the room feel a lot bigger.  The dining area was also a very good size; the table was set for four people but could have fit more people if needed.

The location of the hotel itself is perfect with access to the strip, and it is in the middle of all the main action.  It's easy to get through the casino to the elevators to the rooms and the elevators are very quick.  

There is a main concierge for the standard rooms and then a private concierge for suites.  I went with a few of my friend there because we were told that if you booked a suite, you can get into any other their clubs (including Tao) free of entry fees.  You have to call ahead or go to the concierge to make sure your name is on the list ahead of time.  We got in right away to Tao and had no problems, we just had to let them know our names and that we were staying in a suite.

Overall, a great hotel, clean rooms, helpful service, and great location.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone!",1,0,0

-one of the dealers in the lobby ruined me and the other 5 people sitting at the black jack table
-the canal floor was a bit strange. I used to think it was beautiful, but we ate dinner up there and things just got weird.

We were leaving sunday night at 11 PM so we had a full 12 hours from check out to leaving Las Vegas.

And as if fate, the Gods of gambling, Ala etc. took pity on my poor soul and bestowed VGL (Virgin Gambler's Luck) upon me.

Overall the Venetian is very impressive with its miles of hallways and corridors saturated with sensory overload.  As you walk through the vast spaces, the decor turns your head in every angle and your eyes shift rapidly just to keep up with the hotel's beauty.  

I have stayed in a few 5 to 7 star hotels previously and my rating is based on service, amenities, functionality of the room, comparison to other luxury hotels and overall appearance.   

While driving up to the hotel I noticed there was a sign that read registration and another that read valet.  I proceeded to valet to find that I was in the mall valet, a good distance away from the hotel check-in.  My wife and daughter were too eager to stay in the car any longer, after the long journey, so we used the mall valet and carried our bags through the mall, through the casino and eventually arrived at check-in.

  We joined the small line of other guest and I was prompted by a slightly smug, yet professional bellhop.  The bellhop escorted my family and I to the next available staff member.  Jeremiah issued us with our room keys, maps, and vouchers while engaging in pleasant conversation.  We then made our way to our room, which was comparable to walking a few city blocks.  The room was tastefully decorated in modern Venetian design. The beds were the highlight of the suite because they were so comfortable.  The bathroom doors did not shut properly, did not have turn handles, and the shower just ok because it was a slightly above average shower head on a 45 degree angle.  There were not many wall plugs and the ones available were in awkward places.  Additionally, there was not a coffee pot within the room and for my wife who is a coffee addict .(this was a problem)  I was impressed with the number of pools, gym (rock climbing wall) and spa amenities located around the hotel and I was informed that the Venetian is the largest spa in the united states.  I only wish I could have stayed a little while longer to enjoy them.  We checked out promptly at 11 am, the standard checkout time.

What was supposed to be a very relaxing couple of days time off, upon check-in, our suite was not ready. Our desk clerk Lamar apologized and was trying to get us checked in as quickly as possible. He looked for any other available suites (which there were none) and said there is another suite available bigger with an upgrade $168 which he assured me was not going to be charged to us due to our room not being ready . He was very nice ,  accommodating and very professional . I am big on customer service. Thank you Lamar.

Receiving the statement, I noticed we were charged the upgrade fee of $168 per night( we stayed 3 nights) =$504 in upgrade fees. Of course I called to dispute and explained my conversation with Lamar at check-in. I was in contact with the accounts payable manager Jonathan James, who said at the time since we signed and agreed to the stay,he would NOT be able to reverse the charges. He was very argumentative, and did not seem I had a valid dispute,  upon asking to speak to his superior, (Jaime Dorado, hotel manager) he did not display the professionalism The Venetian has been known for( very disappointing).

Upon speaking to Ms Dorado she was quickly apologetic for the miscommunication and  refunded me $504 immediately 

At this level of hospitality I should not have been given the grief and lengthy tactics  Mr James had put me through .

I've walked around The Venetian dozens of times. I love the shopping mall because of the painted sky and the miniature canal running through the main plaza with the gondola ride is just too cute to boot. I've also seen The Phantom of the Opera show here and the theater was very nice.

Needless to say I've also been to TAO and TAO Beach quite a few times as well. I feel like Tao is the staple club that I visit whenever I come to Vegas...it's alright.

Lovely employees at check in and out. Waitresses could be better. When gambling I could never find one as they catered to the men who are the high rollers. I'd say the waitresses were pretty bad.

This was my vacation and I wanted my drinks while gambling. So I'm going to give my rating a 4 star. Would've been 5 if the waitresses were not blowing me off. That really ruined my gambling experience. At least if I had a good buzz, losing wouldn't hurt that bad. Bad, bad waitresses. My husband had a work convention so I was alone in the day. I couldn't even get my drink on. Poolside waitresses were way better.",0,0,0

(Actually, that comparison might not make any sense whatsoever, but I'm leaving it because I love that line for some reason.) 

Three main take-aways from my three-night stay at the Venetian:

1.  The place is massive.  
Public spaces are crawling with people, including the usual assortment of cliche Vegas characters:  twits, schmucks, hustlers and greaseballs of all backgrounds (but the jackass factor here was noticeably lower than it was over at the Palms, for whatever that's worth.  I'm not a Vegas aficionado, so my grasp of the relative knob factor from property to property is limited at best).

2.  The rooms are big and spacious, but weirdly unstylish.  
The bed area is fine, but the living room furniture reminded me of my Grandmother's place in Jersey circa 1980.  I was looking around for the box of Thin Mints and glass of 7-Up that she always hooked me up with.  Had to settle for a Heineken and some Kit Kats out of the mini-bar.  

3.  The gym is excellent.  
It is also expensive @ $80 for a 3-day pass, but excellent.  And underused.  Only a handful of people there each time I used it.  All the equipment options you could want and little competition for using it. 

Other assorted notes:

- Bring something to entertain yourself in the check-in line.  Maybe a Nintendo DS, your blackberry a yo-yo, whatever.  Felt more like an airport security line than checking into a hotel (see picture).  Yikes.

- Bathrooms are huge and have a nice lil' TV for your viewing pleasure (plus, with their channel lineup you can watch random Asian game shows while you shave.  Beat that.)

- Service might need a little prompting if you're not a 'whale'.  The key I was given upon check-in didn't work.  I learned this after it took 20 minutes to pick up some food to-go at the San Gennaro stop in their food court (took crazy long time for them to serve the 5 people ahead of me) and I had trekked the additional 8 minutes through the casino, over to the elevator and then all the way to the end of the hall to my room (suite 14329).  Called the front desk on my cell and they said it could take 30 - 45 minutes for security to come get me into the room.  I calmly suggested that wasn't optimal for me.  After a brief hold I was then told they'd try to put a rush on it.  Wound up waiting only about 5 minutes.  But it still kind of stank to be sitting there feeling my dinner getting cold in the bag waiting for security to correct what should be just about the most basic hotel \/ guest interaction possible.  

Would I stay there again?
Sure.  Why not?  Great gym.  Seemed convenient enough to everything I needed to get to.  The Canal Shop and restaurants in the Piazza San Marco were nice enough.  But I really don't have a lot of Vegas experiences to compare it to.

Did it seem like a good value?
Hard to say, as I was here during CES, which is the busiest week of the year for them and probably also when prices are the steepest.  Think my (work expensed) room averaged $400\/night for the three nights. Not cheap.  But the room was bigger than many 1-bedroom city apartments.

5 = Spectacular
4 = Better than average, really enjoyed it

I've stayed in the Venetian once; in a king bed room. The grandeur of this hotel is it's main allure- and honestly, I just feel it's aging out. Maybe it's a part of the generational gap, but my parents absolutely love this hotel and my fiancé and I just don't have the same appreciation. The price of our room wasn't terrible- comparable with other high end resorts on the strip. With tax or total was around $180 a night- which compared to other major cities around the US was not terrible at all. 

The room was clean with modern Victorian décor. The hotel is decorated with rich tones that make the rooms feel very warm and elegant. The room fit the rest of the hotel perfectly and was exactly what I expected in the Venetian. The sheets were clean, the pillows were firm, the bathroom was filled with all of the complimentary toiletries you could desire. The room was spacious with thick black-out curtains that easily allowed us to sleep in after late nights out and about. 

This hotel caters to an older crowd and isn't necessarily family friendly. It's one of the best hotels for relaxing around the pool- as the pool here tends to be quiet and rarely gets crowded. There's almost always seating available- although earlier in the day many of the seats are in the shade. You need to wait until around 10:00 AM for most of the seats to be in the sun. There are two large well-kept pools that allow plenty of space for swimming. Although there are a couple families, the majority of the crowd tends to be couples and older individuals. 

The rest of the hotel is equally as nice as the rooms. There is a large shopping center filled with many high-end shopping choices. There is a food court with a few decent options (but be forewarned that the prices in this food court tend to run high). There are also a couple decent bars ranging from beer-geared pubs to cocktail establishments. 

This hotel is the Vegas version of upscale. A bit gawdy and overdone. It's a place of 'riches' for upper middle class individuals. The shops are often visited by random celebrities- and if you visit between mid morning and early afternoon you're likely to catch a glimpse of at least one person who is 'some person'. Service wise, the hotel staff are no better than a more affordable alternative in the same area. Their amenities are practically the same. This place is quiet and caters to mostly adults- which is nice if you hope to avoid children. I'd definitely recommend it for couple's retreats, anniversaries, and honeymoons. But if you're just traveling to Vegas for a vacation and are open to considering an array of options- I think you could get a better bang for your buck elsewhere.",1,2,1

We stayed in the Venezia tower, which is 10 floors up. It is slightly inconvenient since we need to go through the elevators twice to get to our room. On the plus side, the Venezia tower lobby had a much shorter line when checking out. Noelani even printed out our southwest boarding passes for us. That saved us the inconvenience of having us check in at the airport. 

Two cons - they knock on the door to check if you got your chocolates. There's another time they knocked for some odd reason and woke me up in the morning. I think someone stole our privacy sign.  I was oh so tired and cranky.

A few pluses. They honored the $40 off per seat on our Phantom tickets since it was a promotion for staying at the hotel. We booked the seats after we booked the hotel but didn't get a promotion code back then. Everyone was super friendly. The security guy by the hotel elevators are all very nice. When I was rushing back from the pedicure at canyon spa for dinner at Tao, my flimsy spa slippers broke and I was walking barefoot, as not to mess up my pedicure and he told me to watch out for fallen glasses.

I tried to request it on my way to the room and was told I had to call from my room phone. So I called from the room phone and the furniture was delayed because they wrote the room number down wrong.  The final straw was a hotel staffer delivering a fridge entering our room at 10:40 pm with a slight knock and no delay. He was in the room before I even got out of the bed.

Venetian is the home to TAO and its sister hotel Palazzo has Lavo. These two clubs play all the right dancing music and has just enough space for you to dance.

I really enjoyed my stay here except ONE thing.... the phone service sucks if you are in your room! I stayed in the Bella suites thi weekend in the Venizia tower and it was like a dead zone, it took forever to get texts and for any thing internet related to come through. It was important for my phone to work since I was with a large group!

Oh and one other thing, we were told we would get half off room service if we mentioned a certain staffs name, we used this twice and got 50% off our entire order but the third time they told us that they never had a promotion like that. (???)",0,0,0

The bathrooms are large by Vegas standards, with soak in tubs and vanity table. There were ten pools to pick from, they had to provide a map for pools alone. Restaurants in the resort are excellent, so many options, we went to Bouchon and it was yummy.

The bad: They overcharge you for gambling: limits went to $50 and stayed there, no grandfathering in with the lower limits, which I thought was absurb. 

Check your final bill! The Vegas hotels are very famous for charging the room sensored refreshment on final bill, because they know people don't really check, it's not just the Venetian but other hotels on the strip do the same thing, make sure to clear it out like I did with the Venetian front desk.",2,1,1

Every room at the Venetian is a suite, with a flat screen TV in the living room area and another one in front of the bed. The mattress and pillows are so comfortable you really won't want to get out of bed in the morning. The marble bathroom is also a great feature, with a separate shower and tub (and a TV in here, too). There's lots of nice hotels to choose from on the Strip that are quite a bit cheaper, but I feel like it's worth shelling out the extra money to stay somewhere like the Venetian. 

I've stayed in both the regular Venetian tower and the Venezia tower, and both have been positive but different experiences. The Venetian tower is quite a bit bigger and very close to the Grand Lux Cafe and Bouchon Bakery. The Venezia tower has a much more secluded feel to it, and doesn't seem to be as busy as the Venetian tower. In terms of entertainment, if you really didn't want to leave your hotel you probably wouldn't have to. Blue Man Group and Phantom of the Opera are permanent attractions here, and i've seen both of them. Blue Man Group is probably best for families\/kids, while Phantom of the Opera is a must-see even if you've seen it somewhere else before. They did an amazing job with creating this theater and customizing it for this show. TAO nightclub is located at the Venetian if you're planning on going clubbing at night. 

Check-in and check-out on our last visit were both very smooth, and we didn't have to wait more than about 5 minutes or so. The employees here are all very professional and friendly. 

Be sure to put the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on your door before you go to sleep, because housekeeping knocked on our door at 8:30am to try to come in and clean!",0,0,0

We had the standard suite which is actually quite large and could easily fit 4 people comfortably. When I first walked in to the room, I was kind of confused. There was a lot of Asian themed things - from the clearly Chinese toiletries to the overall design themes of the room. Hey, I thought we were supposed to be at ""The Venetian?"" Anyway, this didn't really matter to me but thought it was kind of odd. 

---Likes!---
1.  BOUCHON BAKERY and ILLY! Bouchon is right next to the elevators on the main floor, next to the theater. So many wonderful things.....I'll write a separate review. Illy is in the Palazzo I think? Gosh, I'm not sure, this hotel is kind of confusing. This espresso and gelato place has sooo much yummy stuff, I'll write a separate review for Illy as well.

2.  Easy breezy valet parking! Remember to tip, folks working in the Vegas service industry seem to practically live on tips....they wait around for tips too....haha...awkward if you forget cash.

3.  The Canyon Spa. Nice place, not too upscale, low-key and has lots of services. Kind of expensive (often have deals around holidays), but there is a lot available such as rock-climbing, gym, massages, pedicures, waxing, a cafe, etc.

4.  RESTAURANTS! The Venetian\/Palazzo is home to many famous and great restaurants such as Bouchon (French restaurant), B&B, Carnevino, Grand Lux (a better Cheesecake Factory) and more! I'll write a separate review for B&B, Carnevino, and Grand Lux. 

5. Check-in\/Check-out was a breeze. The front desk people were nice and efficient. Why of course, it's a busy hotel, they get a lot of practice I assume.

1. Ok, please don't get me wrong - the rooms are nice but I was underwhelmed by the maintenance of the rooms. A lot of things were dusty or askew. The toilet seat was sort of off and the area underneath the sink was partially finished with tiles or paint missing. Looks kinda gross...haha. 

2. Oy...the blinds are so hard to close or open! I understand why the windows aren't openable but why not the blinds? So annoying. 

3. Ew some minor stains on the carpet and couches. Maybe we had a lemon of a room. I don't know man....haha. 

4. Confusing layout for first time visitors. Where am I? Is this technically the Palazzo or Venetian? How did I end up at the wax museum? Haha....It gets better after a while of windingly walking around but man, make sure you pay attention to how you get around!

5. Yes, I know we're at ""The Venetian."" Oooh big deal - no real excuse for stupidly high minimums at gaming tables. The only ""break"" we saw was a special $10 minimum blackjack table on Christmas day and some complimentary gaming...but who wants that? No thrill, haha....",3,3,2

I was actually amazed by the size of the room we got. If I still have the pictures on my phone I'll upload them later. The girl at the front desk was extremely nice and very cute. Since the security deposit was going on my Credit Card naturally I had quite a few questions to ask. She answered them all perfectly and made the check in process go smoothly.

Having to walk thru the casino floor to reach the elevators to our room, and also the guard standing at the elevators who checks you for a room key I found to be slightly awkward and unneeded, but after a few days he started to recognize our group and would let me and my buddies go by unbothered.  

As everyone knows, the more time you spend at a table, the more drinks you get for free. Big change from the casinos out here in California that actually charge you $1 per hand that you play (house tax) plus every drink you order. Las Vegas knows how to take care of its players and for that I am grateful. 

I met quite a few different card dealers, one of whom was absolutely hilarious and actually advised me on when to hit or when to stand. Was definitely helpful especially since I was on a $25 minimum table. I didn't actually win any money but he helped the time go by and pretty much kept me at even throughout the night. 

GO PLAY THE SPORTS BOOK and get a Grazi (I know I spelled that wrong) membership card. I bet on all the hockey games, and won a lot of money, only to spend it all on food the next few nights. But hey, if you play your cards right in Vegas you should be eating free every night anyways. 

BEST PART: Pauly Shore walked right by us as my buddy and I were getting up from a Blackjack table. Of course my buddy made a huge scene and yelled ""Dude, thats Pauly Shore!!"" To which he turned around and made eye contact with us with a little smirk and a wink. 

Overall a great trip. If I ever go back, I would stay at the Venetian again. 

MY PRO TIP: At check in, tip the front desk worker a twenty dollar bill, and see what kind of surprises and\/or upgrades they hook you up with. Hopefully you get someone cool who understands, otherwise its only a twenty spot that you're out. Highly Recommend doing this at every hotel you stay at.",3,2,0

The hotel does a good job of emulating much about its namesake in Italy with beautiful frescos on the ceilings and a very cool indoor canal that snakes along the middle of the shopping esplanade upstairs above the casino floor.

The Canal shops feature lots of touristy and some useful shops and a wide variety of restaurants from gelato and pretzel bars to Wolfgang Puck. Kids should be well entertained with all there is to see and do and adults can enjoy the shows and shopping. Be sure to catch Blue Man Group if you have not already seen it. It's a great show.

I love the sprawling convention space here and have attended and spoken at events and everything went very well. Staff is professional. Food is mediocre at the Grand Luxe and actually not very good at all in the food court, but that is the thing with a lot of food courts right?

The restroom space is huge also! There's two sinks, a bath tub, a standing shower, a small tv hanging on the ceiling\/wall & the toilet is in a small room on it's own. The best part about this restroom is the beauty counter! You can sit down when you put your makeup on.
The livingroom area includes a large Lshaped couch that can sleep two people, a round dining table with 3seats, and an office table. They also have a fax\/copier by the office table so it's nice for those who are there to work; you can print materials in your room or send out faxes.

We were at the table for quite some time when the display monitor malfunctioned and reflected that a specific number had been hit 5 times in a row. We indicated the error to the dealer who said sometimes that happens, but did nothing to fix it. The supervisor came over and saw the problem as well, but took no action. Obviously people walking by were excited to see the same number hitting so many times in a row, but we told them the display was malfunctioning. The dealer contradicted us and LIED to new patrons at the table, saying she did in fact hit the same number multiple times! This floored us, especially when we got into a back and forth with her about it and the supervisor was right there witnessing. Needless to say everyone left the table but as soon as we were all gone, a new batch of people were drawn in by lie on the monitor of the same number hitting multiple times.

I was surprised at this level of deceit by a supposedly higher end casino. The worst part is we complained about the situation to a supervisor later in the day and filled out a written statement with contact information. The response from the supervisor was that we can keep the pen and a coupon for a free drink from the casino bar. We received no follow up contact and it appears the Venetian just slid this one under the rug. I bet this happens all the time. Keep your money for a more honest establishment.",1,0,0

In particular, I love the human statues and have often wondered what the pay rate is to stand completely still for an hour.

Other than a fabricated taste of Venice, what you'll find when staying at The Venetian is value! I stayed in the luxury suites a year ago and the rooms are spacious at an affordable rate. More than enough space to sleep 4+ and the bathrooms are huge! There are restaurants, shopping, nightlife and gambling located all within the hotel and you really don't even have to leave the building if you're feeling extra lazy. 

If you do choose to see the light of day or the strip, The Venetian is centrally located on the strip and there are lots of other fabulous destination (Fashion Show Mall & The Wynn) located right next door.

Not to say that The Venetian was a bad hotel or anything.  It is in a pretty good location and the hotel itself is gorgeous.  

The small details really made it an incredible hotel, there's so much to see and the fact that the Palazzo and The Venetian are connected makes it even better because you can walk between the two hotels.  The rooms at The Venetian are basically identical to the Palazzo if you've ever been to one and not the other.  Although I found the Palazzo rooms to be a bit more modern and slightly nicer.  The bathroom is and always probably will be my favorite aspect of the Venetian rooms.  The lighting in there is amazing and there are so many mirrors.  There's literally mirrors everywhere, perfect for selfies and mirror pictures.  It is definitely a luxury hotel.  

However, here's why I would much rather stay at the Palazzo.  It is so much more convenient, especially if you end up in a room at the Venezia tower.  If you end up with a room in the Venezia tower, get ready for the longest walk of your damn life.  I was carrying my duffel bag which was heavy, and a few other bags so needless to say it was not a happy walk.  If you are trying to get to the Venezia tower from the regular guest suites entrance you will have to take the elevator to the 10th floor then walk down a hallway to another elevator and take that up to your room suite floor.  If you go that route it's a lot of walking through hallways because you have to take an elevator then walk down a long hallway then take another elevator.  So here's a slight shortcut, by the check in desk there's a hallway that leads to a few elevators that will take you to Bouchon, take those elevators instead.  It will dump you where the pool area is and it is a much shorter walk then if you were to take the guest suite elevator in the casino area.  

I do recommend staying here if you cannot stay at the Palazzo.  The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are super luxurious and there's a ton of food places nearby.  The pool is great!  However, drinks are super expensive.  I got a gin and tonic and a margarita and price + tip came out to be $40!  Oh and a perk I thought was good about this hotel was that there are not a lot of children running around everywhere.  I did see a few families but the hotel was not overrun with them which was great!",7,4,4

Location: Located right on the strip, The Venetian is centrally located to popular destinations such as the Wynn\/Encore, Treasure Island, Fashion Mall, Caesars Palace and more! You won't run out of any activities and with the shops at the Palazzo you may not even need to leave the confines of the hotel for shopping, dining or entertainment.

Suites: All the rooms at the Venetian are full sized suites. That means separate living\/bedroom area and huge bathroom complete with marble fittings.

Walk into our hallway and notice a group of 10 - 15 guys at the end of the hallway.

Or smoke in your pals room but seriously dudes?  In the hallway?  I had to walk though all of them with my kid.  We get in our room and shut the door but guess what.  The smoke is creepin on in.  Lovely.  Yes- I know we're in Vegas and I expect for people to smoke but maybe not right outside my door.  So as soon as my friend called and said the front desk found us adjoining rooms at the Palazzo, we packed up and moved on over.  Glad the front desk was so awesome!!",1,0,1

+ The Venetian is pretty. Not the most gorgeous\/ unique room I've ever been in, but very nice.

+ The Bella suites are large enough to accommodate a number of adults comfortably.

+ Convenient location, Strip-wise

- Every single person I interacted with, except for the entertainment-type people (gondola people, cabana folks) had a TREMENDOUS attitude. I understand that everyone, even the high rollers, are dime a dozen in Vegas, but we are all still customers and it was shocking how expendable they considered us to be.

- Not one person has a clue what is going on. Off the top of my head, we were told contradictory things by various staff no less than 5 times, including once where 4 different people told us 4 different things about receiving a package from the mail room.

- None of us could get wifi to work

- The safe in our room broke at check out. It took 45 minutes of speaking with people at the front desk for them to recognize this was an issue, yet they still suggested that ""in the future, everyone should leave valuables throughout and not just in one safe, so not everyone is 'held up'"" - several times. It took over an hour for the safe to be drilled open, and people nearly missed their flights. This too was met with them encouraging that people prepare to leave for the airport earlier (two hours in advance, as opposed to an hour and a half). Here's a suggestion - how about you replace safes that break down all the time, as you said they do, and\/or hire more than one repairman to fix them, when you have 7k rooms?

- Housekeeping never showed, until the date we were checking out, when they knocked at the door at 9 am. On a Sunday.

- $15 minimum tables. Hard to have a little fun as an amateur gambler.

+\/- There are a number of discounts, especially at the restaurants, that they are not up front about. Be sure to ask.

Note: The restaurants in the hotel were really good (went to Bouchon twice, and a mexican place in the Canal Shoppes that had a pretty good happy hour), and the cabana was probably the most enjoyable part of our trip. The cabanas at the Venetian pool are directly next to overly-crowded, tiny-pool-ed Tao beach, and are significantly cheaper, yet you can still hear the DJ, and everyone is having a great time. Chase was our host and he was the only person at the Venetian who was fun and acted like he appreciated our business.

Overall: if\/ when I go back to Vegas, I would either stay in a cheaper\/ more gimmicky hotel OR stay in one of the other supposedly big boys, but one where I know they will appreciate my business when I bring in 10 people who are all staying, eating, gambling, and clubbing all weekend.",0,0,0

Where to start?  First off, the Palazzo is a newer section of the Venetian-Palazzo hotel.  The Palazzo was added years after the Venetian was here and it's a welcome addition for sure.  

Between the two hotels you have over 7000 rooms so it's huge to put it lightly.  There is a wonderful shopping mall called The Canal Shops"" which is one of the nicest shopping areas in Las Vegas and it houses many of the top brands in the world.  There are also many of the top restaurants in Las Vegas here as well.  You can easily come to the Venetian or the Palazzo for a week, never leave the facility and never get bored.  But then, this is Vegas baby and you need to get out and see what the city has to offer.  

The rooms here are what I believe are some of the nicest in the city.  Even the basic rooms have full baths with a soaking tub, walk in glass showers, dual sinks, separated toilet and floor to ceiling marble.  They are spectacular.  Did I forget to mention the flat screen in the bathroom too?  It has that as well.  

The beds are super comfy and the rooms are posh with two more flat screens (three total), a full fridge with tons of selections, a snack bar, huge sectional sofas all set into a sunken living room.  To continue, there are floor to ceiling windows with electric shades, dining tables for 4, etc.  The rooms won't disappoint.  

The service.  It's he best.  Period.  Need anything and I mean anything?  Ask the concierge and they will take care of it or steer you in the right direction. 

Overall, I would probably give 4.5 stars just die to the slight aging of some of hotel amenities but I'm not going to post 4 and dock this great place.  

If you want to stay at a top location in Vegas, look no further.  

Update:   9 months later and still in love with this place. 

Enjoy!!",3,0,3

This was my first time at the Venetian and I totally enjoyed this hotel! The room was spacious and very appealing to the eye. Only thing I didn't like--front desk said the bar in the room is very sensitive...so if you moved anything, you will be charged for it...hmmmm

The bed was very comfy--soft sheets etc! My fave place was the bathroom tho---huge w\/ mirrors\/glass everywhere! love dat! I enjoyed watching TV while getting myself together.

The location of the Venetian is one of the best--right in the middle. Walking distance to restaurants, macys, bloomys', walgreens(u always need that), and other other hotels near by.

I went to TAO sat nite which was cool...we were hotel guests and didn't see the guest line until we were already standing on line for 15min or so---SMH! TAO is huge----music was pretty good as well. Oh, let me not forget abt the restaurant--food was GRRRRRRRRREAT! hmmmm mmmmm mmmm good.
For app--we had thai crab cakes w\/ mango chili sauce--one of the best crab cakes if i may say so.
Main course--i had kun pao chicken....delicious! just the right amt spice and overal just really tasty! My boo had the red snapper--was ok...he enjoyed.

I made it to the gym abt 3x out of the 5days I spent-- :-) gotta keep it tight peeps. Took a spin class which was really good(apparently we snuck in). I found out later when i try to take another class that it's $20 a day to register, which always gives you access to Aquanova etc....I think the classes should be complimentary! I also went to the Canyon Ranch Spa for a few hrs---recvd' a full body massage--womp womp!:-(....i felt ok after but I've had better. My masseuse(sp) needed to soak his hands in Vit E Oil for at least 2 days---can we say rough?! and his heavy breathing was a major distraction.
All the other amenities in the spa was nice and very relaxing.

Overall--I really enjoyed myself...did just the right amt and got more than enough sleep!

I will def be back and this hotel is highly recommended.

Oh--I went to the Zumanity show at the NY NY hotel--Interesante...hahaha.",2,2,0

PRO:  Close to the major hotels.  Walking distance to Mirage, Treasure Island, Wynn and Arias. 

Hotel itself is alot of fun with the Grand Canal shoppes, the amazing Bouchon restaurant and other top notch restaurants.  You also have access to the Palazzo.  The shops there are awesome!!  TAO is a hot club.

If you are into AZN girls, there are tons of them here!

Cons:

Venetian is pricey.  We did use priceline which helped.
The hotel rooms are varied.  We booked three rooms, my room has sink noise, the doors doesnt close properly in the restroom and the toilet doesnt flush right.  

It is clean, the bed is soft and the TV is flat screen.

There are lights on the stairs (for safety) but when you go to sleep, the lights cannot be turned off and can be very bright.

The lobby is beautiful but needs more places to sit (while family members are checking in). There were many tired travelers standing around waiting and had no where to sit.

Wifi and internet is expensive, but there are many hot spots in the local area.

Tips: request a room close to the elevator unless you like to walk a LOT. Make sure to check online for specials (we were able to get $50 slot credits, 2 for 1 at the gondolas and Madame Tussauds, and $30 restaurant credit at Woo). Each special is different, but don't book without one. Sign up for Club Grazie on-line and you'll get a $15 slot credit.

You have the Wynn\/ Encore, the Aria, the Cosmo, Mandalay Bay. But for my money the Venetian is the best. I liken it to Disneyland. While other parks have better rides, Disneyland is about the whole experience. Likewise with the Venetian, it is about the whole experience, the atmosphere, the totality of the entire resort, not just individual entities. In Las Vegas there are Better hotels, there are better casinos. However the Venetian takes the best parts from it all and puts it together into a single resort where you can escape, you can get away from the chaos that occurs on Las Vegas Blvd. The hotel is superbly furnished, extremely relating and very quiet. The Casino is exciting, it is not dingy or worn down. There is no choking clouds of smoke everywhere. Then you get to the 2nd floor and are taken to Italy. You can walk ""outside"" and browse through the Grand Canal shops, Take a Gondola ride and be serenaded as you do. This is my favorite Hotel. Sure it might not have incredible fountains in its front, or doesn't have it's own buffet. But what it does have is the very thing that makes Disneyland so successful. It simply takes you away from life and transports you into a sanctuary where you can take a breath and experience a distant place without the inconvenience of the ""real world"" where what you imagined it to be, how it should be takes over for how reality really is.

There are also 2 separate elevators you have to take if you are staying in the venezia tower for the suites.  Room was great although I like lemon scented bath products better than the bitter orange stuff they use. Since I usually like pastry or biscotti for breakfast I really enjoyed the free continental breakfast special they had. Basically you can get all you can eat croissants, pastries, orange juice, fruit, or coffee. This place along with Palazzo are my go to places here in Las Vegas. The encore might have a slightly more luxurious room but the crowd there is for 50 year old country club types. Bellagio is a little too crowded and less of an authentic Italian design. Venetian is the best because you have the palazzo joint together with it. Go for a ride on the Gondola, stop at Illy(Palazzo)  and get a cafe mocha, and go to Bouchon for breakfast if you don't have the continental special.

The bathrooms are above and beyond spacious for two people.

Yes, it's definitely one of the pricier options. But if you're either a) with a bigger group of 4-6 people (or more) or b) looking for the highest-end stay while in town, The Venetian is for you! 

On the first point, this hotel is a rare suite that has more than one bed in it - though the rooms are perhaps smaller than other suites, there are a whopping 3 beds in one room (one is a pullout). The Venetian is my absolute go-to hotel when I'm with a group in Vegas. 

For those who are hoping to ball out and actually get their money's worth, The Venetian is definitely for you too! From its decor to service, The Venetian really is top-of-the-line. Being a bit further on The Strip, The Venetian also keeps out the thickest of the hoards in Vegas, so you can take a nice break from the huge crowds of tourists. 

Just trust me: you really won't regret staying here!",0,0,0

The carpet in the hallway to our room was covered in plastic, made me feel like they were removing bodies from a crime scene.
 They just remodeled the sports book and did a bad job. It is not a comfortable place to watch a game unless you like hanging out in a cubicle. 
I will say the the bartenders in the sports book know how to make you feel welcome. They remember your name, are proactive and do what they can to accommodate (and sometimes console you after your horse clears from the pack and has a 16th of a mile to go and the jockey falls off the horse for no apparent reason.

However, visiting giganto-gigante hotels can be fun. This is a very nice hotel on the Strip. The standard rooms are suite style at about 700-900 square feet with sunken living space, a foyer area which leads to huge bathroom complete with marble counters and tile floor. I felt like just staying in the bathroom with its glass shower and tub and separate water closet. I had one king bed that overlooked the sunken living room complete with L shape couch and HDTV. 

There are multiple pools to enjoy-- secluded or more public pools. 

When in LVegas there are food options galore. Did you know what I enjoyed? I liked watching the newB trainees at night practicing drown proofing and recovery exercises by going overboard and going back on board their very narrow gondoliers on the hotel's narrow 'canals'.

I have stayed at a number of hotels in Vegas but this has to be my favorite so far. The room is everything you can want for home away from home, every part of the hotel's common areas from the casino floor to hallways are well maintained, and entertainment aspects are top notch from clubs to restaurants.

Usually when I go to Vegas, I stay at an one of the above average hotels along the strip because I only stay in the room to sleep (or recover the next morning). This time I want to give the Venetian a try as I have passed through and ate at the hotel many times before. The bed is super comfortable, the bathroom is excellent with both a tub and shower, spacious his-and-her sink, and separated toilet room. At 650 square feet, the living area with a sofa and coffee table is a nice touch.

We did have a couple issues\/grips at the hotel. When we first got up to the room, we had to switch rooms because the room reeked of cigars and cigarettes in the non-smoking room. As a former smoker, the smell was a bit much even for me. We called in and switch rooms... to which they also gave us a discount when checking out for the inconvenience. The check-in and check-out process seems to have taken a lot longer here than at other hotels. The hotel layout may be confusing for some, but for someone that can walk the hotels of Vegas blindfolded, it wasn't too much of a problem for me.

One thing I did notice, the people don't seem as insane as they do in the south end of the strip. This can be both good and bad. Good because you don't have to deal with some of the d-bags out there and bad because the energy is a little more subdued because the people seem older or more mature on this side of the strip.

In the end, this was a very memorable trip thanks in part to staying at the Venetian. The rooms are slightly more expensive but it was definitely worth it in my opinion. If you want to drop the price some, go searching for coupon codes which doesn't take any time at all. Most won't work over the weekend, but I was able to find one that cut the price on Friday significantly on my Friday to Sunday trip.",0,1,0

Comfy beds, nice amenities, and a pretty central location on the strip makes it a good choice. I used the concierge service to get safety pins (fashion emergency) and they were a little slow but still were fairly on time. My one complaint about the room would be its size--I expected it to be a little bigger. It felt cramped with all the oversized furniture in the room. 

The pool is nice, but definitely could use a shot of chlorine--it was pretty cloudy, especially around the edges. The people working the pool area from the cocktails to to the towel people are on pointe--they are constantly roaming around, asking people what they need and picking things up.

I tried to book 2 suites online; chose the slightly more expensive ""view"" rooms, but the website wouldn't submit the last step and hence I called the hotel to make the reservation. The guy I spoke to asked what rate I was getting online and I told him, and he said ""yes, I get the same rate here, let me go ahead and book the rooms for you"". So we arrive here, and the view is a stone wall (will post pics in am). The front desk says: no you booked a regular room, and we've actually upgraded you to a room with patio. Me: there are at least 3 cockroaches staring at me from the patio as we speak! (Pics to come in the morning) Front desk: no problem, I'll send housekeeping. Almost an hour later housekeeping knocks on the door: where are the bugs? Me: in the patio. Housekeeping: oh we don't clean the patio, just don't open the door and you should be fine!!!! 
A hour later, 1.30 am, I've just managed to put the one year old to sleep, the phone rings; me: hello?
Front desk: hi, I was just notified that you had problems with cockroaches in the patio?
Me: we still do. Front desk: we can move you to a different room, but not until tomorrow. Me: you called me at 1.30 am to tell me you can't do anything about the problem tonight but will be able to move me to a different room in the morning? Front desk: yes. Me: thank you, now let me go try to put the baby back to sleep. It's been a wonderful stay so far. 

Let me just add that the second suite we had booked is on the opposite side of the hotel, so much for reserving rooms in advance!

We're celebrating our anniversary and my birthday, and we'd been much better off staying at home. 
The very overcharged plate of berries and bottle of ""champagne"" that I had requested at the time of reservation and asked to have in the room when we arrived, was brought up about an hour after we got to the rooms.

Anyway, maybe it was too close to the holidays but I didn't see any email\/ads\/discounts come across from Venetian\/Palazzo for 2 weeks so I resorted to booking on Vegas.com. I waited for the price to go down by $20 bucks on the offical site and for Vegas.com to match it. Using my nifty $100 gift card for $20 from Costco, I was able to save 20% on my room with an additional -$25 using coupon code: Getaway. The room was then very affordable.

I drove from Orange County Ca and it never hit over 200 so my question is what the heck happened. Then my wife opens the passenger door and notices greasy foot prints from someone's boots. First off why would someone be in the passenger seat when the car is left with the valet service. Secondly why the heck wouldn't you put down some paper or something if you have grease on your shoes. It doesn't matter that this car cost $250,000, your people should have enough common courtesy to do it for all cars. To say that I'm unhappy with your service is an understatement. Your valet manager attempted to clean the grease off my floor mats with Lysol wipes and those crappy brown towels they use in restrooms. I'm sorry but I expect more from a property like the Venetian.

We were originally given a suite in the Venetian Tower. The layout is bigger and the setup is much newer than the Venezia Tower. The bed was extremely comfortable and the sitting area is bigger. The sofa bed is a twin size bed as opposed to Venezia Tower's queen size sofa bed. Unfortunately, our stay was unpleasant the moment we set foot into the room. First, we could not close the safe because the safe was locked with the door open. My pillow had a dark stain which was gross. The sink was clogged and spat out soot. We had to call concierge multiple times to fix the problems and each time, the wait is around 30 mins. The hotel finally upgraded us to the Venezia Tower with the strip view. The suite in Venezia is much older but at least we didn't encounter more problems. 

Since we had 5 people staying, we had to call for housekeeping to bring in additional towels and such. It took a long time for calls to be picked up and once, the housekeeping took an hour to deliver the towels we needed when I was told the est. time was 15-20 minutes. Whenever we ask the front desk to upgrade or give us a late check out, they always told us that the system is down and we'll have to come back in an hour.

Top to bottom, it's just really high quality and the real deal.

Haven't stayed at Bellagio or the newest places (like Cosmo-seems amazing when I've hung out there) but I do know that if you have the money to stay anywhere, you'll be happy staying here.",0,0,0

Last week I was in Vegas with friends and upon returning to our suite the morning of Saturday the 18th we discovered that someone had BROKEN INTO OUR ROOM. Our do not disturb sign had been taken off our door and thrown into the bathroom. We had $460 in CASH, a kate spade PURSE, and TWO CREDIT CARDS STOLEN (with unauthorized charges) out of our locked room! We did not lose any of our own keys so the only people who would have access to our suite is HOTEL STAFF. 

We immediately alerted hotel security who had us file a theft report. They informed us that they had no direct access to the video surveillance or the record of what room key opened our suite. We voiced to the manager on duty, Manuel Arguello, that we felt violated and unsafe in the hotel which is when he offered to change our room. It felt as if they were doing the least they could to help our situation. 

I filed a police report with the LVMPD. I have also contacted guest services at Sands Corporation who owns The Venetian and Palazzo Las Vegas. It has been four days and I have yet to hear back; the horrible customer service runs all throughout this corporation.  

Upon researching our issue I found on Yelp and TripAdvisor that this is A COMMON PROBLEM at The Venetian! Other guest have also had property stolen by hotel staff from their rooms. The Venetian has a security issue. While talking with the security team we learned that their video surveillance is only in the elevator rooms and that is does not extend down their hallways. As a lady I found this very disturbing. I felt even less safe than before. 

Upon checking out Tuesday morning we asked to speak to management again to check on our investigation. We were informed that because we never called their claims department they had not began an investigation. Hotel staff stole from my locked room and then hotel management does NOTHING TO HELP and as a guest I had to handle everything! We were never offered any type of compensation for our loss. We lost over $800 in items and cash and they did not even offer to remove a nights fee from our six night stay. 

I will never stay at The Venetian or Palazzo again and I will never recommend it to my friends or family. I suggest finding a different hotel. I am still waiting to hear back from guest services at Sands Corporation and from the hotel investigators.",13,0,0

Our stay was on the 23rd floor from 8\/22 thru 8\/29. To give you an idea how bad it was - on our last morning we were shocked to hear hammering above us at 6:15AM. It took a couple phone calls from the room to get a live person who said they would take care of it immediately. 45 minutes later the hammering stopped but then we were serenated with sounds of a carpet kicker and screws falling on to hard floors. We are very disappointed at the front desk upon check out and I even took the extra time after our return to send an email to the Venetian to see if they would do anything after-the-fact. Sorry to say there has been no attempt and after 4 stays at the Venetian this will clearly be our last. The Wynn and the Bellagio know how to treat their guests and go to extreme efforts to make sure THEIR guests want to come back. We're disappointed more than upset and perhaps others that will read this who had similar experiences will share their stories too. Only in the hopes that the Venetian will step up to be a true 4 or 5 Star Hotel. The single star above represents their current level of guest treatment.

The gym and guest pool are ALLLL THE WAY on the other side of the hotel though. It was like a maize to get there. For someone with joint problems and needed quick knee therapy, the gym was a long walk. Staff members were alright if you needed help. You have to take multiple elevators to get pretty much everywhere within the hotel. Housekeepers were loud as my note requested them to just replenish what was needed, quietly. I wouldve given the tip had they just been in&out, but they didnt follow the request and kept knocking on the door, yelling housekeeping, and slamming doors. 

This is a very nice european inspired place to stay at. The bad thing? We stayed in the bella suites, which was nice, but whoever though abt the functionality of the room, didnt really do a good job. There was no fridge to hold food that we took back. The mini bar fridge wouldnt even do as it was not a cold fridge. The restroom had no ventilator.  The restroom room itself was inside the bathroom, so if someone was showering, you couldnt go in there as the shower was made of glass door and the tub didnt have a curtain. Also, both the restroom and bathroom door didnt have a lock... And the bathroom doors had a gap where the doors met. The walls were thin, you can hear people using the restroom\/shower.

There are two queen size beds, one pullout (which can only fit 1) and part of the couch.  Some may have to sleep on the floor but you can easily ask for additional sheets and pillows.  Because of where our particular suite was located, rollout beds were not allowed due to safety standards.

I would say that pool and gym are the best amenities there.  With the pool, you would probably have to get there early around 10 a.m. to claim a spot.  The gym even has a rock climbing wall, for an additional cost, and rowing machines powered by water.  Impressive.

Right outside the elevators to your room on the first floor is Bouchon Bakery.  Early in the morning, it may be one of the few establishments open for a quick bite so it's very convenient.  I god food from there 1-2x per day on my trip.  Also, Grand Lux Cafe is not too far away either.

Overall, the location of the Venetian is good; you could also go to Tao Beach or Tao Nightclub conveniently.  I would say it's a good spot if you're coming with a group and looking to share a room.  Look for discounts!  We had missed a deal months earlier but it still ended up being $1000 total for both nights which is decent if you're splitting that between 10 girls.",3,2,4

Why, well because it's gorgeous and I'm a sucker for a Gondola ride (that's right ladies, I'd give it up for a Gondola ride)!! Speaking of up (well a different kind of up), the one and only complaint I have about the Venetian is that I always leave with a cramp in my neck. The ceilings are unbelievable, filled with paintings, and not to mention all of the detail that goes into the molding. But back to the Gondola ride, a quarter-mile Grand Canal flows through the hotel, past the piazzas and shops. All the mean time the rest of the crowd gets to watch you or ignore you because they are too vested in the 80 international boutiques and name brand outlet stores. Cobblestone pathways filled with street performers to entertain you, and then at the end you find yourself in a large room with painted floor to ceiling walls to give that impression of being in Venice. In here you'll find multiple restaurants and more street performers to make that dinning experience so much more enjoyable. There is nothing like the Venetian unless maybe Venice herself. 

Speaking of restaurants, the Venetian is filled with the best fine dining you can experience on the strip and equally with the shows (A Bronx Tale, Phantom, Blue Man Group, Jersey Boys, comedy acts like Wayne Brady and David Spade). It is also home of the Madame Tussaud's wax museum. The service is always top notch and the suites are memorable.

The issue with the hotel room was the fact that when I entered the room after a very late check-in, it seemed as though the room smelled of a horrible odor of something similar to really stinky wet athletic socks (enough to nearly make you gag after getting a whiff of it).  But it was very late and I needed sleep so I didn't have the energy to complain about it that night.  The next day I notified a manager about the issue.  They offered to move me into a different room but I was already settled in and didn't want to bother with the hassle of moving my luggage... so the other option was to have them run an air filtration system and spray a deodorizer all over the room.  So I opted in for the 2nd option which meant a lengthy visit from maintenance.  Plus I had to listen to the loud filtration system all night long which made it a bit difficult to sleep.  The primary reason that I didn't make a bigger fuss about the issues right away is that I was on a very short weekend trip and had driven out from Los Angeles so I really did not have a lot of spare time to waste (plus I was also spending time with friends that were staying nearby).  And in a hotel that's so huge and built like a maze, it's a major hassle to even get to the front desk to speak directly to a manager in person to discuss the issues!  In addition, the toilet in my room was also constantly running so this was an additional maintenance interruption that I did not appreciate at all.  Apparently the summer months that I was visiting during are their slow time so they, unfortunately, ended up putting me in a wing of the hotel that's not heavily used this time of year so with the ridiculous Vegas summer heat and the fact that the rooms remained closed up, the hotel staff confessed that it's a common occurrence for this foul odor to occur.  And I just happen to have a very sensitive nose and bad allergies.  I am not about to pay full price for a room in this condition...  and a ""luxury hotel"" charging high rates such as this should be on top of properly maintaining the rooms - it's not the customer's responsibility.

Upon returning home, the following day (August 4th as well as August 5th) I checked to see what I could do about getting some money refunded due to the issues I had to deal with.  Spoke with Kylie manager at Venetian (she was the head manager that I last dealt with and I initially also spoke with an additional 1-2 other managers that worked under her) & Charlotte supervisor at Cheaptickets.  Unfortunately, all the managers I spoke with at the Venetian said that the only thing they could do is to waive the resort fees for me because they said I should have complained more up front!?!?  And Cheaptickets was only willing to refer me back to the hotel to deal with them again.",0,1,0

Back home, I work at a casino\/card room so I expect customer service to be at a certain level. I come to Vegas with the thought that I'm going to lose my gambling money (money that I set aside just to gamble haha) which is fine with me, as long as I have fun with it. 

I get to the craps table (my favorite game because all you do is win money) and I understand the game but I am fairly new to it still when it comes to playing with everything in the center (the hard numbers and all that stuff). 

But I made a bet on the hard number and I hit it later down on the road but I didn't get paid out for it, so I asked a simple question. What happened to my bet and why didn't I get paid out for it? Turns out the bet came off or whatever, but when I asked the question the dealer was yelling and raising his voice and being completely rude and that totally changed my fun vibe I had going on at the table.

So to say I left that night and went back upstairs. 

Later the next night during the grave yard hours when I couldn't sleep, I went downstairs wanting to play pai gow. (Which I do not like in Vegas because if you lose you lose your money. If you win you have to pay commission to the casino. And their aces are not wild unlike ours) but pai gow was closed but there was a similar Chinese game to it and the dealer is Wentao. 

I love Wentao and let me tell you why. I would give him 10 stars if I could. 

I'm already having a bad experience from the casino the night before but I'm the type of person to always give everything a second chance. So I sit down at wentao's table and he teaches me how to play. Of course I lose but I'm having fun cause Wentao is making me laugh. 

They open up pai gow for me and Wentao turns to be the dealer and they have a progressive jackpot going on for 7 card straight flush. He asks what would you do with this amount of money? I answered ""easy! 20% goes to you right because you gave me this 7 card straight flush"" we get a 6 card straight flush. :( but it's okay Wentao still made us laugh. 

So I was up, and Wentao got switched out so I left and went back upstairs. 

Now the night after around the same time I'm like .. ""I wonder if Wentao is working tonight."" So I'm wandering the casino floor and guess where he's standing.. On the craps table!

The hotel was very nice and the staff were accommodating for the most part. What was lacking service wise was speed. From the valet to check-in to room service everything seemed to take forever. The valets tell you to call ahead for your car but when you do you are told that you must come down to request it. Room service tells you up front that it will take at least an hour for your food to arrive. When the food did finally come it was hardly deserving of a 5 star rating. The room was nice as well with a good view but the attention to detail was lacking. Clean but not spotless, nicely decorated but a little dated. As an example, the bathroom looked great but upon closer inspection the fixtures were tarnished, the marble damaged, they had horrible water pressure and it was never quite clean during our stay. The toiletries were a joke. They have two flat screens in the suite but they are poor quality with blurry pictures. There were plenty of shops and things to do in and around the hotel. I'd put it on par with a nice Hilton or best western with a whole bunch of extras. It was enjoyable but for the cost I wouldn't stay there again.",1,0,0

Nicely apportioned, and I love the free hors d'oveurs and cocktails for concierge suite guests in the afternoons (it's good to have something in your belly for your evening's booze to lie upon). IMHO, the concierge suite prices in the Venezia Tower are worth it considering the complimentary canapes, continental breakfast, and private pool deck -- not to mention the far shorter lines for check-in. The suite itself is quite spacious: the bed is comfy, the pillows comfortably squishy, and the bathroom is very roomy. Double sinks are a definite plus. The suite had three LCD televisions - including one in the bathroom. Classy! :P

My biggest beef with the room is the lack of WiFi. Supposedly, WiFi is available all over the Venetian, but my room on the 11th floor of the Venezia Tower did not have WiFi available (or so they said when we tried connecting and were unable to). Wired ethernet is speedy and fairly reasonable at $9.95\/day, but I would have preferred that the WiFi work in my room. And I was having trouble maintaining good cell phone reception (I'm on AT&T using an iPhone 3G, and had trouble maintaining 3G data connection. Fie on you, EDGE!)

The sheets on the bed were also super rough. After two nights, we both had rough spots on our extremities from the sheets (and not because anything particularly gymnastic was going on in that bed, okay?). We called down to see if they had other sheets available, and the front desk said that their sheets were 200 thread count. Youch. No wonder. However, YMMV - if you enjoy sleeping between sheets of construction paper, more power to you. I would have expected more from a 5 star caliber hotel. 

Also, the fragrance in the hotel lobby, shops, and check-in areas drives me CRAZY. I'm not a very sensitive person when it comes to smell, but the strong scent of florally\/powdery\/douchey fragrance gives me an insta-headache if I'm in those areas for too long. The room is great and all, but if I'm shopping or gambling, I have to leave the hotel or I'll wind up with a massive migraine. Someone mentioned that the smell was particularly strong because they just changed the ""cartridges"" in the air system, but phewww-weee.

I was there for a bachelorette weekend getaway a few weeks ago, and spent the whole 2-and-a-half days trying to keep up with these girls, clubbing 'til 4am and running around the casinos.  

On day (night?  middle of the night?  morning?) two, my feet really started to give out around 4:30am.  Shouldn't have worn those brand-new slouchy booties... but they're just so cute!  Anyway, every time the group stopped moving I'd slump into a chair at a nearby slot machine to give my feet a bit of a rest (I wasn't alone).  I got glares from staff every time because I wasn't playing, and a couple of times I had them approach me to tell me to move.  The first time, they pretended they needed to do machine maintenance.  Smooth.  Second time, they just flat out told me to play or get out of there.  

The place was empty, mind you, as it was 4:30 IN THE MORNING.  

So my also-tired friend and I split off from the group to head up to the room, where one other person was already sleeping.  We didn't have a key, and planned to just have her let us in.  Of course, then we ran into ""elevator security,"" the guy who won't let you past his podium without a key.  Back to the front desk to see if they'd issue us one, which of course they couldn't, as neither of our names were on the room reservation.  All of that is understandable, but what ISN'T is that each staff member talked to us as though we were 5-year-olds, assuming we were piss-drunk.  For the record, at that point, we were both sober.  Tired as hell, but sober - I had had one drink 6 hours ago.


Anyway, enough of my rant.  I just was not a fan of the staff in the least.  I've stayed at at least six different hotels in Vegas and spent time in all of the casinos (never gambling, always waiting on others - and therefore sitting in slots chairs without playing) and was never made to feel so unwelcome.

The staff people are all very pleasant and accommodating, and the check-in process is simple and smooth. The rooms are incredibly clean and intricately decorated, the bathrooms have gorgeous green granite countertops and travertine tile, and the rooms even have remote shades. (If I'm this impressed with the regular guest rooms, I can't even imagine what the suites look like!)

The Venetian has lots of great restaurants and shops on site as well as a bright and inviting casino, so you technically wouldn't have to venture off the property unless you have plans elsewhere.

During my three-day stay, I didn't notice the smell of cigarette smoke in any areas other than on the casino floor. I know this is a concern for many people, as it is for me since too much cigarette smoke causes some sinus problems to flare up. Our guest room and hallway on the 30th floor was also very quiet.

I'd give the room a -3 wifi didn't work and the head board was torn, no fridge, there is but if you move anything it charges you, cheap off brand toiletries and no coffee pot!? Even the days inn have those! cleanliness -3 had to wipe out the bathtub full of short curly black hairs before I could bathe. Picked a few off my socks too, casino-3 it was a maze to the desk, poker room- 3. my fiance played for hours and said he wouldn't play here again, too many weird rules.
 
Customer service - negative 1000. 

I'll try to sum it up for the sake of myself and everyone reading this:
Stayed here on Christmas Day, I'm content with 3 star hotels but for the holiday my fiance convinced me to for once treat ourselves to Venetian or Caesars. And we unfortunately pick this place. 
Room was decent enough (absolutely not worth price if you ask me) Had a good nights rest didn't hear any neighbors which I LOVED! Then we checked out and at this point I'd give an overall 4...

Then the next evening I realized I forgot my brand new, got to wear it one damn time, $225 coat...I remember taking it off when we got in the room and leaving with a different coat on.

I call the 27th (was in utah mountains so no reception until then) 
*Call lost and found leave a message. 20 mins later call back talk to a man. Writes down description. 30 mins- call back. Talk to a woman ""no man back here or inquiry please describe the coat"". describe it. Call back. No coat- I ask to speak to security. A male officer takes my info down does a ""lost inquiry"" tells me to call back tomorrow. 
*Next day- instead of calling I decide to go out of my way and go in.
*Tell the woman at the desk my situation, she calls lost and found -nothing. ""go to security"". I go they have none of my inquiries and no coat. They send me to a manager back at the front...
*I talk to Rhommel Berris, desk manager who tells me ""nothing is found so therefore there is nothing I can do"". I tell him exactly what time I came in and what I was wearing to check the cameras. He can't because surveillance is a different ""entity"". Bet if I took $225 from them it wouldn't be 5 secs later that I was caught and in handcuffs though.
*He calls security, calls housekeeping- nothing. tells me ""sorry if nothing is found there's nothing we can do"" well obviously it wasn't found or I wouldn't have been wasting my time with you guys.
Security comes and takes my THIRD lost inquiry report. Tells me ""call back in 72 hours""

On the phone for 45 mins and arguing with Rhommel for an hour and 15 mins and there was NOTHING they could do, I thought maybe they'd offer something, anything! But we ask ""because of all of our time wasted could we at least get a lunch voucher"" and Rhommel said ""sorry unfortunately I can't do that"" well Rhommel it doesn't seem like you can do much of anything. 

Losing the coat was my fault but my coat magically disappearing when I left the room and how unprofessional they were is theirs. I will never again stay here and EVERYONE who's mentioned Vegas in the past week I obviously tell them to avoid it. I advise anyone who for whatever reason decides to stay don't leave anything behind, I've read other reviews of things going missing after they've left for the day and housekeeping has been in.

lavo, tao, bouchon, delmonico's....we did them all, and they were all 5 star.

this place is a cut above for sure, you're not going to see too many people with nascar t-shirts and jean shorts.  what you will see are hot women....everywhere, my neck is sore from being on a swivel.

that scent they pump in there wasn't bad.....you do notice it, but it has to be better than stale smoke scent.

if you are loooking between the venetian or the palazzo, i would pick venetian....it's cheaper, the suites are bigger (and older, but not really noticable), and it's connected to palazzo anyways, you won't really notice you're in a different hotel.",0,0,0

Okay -- so I feel guilty now for giving 4 stars instead of five... 

Overall -- the stay was wonderful. There were SIX of us crammed into one room (new year's...) but still, the room was big enough to accommodate all of us comfortably. The only pain was waiting for a bathroom -- but the shower area\/vanity\/sinks area was seperate from the toilet... so if you were primping, someone could use the toilet...  (and note to self... gay guys take longer than girls to get ready.... go figure...) 

Okay -- so plusses about the bathroom -- other than the toilet\/getting ready area... huge tub. huge. glass shower (no lock on the bathroom door.. be with trusting friends or a significant other.) with the BEST shower head and two nozzles that spray your lower back area... hiiii heaven.  Also... a vanity area with a really good makeup mirror, which is always nice to have!

Our room was in the Venezia tower -- which, quite frankly, is the Bermuda Triangle. It's nearly impossible to get to... and once you get there, the rooms are even tougher to find. I was schlepping two-week's worth of luggage for what seemed like MILES to get to our room. 

The casino is nice... got addicted to rapid roulette. Table games were way expensive because it was NYE. But it's always fun seeing someone win\/lose thousands of dollars on one hand at the high-limit tables. The poker room is actually very nice as well. 

If you want to eat -- grand luxe is the easiest... but not necessarily the fastest... we spent 2 hours there for breakfast... (I guess this should be a seperate review...)

The food court in the shops area is maybe the fastest way to eat --  but it's quite a haul to get there. Bonus -- TWO coffee beans... but actually, the coffee place in the casino had some AMAZING coffee and the best pain au chocolat I've had since I was in France.

Didn't see the pools or the spa -- too freakin cold and too busy gambling... 

Of COURSE I would stay at the Venetian again.. the price tag is always a bit hefty compared to other places on the strip... but if you're spending any time at all in your room\/hotel it may be worth it!",2,2,2

I thought the refrigerator had that feature only but I noticed the mini snack cart had one also. I'm worried because I picked up the snack to look at 5 times. The snack is worth $5. So I might be charged $25 for looking at a snack and putting it back. If they do charge me I'm going to take the snack with me at checkout.

My only complaint is that the hotel service takes forever. If you ask for more towels, blankets, etc, it takes about 30-45 minutes to get to you. Same with the bell-hop luggage service.",0,0,1

We stayed with a large group in approximately 10 suites, both at the Venetian AND the Palazzo. Quintessence is: Almost everyone had problems with housekeeping.

When we first moved into the suite, it was completely dusty. There were hairs in the tub and in the shower, plus hair near the toilet. The sheets on one of the pillows on the bed were on their left side. Wallpaper came off the walls as well.

We complained multiple times about this situation and it took 3 phone calls plus 4 hours wait until someone finally showed up. Yes, the suite was clean afterwards but we could not use the bathroom in the meantime.

Last but not least: One day, that little Kleenex box in the bathroom was empty. Of course housekeeping didn't pay attention to this. They don't pay attention to much detail. So I called them, requested a new one to be send, removed the old one from the leather casing and put it in the entrance so even the dumbest person would see it. Well, what happened?

Housekeeping in fact brought a new Kleenex during our absence, but they neither put the new one in the leather casing, nor did they dispose the old box. It was still standing in the entrance upon our return.

I pay attention to details, and these details just tell you something about the attitude of housekeeping at the Venetian and how it's managed - BADLY.

And since housekeeping is so important in any hotel, this deserves 2 stars to be subtracted.",0,0,0

I think rooms are going for about $140 a night these days, which is not a bad deal when compared to the nearby hotels. Also, for what you get, it's a steal! Think about it. A regular room in Midtown Manhattan is at least $200. A room like this would cost you $300+.

Pro: Large, Beautiful, Comfortable Rooms. No problem fitting 3 girls per bed :)  

Con: expense (I haven't had any problems because I always split the rooms with large groups.. or go to vegas with someone that gets  rooms compted because of their gambling history haha) I could imagine this would get expensive if you are in a smaller group or 
 
Pro: Plenty of mirrors, duel sinks and bathroom space. 

Con: Bathroom lighting -- is horrible.. at least from a female perspective 

The lighting is actually quite flattering and might be nice for honeymooners\/a romantic pair. The open tub\/glass shower means full exposure & you want the most flattering lighting you can get haha.. 

BUT when you are a group of girls trying to get ready to go out there is a real fear that your makeup is going to look completely different and potentially outrageous under the brighter hotel lighting elsewhere..

Pros: 
Blue Man Group, Phantom of the Opera, and Jersey Boys all housed here. 

Hotel guests usually get their own shorter line and free admission to Tao, Lavo and Tao Beach. Also, home of the perfect after club meal spot Grand Lux. 

Share pools & amenities with The Palazzo. Even if you don't go into Tao Beach or Azure.. the music is still easily heard from the other less exclusive hotel pool areas.

6 stars!; this place is the best, and probably my favorite casino\/hotel in Las Vegas; you have your choice of the lively 1st floor, or the more serene 2nd floor which is mainly the Grand Canal Shoppes situated along canals complete with gondolas for hire; it is always daytime here, with a blue sky & puffy white clouds painted on the ceiling overhead; particularly love the St. Mark's Square area, especially getting an ""outdoor"" table or sitting at the bar at Otto Enoteca; there are a crazy 5 floors of conference rooms here; the somewhat hidden Venezia Tower houses the classy Bouchon restaurant and beautiful pool-side gardens outside; adjacent to Palazzo, so hard to tell where one ends and the other begins; best craft beer bet = the fantastic choices include Sin City Brewing, Public House, and maybe best of all, Yardbird; the Venetian has the best overall craft brew selection on The Strip!",6,0,1

You can walk along the Grand Canal...indoors...with shopping! And end at St Mark's Square....except they forgot St Mark's Cathedral! I guess they don't need such things in Sin City. 

The Doge's Palace has become a shopping mall and the Lion of Venice stands proud over the neon signs. Altogether cheerfully nonsensical, but at least the canals don't stink as they do in the original!

Otherwise, this is a nice, high-end, all-suites Vegas hotel. Expensive shops, fancy canal-side cafes and superior restaurants. New York's own Mario Batali has moved in with two places, the casual Enoteca San Marco and the impressive B&B Ristorante.

It's next to everything.  But I feel like this hotel is going downhill.  I've stayed here around 10 times and now I feel like they're having a tough time staying classy and keeping up with the Jones'.  Not to say the Venetian is bad at all..but it's not the same as it used to be IMO.  

This weekend the Venetian was almost at full capacity, so they had to utilize their older tower, Venezia, which is the one to the right of the front-lobby desk.  Finding your room here is literally a project in itself.  I felt like I was navigating my way through a maze...2-3 elevators, 4-5 rights and lefts, a few 100 meters, then FINALLY I'm at the room!  Now just finding my way back...hmm...what a pain in the ass.  

The Venetian has a lot of good options fortunately.  Bouchon, Grand Lux, Cut...and the food court is great to get something quick.  

I like how the rooms are pretty spacious for the most part.  You can comfortably sleep 5 people here, and cram up to 10-12 if you're Asian like me and my friends.  You can't do that at other hotels! lol.  I think I'm getting to old for this...",1,3,2

First off, the decor in this hotel is absolutely gorgeous. So much thought and detail went into the construction of this place. Anywhere from the ceiling, to the floor. The ceilings were beautifully adorned with paintings and the hotel lobby consists of a gorgeous structure that my friends and I took photos in front of before heading out. Checking in was relatively smooth. 

As far as the room itself, my friends and I booked a suite. The suite was very nice, with a large pull out couch and a table with 2 chairs. We paid extra for a room with a ""view"", although I'd probably opt out of that next time since the view wasn't all that great. The best part of this room was the vanity in the bathroom of course! This made it easier for several girls to get ready in the bathroom. 

The best thing about The Venetian in my opinion? Tao. If you're in Vegas, you must go to this nightclub!! The nightclub is absolutely gorgeous with its Asian-inspired decor and the atmosphere was amazing! If you're into Bay Area music, this is a great nightclub for you too! It was so convenient to get ready in the hotel room and just go down the elevator and walk into Tao, rather than struggling in my heels walking down the strip. Not to mention that the casino in The Venetian is great too (not that I know much about casinos lol.) 

Another great thing about this hotel was the beach club. It's not as big as Encore beach club of course, but it was still very pretty and such a great environment! I went at 11 (?) in the morning and the DJ was playing top 100 hits as people lounged and drank.

Overall, this hotel was absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. I don't see myself staying at any other hotel next time I go into Vegas just because the Venetian absolutely exceeded my expectations. The only regret I have is not riding on one of those beautiful gondolas and exploring more of what the Venetian had to offer but hey, that's what happens when you're too drunk to go anywhere else besides your hotel room.",0,1,0

I was traveling with just my son, and of course the location was great next to all the great food places and the ""kitty pool"" was great for my son, he was so sad when it was time to leave the pool. Also the food next to the pool was amazing I ordered a perpperoni pizza, a mock cocktail and water. I believe it was a Wolfgang Puck restaurant if im not mistaken and it was Amazing.

Never buy beer at a bar, $7-$8 plus tip?
Head to a store in the hotel; literally half price $3-$4 minus no tip
Only individual beers sold no 12 or 24 packs; for best value stock up before.
You're going to lug it to your room if you buy it at the store anyways.

Don't be surprised to be paying $10 a pack for cigarettes, just bend over as soon as you check in. 

Don't waste time buying outside the hotel on the strip, your still paying strip prices.($$$)

Sit down at a machine and play a dollar or two, pretend to play I don't care. Cocktail waitresses will eventually come around and take your order. Just tip her and you're good. No need to purchase a $14 mojito at the bar.

Sign up for a players card, it's free and besides stores owned by the property offer a discount for having one.

Sign up for suite charges, depends on the hotel but you can get points for charging to your room. It's going to the same card anyways? Why not.

Not only should you stock up on essentials like water and food before, but on CASH as well.

There are no banks on the strip, so take out whatever you think you need.
Because ATM's inside charge a high service fee, plus whatever fee your bank might charge.

You're going to need all your change. Keep all your singles, you gotta tip everyone here; doorman, valet, baggage handler, bartender, cocktail waitress, your regular waitress. Having a few extra dollars really helps out. 

It happens, you pack everything, except your toothbrush.
Don't buy inside one of the shops, go to the hospitality desk and\/or ask the housekeeper and receive essential toiletries for free.( toothbrush, razor, q-tips, etc)

Don't do the tourist thing and ride the monorail. Do ride it if you need to actually go somewhere. But don't ride it for the view. Unless you like parking garages. 

Don't bring your coins, slot machines in most hotels do not take the kind of money that jingles it only takes the kind that folds.

Uhm, duh!  It's more than okay. So first of, thank you Auntie for hooking it up. You are always that awesome!

Another long weekend in Vegas and this time it's to see the New Kids on the Block on tour, along with Boyz II Men and 98 Degrees. The initial plan was to stay at Mandalay Bay. But, staying at the Venetian was definitely a better option, for both price and the luxury of the room. We ended up getting a Bella suite with 2 queen beds. The suite usually averages about $250 per night. Our view was of a rooftop, but since I was only paying 1\/3 a share for one night, WHO CARES? I wasn't going to be hanging out in the room to enjoy the view anyways.

The room was spacious, nicely decored with a contemporary look and very clean. The location of the hotel put us in walking distance of the other casinos we wanted to visit. We really wanted to be close to Caesars Palace, since we planned on watching the 4th of July fireworks show there.  The hotel itself has two gyms, pools, Club Tao, a variety of restaurants to choose from and retail stores to blow money in. You can also hitch a ride on a gondola or gamble in the casino.

I had called to book the room instead of booking online. I had explained to the lady on the phone that it was kind of an anniversary thing for us and she promised me the room would be exactly what I wanted. I hate when I pay for a ""strip view"" room and I only get a partial view or bottom floor room. When we arrived I couldn't believe the room we had! I have never been one of the double doors on the end and here I am standing in a suite on one of the higher floors with more than enough room for the 2 of us!!! The view was incredible! We could stand by the window and watch the Treasure Island show! I had never had turn down service before so it kind of scared me when the lady came in and did what she did.

I've stayed at many, many places, ranging from Circus Circus as a child, all the way to the penthouse at Caesar's Palace or a massive suite at the now-gone Sheraton (yes, those last two were superb).

I cannot say Venetian has the very best room ever, since that penthouse thing was quite amazing, but for the purposes of this review, I will stick to the basic room that each hotel is offering.  When staying within that range, there is NOTHING that compares to the Venetian Hotel.
NOTHING, I assure you.

From the minute you pull into the front of this hotel, you will FEEL the difference as your valet opens your door singing some Italan opera tune at the top of his lungs, or as your valet in his red\/white striped shirt takes your bags.  You enter the lobby and just stop for a second to take it all in.  Interior is amazing from the minute you walk in with ceiling as high as the sky - paintings\/murals that make you gasp, and floors that sparkle and really make you feel ""You're in Vegas, baby.""  

All of their rooms are ""suites"" and are about 700+ sq ft in size.  You won't find anything of this size avaialble at other hotels without requiring twice the money you're paying here.  Is it expensive?  Uh... yeah, if you don't gamble heavily, and you need to pay for your room, it will range about $350+ per night, if not up to $399 per night when busy, but if you are anything like me and really enjoy a good hotel experience, it's worth every cent.  The way to do the Venetian best, though, is to gamble here, and have your own casino host to comp your room\/meals, etc.  Granted, going this route can end up costing a helluva lot MORE than $350 so you might consider just paying for it if gambling is not one of your talents.  The casino hosts here really take care of you during your stay, and make sure every need of yours is met.  It's sort of like the service of being on a good cruise - - in the middle of the freakin' desert.

Gambling.
The casino is enormous.  Prepare to get lost your first 70 times or so.  I still have trouble finding the elevators at 6 AM after gambling and partying and I've been here more than most people I know.  Venetian's comp policy is a bit higher than other casino's at $70\/bet for a minimum of four hours per day.  If you can afford that, though -  gamble here.  Great dealers, super funny pit bosses who know you by name and always greet you and something to entertain everyone.  Good ventilation - smoke is never a problem.

The Venetian does not have a buffet, as of yet anyhow.  So if you're in Vegas for cheap food that you can eat to the point of gluttony - - this may not be the place for you.  In fact, I'm told they deliberately left out a buffet to keep people like you out.  :-)  Their idea, not mine.  In any case, what they do have available are some of the finest dining establishments ever - and ample choices of cuisines.  They have plenty of restaurants on their main level, but many more also on their shopping terraza on the second floor.  Superb Dining.  Excellent Dim Sum.  Zeffirino's - amazing.

24 hour room service is available but it's costly.  I am in constant argument with the room service staff about the meek coffee they deliver.  Now I am not one to mind paying $15 for a pot of coffee, but give me something I won't call ""black water"".  I mean, I ordered it to wake up - not fall back asleep.  I realize they want me downstairs wasting money instead of hanging out in my room drinking coffee, but geez - I have to wake up to do it - and the quicker I am conscious, the faster I will get down there to blow my money, no?

That is perhaps my only complaint about the Venetian.  
Otherwise, the rooms are fabulous, huge, and the bathrooms are about as big as any hotel room you'd find in NYC, all marble, a shower that will wash your worries away, and a jacuzzi tub that makes you forget you just lost $____________ downstairs.  Who cares when you feel this good, eh?

For a true-to-style Vegas experience, I would definitely recommend checking into the Venetian.  While not the most economical way to go - it truly adds to your Vegas trip in every way.  Location is also perfectly centralized, with easy access to anything you might want to see.  I hate walking in the Vegas heat, so I usually cab it to anything, including a ride across the street to the Mirage Hotel.  While cabbies will look at you strange when you ask to be driven across the street - - you offer a good sum of money and they'll slam on the gas and get you there WAY before your friends arrive there 20 minutes later, dripping in sweat.  The extra you just paid the cabby is simply money you didn't lose at the tables instead.  

This is, afterall, LAS VEGAS!
I'll be there this Easter Weekend!",17,2,4

We stayed at a Luxury Suite, which had a sunken living\/dining\/office room, 3 TV's (including the Bathroom), very comfortable bed, and remote controlled blackout curtains. The rooms are so spacious, luxurious and comfortable, especially the bathrooms.

The pool area was beautiful, with quite a few people gathered to enjoy the 109 degree weather and enjoy a great lunch at the poolside cafe.

As it's the standard in hotels located on the Vegas Strip, getting from your car to your room takes a little while, this whole resort is huge, and you have plenty of options for dining, shopping or just finding something fun to do. But once you're in your room, there's absolute peace and quiet to relax after a fun day (or night) of gambling, partying or just touring Vegas.

All this comes at a price, there is a +-$20 per day resort fee, on top of the already high prices. However, you can find great deals if you book well in advance. I absolutely recommend this hotel.",3,1,1

Everything was immaculate; from the pillow top king sized bed, firm but comfortable, to the beautiful marble accented bath with separate tub and shower. And the first suite I've ever stayed in with a television in the bathroom. Sunken living room with electric powered drapes opening to a fantastic pool and Las Vegas Strip view. As well as the surrounding mountains. 3 flat screens  all of varying sizes. Just don't touch the snacks on the counter or anything in the refrigerator. I mean, sensors that will automatically charge you for even lifting one of the alcoholic beverages. Charged without any necessity of one drop of consumption. But no worries my fellow Yelpers, I was forewarned of those refrigerator sensors and on top of that, neither I or my wife drinks.

This is an impressive resort, providing so many reasons to stay on the premises; in dining, shopping and entertainment. But there are its minuses, none of which are cause for my lowering their 5 star rating from me:

1. We were given two American Breakfasts included with our suite at the Grand Lux Cafe, for both mornings of our stay there. Being that neither one of us eats pork, there is no substitute option for the meat choices provided: bacon, sausage, etc. All pork. But no problem, we did the vegetarian thing (both of us former vegetarians many moons ago) and enjoyed our choices of toast, English muffins, eggs and hash browns. What we didn't appreciate was that the server on day one took it upon himself to include an 18% gratuity on the bill. It was on the following morning that we saw on our next bill, the recommended gratuities listed for you. The previous server had apparently deleted those options. And being that this server was much more attentive and upbeat, we left her the 20%. She's the sweet redhead with the very upbeat attitude. 

2. A cheap faulty iron that shorted out half of the suite (entry way and bathroom) when trying to plug it in. We had to leave for dinner, then off to the Celine Dion concert, our main purpose for being in town this weekend. So I informed housekeeping of this and they assured me that they would take care of everything before we returned. To their credit all was taken care of, including a brand new iron still sitting in a bag on top of the ironing board I had left out. 

3. Apparently, someone on the cleaning staff took it upon themselves to snack on some gummy bears; $9.00 worth! I found this out during check-out and the kind woman behind the counter took it off immediately. Oh, but wait, that explains why one of the workers took it upon himself to barge into our room without knocking first, just as my wife was stepping out of the tub, almost stepping into view, but not quite. On seeing me he blurted out something about ""coming to replenish the snacks"". Really?! Without even knocking first?!!! Something fishy going on with the cleaning staff, and they were trying to have him cover up the dirty deed no doubt. We never, on numerous hotel stays in the past, ever touch anything offered for sell in our rooms. And rarely do I not latch everything on the door, we had just returned and earlier had requested housekeeping late, since we didn't leave early enough for the morning maid service. I guess he was hoping we hadn't returned yet.

4. Now this observation doesn't necessarily reflect on the Venetian, but since they're on the property I think management should be made aware. Why is it that on 3 separate occasions, I witnessed 2 of them my self, the salon by the name of Oceane offers free samples as women pass but immediately upon my wife's passing, swiftly withdraw the offer and go mute? Only to be heard making the same ""free sample"" pitch upon her passing? She told me that it also happened on a 3rd occasion while she was out strolling the grounds alone. Now mind you, my wife wasn't interested anyway, especially since they obviously were purposely avoiding making the offer to her. She tells me that on that 3rd occasion, she just stared at the saleslady, making her aware that she knew exactly what was going on. And she just happened to be passing by, since that's right next to Tao and a major exit. Coincidence you say? 3 different salesladies over the course of our 2 nights stay. ""Oh he's just playing the race card"". I never mentioned it being a race thing, my wife even saw them making the free sample pitch to a fair skinned African-American lady so that's not necessarily the point. I never mentioned anything about race, but saw seemingly every other woman of various backgrounds, the vast majority just happened to be Caucasian, of all shapes and age groups. And there was that one fair skinned African-American that my wife did see being offered a free sample. If they had seen the price of our 2 night stay and known that we weren't just passing through but staying there, do you think that would have made any difference?",11,5,7

Call this the European version of the watered review elsewhere. Hey, don't you want the naked truth? A review stripped of all embellishments?   

If you like'em painted up and powdered up, then you're gonna be glad, cuz your good hotel, is gonna go bad. (In the good sense.)

The Venetian is glitz on the fritz. From Gaudi to gaudy in two strides inside this monster hotel. It's an Italian Villa on steroids rising from the muck and then run amok. 

The Hotel is larger that most cities with 7,117 room and suites. Somewhere, Michaelangelo is spinning in his grave or searching for his medical marijuana card whenever he looks up at the painted ceiling in this Cistern Chapel. Everything that couldn't get past City Planning in the French Quarter made it to Final Permit here.

It could be used as a location site for the Biggest Loser. Hang in the Casino to people watch and\/or go and show off that Dump Trump Tat on your rump or sashay in last year's Frederick's of Hollywood couture. Stuff yourself into that gownless evening strap and strut your stuff. But this is a review of the Hotel and not it's patrons. 

Everything about this place is supersized, from the 110,000 square foot Casino to the 21 restaurants which includes a Taco Bell offering 1 meter  Margaritas to high end destination eateries like Cut and Delmonico's.   

There is an army of security and cocktail waitress patrolling everywhere endlessly. Swipe your ""Grazie Card"" and most anything your secret, pea sized heart desires arrives almost instantly. Well, almost anything and almost instantly, anyway. 

Pools, a Spa, a Grand Canal with Gondolas (Doesn't every Hotel have that? No? They should.) There's a Gym, Nightclubs, Bars, a Concert Venue, a Sports Book, ATM's along with the new industry trick, a Resort Fee for free Wifi, Ethernet, Boarding Pass printing, Newspaper (which I did not get), free local calling. The only thing you can't sign for here is love and happiness, although I bet you can rent it for an hour or two. (I'm talking about an Emotional Support Dog. What were you thinking?)

The staff of thousands are mostly smiling, helpful and happy to show the way to all the Venetian has to offer. A trail map is helpful to find the elevators or the entrance once reception is done with you. Housekeeping keeps house 24\/7. Need more live chickens for the party? Call room service. They deliver.    

Room 18-335 was a huge suite larger than most apartments I've lived in. There was an unobstructed view of the air conditioning ducts 18 floors below. But if you need a view of something unusual, ask for a room overlooking the High Roller Ferris Wheel making people nervous or the Strip strippers stripping making people nervous.   

There were two Queens (beds, not occupants), a large Sitting Room, Flat Screen, and a micro sensor mini-Bar. (Move the Coke out to see if its Diet, and you own it.)

There's a great bathroom with duel sinks to ameliorate roomie discord. A full bath and a rain Shower with enough water pressure to equal an entire Kindergarten class spitting on you. 

I would recommend the Venetian Hotel to anyone who feels lucky, gets lucky or recently binge watched Rome and didn't get enough.",7,7,3

The bella suites are awesome! In both the Palazzo and Venetian! It's two queen beds, a pull out couch, a seating area,and a great bathroom. Their bath products are ok, but who really cares about that? So you can really cram a bunch of people here. We got two bella suites next to each other. And you know what? We all fit and everyone had a bed. It was frigging awesome!!

There are four or five different pools that you can go to. The largest one is right next to Tao beach where you can hear the music, but not pay for the entrance (except I've gotten in on guest list), and not deal with the hellish drink line.

There's the shopping area downstairs, just in case the boys you're with didn't realize you needed BLACK\/BROWN shoes to get in and not tennies or Vans.

You get comp'ed for the clubs. :) Also, if you get to Tao early enough, it's open bar for ladies til 10. (woot, woot)

Easy check-in, check-out.

Easy access to Encore\/Wynn for XS, Surrender, Tryst, Encore Beach club. 

Look out for deals on Jetsetter, their website, and a few different voucher sites for better deals. 

I do wish they had a fridge in the room - but it's ok, We've killed four ice machines (one on each floor) to fill our tub with ice and to chill out drinks. Hehe. Did I mention they have an awesomely large bathroom. There's two sinks, a separate potty area, a tub, and shower area.",6,6,7

I was there right after it opened and have continued to stay there since. As of this past weekend (July 23-27, 2010) I will no longer stay there. The Venetian is a 5-star hotel that now has 1-star clientele! I witnessed the following events: On Saturday afternoon there was the equivalent of a bar fight outside our cabana - a very drunken jerk that needed to be subdued and ejected by hotel security; on Sunday night there was a girl-fight in the casino - bystanders made no attempt to stop the fight AND, in fact, were cheering these trashy\/trashed women on! Finally in the early hours of Monday morning in the suite next door to me there was an out-of-control party that involved screaming, hitting, fighting, a trashed hotel room that required police dogs and pepper spray to be extinguished. I was told by one of the hotel security officers that there were more people in that room than security officers. 
I complained to hotel management (David Gabildon) about all of the above and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do since I was not injured!  Not only did we rent cabanas at the Venetian this weekend but we also spent plenty on the hotel premises and the response was ""we cant control how people behave"". That may be true but when guests are inconvenienced and their use and enjoyment of the premises is disrupted, the hotel's response should surely be more than a shrug of the shoulders!!!

Here's a few tips though:
Ask for non-smoking room (we did, but heard others grumble about being stuck in rooms that were not)
Do not touch the mini bar! (from the tons of online reviews we read, it was a problem. If you move stuff around, the weight activator under the items will charge you. When you check in, you sign something to the effect of that)
If you don't plan on using the pool, spa, etc, consider asking them to waive the resort fee. The girl that checked us in was super nice about it.

My checkout day is tomorrow on Friday, March 24th.  I have one more night and day with my stay here but I am writing my review one day before I leave. I will update my rating and evaluation again upon checkout.

Overall my stay so far is fair\/good. The rooms are lavish and housekeeping does a great job keeping it clean every day.  However, there was no coffee maker or refrigerator in my room as I thought these would be provided  since my stay was for the entire week.  Also, my view from the 17th floor was not good:  It was of the roof of the adjoining building.

The food at the restaurants I the lobby was also very good.  I had several meals at the Grand Luxe restaurant in the lobby floor and was very impressed with the food and service. I also had breakfast rolls and coffee at the Bouchon restaurant for quick morning meals. The ham, egg, and cheese croissant sandwich was very good. Highly recommend this one.  Also, the strawberry danish was excellent.

Probably the main issue with the hotel was the Internet connection. This connection is incredibly slow and we had to get the hotel's IT department fix our connection several times all week to resolve. This issue is surprising given the hotel is hosting the Adobe Conference and many people rely on hi-speed Internet. Not good for the Venetian. This is one of the most expensive hotels on the Vegas strip and they should be up to par on their internet services.",0,1,1

We were spread out - staying at the Venetian, the Wynn Encore, and the Aria - giving us insight of how our suite in the Venetian compared to other hotel rooms.

The first thing you notice upon pulling up the Venetian is that it has an extravagant curbside and lobby area. You feel all of it's 4 star hotel power as limos, luxury cars, and taxi's hustle and bustle to and fro. I have read about the the ""filtered perfumed"" air and walking into the lobby understand exactly what everyone has been describing. It doesn't smell bad but is irritating, I would go so far as to say, annoying. No, actually, what was annoying was the Phantom music playing in every single elevator. You could not escape it and it will stay with you until you hear ""Birthday Sex"" by Jeremih at the clubs and then that will stick with you. Seriously.

The hotel itself is grand and ornate - clean, strong lines and tasteful accents. We stayed in the Rialto suite - 2 queen-sized beds and large sunken living room area. The suite was HUGE. We had 4 people staying there but had up to 6 people sleeping there one night (2 others on the pull out couch). Plenty of room. I would say the only negative aspect of the suite was that it was one large open space - it would have been helpful if there was a dividing wall for the living room area so that it was a separate space. You could not have people hanging out in the living room without disturbing those who were sleeping\/napping. 

The bathroom is a dream come true with his\/her sinks, vanity area, bathtub with separate shower in view of the small flat-screen television affixed to a corner. Separate toilet closet and giant full length mirror were also present.

I liked the fact that the Venetian was attached to the Palazzo - both hotels are tasteful and project opulence. We stayed in a fifth floor suite in the Venetian tower which didn't have much in way of a view, but made for convenient access to the casino and shoppes. No walking seemingly long miles for us (tip: the Venetian vs. Venezia towers - Venezia is further away from the hub).

Best kept secret is the Canyon Ranch Cafe on the third floor by the spa\/gym. Healthy snacks and fresh juices plus organic meal options. Great to start your day out with a jog on the treadmill then a stop over to Ranch Cafe.

All in all, a top notch hotel experience and a truly memorable birthday.",1,0,0

Rusty: You'd need at least a dozen guys doing a combination of cons.

Scott Ocean: Have you checked out The Venetian? 

Rusty: Didn't they name the new Pope at The Venetian?
Scott Ocean: Ha ha. Maybe. You would think so from just looking at it. ""Kitch"" is not really my architectural style...but I'm sure there's plenty of cash in the vault.

Rusty: You think we can make it out of there?
Scott Ocean: Easy. We'll disguise ourselves as gondoliers and row like hell through the canal. There are so many tourists walking around, they'll think we're shooting a chase scene from ""The Italian Job 2.""

Rusty: You probably look good dressed in black and white stripes with a pole in your hand. 
Scott Ocean: Yeah, yeah. I already booked us in a cavernous luxury suite on the 20th floor of the new tower. We have a great view of their spectacular main pool and bikini-clad women.

Rusty: Nice.
Scott Ocean: I already mapped out where Linus and Yen will be waiting for us. 

Rusty: Do they have Nacho flavored Doritos in the mini-bar?
Scott Ocean: What? You won't need to break into the mini-bar this time my friend. The hotel is littered with celeb-chef restaurants from Mario Batali, David Burke, Thomas Keller, and Wolfgang Puck.

Rusty: Get the Puck outta here! Ol' Wolfgang?
Scott Ocean: Yeah. I never did get to try Postrio. Or Burke. But I did eat at B&B, Bouchon, and Tao. The dining experience helped me take my mind off th Venetian Disneyland.

We stayed in the southern wing. It has a gorgeous view of the smaller, more elegant pool, which is fantastic! We had the ""Bella Suite"", which is perfect to sleep 6.

In the room we had two very comfy Queen beds and two big plasmas. There is a large shower and separate tub area. There is also a spacious living room area with plenty of seating and a pull out couch. It is a very posh room. The room comes equipped with tinted windows and blackout curtains, which made it seem like midnight in the middle of the day (perfect for Vegas).

The Venetian is centrally located on the strip and is attached to a great, spacious, clean casino and a mall. There are 50 restaurants in total, including the poolside Bouchon. This is the perfect place for Brunch. It doesn't get too hot before 12 and our server, Romberto, was a doll!

There is a very relaxed pool environment in the Southern wing. It has a small main pool, a kiddie pool, two hot tubs and a fountain. It is lush with olive trees and mood music. Get here by 9 AM to take advantage of the sun, which because of the building goes away by about 3PM in the late spring.

Tao Beach and the other, larger, pool area are in the other tower. They are both great for partying your ass off.

Tips: 1) Book through the hotel. The rates on Expedia were no better than the hotel rates, so unless you can find a good deal, it's better to book through the hotel.
2) The concierge desk is a mess, so don't count on them. There are just way too many of them to get anything done efficiently. My best advice is to only ask simply questions, and plan ahead.
3) There is no Wifi in the Southern tower. If you're planning a family vacation (firstly, don't bring your kids to Vegas) this is the place to be. Your husband wont be able to work and your kids will be safely kept away from tramps and drunks in the more relaxed pool area.

The financials:

We paid around $250 a night, which was worth it! They hold $50 a night for incidentals, and there is a $40 resort fee per night for the fitness room and wifi. Which is really silly. Who is going to workout in Vegas?

Cab ride to the hotel from the airport was $20, back it was $25. And it's a $5-$10 cab ride to anywhere along the strip. It's also across the street from the Mirage, which has a tram to a couple ends of the mall.

Overall, staying at the Venetian made our Vegas trip perfect! I highly recommend it.",1,0,0

Got to the room, had a view of the other building, and two beds that looked like large double beds.  Went back downstairs and was told they had sold out of the King beds despite the fact that I made my reservation months ago.

I've stayed here three times now, and I really like how large the suites are, and that it's the only hotel on the strip that offers a sofa-sleeper in the suite. (If i'm wrong, please correct me, but I called around and it seemed as though only the Venetian had it). 

With regards to the Venezia suites in particular: The bathrooms were quite large, with a tub, a shower, and a separate toilet. That was great, because no one showering wants to watch you do your business on the john. The sofa area was spacious, and definitely large enough to accommodate more than 4 people, which they mention in the bookings information. 

The view of the pool garden was beautiful, even if placement of the pool garden is less than ideal (when it's between four tall buildings, you can bet it doesn't get a lot of sunlight). The water pressure in the showers was perfect, even if I couldn't figure out how to adjust the temperature; it was perfect to begin with, and required very little tweaking on my part. Having Tao in the building was pretty helpful after hours spent dancing in a crowded club.

Housekeeping is hit or miss: we had someone really good come in the first day and give us everything we asked for (we tipped quite generously for that), and the second day, we asked for less and tipped less and the person who came in took the tip but didn't give us what we were asking for. Also, our suite was missing a corkscrew and it took about an hour for them to send one up. This delay resulted in us chugging our bottle of wine as we headed down to Tao. Also, the location on the strip means you are on one side, and need to exert extra effort to go to Paris or New York or even the Bellagio. 

The next time I come to Vegas, I will probably give another hotel a shot. But the Venetian has served me well for my purposes.",0,0,0

There's a gym on some level I forget. Shopping here was nice, there were a lot of workers strolling around in costume offering to help with directions.

We stayed at the Venetian. We called in advance to get poker room rates. The woman we spoke to in the poker room stated that the Venetian does it in reverse. You book a room, and at the end of your stay, after you have played poker, they convert your room to the poker room rates. She mentioned we need to play a minimum number of hours per day, but nothing else. We were then told by some managers while we were playing, to simply come to the poker room desk the night before we check out, and they will convert our room to poker room rates.
We went to the desk the night before check-out, and asked the poker room to convert our room to poker room rates. However, after speaking to two people who refused, we spoke to the manager, Susan Schaffer. Besides being incredibly condescending and rude, she would not give us the poker room rates stating we had to use a Grazie card, or they cannot change the rates. I told her no one told us that, and she said that is not true, all her staff are trained to tell that. I again explained that if we were told that, we would have complied. She said we don't know what we are talking about, we are probably in the wrong hotel, and other condescending remarks in a very nasty manner. The interaction was incredibly rude and unacceptable from a manager in her position. I again explained that no one told us that, and she was only trying to stop from giving poker room rates. I understand she was trying to save the Venetian money, but then her staff should not be lying to the customers. Due to this one interaction, she has lost probably 15 customers who visit the Venetian 3-5 times per year and play poker. DON'T be tricked into believing you will receive poker rates at the end of your time at the Venetian. There are many other nice poker rooms in Las Vegas, including the Mirage and MGM.

The hotel is immaculate. Service is impeccable on every level from the front desk staff and concierge to the bellboy, housekeeping, and security. Check in and out are a breeze.

The rooms\/suites are elegantly appointed. Ultra comfortable beds with millions of pillows; 3 televisions (including one in the bath); marble and mirrors everywhere; gold fixtures; vanity table in the bath; remote-controlled shades and black-out drapes over huge windows.

So then why only 4 stars? It's pseudo luxury; when you see the suite you are blown away...until you realize there were a lot of little shortcuts taken and things not thought through that make staying at the Venetian irritating\/inconvenient. 
 - There are no fans at all in the bath or toilet areas; 
 - the lighting is very soft, making it difficult to apply makeup or to shave;
 - the entire area under the sinks is open and completely wasted because there is no shelf (or storage) for toiletries, cosmetic bags or styling tools, and only limited space on the counter; 
 - beautiful piece of furniture in the bedroom area is not a dresser, it does not have drawers, only (black) shelves so you have to live out of your suitcase;
 - there are wonderfully convenient light switches for the bedside lighting on the wall above your pillows, but there is no way to turn one lamp on so you can read and turn the other off so your spouse can sleep
 - the door is paper thin, not only can you clearly hear conversations out in the hallway, if you are in the hallway you can hear every word of the conversations people are having in their rooms...we were fortunate to at the very end of the hall so we did not have people walking past, only those with the room next to ours and across the hall. Personally, I would have sacrificed the electric drapes and installed thicker doors if it were a budget issue.
 - no coffee maker\/french press\/Keurig in the room. I have been informed that this is typical in Vegas, and while that may be true, it makes me grouchy trying to get myself presentable without my coffee fix to go down to get my coffee fix (which you cannot charge to your room).

Rooms:  They rooms here are ridiculously huge (as in more than 500 square feet).   They have multiple TVs within one room: one big screen TV in front of the bed and another in front of the living room area.   Their bathroom is also ginormous and has a TV in there as well.  

Casino\/Shopping: Great selection of stores that has something for every budget. If you stay in the Venetian side of the resort, the stores are in a centralized area.  Once you start meandering into the Palazzo, they get scattered around.  Nice poker room as well but it's not as busy as the Bellagio.  

Crowd: Good mix of people.  I felt safe for the most part but the crowd is a lot more louder than the Bellagio

Gondola Ride:  Worth doing once.  It's not cheap but if you can't make it to the real Venice its worth doing.  They also sell these stuffed monkeys dressed like the people who row the boats.  The monkeys are quite cute and I recommend picking one up.

Restaurants:  They've got a good mix for varying budgets ranging from Emeril's restaurant to a food court.  

Spa: Canyon Ranch Spa is here and wonderful.",0,0,0

The room was called a suite but it was just a room with a big living room. The cleaning wasn't impeccable unfortunately. Room price was reasonable for the location-central on the strip. Tonnes of big name chef restaurants including Batali and Boulud which was really nice. We ate at Carnevino. Prices at all restaurants are a little crazy-kinda like you're in the airport. We were at a conference there and the meeting rooms were large and well equipped. Tonnes of stores from Barneys to breguet. If you're looking for class-go elsewhere, but be prepared to pay.",1,0,1

I was in vegas for a tradeshow and I was able to be in the hotel b\/c of it.  I got there the day the tradeshow started so I went to their convention center first.  On the way there I just saw rooms after rooms size of football fields all very nicely decorated.  The actual convention center felt like it was like 15-20 football fields together?  I might be slightly wrong but I just know it's huge.  I know I wasn't able to walk every isle and see every single booth in a single day.  

Now the front entrance to lobby\/casino....look up when you get there.  The ceiling all had paintings on them and looked breathtaking.  I think I stood there for a little bit the first time I walked in.  Also, go upstairs the casino where the shops are.  I really enjoyed that place, they created somewhat a small breeze in there and have it design with buildings that looks like it's from italy.  They have performers there singing at certain time of the day and there's the artificial river with boat and the guy that sings while you're on it.

The room, I was in was a suite and it was one of the nicer suites I been in.  We had two people in the suite but it could've easily fitted few more with the room we got.  I'm not sure how much it cost b\/c it was offered to me so I didn't have to pay for it but I'm guessing it would've been pricey.  The service was pretty quick, I pretty much went straight up to the suite without any wait.

Probably one of my favorite hotels at vegas so far.

one more note:  if you seen the michael jackson special done by ABC a few years, you might remember MJ going to one of the crazy stores.  Well Im not sure if it's still there but last time I was there I went in and that store is insane b\/c of what they're selling and the price tag.",0,0,0

When finally exhausted went back to our room and met with a comfy bed and delightfully soft pillows. My husband sleeps without pillows and found the bed to be perfect. 

For those that don't work out I say start here, take the time to explore the gym, our favorite part of the hotel. After a great work-out they have great smoothies, blueberry, strawberry...$5.00 from 7-2. 

The Canyon Ranch Cafe has great food and healthier choices. We recommended it to an older couple and saw them later, they so enjoyed!

The bars weren't as good as other resorts and the table games aren't the cheapest so I never really ventured there very much - which is surprising for the amount of Vegas trips I've taken over the years! 

I'm officially a fan. We stayed here for two nights in a comped suite. It was either the nicest or second nicest room I've stayed in in Vegas (other is West Wing room at MGM). When you walk in, there are two french doors to the side leading to the bathroom which has a separate restroom (strangely with no lock on the door...), big bathtub, separate shower, double sinks, flat screen TV, and sitting area with a big mirror and vanity mirror. The only real downside here was the toiletries - bitter orange scented? Yes, it smelled as rank as it sounds. Gross. 

Past the bathroom is a nice fluffy king bed and big flat screen TV. There is a nice big closet with my favorite...comfy robes! Then you walk past the bed and go down a few steps into the living area with a big sectional couch, yet another flat screen TV, DVD player, desk with internet access, and another favorite...remote-powered curtains! Beware - the mini bar is weight sensored, so no funny business. Also, there are a lot of lamps and whatnot in the room, but the lighting isn't very bright - it's nice most of the time, but sometimes you just need to see a lil' better. 

We had one gigantic issue with the main entrance valet - estimated car in 30 minutes and didn't get it for and hour and ten minutes and they were jerks about it and we were crazy late to our Valentine's dinner reservation. What a bunch of bitches! The valet by the guest rooms was always fast and courteous. All of the staff (besides aforementioned valet guys) were very nice and made it a pleasure to stay there. They also happen to have one of the better poker rooms on the strip.

It was just or almost as funny as  Eric W putting on the pajamas in Target.

Way too many dining options including two fast food courts with some open 24 hours. Walgreens is great to buy beer, water, toiletries. 

Pool complex was good but not great. Good luck getting a pool lounge chair at main pool, unless you do what everyone else does: get in at open, leave a towel and a personal item. We rented a cabana ($500 for the day) the next day so my party can just relax with no worries about finding a spot.

This is a hotel casino resort. There was a little confusion on entrance to hotel parking but after that we found the back entrance to be quicker access. Like most casino hotels, there is a navigation and maze to find the front lobby and gratzie rewards program center. 

Hotel check in line was semi long but moves fairly quick. Staff at the desk was friendly, efficient and well articulated. Finding the hotel elevators was a few turns away from desk. Elevators were some of the fastest I have seen in Las Vegas. 

Room door locks worked to a varying degree. Some of group ended up having technician come out to fix the battery unit. The rooms are all suites with a couch three televisions, seperate shower, tub, and toilet along with double vanity. No kitchenette but stocked for charge mini fridge.

Room temperature itself was comfortable without much changes needed. Clean top to bottom. Bed was firm and soft. Linens to decor were modern, current, vibrant, and coordinated. Chairs were soft. Small stairs and stair lighting are a change from typical rooms. Lighting can be a little distracting but needed for safety. The electronic curtains are adjustable for the light or heavy sleeper needing to block out the lights of the never sleeping city.

Housekeeping was prompt, friendly, and responsive to requests. Rooms were kept in order.

The resort also has a pool spa open year round with exception to in-climate weather on one day during our stay.  Spa and pool were temperature adjusted for the weather outside. Spa whirlpool jets were in working order. The seating and lounging was also in great condition. Hours are generous compared to other Las Vegas resorts. 

Resort also offers a gym. Equipment was well cleaned and fairly modern. Better than most regular gyms. There are classes, rock climbing, and the likes for extra charge. We did not try the classes or the wall but seemed cool.

There were several restaurants on property to which we tried out. Very good. 

Casino was nice. Lots of table and slot games. Well circulated air. I didn't really notice smoke smell. Casino dealers and bosses were somewhat friendly to take time to know players. Drink service was fairly consistent. At the slot machines, drink service button worked appropriately. Too many choices had to order a second choice drink to order first preferred. Drink service was prompt friendly and accurate. Definitely like the drink buttons at slot machines.

Cashier cage had a short line which also moved quick. Staff was friendly.

Casino promotions for signing up or new players was not very consistent. Between the five of us four did not have cards. Only one get any bonus coupons for signing up when checking in. Gratzie staff could not explain why that was. Only one card was signed up. We had a coupon for 15 dollar slot play. We went to a machine and it didn't work. We had to go back for the money to show up. That took like 10 minutes.

I chose the Venetian this Las Vegas trip because the International Vision Expo was conveniently located in their Sands convention area. I've thoroughly enjoyed their theme and decor as a visitor on many occasions, but as a hotel guess, I felt the Venetian did not deliver a five star hotel experience.

Pros: 
1. Check-in was quick and efficient with smiles.
2. Security officers check to ensure patrons heading into the elevators are indeed guess. 
3. The room had the usually amenities I've come to expect; fax machine, high-speed Internet access, iron and board, safe, wine glasses and wine bottle opener, and LCD televisions.

Cons:
1. Valet parking is located within the parking structure on the third level. I've never paid too much attention to this detail until my recent stay. why offer valet service at all if it is not available at the front of the hotel? If I have to drive into the structure to the third floor, I might as well save myself the time and find my own parking stall. Ridiculous!
2. The room door slams shut every time with a loud semi-thunderous thud. I suppose this is a security precaution to ensure each room is shut and locked after access. Nevertheless it gets annoying, especially in the morning when patrons and maids alike are going in and out of the rooms.
3. The cheap RCA alarm clock was hard to program. I know this sounds insignificant, but after a long night in Las Vegas, I'd like to rest easy in my bed knowing I can rely on an alarm to wake me at a timely hour.
4. The window curtain remote was ""hit or miss"" at best. Sometimes it functioned, sometimes it did not.

In short, I would not recommend, but neither would I advise against, a stay at the Venetian. My experience was uniquely my own.",1,0,0

When you walk into the lobby, you instantly feel transported to Italy; everything from floor to ceiling screams Venice and is totally over the top (in the best way). As far as location goes, you really can't go wrong; you're right in the middle of all the action and a taxi\/uber\/lyft is very reasonable to any part of the Strip and the airport. The Mirage is right across the street and the Wynn & Encore are a stones throw away.

I booked a Bella Suite with two beds and it was perfect for my friends and I. All of the rooms at The Venetian and The Palazzo are suites, so you get a sunken living room and a huge bathroom. Beds were comfortable, bathroom was roomy and perfect for getting ready, and the living room area was great for hanging out before we all went out. We loved the cute vanity in the bathroom. My only complaint about the bathroom is that the water pressure wasn't that great and we only had warm water in the bathtub, not the shower. Overall, the suites here are perfect for groups and well worth the extra money. 

The casino is huge and there's tons of restaurants in the shops connected to the casino. Past trips, I've always gone to the Grand Luxe Cafe for breakfast\/lunch and this time was no different; always a solid place to get food. If you're looking for high end dining, there are also many options throughout the casino and the shops. 

Aside from the gorgeous rooms, what really stuck out to me was the customer service. My friend arrived earlier than me and she was able to check-in no problem. We never had our room serviced by housekeeping but when we needed extra towels, we got them pretty quickly. Basically, everyone we encountered on the staff from check-in to check-out was extremely helpful, welcoming, and kind.

But, once you get thru the lobby, then the smell is more inviting....smoke!  Haha....you're in a casino, what do you expect!?  
The casino is.....well, it's a casino!   You see one, you've pretty much seen them all.   We were going to eat at Delmonico's but chose Ruth's Chris instead, but that's a different review!

Everything about it was just amazing. 

I was actually worried too because one of the things I hate about vegas is the smoke n the casinos and the hotels. I was pleasantly surprised when I got there that it wasn't bothering me at all. There is no way to avoid the smoke in the casinos, but even then it wasn't killing me. Their high ceilings and ventilation made it so much better than other hotels I have stayed in. But as for the rooms, I thought they were very clean and not smokey. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to vegas.

We go to Vegas every 2 years or so, we try to stay at different hotels each time. OMG! This resort was beautiful, romantic and completely amazing! This is the only one we plan to go back to. 

When we first entered the lobby I was overwhelmed by the beautiful architecture. The air was perfumed and didn't smell of smoke (this is big for me as I'm a reformed smoker). 

The check in took about 10 minutes because everyone and their Grandma was checking in too but well worth the wait. 

We reserved their standard room (who stays in the room when partying in Vegas?) but don't let that fool you, the room was HUGE! Definitely not a standard Vegas room by any means. Loved the bathroom especially the jacuzzi tub for 2. The king sized bed with the down comforters just screamed lay on me. The couch was velvet and there are 3 TVs. The TV in the bathroom is nice when you're getting ready for a night on the town. 

Just to let you know, the mini bar has some nice looking things but don't remove them from the fridge. If you take them out you have 7 seconds to put it back or you're automatically charged for the item. We took out a Fuji water and that cost us $6. So just a warning in case you get excited and start pulling stuff out. 

The employees were uber nice and friendly. I know you're thinking that's their job but they seemed to be genuine. 

Definitely check out the pool side bar and say hi to Mary. She makes the best drinks.

I was there for Palazzo's soft opening and had the opportunity to be the first to sit at a few of the Palazzo dealers' tables. The Venetian\/Palazzo are my favorite casinos. 

As for hotel, Palazzo is the newer of the two so for a fresher, newer hotel, I would suggest staying at the Palazzo. I am not a big fan of staying at Venetian. 

As for gambling, Venetian tends to be more fun in my opinion. I like the congested, excitable feel of the Venetian. The Palazzo tends to be more spacious, open, and less exciting.

As for comps, the last couple of years I get the impression the hosts haven't been as generous. I am not sure though since my betting average has tapered down.  I still get my fair share of comps for restaurants and tickets, but I don't think I would get that stuff if I stayed there. My suspicion is they would use my comps for room nights and I would be SOL on the amenities. I really don't know anymore I stopped staying there. The hosts always ask me if I am staying there, when I say no, then they calculate how much they can comp me for whatever. I never really had a permanent host here 'cause I can get everything from the host station.

As for decor, I definitely suggest spending time to walk around. I think the architecture is great at the Venetian (I really don't know much about architecture, but it is visually pleasing to me). The atmosphere is relaxing. I am not a big fan of shopping, but the Grand Canal Shoppes area is definitely nice for taking a stroll.

Day Three, checking out the Summer Shopping promotion.  Should have tons of points from all the video poker that I played. Had dinner at Valentino (see seperate post). Housekeeping took care of the towels and bathrobes.

Day Four, checking out.  Plan on having lunch at the Grand Lux Cafe then drive back home. Overall not quite as nice as the Palazzo, but a solid four star hotel and resort.",0,0,0

If I could give negative 0 stars, that would be more accurate. We were physically attacked in the lobby last night. When we yelled for help and security, it took several minutes for a staff member to appear. We gave a very detailed description of the attacker to their security team and they did nothing (besides standing around) to apprehend the individual even after we said we wanted to press charges. Clearly The Venetian Las Vegas doesn't care about their patrons safety. This was a horrible experience that needed to be resolved immediately but, never was.

I could never imagine that another hotel would live up to my last experience in Los Angeles, but The Venetian in Las Vegas did exactly that!  

I had such a fantastic time at The Venetian...it really is a world unto itself and you could actually live inside the hotel and never have to leave.  Everything you need is right at your fingertips.

The staff and service is really spectacular.  The rooms are amazing...they are all suites, with a separate sitting room area in a sunken living room.  The pool areas are great...the pool in the Venezia Tower is much smaller, but very quiet, lush and private.  My friend and I had no reason to ever leave the pool area.  Drinks were brought to us (try the Miami Vice drink, which is a mix of Pina Colada and Strawberry Daiquiri).  There is a larger pool area on the fourth floor of the main hotel tower, with a number of pools (including a shallow one that you can put your lounge chair into and sit in the water), a restaurant, and Tao Beach, a daytime spin-off of The Venetian's famous nightclub.  

The casino is spacious, the indoor shopping center is amazing, especially with the canals and gondolas running right through it, and the restaurants are all really spectacular.  Be sure to make a reservation at Zefferino's and sit at one of the tables overlooking the indoor canals.  If you get a chance, get tickets to see The Phantom of the Opera, which is a slightly shortened 90-minute (intermission-less) version of the famous Andrew Lloyd Weber Broadway play.  

I really enjoyed my time at The Venetian Hotel!  My friends and I were very sad to leave Vegas.",1,0,2

Sure, the hotel is BEAUTIFUL and there are a plethora of shops and restaurants to go to. And I'm sure the rooms are amazingly decadent...but what my experience comes down to is pure customer service issues. 
First night in town and we decide to walk our happy hinnies over to see what all the hullabaloo is about this hotel. We sat at the circular bar in the midst of all the gambling. It doesn't smell of cigarettes and the atmosphere is great! People are having a blast, winning $$$ and getting their drink on....we wanna get our drink on as well...too bad that no one single ""tender"" came to get our drink order. There weren't even that many of us at the bar and still not one of them made eye contact or gave us a nod to let us know that they knew we were there. Litterally 10 minutes went by before my friend had to go wrangle down someone to get us a drink. Seriously!?!?!? And even then it was one drink and they were gone, no check backs, no second round... we left. 
Second night we ventured in was kinda worse. My friend wanted food so we went to the ""food court"" and she got some grub. It was late so most of the restaurants were closed. We took her stuff back to where our boys were playing in a tournament and realized that there was no where she could eat her food. There is a Noodle restaurant right by the tables so we slipped in and sat down so chill. There were maybe 5 people in the whole place and it was an ""open"" restaurant so there weren't walls or anything, you just go sit down. Well...apparently the dude that ran the joint didn't want any of our ""food court food"" in his Noodle palace so he told us we couldn't eat there...really?!?! So we asked where we could go besides the food court area...his response ""I don't know but I'm not gonna let you eat here""....WOW!!!! I just don't understand how you can work in hotel and not have an answer for a guest or even be accommodating. Yeah, maybe we aren't supposed to bring in outside food, but if you're open and no one's in your restaurant, it looks better to have someone in there than to be more empty, I'm juuuust sayin. So, boo to the two times I tried to give this hotel some credit. It just didn't happen and I won't be going back to spend my time or money there.",0,1,0

Come on people it's vegas people don't sleep until 5am. Called the front desk and they moved me rooms into the Venetian tower...... Glad that we were moved but there was a problem in that room as well. Us girls started to get ready for the night and as I was showering the water wasn't going down the drain. Called the front desk again they said they will have someone fix it. I told them we don't have time we need to get ready for the night. The lady then said call back after your done getting ready and we will send someone up. SERIOUSLY gross who wants to take a shower standing in water that isn't going down the drain after someone showers. Seriously lady. She finally said they will move us again for the second time. Moved into the new room and of course something else is wrong with it. The bathroom door doesn't close and the toilet doesn't flush right. For all this money we spent at this hotel I rather would have stayed at the Luxor and gotten a suit. The lady at the front desk was rude as well and didn't want to help out.

There are enough people spending money here to support good shops and restaurants -- never had a bad meal here even in the food court.   The feel is glitz, power, new money.  But the size creates log jams, service that is professional on the strength of rules and systems but not personal attentiveness or courtesy.  Check-in and taxi lines can be an hour each.  They deliver room keys and shaving lotion, Fedex packages to your room, but not tylenol no matter how sick you are.  You get around all obstacles with some ingenuity and generous tipping, if you are a girl you can try crying but that gets tiring.

Venezia concierge level is a world apart, a hotel within a hotel atop a parking garage.  Here there is no gambling, just a garden.  You get checkin, dinner reservations, VIP passes, anything else you ask, seated before a desk.  Staff remembers your name one day to another.  There are four receptions a day in the small lounge with food and an open bar, newspapers, a DVD library.  Bath liquids are better.  All that for $100 extra per day.  The frustration is that you pay extra for services any first rate hotel should give for free, noticeable only because the rest of the hotel lacks it.  All rooms are, in fact, identical throughout the property until you get to the very high end suites.  So pay $100 to be well pampered -- or save your money, do it yourself, and cry, whine, and tip.

Back down on the floor, a three or four block walk through the casino from the guest elevators, the convention area has one vast level of ballrooms atop another, escalators up five or six landings before fading to the hazy beyond.  Enough suites and ballrooms, I commented, that all the Jews in my home state Oklahoma could have weddings and bar mitzvahs on the same day they once a year in this hotel.  My convention companion thought this was funny.  ""Jew day,"" she said.

Also one cup on the bathroom sink when there is a double sink and a coaster sitting there with no cup. Honestly housekeeping paid no attention to detail when flipping this room. It was quite disappointing to walk in and even the basics weren't taken care of. A gold card holder with free room and upgrades and they place me facing a wall. Poor location and honestly not great service. We'll see how the day goes.,0,0,0

I slipped and fell going down the steps in bare feet, as they were so highly waxed, they were like glass, or stepping onto a skating rink! I don't drink much so I was not drunk, nor am I careless or clumsy. We called to report it... They sent up security and an EMT... I reported it so they would do something about it, and to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else who might get hurt much worse. I hurt my wrist, and my shoulder blade hit the step when I fell.  I was lucky, and the hotel is lucky, that it was not worse, as it could have been.  Next time, it might be someone who lands on their tailbone, or injures their spine or hits their head, among other things!

Now, before this happened on our last morning there, we had other problems which we never bothered complaining about and just let them slide. When we arrived to check in, at the VIP desk, for our 2-night stay,  we are informed our reservation is only for ONE night. We show them the email confirming 2 nights, but are told since it was  through corporate, they would have to talk to them the next morning, and would call us to let us know when done. They never called. So we had to call them after Noon to find out. It was done. That evening, we come back to our room only to find out we are locked out... Our keys no longer work! So now we have to wait for security, then new keys... Wrong ones delivered, so then had to wait for right ones. Our evening was delayed... We had come back to the room to freshen up for night time activities. 

I have not had a vacation in years other than a weekend away 2 or 3 times a year. I went away hoping to have a stress-free, relaxing weekend. Instead, a weekend of frustration and aggravation, and an accident. When we called to report the accident, that's when we decided to mention the other problems we had experienced. We had had enough at that point. Now, one would think they would at least make a follow up call to see how I am doing the following day, as well as offered some form of compensation for all the mishaps... But NOTHING! Not even a dinner, maybe a bottle of wine, something to show they are sorry for all the problems and want us to come back, and not get a bad review either. I know many hotels would've comp'ed a night when incidences like this happen to a guest! Every guest should be taken care of, but when even VIP guests are not treated properly, it makes one wonder how everyone else is treated at this hotel.  IF they do come through and decide to respond to us and compensate us in some way for our not-so-relaxing and very frustrating get-away, then I will remove this bad review everywhere it appears, including TripAvisor.",4,1,2

First of all right upon arrival, we strolled down the beautiful Italian designed building with high painted ceilings and marble floors to the strip of small boutiques through the casino, to the pool, or should I say SLEW of pools. I swear there are about 5 or 6 pools on the Venetian property. We approached the main pool and a Venetian employee approached us and asked if we would like a tour of the pool area. We kindly accepted. As we are walking around the pool area, packed with people (FYI this is Mid July, rated the hottest weekend in Vegas last year) we are approached by a gentlemen who asked us if we would like to be in a music video. A music video? Huh? We said, uh sure! He escorted us over to this blocked off area called Tao Beach. We signed disclosure forms and pictures were taken of us then we entered. LIL JON???? LMFAO???? IS THAT YOU???? We had only been in this hotel for frikken 15 minutes and we're standing in front of LIL EFFING JON? 

After that we thought nothing could really top that. If you can believe it, we were wrong. We got to our suite. Wow. A two level hotel suite, 2 queen sized beds (the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, IN MY LIFE), 2 big flat screen TVs, 1 in the bedroom area, 1 in the chill area with a huge wrap around couch, and 1 small flat screen TV in the beautiful marble bathroom. Mirrors everywhere! We're girls, we LOVE mirrors! A balcony? Helllll yes! And did I mention EVERYTHING is managed on 1 remote in this suite? We had a remote in between our beds to control the blinds, lighting, TV, air conditioning, errrrrrrrrythang!

Second level shopping, amazing. The ice-bar? Omg. Don't drink too fast or too much though, stomach ache+brain freeze :( I suggest sharing one. The atmosphere, priceless. It's like your outside Italy while your INSIDE Vegas. Ah :) takes me back to my favorite place in the world. And the Gondola ride? A GONDOLA RIDE, need I say more?

All of our pictures were ready to view the next day and we were able to sit with her and look at everything and decide then what package we wanted to go with.  She made it very easy for us.  We went with the photo package that includes a disk with all of our prints and the copyrights to all of them and the DVD of the ceremony.  We also got an album, some 8x10s and specialty photographs, such as metallic paper, canvas and a gorgeous 3 piece panel to go on the wall.  If you can get all of these I would definitely purchase these items as they are made extremely well and look beautiful.  The album is beautiful; We got a clear acrylic cover and it almost looks like glass.  Everything was shipped to us and we had everything in our hands by November, which is really quick.  I know people who wait sometimes years to have everything completed.   If you need anything retouched or photo shopped they do it and do it well!

I got up to my room and the place is beautiful and very spacious. I got the luxury suite and it was more than enough for everything. However, I went to go and plug my phone charger behind the night stand and saw condom wrappers and other things under the nightstand that the cleaning people never cleaned out.

Then I would have given it 4.5 stars.
Last time the room was pristine. This time our room looked a bit tired. This time we stayed in the larger Piazza Suite, last time the smaller Luxury Suite.
Last time we were supplied with luxury robes and a coffee pot. This time no robes, and we were told coffee pots were a liability now. However, the was no issue with hot irons, as there was one of those as well as a blow dryer in the suite. It was suggested we use room service. I just think after spending $200-$300 a night, a cup of tea or coffee when one wants it isn't asking a lot. Having to spend $15 plus a tip and after waiting 20-30 minutes any time the mood hits for tea or coffee is just ridiculous.
This time out room had not been totally cleaned from the last guests. There was a crude and lewd drawing hanging on the chandelier and there was not adequate towels linens or pillows. These were brought up within 15 minutes of request with apology. 
There was also construction going on. I never saw it or understood what was being done, but it went on all week from 7am - Yep SEVEN AM until 8pm. I requested a day comp for the week. That apparently was too much to ask, but they did take off the ""Resort Fees"" for the week.
Linens on bed were fresh and clean. Appeared not to be worn, as were towels. But the edges around the bathroom were starting to show wear. The carpeting and fixtures.
Wi-fi is terrible (but free) and phone reception on AT&T and Sprint very spotty.
Housekeeping was friendly and attentive.
We dined at several restaurants at resort and still find the Grand  Lux Cafe' to be the best breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's not the finest dining, but the food and service and what you get for the money is the best. The Bouchon is finer dining good for breakfast too, didn't care so much for lunch\/dinner. Out in the Canal there are some other good choices for lunch and dinner.
None of the shows we saw this trip were at the Venetian, so can't comment on these this visit.
Did a little gambling at the V this time. Cocktail waitresses were very pleasant and accommodating. Many of the dealers seemed bored. We saw several slot machines that were missing lights. However, compared to many other resorts, this casino is one of the better ones as far as variety and volume of business.

The Venetian does feel a bit older but still very comfortable nonetheless.

One of the complaints I have about the Venetian is the layout.  It's a veritable maze to try find your way around the place.  It's huge and getting from the parking lot, the casino, or your room is always a hike.  The Palazzo is set up a lot better in my opinion.  One other minor complaint was that there was no robes at The Venetian.  Other then that, the amenities are comparable to the Palazzo.

This hotel has luxury and efficiency off to a tee, suite was excellent with 3 flat screen TV's, desk in the corner allowing direct access to the suite wi-fi and has a printer with paper and ink to print your tickets to shows and attractions which you can get cheaper by completing the bookings on-line rather than using all the ""outlets"" throughout the shopping areas.

There are over thirty places to eat in this resort with the Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian open twenty fours a day. You will not starve as the portions are huge and the prices cheaper than I expected, the Grand Lux Cafe was good for all meals throughout the day. Every restaurant we ate in I consider outstanding.

With over 160 shops & boutiques nobody misses out on the shopping front. The casino will never disappoint whether you are a gambler or a novice with bets from 1 cent upwards.

If you want 5 star luxury, convenience, safety, professionalism and a once in a lifetime experience then stay here, it truly is in a class of its own and we visited every hotel on the strip to compare it. Second would be the Bellagio and third the MGM Grand. Do not believe the people who say three days in Vegas is enough, we were there for nine days and saw about half if we were lucky.

After our meal, we decided to tear it up in the casino for a bit. I should probably preface this by saying I'm a super frugal person. I'm honestly surprised I don't walk around using $0.20 off coupons whenever humanly possible... I've also done very little gambling. I'd describe myself as an intuitive and strategic gambler, but also one who doesn't like the stakes to be too high. With those standards, the Venetian is a decent casino.

I was so filled with glee when we actually had cocktail waitresses come up to us to get us free drinks (during my previous visits to Vegas, this was NOT the case and I couldn't seem to tap into these endless free drinks everyone talks about). Both of the ladies were all smiles and accommodations. It's baffling to me  they work overnight hours, in dresses, dealing with drunkards and having such a high energy about them.

The craps table was on fire, and their cheers could be heard rumbling through the casino.

My partner and I primarily bounced around from one slot machine to another. There are endless machines, from penny slots to five dollar slots. We didn't win but didn't lose much either ($10). 

The three roulette tables we passed were $5, $15, and $25 buy-in. Still too heavy for my cheap genes. But an interesting people watching place.

To start, housekeeping is loud, intrusive and they do not clean your room! I could hear them all the time from my room yelling across the hall! Next came the dealers and pit bosses. We are high players and stay in the Wynn every year where the service is impeccable! One Chinese dealer, on the night shift, by the name of Jennifer. made our playing so unpleasant that I had to leave the table. She yelled, falsely degraded our ways of playing and threw out winnings when we won. Not to mention she kept snarling and saying things in Chinese to another friend that was not playing, but yet sitting in the table and referring to us while laughing and glaring at us. Never have I had such a terrible experience playing in my life. The pit boss, Mary, was uncooperative too and tried to ignore the situation. Never addressing the dealers unprofessional and demeaning behavior.

if you plan on going to TAO, go there earlier and talk to a promoter whos usually outside, but if your ratio isn't that great then i'm not too sure because we had 8 girls and 6 guys. but we got in for free and only had to wait maybe 5-10 minutes in one of the 13 lines they had. 

So again, great location, right next to Wynn, i'll probably be staying at the Venetian from now on, i mean you're in Vegas, do it right or don't do it at all. see you guys there.",0,0,0

On Friday July 1- when my husband and I were at the Pool- my platinum emerald engagement ring was stolen from our room. Since it is an emerald- it cannot get soap or chlorine on it - so I always remove it and tuck it away in the same place. It was physically dug up out of luggage by housekeeping we were told- as we were the only other ones who entered our room besides them. The security guard told us this happens all the time and it was definetly the housekeeper. We filed a report with security immediately and are contacting their RISK management (As the venetian won't deal with this themselves). First off- I did not leave cash out, I did not leave my ring out in the open either. I was responsible with putting it where I always put it - tucked away - it was like finding a needle in a haystack. There was no safe located in our closet- as I checked - so hiding it was my only option. But even if I did leave it out in the open- it's absolutely unacceptable for it to have been taken in the first place. I pay to stay at the Venetian to feel safe. I can easily stay at an equally expensive hotel to get better customer attention, or save half the money and still be treated well. We live in Boston and fly to Vegas 5-6 times a year - so we are frequent visitors. After this weekend- I view the Venetian resort as a bunch of heartless monsters. This wasn't just jewelry. This was my engagement ring. This ring has memories that you can never replace. And not one employee cared - or at least acted like they cared. 

We went down to talk to a manager after we put up a ""Do not disturb"" sign because we didn't want housekeeping anywhere near us. And at 3:30pm we walked in to find a maid in our room. When we told the manager everything that happened and that we were fed up she just stared at us. Then she told me that when she travels she puts a lock on her luggage and that you shouldn't trust anyone. Thanks for the advice after my precious engagement ring is gone- thanks for being so thoughtful. She then said she can't do anything to make anything up to us except offer a late check out. I am tired of the rude, insensitive employees at the Venetian. Because they cannot screen their maids and hire thieves - I lose the most valuable thing I own. And all your manager can do is say ""I do not know about the incident, that's for Risk management- not me"". Are you serious?!

Save yourself- and stay at the new hotel the Cosmopolitan. It looks amazing and is brand new. The clubs there are also just as good and the pools are amazing. Beware if you stay at the venetian as they admit their housekeepers steal. DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING behind. You might as well drag your luggage down to the pool with you.

I thought the price tag of the room was a reflection of the service you received - WRONG. 

Room Tip: Stay at Cosmo down the strip...",3,1,0

Anyway, we arrived to Vegas early (8 am) and check in wasn't until 3 pm. We killed as much time as possible from the airport to car rental to breakfast and we decided to at least try to see if we could check in and if our room wasn't available we would just drop our bags off.

The room exceeded my expectations. Very clean and fancy and spacious.

I was invited back and this time, I requested not to stay in the Venezia tower. At check in, I requested an upgrade. I was offered the Rialto suite (supposedly 1100sqft) for a small price. I decided that this was a special occasion so I bit. Here is my review.
Service: I thought overall, very good. We had the bell guy bring up our luggage. They called to make sure that they had the correct number of pieces. We requested extra towels and blankets and that was brought up in a reasonable amount of time.
Room: One of the biggest pro with this room was its location. We stayed in room 11-102. Short trip up and right next to the elevator. Quite a change from having to walk miles before getting to your room. However, I was a tad underwhelmed with the room itself. It is supposedly 1100sqft but feels smaller. Much of the extra space was used for the foyer and bathroom. We supposedly was getting a great view, it turned out to be a view of the pool area. The room was recently renovated so it looked fresh and new. The beds were very comfy. Bathroom was well appointed. It is a nice room but I would probably not pay for the upgrade in the future.
Amenities: Did not use the pool area. Also, I appreciated the opportunity to decline the resort fee ($25 for wifi and fitness room use, among other things). Lots of restaurants to choose from.

We gambled a little but no one did very well and their tables were a little high for day time mid-week.

For those who hates the heat and prefers to stay in cold rooms, the venetian hotel rooms are fairly cold too.  Also, this was the only hotel that had flowers pumping through their vent, and never did i smell like cigarettes.  They have a food court in the casino and in the canal shops for those who want to eat a little cheaper.  Some of the other hotels might be a little more ""vegas like"" but this one is definitely my favorite.",0,0,0

Check-in was easy... the woman at the desk was very friendly and the whole process was pretty painless.  The room she had put me in had a killer view of the strip.  The room was pretty nice... they are all suites, so they are huge.  A TV in the living room, another in the bedroom, and even one in the bathroom... wow!  The bed was incredibly comfortable... generally hotel beds are horrible on my back, but this was one of the most comfortable beds I'd ever slept in.  Also, the room was quiet... I didn't have any noise from my neighbors or hear other doors opening\/closing. 

I'm not much of a gambler, so don't really have any comments there.  It seemed clean and didn't completely stink of cigarette smoke, so that was a nice plus.  

My biggest complaint is that I was promised a non-smoking room... there is no way in hell that my room hadn't been smoked in recently.  It smelled so strong, that I was struggling to breathe the first time I had walked in.  I immediately called the front desk... they said they were going to set up an air purifier in the room and promised this would take care of it.  This was at about 10:15am.  By 11am, they still hadn't shown up yet, so I called back to make sure they were still coming.  I was promised they would be there in the next 20 minutes.  Since I had to go check in at a conference and wouldn't be in the room, I took their word for it and figured it would be dealt with while I was gone.  Unfortunately, I showed up at the room again at about 5:30pm, and it still stunk incredibly bad.  I called back to the front desk again and they apologized and would be sending somebody right up.  So, 10 minutes later, a guy shows up with a spray bottle... now when they said air purifier, I expected some sort of HEPA air filter, or something along those lines... not an industrial bottle of deodorizing spray.  So the guy sprayed the room - not a bit of difference...He did it again, and it helped, but it still wasn't great.  It went from cigarettes to about 30% cigarettes and 70% cleaning spray... oh well.  I also found cigarette burns in the couch.  Disappointing.

Would I stay here again?  I'm not sure... probably not if I had to pay for it.  They really should have just offered to change rooms for me and I would have been happy with that... instead they took a very half-assed approach to dealing with the problem, and it was never properly dealt with.",0,0,0

I stayed in the Venezia Suite Tower on my last trip, and holy smokes the room was like a castle for 3 people. Comfy beds, a big L-shaped couch (chicks dig it!) and a great view. I loved the layout because it reminded me a studio with the beds in the first area and the couch in the living area.

The hotel itself is a masterpiece, lots of inspired art and decor. It just screams luxury. Casino is lit well and even though alot of people smoke, you don't smell it at all.

Crowd consists of people who have alot of money and people who want to look like they have alot of money. LOL. So you can definitley call it upscale. I always feel like a small fish in the ocean when I gamble here, because my chip stacks of $1 roulette chips is nothing compared to the guy with the same sized stack but with $5 or even $25 chips lol. Not a place for novice gamblers! One of the higest limits of the strip, and you'll be pressed to find limits lower then $15 at night.

As far as entertainment goes, theres Tao Nightclub in the evening time and Tao Beach for daytime fun. Quicktip! The cheapest way to get into Tao Nightclub is to eat there at dinner, and get a stamp. Definitley cheaper then simply dropping $40-$80 for cover and you can say you dined at a $$$$ restaurant lol.

I've stayed here at this hotel over 10x already and trust me I have noticed the difference. 

Cons: The room use to include two generous LCD TVs, by Sharp I believe, now they swapped them out and included a generic no name brand. Not only was the TV an eyesore, it was smaller as well.

Checking in - The room had a mirror that was tilted and out of place (cleaning lady probably couldn't do anything about this. The lamp was tilted\/broken like someone just had a party in here.

Valet is horrible anytime during the day. You're going to have to wait at least 20-35 minutes. 

Pros: The room is still fairly big. Whether you get a 1 king bed or 2 queens it will include a living room area with a pull out sofa bed. Venetian rooms are all suites. This mean you can pack a lot of people in one room. A lot of people who are budget do this and split the cost of the room.

Room Rates for regular people are normally $239 - 279 on Fridays and Saturdays. Busier Weekends can set you back at $299 - $499 a night. If you play at the casino your rates could be reduced or you can be offered favorable rates in the future.

I crave for that nostalgic scent they blast through their vents.  As soon as you walk through their lobby doors, it whooshes up your nose and embeds itself in your brain leaving you hooked for life.  I kid you not, it is the most distinct smell you cannot forget.  

It's a bit pricey without a gambleholic's VIP hookup, but you do get what you pay for.  So make friends with a poker enthusiast for cheap\/free stays or honestly, be ghetto if you need to & jam pack the room to split the costs!  Love the spacious & luxurious suites.  3 people per bed(1 king or 2 queens), 2 on the pullout sofa bed, 1 more on the couch.  The rest claim your spots on the floor.  What difference does it make where you sleep if you're drunk anyway, right?  Two flat screen tvs, one more in the bathroom.  HUGE bathroom and mirrors all around for all the girls to put their faces on at once before a night out.

There's a food court in the casino with a lot of delicious choices, and a food court on the second level with a bigger variety of fast food joints...but you MUST dine @ Grand Lux Cafe.  It's a tradition to stop by.

Lots of tables and machines in the casino to win or lose your cash monayys.  Wanna dance?  Sorry, but Tao sucks...luckily the location of the Venetian is perfect.  Do yourself a favor and walk over to Encore for Sin City's hot spots: XS & Surrender.

At first I got there, it's just gorgeous to look at. Perfect spot on the strip. Everyone was nice to me, although that's their job, but come on.. Nobody's nice all the time in a hotel. I had the bella suite, which had 3 tv's (including one in the bathroom; with a tub, shower, water closet, vanity, two sinks, and french doors) A tv in the sunken living room WITH  a sofa bed, and of course one in front of the two most comfy beds i've ever slept in.

Room service was great, friendly AND ALWAYS on time. 

I walked through almost every hotel on the strip, and I have to say this one is my top favorite. It's huge! I don't even think I went everywhere inside because it's just. that. big.

Oh, make sure you don't touch what the water and cookies are sitting on because the check-in guy said if you move that you get charged for it, because it's weighed! So, don't open the fridge underneath it either. Buy a cooler, and use the ice machine like we did ;)

The negative? I like to take my clothes and put them in drawers for the week, not enough room for 3 peoples clothes. The lighting for make-up is only great in the bathroom. It's pretty dark in the room. 

And when you go to the concierge desk ask for VIP tickets for the clubs there, they'll give it to you if you sweet talk. DO NOT buy anything off the street. It's scams, you can get those club\/pool tickets for free.

I didn't take notice to the stench that people keep complaining about, that might be just because I was more focused on the architecture lol.

And do NOT take a taxi to the hotel, there's a shuttle for 7 bucks, that comes every hour. Our taxi was 30 bucks, INCLUDING tip (big mistake, it was out first day, what can you say?). When you get there, don't take a taxi ANYWHERE. Get a bus, it's called The Deuce, and they run everywhere along the strip, even at Fremont Street and at the other end near the vegas sign. 7 bucks for 24 hours, which runs ALL DAY\/EVERYDAY! The bus also comes every 10 minutes... So worth it.

159 dollars a night? NOT bad for a suite like ours! And make sure, when you buy things, check out the bottom of all receipts, panda express had a survey to take and you got an another entree for free! =)",5,0,0

The big bathroom in our Suite was truly big and very impressive. And the fact we couldn't hear people making noise in the hallways really made it count. We all love to go a bit overboard while in Vegas, but I really appreciate people leave the craziness at the bar, the strip or anyplace but the hallways of the hotel they are staying in. 

The pool in the new wing was crowded during the day but was a welcome treat in the night when we came back from the day long of walking up and down the hot vegas strip. the 2 Jacuzzies  were fun to be in as well. All in all, a great place to spend a few days in Vegas if you cannot afford Mandarin or Aria or Cosmo.",4,1,2

I loved it. It was a little hard getting used to the rosey smell of the lobby and casino but you grow to enjoy the fragrance.  I recently stayed at the Palazzo and I can say that the rooms here are in better shape. Weird since the Palazzo is new but ok, whatever.  

Housekeeping comes by twice a day. They kept our towels stocked and our ice bucket filled and insisted on giving me handfuls of chocolate.  The front desk was accommodating as I called on the last morning of our stay and requested a late check out and they happily gave us an additional 2 hours to sleep. If we wanted to extend until 2 pm, they charge half their nightly rate. No thank you. 

This is a great place to rest your head, gamble, party, see a show and eat.

When we first walked into the hotel, I saw that the check-in line was about long as the check-in line at O'Hare airport for UAL!   However, I was pleasantly surprised that the line went SUPER fast -- which was managed by a hotel personnel -- and we were checked in promptly and courteously.   (If only airport lines went this quickly!)  My next fear was how long it was going to take our luggage to come to our room.  Again, to my pleasant surprise, our luggage came within 15 minutes of checking into our room.  

During our 2 day stay, the only complaint that I had was a wobbly toilet lever (which was still functional), the mistaken mini-fridge charges (which they took off promptly) and weird Chinese brand of toiletries.  Car was pulled out of valet quickly.    Calls to front desk and valet were picked up quickly.  WiFi was great and I had no connectivity problem.  (I used WiFi to stream a bunch of work related videos).    

We loved BOUCHON for breakfast, B&B, and the shopping!!.    We also loved the comfy couch in the room.

As you enter your door you are greeted by a 10 footish hallway that leads to your bedroom and living room. Within that hallway is a gigantic mirror and right across from that is your bathroom. Since that's what you see first let me tell you about the bathroom: 

Right when you enter there's a vanity mirror for all you ladies. There are his and her sinks with a mirror that stretches all across from left to right. Beside the vanity is the door to the poo poo station which also has a phone just in case you need to talk to someone or have another form of emergency in there. Across from that door is the bathtub, which can fit two people and a full view of the shower which is right beside that. The shower is very roomy but unfortunately doesn't have much place to put your bathing amenities. So what!!! How often do you get to enjoy a bathroom like that?! 

At the foot of the bed is a weird mini psychiatrist couch which I would say does accentuate the room perfectly. A few feet from that is the cabinet where you can put some of your clothes or whatever you really need to be stored and above that is the awesome flat screen television. One side of the bed is a nightstand that has an alarm clock and on the other side a phone. There's also a closet that has lights that automatically turn on and off once the doors are opened or closed. 

As you go deeper into the room you have your living are which is actually divided from the bedroom area by a barricade and two steps which has a convenient floor light so you won't trip on your way back and forth when it's dark. Once you step foot on the lowest step there is a gigantic L couch to lounge on. In front of that, a gigantic square coffee table and underneath that a slide out... foot thingy... sorry I have no idea what it's called but hey, it is my first time experiencing such a high class accommodation. Anyway in front of the couch is another flat screen television that is housed in a gigantic cabinet which also has a DVD player and fridge for your cooling needs and also carries the in house water and alcohol which would naturally be pricey... $5 dollars just for a regular bottle of water... probably Kirkland too but hey what do I know... To the side of the TV is a mini dining area with a round table, 3 chairs and a nicely, already dimmed lamp directly above. Then to the side of that is a desk for you business types. It comes complete with a phone and a printer and you can use the Internet. 

That's pretty much just the room. I could say more but that alone was probably already too much. 

Parking is good, you're never too far from the entrance to The Canal Shoppes which is beyond beautiful and high end. It's also amazing because there is a canal with a gondola that goes through the middle of all the shops.

Unfortunately since my pockets aren't that deep, I wasn't able to shop at the actual shops except for The Coffee Bean, and New York Pretzel. Once I have the money you'll be able to catch me with more than just snacks ;) 

The casino is amazing, at check in I was given $25 in slot credit and I won $55 back so I made a $30 profit haha. They have their Grazie card which is their players card and you can build up point for rewards like a free stay or little gifts. 

There's also 5 star dining everywhere you go. They only have one restaurant with a 4 star rating.

Room Type: 1,100 sq foot Rialto View Suite (room 27-205)

Casino\/hotel itself: 8\/10
Customer Service: 2\/10

I'll start off with the Positives:
- The hotel itself is aesthetically gorgeous
- Nice little shopping center within the hotel (includes a cigar shop)
- Amenities include free mini-refrigerator, bathrobes, slippers, soap and shampoo (all upon request)... free printing and internet come with the Rialto suite.
- Large pool areas (multiple pools & Tao Beach option)

Negatives:
- Terrible customer service (elaborated upon below)
- Not many late-night dining options within the hotel
- Located at far end of the strip
- Casino floor layout is clumsy

Upon arriving at The Venetian, I found myself very impressed with the hotel interior. As mentioned above, it is gorgeous inside. However, this was overshadowed by the multiple issues that had occurred during our stay and subsequent poor customer service, which was amongst the worst I have ever experienced during a hotel stay.

I had pre-paid for an 1,100 square foot suite (the Rialto View Suite). Upon check-in, I was assigned an inferior room. When I had pointed out the error, I was told my room was ""on hold"" due to bathroom maintenance, but after 15-20 minutes at the counter, the lovely Paige was able to take the room off hold, as ""the maintenance had already been complete.""

Upon entering the bathroom, one of the faucet handles was broken, the glass shower door squeaked loudly, and during the second day the toilet clogged up.

I was told during check-in that because I had booked a room at the Venetian, I (&friends) could be put on the guest list for Tao Nightclub to enter free of cover charge, as long as we got there before midnight and there were more females than male in my party. Because of this, I dragged 7 girl friends to accompany me and 4 guy friends to Tao that night. When we got to the front of the guest list line, my female guests were let in free of charge but all of us males were asked to pay a $20 cover charge each. We paid it as we had already waited in the line and our women were already in the club. When I had asked the front counter about this the following day, I was told we should have been let in free of charge provided we were accompanied by more females than males. When I stated we had met this prerequisite, I was then told (in contrary) that it is ""up to the mood of the bouncer.""

Our room was only cleaned once during our three night stay, and that was the day before we left. There was no ""do not disturb"" hung on the door handle and we barely spent any time in the room.

If you stay at The Venetian and need to call the front desk for anything, plan to be on hold for 20+ minutes. This happened more than once when clean towels were needed (as room was not cleaned until the day before our departure) and when maintenance for the bathroom was needed.

One of our door keys ceased to function after the first night.

""View suite"" had lame view

The horrors did not stop after we had left. The week following our stay at The Venetian, I discovered an additional $410 charge on my credit card. I was on hold for about 30 minutes when I had called the hotel to dispute the charge, hung up in frustration and made contact via email due to no answer. $300+ was due to refreshments having been moved around the refrigerator (our mistake initially, though I was assured I would not be charged as I had quickly notified the front desk of the error moments after the incident had occurred.. a hotel employee even came in to verify the count the following day and reassured me that nothing would be charged). There was also a charge in excess of $50 for in-suite dining that I had not ordered, though I accepted the charge as one of my guests may have made the order without my knowledge (though none had claimed responsibility after having spoke to them). On a positive note, the A\/R rep, Maria, was prompt (as I have found most A\/R will be when it comes to matters of payment) and had even provided me with an itemized breakdown of the charges and a copy of the receipt for the in-suite dining (which contained a signature that was clearly not mine). The $300+ charge for refreshments was also credited.

Even so, I must note in the end, the A\/R rep still insisted on charging me an arbitrary $50 ""restocking fee"" when crediting me for the incorrect charges to my credit card. I asked her to advise what was being ""restocked"" as nothing from the room was consumed. It was an added slap in the face given the thousands of dollars we had spent that weekend on the room, the casino floor, the restaurants, Tao nightclub and stores within.

Bottom Line: The Venetian is among the fancier looking hotels in Vegas, but the customer service is amongst the worst. I will not be stopping by again during any of our future business or annual trips, and I will strongly advise friends not to stay here when the opportunity is presented.",5,0,0

We just didn't need or want all that extra for $149\/night.  One day we called for extra towels because we got missed by housekeeping.  They brought them up really quickly and brought plenty.  The next day, housekeeping came in to make up the room and took all the extra towels back out of the room.  Annoying.  Just a note, they are making the resort fee mandatory again.

Stars are hard to rate since we used different rooms depending on who is in our crowd.  Suite with two bed, king bed, queen bed are a bit different.  So ratings are base on overall experience, not each individual room.

For the price paid I am appalled there is no WIFI.  Price increased to $17+ a day for WIFI! What? every hotel should have standard WIFI because we rely on it to figure out what to do in vegas! What to eat\/to play\/to drink, traffic, venues, tickets, etc. I cannot even begin to list all the possibilities and needs for WIFI especially in Vegas.  So that is one big star off.

I would take another star off for no coffee pot, or even hot water.  Shouldn't there be a standard to have hot water or a pot in the room.  I just wish for the price you are given that or even some coffee products.  Even cheaper places have it as a standard.

It's safe to say that we will most likely stay here 100% of the time when in town, (with the exception of the Palazzo with is their sister resort anyway) exclusively! 

We have stayed at many other resorts on the strip but never here. My family always stays at the Venetian and my husband and I are just the exception. We chose Venetian this time because my parents receive complimentary stays through their Grazie membership. They had a 3-night stay comp so we decided to head to Vegas for my husband's birthday and stay with them because its such a huge room. We decided to just pay for the 4th night's stay.

We really did not need to leave this hotel and could of vacationed at the hotel and casino on it's own. The room was very spacious and I love that there is a vanity equipped with a light up vanity mirror - we all love to get all glammed before a night out in Vegas so what a great and useful set up for hair and makeup.

The beds were very comfortable! Because our room was the biggest out of group of 15 (our friends stayed at different hotels on the strip) we made our location the central ""meet up"" room. Our friends all really loved our hotel as well and we believe we've made new Venetian patrons out of them, for the future. Security made us feel safe because they do not let people up who are not guests, unless they are accompanied by someone staying there and we learned that first hand since we had friends visit.

We enjoyed the pools and all of the different shops and restaurants. 

Check in and Check out were both easy and amazing! My parents checked in before we got there, so I am not sure of the agent who helped them checked in but they raved about their service that they received from her. 

For check out, my parents had already left so as authorized people on the reservation, we were able to check out. Can we just talk about the service we received from front desk agent Sue? She was so helpful and sincere! She went above and beyond to answer our questions and because of her diligence in making calls for approval, we ended up with a zero balance after check out. We got our 4th night comped based on everyone in the room's play.

We had a not so great experience at the Grazie desk that morning and Sue did more than make up for our sour feelings. She gave us the feeling that we'd never want to stay anywhere else when returning to Vegas.

I need to mention that we had two very different experiences at the Grazie desk. The night before check out we spoke to a gentleman that took the time to explain to us what the best way to get our room comped and how we can play to help. The morning after we went back to see how we did with our points and received horrible service from a different woman in the morning. She was not wanting to hear what we had heard the night before and kept telling us we were new members (even though we were staying with my parents who had been long time members) and that we had not earned enough. I found it off putting that she treated us that way. 

Overall despite that one interaction our stay was wonderful. The staff and service was A+++ and the shops, restaurants, casino etc were all great!! We will be back again and will recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family!",1,1,1

Sure the Bella is 2nd to the cheapest room they offer, but because it's part of a luxury hotel, I don't want to hear that I got what I paid for.

I paid for what was advertised: exquisite luxury, plush pillow-top beds, 400ct wool throws, in-bathroom LCD HDTV.

Instead, the look is luxury but the room has aged and everything is worn. I appreciate the vanity in the bathroom, but the surface has scratches all over. Towels are standard but bath amenities is some sort of unrecognizable brand. And no bathroom tv (I was looking forward to watching their meditation channel while soaking in the tub).

If an Elderly had shut the water closet I imagine they would be stuck there until someone discovers them. I'm 25 and didn't realize that after I firmly closed the door that I had nearly locked myself in. I pushed hard to get that door to budge open. My friend and I avoided closing the water closet entirely for the remaining time we were there... awkward. The wardrobe closet was also a struggle to open and close. We tried to see if there was a lock integrated somewhere but really the door was just old.

Comfort:
Did someone steal the plush pillow top from our beds? When I leaped into bed I was greeted by an old spring mattress. Not enough pillows, no variation in density. The throws, the comforter were coarse. The Egyptian cottons were the only things that felt nice. 

The sofa was very comfortable and soft. While napping on it for a few hours I heard knocking in the background. I kept wondering why the knocking kept continuing, but didn't realize it was for our room. Despite the ""do not disturb"" sign on our door, I heard our door swing open. Thank goodness the 3rd lock was implemented so it halted the door and I heard a man's voice exclaiming, ""OH! I'm so sorry."" Who the heck was that? Housekeeping? At 4 or 5pm? Why was our sign ignored? Seriously, If you and your partner were having some fun in bed, what a scene that would have been.....

Layout and Security:
This place is rather complicated to navigate. After we had checked in, we headed to our room. We thought we were at the door to our room, but were perplexed that the door was wide open,  exposing clothes and luggage. Were we double booked? Nope. We were at the right door #, but on the wrong level! The housekeeper was working in this particular room when we arrived.  ""I-500s"" is read as ""floor 1, 500s"". We needed to be on 10-500s. So in light of this, I question the security of the rooms when housekeepers occupy it. Don't leave your valuables or accessories out in the open. The housekeepers may respect your items, but your neighbors may not.",4,3,2

Anyway, I had to conduct a little business.  The 800 phone call from the landline was free and the internet was included.  I liked that aspect.  The main pool on the 4th floor was gorgeous on Thursday and Friday.  On the weekend, it was disgusting.  It was so crowded and unknown particles were floating everywhere.  I wouldn't go in.  The spa is reasonably priced $20 and full of all kinds of activities from spinning classes, yoga, rock climbing, etc.  Very lush.  The casino tables are too expensive.  However, right next door is a cheap casino called Casino Royale where you can play craps and 21 for $3 during the week and $5 on the weekend.  We had a great time gambling and most of the gamblers were staying at the Venetian or the Paris.  All in all, a great place to stay (minus the pool on weekends) and we will be staying there again.  One other complaint, the TV stations were non-existent.  I enjoy watching TV on vacation and there wasn't anything to watch.  They had very few stations and most were off-beat cable stations.  Also, check-out is archaic.  You still have to wait in line.  They should email your bill to you on the morning of checkout or slide it under the door and call it a day.",0,0,0

The rooms are beautiful.  They are a semi-suite, with a living room, that is separated from the bedroom by a step down versus by a wall.  The living rooms are equipped with desk with a multi function fax\/printer as well as a flat screen tv and a comfy couch.  One bummer is that the refrigerator is full of stuff you have to buy, so forget putting your own drinks in there.  But, on the bright side if you want super overpriced snacks and drinks, you got it!

The beds are very comfy and they come with robes and slippers... and another tv in front of the bed!  The bathroom is huge with a separate little room  with the toilet.  They are equipped with both a shower and a tub and come with some decent toiletries and I personally found the towels thick and fluffy.

The pools at the Venetian are nice, but not super exciting.  Tao day and nightclub is right next door, so you can hear the tunes from there, but the regular pool is large but with no extras.  Best part is TONS of lounge chairs around the pool and off in little areas, some shaded, some not.  There are two large pools and one large jacuzzi.  You can also walk over to the Palazzo pools and they have a little more variety over there.  While we were here last, only one of the pools was opened... kinda a bummer because it was a LONG walk from the pool that was open to the jacuzzi.  But, it was all good.  Hot day, cool pool.  LOVE!

The casino is large with a huge selection of games.  Really big poker room - YEA!  One of the bartenders at the center bar is freaking awesome... I don't know about the others.  Wish I'd gotten his name.  The Property (along with the Palazzo) also has a great selection of restaurants\/bars, shopping, and shows. 

It really is a fun place.  Definitely sign up for Club Grazie and spend enough gambling and you can hang out in the Gold room.  HOORAY!  Love the gold room... snacks, drinks, quiet and private bathrooms.

Overall, I enjoy this property.  I'll be back!

WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?

I'd rather smell the smoke than become nauseated by the perfurme smell- my wife agreed.  on our floor there must have been a bunch of teenagers\/college kids because all thru the nite they ran up and down the hall screaming, banging on doors, and just being plain ignorant and obnoxious.  the pool was overcrowed with a bunch of drunk looking college kids, most of which we saw come directly off the street up into the elevators.  it was like a 'spring break' atmosphere at the pool and elevator lobby area.  one person would show a room card for about 10 people to get in so they had some kind of racket going; i don't know if this is the resort for UNLV students to party at during the weekends, but I'm going to spend my money somewhere else in the future rather than take the chance of finding out if this is indeed the new 'animal house'.  Last, if you want to catch a taxi, you must cross 5 lines of traffice for limos, buses, and drivers who refuse to yield and are tyring to hit you; when you get to the taxi line, be prepared to wait at least 1\/2 hour since the line is so long.  if the venetian doesn't get its act together, i can't see many people returning on later visits- except for those who like to be surrounded by obnoxious\/drunk college kids and\/or love perfume-infused casinos.",0,0,0

Check-in was faster than expected given the large number of people checking in and out. My room was huge and had a separate sitting area with a couch and desk. The bathroom was large and included a giant tub. The hotel offers smoking and non-smoking rooms. The room was clean and I was thrilled that it did not stink of carpet freshener as many non-smoking rooms do. 

The hotel is located right on the strip and has a huge selection of restaurants to choose from. Thomas Keller's Bourchon is located on the 10th floor and there are several Bouchon bakeries throughout for delicious, French pastries for breakfast. For those wanting to grab and go there are several JuiceFarms as well as a Coffee bean and Tealeaf. Restaurant options run the gamut from Italian to American to French. I had a great dinner at DB Brasserie and lunch at Bouchon. 

The Venetian Canal shops offer a wide range of retail offerings ranging from Burberry to Barney's New York to 7 for all Mankind. What's best about the shops is the shopping experience as you wander along cobblestones with an illuminated and painted ceiling and architecture that's designed to create an experience similar to shopping in Venice. There is a canal with gondolas on the second floor of the hotel! It's pretty hard to fathom, but amazing to view or experience. On any given day you might come across an opera or mime performance along the way. It's a unique shopping experience unlike any other, and there are lots of great dining options along the way.

The suite was a pretty good deal upon checkin (I think we got it for half of what it was online when we booked our room a few months ago) so I'd definitely suggest booking a cheaper room to secure your spot ahead of time, and then going over the upgrade options when you get on the property.

The Venetian has always been one of my favorite properties as the whole Venice vibe is quite cute, but after seeing our room, I was sold!

Fully stocked mini-bar and fridge. Unfortunately, there is no space in the fridge for your own items.

My boyfriend and I checked in at the Venetian at 11AM and worried that our room wasn't going to be ready. We took a risk and decided to go for it anyways and was happy to see that our room was ready and that we were able to check in right away (super efficient and accommodating). 

THE ROOM:
For a regular suite, this has got to be one of the biggest hotels room I've stayed in in the US. The bathroom is huge with two sinks, a bath, a shower, a small vanity desk, and a separate section for the toilet. There are many mirrors in the bathroom with amazing lighting. HELLO SELFIES! My most favorite part of this suite was definitely the living room because it gave us extra room to eat, hang around, walk around, etc. There are also three TVs included in this suite - one in the bathroom, one where the bed is, and one in the living room. 

AMENITIES:
There are ten pools total, half belongs to Venetian and the other half belongs to the Palazzo. All of the pools are super nice and they all accommodate to whichever hotel guests prefer (i.e. family pool, quiet pool, etc). The biggest pool is definitely the pool next to Tao Beach Club which is nice if you like listening to DJs, but don't want to pay $$ to get into Tao Beach Club. However, hotel guests get in free before 2pm, so that is a major plus. My boyfriend and I got there at exactly 2pm and they still let us in for free. The beach club is pretty small though and the pool is pretty disgusting. I read some reviews after going there and it seems like a lot of people thought the pool smelled like piss, which I totally 100% agree with (I thought it was just me). 

I didn't get to try out the spa facilities because I already had a spa day at Aria, but I am pretty sure it is super nice.

FOOD:
Of all the hotels I've stayed at in Vegas, I think the Venetian provides the most variety in terms of food within the hotel premises. The restaurants ranges from super cheap to super expensive, so the hotel guests has a lot of options. The problem I had at Aria was that they didn't have cheap food places within the hotel vicinity. The food is actually pretty good too; I highly recommend the 24 hour pizza joint downstairs. I also really enjoyed having Bouchon Bakery right in front of the hotels on the casino floor.

Overall, this is definitely a hotel that I would want to stay in again in the future. It really does not disappoint. It is by far the best hotel I've stayed in in Vegas (I still havent tried other great ones like Encore and Wynn though). I love how there are shopping centers, restaurants, and many other things inside the area, instead of having to go outside in the heat for it. I really dread going out in the hot weather for food, so this was the perfect place to stay in for me.",7,0,3

We had a nice person taking us out. She stopped for us to watch the new christmas show which gave me a nice holiday chills. (in a good way)

I realize that the Venetian is huge as are all of the hotels in Las Vegas but when It is a 1\/4 mile to your room from the lobby we thought that was a little excessive. From the Casino to the lobby to our room it was about 1\/2 a mile. That might not seem like a lot but when you make that trip 3 times a day for 3 days you get really board with it really fast.

However, this week in September, there were SLAMMIN' deals at some of the classier hotels, so along with the incentive of the FREE Phantom of the Opera ticket, the Venetian it was.

The room was lovely, very elegantly decorated, but honestly I feel the best part about staying here was the location.  Don't get me wrong - it's a BEAUTIFUL building.  Every time I walked outside of the hotel or approached it, I could hardly believe this was where my hotel room was it's so breath taking.  So it's beautiful, and maybe the most perfect location to stay at on the Strip.  The Mirage and Treasure Island are right across Las Vegas Boulevard, the Wynn is a short walk up north, and everything else is just a little bit south!  

The Canal shops are entertaining and fun to walk through.  Also along the path are several wonderful places to eat.  We ate at Z'efferino, which I HIGHLY recommend for you fine diners.

In September I combined business with pleasure and stayed for six days.  I get offers from the Venetian almost on a weekly basis. My wife and I took them up on one of their offers.  Things have certainly changed. Maybe it's just bad luck on my part but it seems the slots at the Venetian are screwed down so tight that they hardly ever pay anything. I was told by several locals don't gamble at the Venetian. They have become so tight they squeak. Since I belong to their players club I accumulate points as I gamble. When I asked what comps I might received I was told nothing since my room (three days) was free. So, if I had not gambled would they have charged me for the room? I thought the reason that I got these offers was because of my past patronage. On this trip I gambled more (my choice) then any other time since I start coming to Vegas yet the extras that the Venetian used to do to show their appreciation has all but dried up.

The room is large (650sf) and spaced out nicely with a sunken living room that boast an L shaped sofa, large work desk, dining table, 32 lcd tv, coffee table and ottoman. 

The king sized bed was the perfect combination of soft and firmness with lots of pillows. The only issue i had with the bed that it wasn't your typical king sized bed. The width was correct but the length of the bed was short and my toes touched the end of the bed and i know im not a tall person. There is also a 32'' lcd tv for the bedroom as well.

The bathroom has a separate enclosed shower and roman tub with a double sink and a small lcd tv. The toilet is enclosed in a tiny room which was a bit odd. The shades and curtain completely blackout the sun and can be remotely controlled. 

I would suggest staying in one of the upper floors if you want to sleep in since they have pool parties and can be heard from our 28th floor room. Checking in was easy and quick. If you plan to valet your car, do it at the entrance valet area and not the back one. We valet our car in the back area and had to walk all the way to the front to check in and walk all the way back to reach the 3 elevators for the tower.

I DID. 

yes, i took THREE showers in ONE DAY. i couldn't help myself. i felt so spoiled and pampered during my stay because my suite included THREE flat screen TVs -- 1 TV by the beds, 1 TV in the living room and 1 little TV in the  bathroom. The bathroom was bigger than my bathroom at my own house! It had a separate door for the toilet (for privacy), bath & glass shower with the BEST shower head. No wonder i took three showers in one day. 

My friends and i reserve 2 Bella Suites in the main Venetian building ($259 a night). 5 people in each room and each of us had our own bed. The sofa can pull out as a sofa bed and there were two queen beds. However, i was kinda disappointed the room didnt have a coffee maker for me to boil hot water or anything. The suite also included two bathrobes for you to wear and if you like to keep them they were $80 each. If you plan to stay at Venetian try booking your room in the main building rather than the Venezia because my friend said it was inconvenient and he took at least 3 elevators to reach the main casino floor.

PROS:
BEAUTIFUL!!! this hotel was breath-taking. i cannot begin to explain how much in awe i was when i first walked through it.  as far as the suite, the bed was sleepin in clouds with a great pillow and down comforter...bathroom was INCREDIBLE!  I went with a bunch of party-rocker friends (4 girls + 2 guys = 6 people total) and there was definately enough space.  so stayin with a bunch of friends, it was nice that there was two sinks (one turned into a cooler though cause we couldn't use the fridge to chill our drinks) and another door to the toilet within the bathroom (mainly so i could bomb the can while everyone else was getting ready).  another bonus (girl thing) plenty of mirrors in the bathroom, so we could all get ready quick!  and i felt really safe here (especially cause i tend to wander off late at night by myself), there was a lot of security...they even escorted me and my friend to our room one night

CONS:
it's a frickin maze! upon arrival, (other than the incredible paintings & sculptures) we were ALL thinkin: ""oh sh!t...i hope we don't get lost trynna find our room at the end of the night"".  it was literally right, up the elevator, across the bridge, left, right, left, right, right, up the elevator, right, right...= lost to me! after a while we got it, but it's just a journey to get to the room (especially after a long night in the club in heels).  our keys all got deactivated, and to get new ones that worked took FOREVER (aka 3hrs of going up and down to see if it worked, waiting around, etc.).  i don't know if that was a weird situation, but service could be better.
it isn't the closest to the strip...so we ended up cabbin it everywhere. oh and beware: if you touch anything in the fridge, you will be charged. they have a motion sensor on that thing. & no micro so can't really save any leftovers

COME BACK AGAIN?:
i was glad that we stayed here.  it was a fun experience, but for the price, probably wouldn't come back again.  i think everyone should stay here once.  if your plans are to hit the clubs every night, i would suggest stay closer to the middle (other than the one night we went to tao, we were at cosmo, ph, etc).",0,0,0

The only downside to this hotel would be the price - it's not exactly a great bargain, unless you do some real bargain hunting and extensive research. Also, there is a mandatory $20 daily resort fee that is magically added to your bill once you check in. This gives you included internet and access to the gym, but I would have appreciated being warned of this sneaky fee instead of it cowering in the fine-print. Also, the front desk takes forever to dispatch maintenance to the rooms. Overall, a great stay.",0,0,0

1 tiny person 
This is the reason I booked this hotel.

Wasn't close to what I imagined 

Customer service at the front desk 

I booked this trip for a birthday and anniversary 
At the beginning in the check in we didn't got the room I ordered 
Asked for a non smoking high flor with view 
And got a smoking whit no view and not in high level 

We where tired and went to the room
It was almost 12:00 at night 
We couldn't fall a sleep it smelled very bed 
Even the bed sheets where sticky from cigarettes I don't think they where replaced!!!
In a  while 
 We went the next morning to the desk to ask for a different room he took them the whole day to give us a room then eventually turn out not so good well yes they gave us non-smoking high-level but the bathroom was dirty and full l
With  hairs 
 Again the next morning we went to the desk and they replaced the room to non-smoking but low level  
Until we reach the room the key wasn't working we waited 25 minutes for nobody to show so we went back to the desk to get a key I want to ask a question is this a joke or what
They only compensated us by canceling the  resort fees and gave us another hundred dollar to use At the hotel 
I think that it's a disgrace not every thing is $$$$$ all hope that someone will hear about it it was my wife's 40 years old birthday and our anniversary very disappointing

For 3 nights I am paying over 1300 dollars and the room is old, the view is no good, when I walked in, it smells like the casino floor, full of cigarette smell.  I opened the fridge, THERE'RE LEFT OVER CONTAINERS FROM THE PREVIOUS GUESTS STILL THERE. And the clothing drawer has trash left over from the previous guests. 

So I called the front desk, only was told that I would have to wait until the morning for someone to fix anything because they were at full capacity.  Therefore, I scheduled a call with them for 10am...  

Our room comes with breakfast, I called in room dining at 8am the next morning and ordered breakfast, it didn't come until pass 9am, which is fine and I was expecting it due to the holidays and the hotel is at max capacity according to the front desk. But when breakfast came, it was not at all what we ordered.  Eggs were wrong, meats were wrong, drinks were wrong.  I called in room dining, they told me they will send new food up.  This is about 9:15am, and I am livid. 

I have scheduled a call with the front desk people at about 10am, At 10:16am, I called downstairs, apparently no one got the note about Calling me.  So I repeated myself again about the issues I was having, including the new ones from this morning.  

The lady on the phone was very nice.  She tried to address everything.  And housing keeping was supposed to come cleaning and make sure everything was in order.  They refunded my ""view"" room and just charged me for a regular Piazzo room which is 50 dollars less a night, that knocks down my daily price from 450 to 400.  As well as they refunded my resort fees for dirty house keeping, plus 50 dollar credit for food and drinks.  

And get this...  By the time I called front desk at 10:16, our fixed breakfast never came either.  And it has been a little over 2 hours since I called for breakfast around 8am.   I told the front desk that I was over breakfast, don't even bother.  

We went about our day, came back to the room, trash in the drawers were still not cleaned out, and a water bottle that was leaking under the sink is now above the sink, not thrown away.  The creamer for the coffee from the morning is sitting out at the wet bar..  Not sure why...  Do they think creamer is still good after sitting out for 6 hours?!

Later on I got in the shower and the shower drain is slow, so by the time I was done with my 10 min shower, I was standing in a puddle of water...

At this point I am really tired, don't really feel like calling the front desk again to bitch.  Maybe tomorrow I will have more energy. But so far, this Vegas trip sucks balls and it was supposed to be a nice romantic getaway for my husband and I.  

I would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.   Unless you want to spend the entire time you are here pissed off and waiting for call backs from the front desk.",13,4,0

My friends apparantly got a great deal via Priceline, and since I was the 5th person to jump in on the trip, the split after 5 people was not bad...$80 for 2 nights.

First Impressions

As one of Vegas' best resorts on the strips, I was impressed with the grounds, and the layout of the casino area, but in all honesty, I wasn't impressed with the layout and the floorplan of the hotel side.  It was ridiculously confusing to get to the room, almost as if you're trying to get thru a maze, with two different elevators, and what not.  It simply wasn't cut to the chase--and yes, I did get used to it after a while, but getting to the room was just overall confusing.

The Room

The room was absolutely beautiful--lots of space, two flat screens, comfortable beds, amazing bathrooms with granite counter tops, big tub, and separate area for the toilet.  Very clean, and spacious.

Service

Service was 7\/10.  Why? Well, for the most part, the staff was great--top notch and efficient, and no problems, but where I ran into problems was with the bell service.
It's ridiculously hot in Vegas, yet at the same time, the waiting area is outside, and so there's a crowd of people waiting for their bags to be brought up, and the service was quite inefficient.  Just as an advice, give yourself a good 1\/2 hr to 45 minutes if you plan to request for your bags to be brought up to the valet area, since there's a long wait.  Don't plan yourself 10 minutes before, with an hour before to head back to McCarren. 

Overall

Was satisfied, though in my book, the Bellagio still beats the Venetian in a lot of areas--the location of the Venetian, being on the north end, makes it hard to trek your way to the center\/south end.

If it weren't for our friends who had accummulated enough points to stay here and invite us, I don't think I would have ever been able to experience the 200+ dollar suite =)

The suite had two beds, two flat screens, a sofa, a pull out couch, a mini fridge and mini bar, toilet, two sinks, vanity mirror, bath tub and a shower.  The whole place was spaceous.

We were able to fit six people comfortably.  Two on each beds and one on the sofa and the other one of the sofa pull out bed.  No one complained about their sleeping area and even the two not on the bed said their ""beds"" were comfortable.

There wasn't really much of a view from our window (on the 200's), and that was alright.  The windows in the rooms are kind of tinted, so it was kind of hard to tell whether it was sunny or not.

At first, it was easy to get lost in the hotel because there are so many elevators.  We thought the different elevators took us to different places and buildings, but don't be fooled, the elevators takes you to the same floor, just different spots on that floor.

Got to the pool around 5 and it was crowded.  No place to sit and the only reason we got lucky was because it was late and the sun was disappearing behind the clouds so people left.  Water looks kinda dirty.  People that worked down by the pools arent very nice.. maybe because they have to carry tons of wet towels across town to get to the other side of the pool.

The complimentary valet parking was awesome and our bellhop didn't even laugh too much as he loaded handles of Vodka, cases of beer, AND a box on Franzia wine (yeah we are THAT CLASSY!!) onto the cart.

My days of staying at a cheap $30 a night are over! Previously, my notion of Vegas was to stay at the cheapest hotel then party and eat at the nicer hotels. Spectating hotels and walking the strip is not the same as staying in one. In college, the partying was non stop. so what's the big deal? Why waste money, if you aren't gonna sleep anyways? It's time that we graduated from those days of back breaking beds and smoked up casino air. You should spoil yourself and wake up a king or a queen, not a cheap hooker that smells like smoke.

Last year, I was treated to a suite at The Venetian and it changed my life. Look for weekday promotions!! Last year, we got a special for $129 a night. This year its only about $79 a night. Previously, the best hotel I stayed at was MGM, which is still on of my favorites. Still have Mandalay, Wynn, Caesars Palace and Aria to try out but that's another review. My goal at Venetian was to have a relaxing weekend and not think about work. So I did it right! I started off with early check-in. I didn't know that existed, but glad I got there early so I can enjoy the hotel for an extra 2 hours. I like how the greeter would get our name before check-in so she can formal introduce us to the desk clerk. ""Here is Mr. and Mrs. *LASTNAME*"" So formal and it made my gf happy because we aren't married. 

Entering my room.. I started to do the MTV cribs\/ Life styles of the Rich and Famous. Take a lot of pictures and give yourself a tour of the Good Life imagining that this could be a permit thing. Then like a little kid jump on the King Size bed with excitement. Then straight to the tub\/jacuzzi for a relaxing bubble bath. Afterward, I put on the robe and gain instant Heff status. Fix yourself a drink and put on a movie or just watch a sports game. RELAX! No running around in the hot summer desert sun. Just relax relax and more relaxation. The tables and slots can wait until later.

I saw the musical which recently started playing at the Venetian and was totally blown away.  

I went with my family to go see it and was surprised at first how the Phantom was a shortened version of the original play. My niece, who came along and loves musicals, discovered the musical is missing maybe a 1\/3 of the songs from the original on the program. The program itself  wasn't a Playbill like all plays and musicals pass out but something called  Curtain Call.  We theorized that since it was abridge version, they don't get the Playbill program.  Only 95 minutes long.... not a intermission in those minutes.  So I felt cheated. Strike number one.

We entered the theater and was surprised that parts of a chandelier were hanging  all over the ceiling. Our seats were in the lower floor (orchestra seating) but I was wondering about the blocked balcony views by those hanging pieces. I was appalled.  Strike two. Remember, I haven't seen stage version of the Phantom (only movie) so I was clueless what was about to happen. 

For the musical, the theater itself  was covered in drapery resembling a cave to me. I remember the phantom lived in the sewers or something like that, hence my cave thought. 

The play started and a auction started on stage. A musical box was sold to an old man on a wheelchair.  Next item for sale, part of a chandelier that was destroyed by the Phantom of the the Opera himself. 

BOO-OM!  Pitch black! PHANTOM THEME SONG PLAYS! That chandelier on the stage and the parts that were strewn across the theater ceiling came to life with light, that flickered with sporadic energy.  Slowly, all those parts danced across the theater and eventually reassembled itself at the ceiling of the theater. WOW! Totally blew me away. Then the drapes that  covered the walls pulled away into ceiling itself and revealing a fake balcony with manikins watching the stage.  WOW!

In the end, I really enjoy the play and didn't feel cheated for being shortened. I didn't realize how much set design and visual effects went into POTO. That really surprised me and blew me away. Maybe being held at the Venetian may have helped in that category. A Las Vegas theater with all the bells and whistles. My niece thought the musical really moved well, she didn't miss any of those omitted songs and liked the play.

Sorry for the novel but if you're a real fan of the original,  you may feel cheated but still appreciate the effort. If you have never seen it before in a theater setting then you'll love it like I did.  I may go out and purchase the CD itself just to play, ""Remember Me.",2,0,2

I had a tummy ache on the way to our room elevator. Man lets just say thank goodness for that restroom. It was clean, beautiful, and located perfectly when I needed it.

Up to the 5th floor we go! We didn't have a nice view but the room was beautiful. We were going to take a picture but we already messed up the room in 2 mins. our suit cases everywhere, we pull out the sofa bed and etc. 

Four stars still? Why? Although everything about it was lovely and Marcela was great, there is one big big downer! The room has not been fully cleaned. We didn't have enough towels, the robe from the closet was missing, our iron didn't fully work and it damaged my dress, there was used q-tips in the restroom, there was not a plastic bag that should have came with our ice bucket, and what else....???... Yea that should be it..

The pool was nice but very very crowded. But I gotta say one thing, this is the place to be! Everyone and almost everyone is pretty good looking. All the girls and guys. Man its freaking amazing. Its like a swimsuit fashion up in here! OOoOoo LA LA!

The new Venezia tower suites are excellent though it can be confusing getting to the tower since you have to take an elevator to the 15th floor to enter the Venezia and it can get perplexing  especially if you have been playing all night long and your brain is malfunctioning. The outdoor courtyard and the pool at the Venezia exude a certain feeling of tranquility helping absolve your mind of the huge losses you sustained at the tables. Venetian is the worst casino to gamble at because,apparently I win money everywhere else and lose it all at  the Venetian. I swear they have those roulette tables fixed.",0,0,0

It's a very big place, but it is gorgeous. I was here a couple months ago with my mom and brother during a trip to Las Vegas. I did not stay in the hotel, so I have no opinions on the rooms or any of that. 

I did thoroughly enjoy walking through this hotel and seeing the decorations they have. There is a second floor above the casino for some high-end shopping, to include a Coach store and much more. Be prepared though, it is a lot of walking! 

I went in for the casino and a trip to Carlo's Bakery, which is inside the Venetian. That was about the extent of my visit, was those and to walk around the shops upstairs. 

I did get lost inside, and had to ask for help getting back to the parking garage. The customer service\/security people, whoever helped me was nice. I appreciated that. 

Would I return? Yes. I had no complaints about my visit here. I enjoyed everything about it. After looking at the pics from other Yelp reviewer, I'd like to stay here in the hotel, as it looks just as beautiful as everything else about the Venetian.

The restruaturants, over priced, and really bad food.  With one exception.  
The Grand Lux Cafe, it was good and one of the best values on the strip.

The casino, had us sign up for a Grazie card, don't waste your time.  You only get point if you win and it must be a LOT!  to the toon of 10,000.  It was a serious waste of my time.

The casinos were also very very smoky and I did not find any of the slots worth playing.  I like machine black jack, but they were so rigged agenst the player, it was not worth playing.

To top this off, they actually have a canal where you can have a ride on a gondola with your own personal singing rower. You have to plan early if you want to ride this attraction because they book up pretty fast. 

As far as the room themselves, they are mini-suites with a step-down living room. The room decor is beautiful. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is the price.

Our stay at the Venetian was actually the first few nights of our honeymoon - and was the perfect start at that. The customer service was SINCERE - which is more than I can say for most strip places - and efficient. We felt very safe and taken care of here. The room is full of little perks - like three TV's, robes, slippers, DVD player, roman remote-controlled curtains on the windows, and wine glasses (albeit it no microwave, refrigerator, or coffee maker - a typical Vegas nickel-and-dine tactic). May I recommend the Phantom+2 night-stay deal, which totals to around $500 for two nights at one of their suite rooms and two tickets to the AMAZING Phantom show. This is the kind of hotel that you won't want to leave - as all the shops, décor, and restaurants will keep you busy all the live long day (I am sure the gambling is great, too, I wouldn't know). Actually, spend a whole day at their pool on the 10th floor (much more intimate and shadier than the pool on the 4th floor). So fresh and so clean; that's you, Venetian. 

Stay (or even walk through) to the Venetian if: You enjoy class, luxury, and wonderful customer service; you have a few extra dollars to spend (well worth it); you want a quiet, sophisticated, yet enthralling stay on the strip; and even if you want to relive moments n Venice (been to the real place - and the Venetian is a nice replica!).

Flat panel LCD TVs in both the sleeping AND sitting area, multiple phones, and a fax machine.

The closet auto-lights up. The bathroom is uber-spacious as well. Dual sinks, separate toilet area, bath tub, and a shower stall. The shower has two nozzles that spray more water on you [if you turn it on] along with the overhead shower.

After we had gotten in late one night and stayed up a bit chatting, someone began pounding on our door at 4am in the morning. We were all girls, already asleep, and not at all inclined to open our door to someone claiming to be security. Half an hour later, the security guard who had grown tired of banging on the door, let himself into our room and accused us of ""stomping on the tiles"". His attitude was accusatory and extremely offensive.

In the morning we tried to call the security manager and were given the run around for 6 hours. We finally went to the security station downstairs and were connected to the manager via telephone. He claimed that the report read that the noise complaint was ""chatting and laughing"", completely different from what the security officer had told us the night before and that we ""should have"" received a call of the noise complaint before the officer let himself into our room.

If you feel that staying in a hotel where security actually makes you feel less secure is alright, then by all means, the Venetian is the choice for you.

I've stayed at Wynn, Mandalay Bay, The Hotel, etc.  I keep coming back to Venetian \/ Palazzo for these reasons-

-Wonderful service
-Large Suite rooms
-Fantastic restaurants!  SushiSamba!!! Even the cafe is owned by Cheesecake Factory.
-Great food court, reasonably priced near registration for those quick meals.
-2nd most popular poker room in Vegas after Bellagio.  Huge...lot's of action!
-Connected to the Palazzo...you can use all their amenities as well!
-The canal shops, what don't they have?
-I frequently bring my kids, the Venetian is the best hotel on the strip for kids.  The canal shops have artists and performers to entertain the little ones as well as adults.  The gondola rides are great for the kids.  The smaller Venezia tower pool is the perfect kid hangout featuring a regular pool and a heated pool all away from the huge party pool area. Bouchon is located next to the pool... mom and dad can order amazing french food brought to you poolside.  The pirate show at TI is right across the street and performs many times during the day.  On my most recent trip the kids had balloon animals made and their faces painted every day for free.  My kids are entertained all day, every day at the Venetian.
-Fashion mall is right across the street if you need a Nordstroms or anything in particular that can't be found in the Canal Shops.
-The rear entrance off Koval makes it easy to avoid the strip.
-2 valet locations, not counting the Palazzo
-Tao nightclub
-Easy freeway access off Spring Mountain
-Resort fee includes free wifi

The entire premises is beautiful!

Negatives
-I think the rooms will need a remodel in a few years to look as good as the Palazzo or Wynn.
-The TV's in the rooms used to be considered large when first installed but now feel small since everybody now has a 50"" plus.

This was Night 1 and 2. 
Night 3-5
We stayed at the Excalibur. Not impressed. Our time in Vegas was exciting,  but our stay was a crash and land; nothing special. 
Night 6 
We were having so much fun we had to stay another night! My husband booked at THE VENETIAN!! ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!! We gambled a lot, drank a lot, ate at the Grand Lux Cafe, room was beautiful, and staff was outstanding. 
Night 7 
That morning I was so hung over and all I wanted to do was relax and eat something while my husband wanted to gamble for another 2hours before going home. He decided to send me to the spa. After my stone massage and facial I received a message with a card and a note from my husband surprising me with another night at the Venetian. This time he had booked a much MUCH bigger room, he wanted to end the last night in Vegas with a bang! Champagne, a new change of clothes, room service, and chocolates. He mentioned that when he told the front desk he decided to spend another night to surprise me after my spa time they helped him plan the entire thing. I will never stay at another hotel in Vegas! They went above and beyond for our time to be special and they delivered! I wish I remembered the managers name who helped us. She wrote it down and till this day I'm looking for that piece of paper! I would love to write a formal letter to her boss. Staff is outstanding, food is delicious, and their sunglass store is my favorite! (I have a thing for cat eye sunglasses).

What's to love? 
------------------
+classy front desk w\/ very attentive, informative and friendly staff
+classy setup w\/ beautiful decor ... vaulted ceilings? YES!
+fairly easy to navigate (to get to your room)
+security check at the elevators : 
   groups will not like this cuz only those w\/ keys can enter the guest elevator room  areas. it keeps unwanted random people out meandering the guest hallways. but if you have a group of friends coming over, it's a hassle cuz they make your guests wait down stairs, call you and then confirm to let your guests up the elevators
+guest elevators close to parking lot
+resort fee includes wi-fi and access to their fab gym
+ they have bouchon bakery!!! right next to the guest elevators. ;) 
+they have TAO nightclub and The Stupid Factory!
+ wonderful display and shows during their ""winter in venice"" period.
+large (but same setup) room as palazzo
+very clean and updated room (better kept than palazzo i think)
+hallways were well lit
+close to the center of vegas ... about .5 miles from Ceaser's and 1 mile from Cosmo.. no need to drive!
+firm beds with really high thread count bedding -- soo soft. :) 
+tv in bathroom  

... and.. their gym.. is to die for. cardio, weight and machine room. plus, a large rock wall, and they have classes.. for free (well, in resort fee)!!! classes are all day and include spinning, kickboxing, yoga, core, pilates etc etc  -- so so extensive!! each cardio machine has a tv attached (w\/ cable channels). wasn't planning to work out but could not resist!! 

... I think palazzo vs. venetian.. I definitely prefer venetian. :)

The only con were slow wi-fi (but if you use their lan line, it's super fast). 

Price tag for a suite on Fri and Sat night in Dec -- $129\/nt. It's regularly $149 based on their ""Winter in Venice"" deal.. but if you are running the Las Vegas half\/full marathon .. they give you a discount. :) we checked so many other deal sites and the marathon promo code gave us the best deal still.

My most recent stay was Christmas 2013 and am apparently still bothered enough to write a review half a year later. The room had a very strong odor of fried food and funky oil, strong enough that we're pretty sure the room is on top of a kitchen or has poor exhaust vents. For multiple reasons we did not bring it up at the time to switch rooms, but in retrospect I wish I had. After being bombarded with cigarette smoke, fake vanilla pumping through the casinos, the last place I want to smell is a hotel room. 

Even after we checked out, the clothes in our suitcase smelled like it'd gone through a shift at a McDonalds. No biggie right? Maybe if I weren't headed straight to a family reunion where I'd be meeting BF's extended family for the first time!

I guess where it really gets sour is when I contacted them immediately after we got home, I received an obviously canned response like it wasn't the first time someone had complained and said we should have brought it up while we were there. I wasn't looking for comps or a future upgrade, just an acknowledgement and at least lip service they'd look into it and fix it for future guests. 

The rooms are spacious but over the years they are starting to show their age with stained carpet, peeling wallpaper and dented furniture. There are always newer places to stay so if they don't keep up, people will go elsewhere.

My only criticism, and this is for all high end hotels, they give you real glasses and wash them out in your bathroom sink with who knows what washcloth or sponge and put them back.   

Health codes in most areas require the glasses to be run through a dishwasher like in a restaurant.  If I won't use a dirty glass in a restaurant why do I want one in my hotel room?

How do I know the Venetian handles glassware in this way?   Because I'm a geek and mark the glassware to see if it's the same (it was) and also you don't see fresh glasses among the items to restock the room on the maids' carts.   

If you're not going to wash them properly give me disposable ware.   It's just a really gross practice that is common in hotels.",1,2,0

Occasionally, we stay at their newer tower, the Palazzo.  Once you get your car off of Las Vegas Boulevard and into the valet, the experience begins. The Venetian is dripping with Italian charm and elegance. It has the feel of Italy with a touch of being on a romantic Hollywood set. 

There are several room options that vary by size, location, and price of course. The standard room is called the Luxury Suite and features over 600 square feet of luxury; including gold colored figures, marble, three televisions, and a sucken living room. Someday, I will duplicate that room in my home. We got lucky one time, and we were upgraded to the Piazza Suite for free. The Piazza suite boasts 1400 square feet of space.

In addition to the accommodations, there are many highly rated restaurants on site. We enjoy the Yardbird Southern Table and Bar, Bouchon, Noodle Asia, and the Bouchon Bakery (reviewed separately). There are also faster and more affordable food options available. One of our favorite bars is the Bellini Bar located just about in the center of the casino. These folks make the best Old Fashions, and they are super friendly too!

In regards to the casino, the Venetian is well-equipped. Most of the table games start at $25 per hand, but occasionally a $15 one pops up.  One of the coolest new table games is called Stadium Black Jack located in the non-smoking area near the 24-hour Sports Book, and also next to the Noodle Asia restaurant. Essentially, you play your own blackjack hand against one community dealer, but the other players' actions do not affect your hand. 

Lastly, the shopping opportunities are ridiculous at the Venetian. You must visit the Grand Canal Shoppes for reasonable and high end merchandise. One of my newest discoveries is a store called Vom Vas that sells unique whiskeys, bourbons, and liquors.  Free tastings are available.  

If you book early, you should be able to get a reasonable rate at the Venetian. You will be impressed with the customer service quality, restaurant selection, shopping, gaming, and entertainment options. We can't wait to go back!",35,18,26

After safely making it up to the guest-only hotel tower areas its much better. Well, if you can find your room. The Venezia tower is a friggin maze. Its bad enough when your sober, I think people just give up trying to get back to their rooms after partying all night. The 3 elevator \/ transfer system takes some getting used to. A lot of people were lost, and were pushing random buttons on the elevators. 

The rooms were nice, reminded me of a compound I lived on in Saudi Arabia. Marble entry which extends into a huge bathroom. They just needed a bidet....and it would be exactly like a bathroom in Dubai or Riyadh. I didn't even notice the burnt out light bulbs in the room, but an employee came by to replace them after we checked in. Very detailed service.

Overall, a very nice hotel, I would probably come back. Oh, and they had nutella croissants in the free expedia breakfast bar. Hell yea, pocketed some for the road.",3,1,0

reason why?

it's simply magnificent.
lets start with the least significant part of the hotel.. the Grand Canal Shoppes.  i say least significant because it really has nothing to do with the hotel.. but the fact that it's indoors and connected to the hotel.. i'll include it.  the Grand Canal Shoppes are HUGE!!  they extent for what seems like forever.. painted and decorated to look like the canals in Venice.. it's simply just a wonderful place to be and experience.

next i'll cover the casino.  although the casino is its breadwinner.. i don't gamble.. so to me, the casino is just like any other casino.  but i do have to admit that it's pretty clean considering.

then.. the hotel itself.  the rooms are GIGANTIC for what you pay for.  the room is separated by an ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"" divided by only two steps.  the upstairs being the entry way, bathroom and bedroom.. and the downstairs being a dining area where the couch, table and tv are.  furnished like you walked into a Pottery Barn display, but better.. the rooms are an experience in itself.  especially the bathroom with a giant tub, giant shower, a giant vanity, a tv, and marble tiling.  everything is more than i could ask for..

lastly.. the decor.. both inside and out.. the Venetian looks fantastic.  designed with the look of Venice, Italy in mind.. the curves and structures, molding and design.. everything was designed in such great detail that from any angle.. the hotel\/casino is photogenic.

i'm most likely missing more than just this.. like for example the entertainment shows put on by the Venetian.  but i can't reveal everything.. i have to keep something as a surprise..",0,0,1

I'm not one who usually takes bubble baths---especially in hotels. But for some reason, I always do when I stay here. Perhaps it's because I like their tubs or maybe because I love wearing those fluffy robes. But trust me, you should do it if you stay here too.

There was some confusion in finding the elevator that would take us to our room but when we finally arrived it was spacious, clean, and had everything we needed. Housekeeping came by as soon as we walked in. Not sure if she knew we were in there since she came in abruptly using a key card. We were all surprised but she did apologize and asked us if we needed anything. We asked for a couple of things. Within 30min she delivered them back to our room.  We did stay for only one night  wishing we stayed a little longer. We did check the sheets, furniture, and bathroom for anything that would raise questions.

The L-shaped couch was very comfortable in the living room. There was a coffee table as well as a dinning table, and also a working desk! wow, I wish my home would have been that nice too! It's definitely a 5-star luxury and enjoyment.

The bathroom was great too, very spacious (the whole room is spacious actually). They provided bath salt for use, very nice. The shower pressure was good. They also provided nice and comfy robes for use. We had a great relaxing time in Venetian and would stay there again next time we go to Vegas. We could also get to Palazzo through the pool deck. So we could swim at the Venetian pool as well as the Palazzo pool. The pools were all nice and beautiful. The water was heated so you won't get cold during cooler or colder days.

We went to Madame Taussaud which was enjoyable since we've never been but again super expensive (oh well, it's Vegas) at $35 a person and we took a gondola ride at $25 per person for 15 minutes.

Do not spend your money in this hotel for either the room or casino, just enjoy the design of public area and then there are better places in Las Vegas to spend your money.

They don't consider Middle Eastern and Indian as human. They behave as if we are animals. 

We checked in in this hotel. The staffs checked our passport and ID and they offered us membership card. 

My husband registered for membership and they issued his card and gave him complementary play as welcoming gift for new members. 

After one hour the same day, I went and registered and double check if I can have a membership card as well. The lady told me you don't have any issue you can register.
When I went to play, another staff come and asked for my ID. She kept my ID for 1 hour. And when I asked her what is wrong. She totally ignored me. Thanks God that at least she like my husband to answer his question. Just saying that ""SECURITY Will EXPLAIN"". 

We were shocked because we didn't do anything wrong that she called security. The security came and said we will cancel your membership due to your nationality. He said you can only stay in your room or go to restaurants.

When I told him we come to hotel to enjoy, he said with the sense of humor ""you can go and enjoy in Indian casino in California""
They they took our ID very rudely and  asked us to get out of casino. 

 The hotel is disaster since it take about an hour to get your baggage in your room and also 1 hour to get it when you want to check out.

My question is: 

1. How come I can go out of casino in this hotel since to get to the room I have to go through the casino??????

2. If you have a rule, it should be for everyone.. if you allow the others with the same nationality and then suddenly you cancelling my membership and do not let me play..... it means that you are creating rules for those that you don't like their face.

3. There is a rule in every casino that you should be above 21 and show your ID for proof. They bold this and this rule is everywhere in casino and hotel. But in this announcement nothing is mentioned regarding nationality restrictions. If you have rule for nationality you should bold it and mention it like all other casino and hotel rules. 

4. When we wanted to check out because of this issue, the supervisor talked so rude. And said I ca. Not help you. You can check out but we will charge you for the night.

I was stunned at how large The Venetian is; I got lost numerous times my first two days getting from one place to another during the convention.

Other than the canned convention food my company had catered from The Venetian I ate at Tao and Lavo.  Both Tao and Lavo were good, although they were buffet style layouts, so I can't comment on actual specific meals.

I was then led to the guest elevators...which were all busted. Mike asked one of the cleaning ladies if any elevators worked, which I interjected, um, let's just walk around, I don't want to go to your room."" Dang it, that's when the elevator opened. Grr!

Well we make it up to the 19th floor as I'm furiously texting my friends where I am in case I end up dead in some stranger from the club's room. Room 19-101. It had the big double doors and opened up onto a suite that sounds a lot like what Carol L. mentioned in her review. Snazzy. The living room and bedroom are only separated by a partial wall which sucks but the bathroom is gorgeous and the living room is nice. 

So Mike, unable to read the signs that I'm completely uninterested in him tells me to check out the view. Wow, the Wynn parking lot. Another joke. Ha. Anyway, the room was decent. It definitely doesn't hold a candle to the Sky Suites at Aria. 

So there wasn't a snowball's chance in hell that I was going to hook up with some guy I had just met from the club (Mike) and was not going to go anywhere near either of the beds in the room. I was prompted to sit on the huge L shaped couch was pretty comfortable. I spent the whole time telling Mike to get off me and to keep his hands off me while I mass texted the guys in my phone to ""CALL ME ASAP and say you're downstairs. Urgent.""  Thank God a friend called right as one of his suite mates burst in, giving me an excuse to bounce. I hauled my butt out right quick and the elevators worked right quick. Hallelujah - I got outta that crazy situation. 

I was so close to the elevator to get to the parking garage when two British guys stopped me to ask me to lead them to Tao. It was like 2:20 AM so we walked all the way to Tao. One of the British guys, Tom, kept commenting on how it looked like Paris, not Italy, but whatever. I declined the offer of drinks and left them arguing with the door security at Tao to go home.

I wasn't so lucky with the room selections and the guy that checked us in forgot my room key, dumb me forgot to double check to make sure it was in there but it was too late I walked all the way to my room and had to turn right back.

Our room looked exactly like their photos, luxury suite with one bed, down side to it was we checked-in uber late and got the room that did not a have a view also it was a smoking room which made my allergies act up so bad, good thing we didn't stay in the room too long. The hotel is huge so you have to walk a long distance to every location and damn did my feet hurt so bad.

Over all the hotel is nice if you can afford to spend more on the room then do it bc I got the worst view out of all my friends and it really sucked, no sun light in the morning whatsoever just a plant and wall to look at, if they give you room number 1-602 in the venetian tower section then avoid it. Downstairs has a really yummy bakery for breakfast and the coffee isn't bad either. They also have a smoothie place right near the bakery which is really expensive (13 for a banana and strawberry smoothie), food court doesn't have a lot of options but the food was really good.

But both hotels have huge rooms!  If you get a double occupancy room, you can accomodate up to 7-8 people comfortably.  Every room is a resort suite.  Most of the rooms I have stayed in have amazing views from their super huge windows.

Room service can take forever though, but then again I've only ordered super late like at 3am after I've come home from the nightlife on the strip.  The casino in this hotel has all the newest slot machines with a good range of denominations.  And of course my favorite macaron bakery Bouchon is here, as well as one of my favorite cafes; Grand lux.

If you have a group of people, stay here.  Even if it's just you and your significant other, stay here.  Best place to sleep on the strip.  Your room is even big enough to preparty!

You either had to be 21 or you were a guest of the hotel.  Everyone had to show their room keys and\/or IDs before they would let us in...

Now, it's completely opened to all.  However, this place still kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth because of the Tao Nightclub....  Not really a fan of the nightclub, but the restaurant is amazing!  Read about it here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/tao-asian-bistro-and-nightclub-las-vegas#hrid:riWg2uQ3-Xh2k5Pw4HzDzQ

Despite my lack of love for TAO nightclub, the Venetian is a beautiful hotel and casino.  I love the fresco paintings on the ceiling and all the beautiful finishes.  For some reason, I'm not a huge fan of their rooms.  I've stayed in the Bella and Rialto suites and they just weren't that impressive...  I prefer their sister hotel, the Palazzo.  The finishes and decor just seem classier at the Palazzo....

However, the Venetian does have some pretty good restaurants and shops.  I love Lime Ice!!  You can get your yard stick drinks there :)

The Grand Canal Shoppes have a pretty good variety of stores as well.  They have a Grand Canal gondola ride too.  It's nice to watch them serenade the guests in Italian.. I guess it's kind of romantic.. not really.. at $16 a person and $64 for a private ride, I think I'll pass.

Make sure you check out the gelato place in St. Mark's Square.  It's delicious!!

I also really like their pool area.  There's plenty of space to lounge around if you don't feel like checking out their day club, TAO Beach.  TAO Beach usually have guest stars (like LMFAO) perform, but in all honestly, I would personally avoid this place when they do.  They space is pretty small, and they pool inside TAO Beach definitely does not accommodate the amount of people they let in.  It's actually pretty disgusting....

In sum, I'm not a HUGE fan of the Venetian... It's just okay.

I love everything about this place, they always have deals online, so you can stay there for ridiculously low prices.

Stayed here this past weekend in a Suite with several friends. We had about 10 people! shhh! haha. But even with that amount of people in one suite, there was still a lot of room. The beds were comfortable, including the pull out bed from the sofa. High ceilings and very decorated. The quality was there. The view was ehh, we had a view of an unfinished ferris wheel and construction. The bathroom was really big, shower and bath combo, his\/her sinks, separate room for toilet.  

my cons;
-WATCH OUT! They have sensors on the drinks and snacks in the room so they will charge you!
-No refrigerator to store your drinks and snacks.
-The TV remote did not work
-It took a journey just to get to the room! Considering we were parting and clubbing all night.

Das Hotel bietet höchsten Komfort, darunter die Canyon Ranch mit einem 6.000 m² großen Wellnessbereich. Es gibt auch eine 12 m hohe Kletterwand und eine Poolanlage mit 20.000 m² mit 5 Pools und Poolbar.

Das Casino im Venetian hat stattliche 11.000 m² und verfügt über 122 Spieltische, darunter Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, Baccarat, Keno, Sportwetten, 2.500 Slots und Videopokergeräte. Beeindruckend ist der 1.000 m² große Pokerraum mit 39 Pokertischen. Hier wird Texas Hold'Em, Stud Poker und Omaha gespielt. Die wohlhabende Kundschaft kann im Players Club Grazie sein Spielglück austesten.

Sehenswert ist die Einkaufspassage ""Grand Canal Shoppes"" in der 1. Etage, wo ein leuchtender blauer Himmel an die Decke projiziert wird. Unzählige Geschäfte, Cafés und Restaurants warten hier auf Besucher. Highlight ist ein nachgebauter Markusplatz und ein 400 m langer ""Canale Grande"".

Elegant resort with one of THE best casinos.   No tacky and cheap Vegas feel...5 star every where you turn. 

Bought a package through groupon which included an invited guest check in...their version of express check in. Only 2 guests ahead of us, where general check in was packed. Check in took less than 5 minutes, and our room was available, no waiting.

Valet parking is included in the resort fee, and if you're leaving the resort after 11am check out, there is a baggage area that can hold your luggage until you're ready to leave.

Stayed in suite 33-127. View of Caesars and the Mirage....pool view below and quite a bit   of rooftop. 

Suite was clean as a pin, spacious and one of the newly upgraded. Bathroom had a vanity with evening and day lighted mirror, wall mounted flat screen tv, amenities, robes and a safe. The bed was super comfortable and linens were clean and free of any wear or tear. Bedroom and living room each had flat screen tv's...sunken sitting area, dining table and desk. On one night stand, there was an iPhone charging station with radio (Nice bonus). Even though wi-fi was included in the resort fee, it was painfully slow and cell service in the room was weak.

Our floor was very quiet and smoke free. Casino, although still a bit smokey, has an amazing filtration system and does a great job at minimizing smoke overload and pumping lots of O2 into the air. But still, as I write this, and being far away from Vegas, I can still smell smoke in my nose! Yuck!

All employee contact was polite and courteous and everyone was eager to please. We had great luck at the casino and felt that the payouts were very generous. Plenty of tables and slots.

This hotel really does have everything you need we hardly went anywhere else, except to see other shows. The Pallazzo hotel which is basically the same because they are connected, was beautiful, out of 5 restaurants we tried inside the hotel 4 were amazing. The suites are very spacious, the cheapest suite you can get there is really, really nice, loved the decor. The reason I don't give it the five stars is because i thought the beds weren't that comfortable and the pillows are terrible, and I really didn't feel like the Hotel staff doesn't go out of their way to make your experience special, like other big hotel I have stayed at. Places that are a must try at the Venetian hotel and Resort: 
* Morels steak house and French Bistro: very pricey but sooo worth it, they have a special menu for wine and cheese parings is $35 for three different glasses of wine and three little pieces of cheese, the also include honey, preserves and slices of bread...Amazing!!! 
*The Blue man group: great show, very, very funny, great for kids. but beware the front row seats of the theater are the cheapest, and even though they give you a poncho to protect your clothes , you can get wet and or dirty. 

Two things i was looking forward to doing during my stay at the venetian and regret doing: 

* Lavo nightclub: not worth the high cover charge and they huge line to get in, you won't be missing out on anything special. 

*gondolas rides: you pay $16 per person or $64 if you want the gondola to be private, is a 5 min ride, you have to wait about an hour to go on it, kinda of boring...

Check- in is complete even with an offer to upgrade. Early check-in, granted, and off to our suite. Put your walking shoes on - i'm not kidding! The resort is so huge! Maybe the size of a small city? You're warned. We were on the 30th floor and that was only half way up. The suite is immaculate with a sunk in living room, L shaped sofa, large desk, small table & chairs with an incredible view of Vegas, separate king bed platform, 3 large flat screen t.v's (there is more but you get the gist) ...one being in the bathroom which was lovely to watch while in the shower or the time spent at the vanity. We were delighted with every aspect of our suite! The staff was unparalleled to any other, extremely friendly and helpful. Every interaction from the concierge to the doorman was a pleasure!  We visited a handful of other resorts on the strip and not one stood above The Venetian.

Yes, it's a bit spendy, but as someone who likes to relax and spend a little more time in the room than the average Vegas tourist, it doesn't get any better. I haven't stayed here in quite some time, the last visit was a couple of years ago (though I've stayed here about 3 times), but every penny spent was worth it. I always request a room with a king bed and strip view, but if you don't care about that then the rooms are a little less pricey. All the rooms are suites and feel like mini-apartments. No joke, if it was an option, I'd live here. I loved that while waiting for friends at another hotel to meet me I could relax on a sofa with a beautiful view and watch TV, rather than attempt to be comfortable on a bed for a few hours. The bathrooms are large and luxurious, I always looked forward to watching TV while I relaxed in the tub or showered (yup, TV's in the bathrooms!). Never had room service here so I can't rate that. It's great having everything in one spot with the shopping and restaurants. When I went once with my mother we wanted to see Blue Man Group and Jersey Boys. She can't do much walking around and isn't a fan of Vegas, so it was beyond convenient that both shows were within the building (Jersey Boys was in Palazzo but it's all connected, we didn't have to leave). If I wanted to go do stuff on the strip she was more than entertained in the main grand canal area where they have real human ""statues"". If I were a gambler, the casino is very nice. Staff is VERY friendly. No buffet here so if that's important to you it may be a problem. Another thing I loved is it's mostly an adult environment. I'd see a few teens here and there, didn't really see any small children and that is HUGE for me, because at the risk of sounding like a horrible person, I'm not a fan of kids and when I go to Vegas I don't want to deal with your screaming toddler while I'm doing anything (lol). The rooms are also beyond quiet, if I ever would have had neighbors I never would have known it. I could go on and on and on about how in love with this place I am but I think you get the point...

I can't say enough good things, I really can't. Once you stay here, it's very hard to stay anywhere else (since my visits here I have stayed at Paris, and it doesn't compare anywhere near this). Trust me, save your pennies and do it, at least once.",1,0,0

Then headed down to the casino.. Had a good time there. Met a lot of new and different kinds of people. Very clean and nice. Love the decor in the hotel too.


However, I went to have a drink at the bar ( they give drinks while at the machines) but because they had different games- i went there to try it. However the asian man there ( tim) who, fair enough and I had no issues with, asked for my ID, and then a blond woman took it, went away for 5 mins or so, and then she ""could not take an out of country ID"".. (My ID being CANADIAN) and was issued by government in two forms of id.. she then asked if I had a passport, and to which I replied"" Uh, no, not to to a place like this."" (Which most do not as the possibility of it being stolen or lost is too high when gambling, liquor and new environments. 

Now in Canada, it  is mandatory to show two forms of Government issued ID to purchase liquor, cigarettes and go to bars\/be served. I was not given ANY issues whatsoever at red lobster, at the casino lobby, or at TAO for my ""out of country ID"" but this woman because she works at the bar, feels as though she has the right to deny someone because of a reason such as that when the ID is being issued by a western, aligned country with US as well as a recent and updated version.

In fact I also showed her a GOVERNMENT LETTER FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA about my ID and my American Bank Card that I had to provide a ID for inorder to get. She continued to give me attitude and refused me service. I had to go and get a pink bracelet and get ""verified"" by the security that it was ""real"".

I was disgusted by this woman's attitude.. she( as man next to me pointed out) was encouraging hookers and others drink and stay at the bar but gave me a hard time for sitting there. I was not even ""welcomed"" to sit until I had it ""verified"".

it was a COMPLETE TURN OFF


and even TIM the other bartender offered me an apology for how rude and disgusting that woman acted. You can blame her 100% for any loss in the Casino bar. 


In her opinion, i can get sent drinks for free without being checked at machine but cannot be served at the bar.


What a JOKE.

It was a must-do place for us and we were finally able to swing it. The room was in the Venetian Towers and while it was a neat layout, (sunken livingroom) I wasn't at all impressed wih the furnishings for the cost. The upholstered seating was rock-hard. The pieces seemed to be a hodgepodge of styles - almost as if this was the room that got the leftovers after mate pieces had gotten broken in other rooms. I am well-aware hotel furniture sacrifices the fine-furniture status for sturdiness, but these pieces really didn't speak quality, class or sturdiness to me. One piece was literally standing on it's last leg and would have collapsed altogether if my husband hadn't gingerly touched it. We called housekeeping to let them know of the damage and it was promptly taken away. The view from the room overlooked Las Vegas Blvd AND the unattractive rooftops of the buildings between us and the road. I prefer the view from the Bellagio.

This hotel can be a little confusing in layout.  We had to take two sets of elevators every time we came back and forth from our suite.

The room itself was really nice big bathroom with a full tub and shower. There was a sunken living room which had a desk, dining table, two lounge chairs, and a sofa that pulled out into a double bed which was nice. 

The Venezia tower also has a secluded garden with two pools and two spas which was nice because there wasn't too many people there when we went. Also, it was between the two towers so there was a lot of shade when we went before lunch.

Let's start at the beginning, though.  I was staying with someone else from my company and we had varying arrival dates.  Because my roommate and I didn't check in together, they canceled my reservation and marked me as a ""no show""  which caused some problems when I tried to check in.  

I agree that the layout of the venetian is a little strange.  It took 10 minutes of wandering around the casino for me to figure out where the  elevators were.  

The room was spacious.  There was a nice sitting room with a table and a large flat screen.  There was also a dvd player which I really appreciated.  Up a few stairs was the sleeping area with another large flat screen.  And then, there was a flat screen in the all-marble bathroom.  Oh!  And I love that the blinds were remote-controlled...It was very lavish.  

Couple of things:
my sheets were ripped 2 of the 3 nights I stayed (but I was too tired to complain about it)

I think this place is great for enjoying the Italian rustic setting with romantic touches in the architecture but for our Vegas weekend, it was definitely the place to pre-party it up!

Only difficult situation about Venetian is that upon heading towards the elevators, there is a check-in kiosk that checks if you are a room card holder of the Venetian hotel rooms. Since we were invited and did not have a room card, they called my friend's room number and asked them about us and we got the OK to go in but the next time we came over, they told us that if we get one noise complaint from my friend's suite and there's more than 6+ people in that room, they will evict visitors and those booked in the Venetian.

Sigh.

Anyway.

The Venetian is really great for groups, particularly since adjoining rooms can be requested to create one big giant slumber party. The suites come with a pull-out sofa so 2 beds easily convert to 3! Only extra pillows and blankets from housekeeping are needed to turn the sofabed into a nice, comfy lazy-place. We packed 8 people in 2 rooms rather easily considering we're a bunch of high maintenance, space mongering bitches lugging around a ton of crap in giant suitcases. And there's so much going on in here that its not really necessary to leave the hotel.

The upper level has the beds with a nice big tv.  The beds are really soft and comfortable.  My back is always giving me trouble when I sleep on the futon at home, so when I sleep at the Venetian, I wake up for a change without any lower back pain. The lower level is like a living room with chairs, a small table, a couch, and another tv.  The couch has a hideaway bed which is always nice when you have a bunch of people. 
The bathroom is huge!  There is a see through shower and a small bath\/jacuzzi right next to it.  The double sinks works well, again when you're with a bunch of people.
While there you should check out the Canyon Ranch Spa.  You could get a nice workout,  relax in the jacuzzi or steam room, and even get a massage.   There's even a restaraunt in the spa where they serve pretty healthy food.  It's a nice way to get away from the stress of losing all your money in the casino.

Pros
- Pretty nice looking room with a shower, vanity, and living area space
- Hotel is nicely decorated as well and consistently themed
- Quite a bit to do in the hotel (restaurants, nightclub, coffee, etc.)
- Great gym inside with a rock wall and plenty of equipment (weights & cardio)

Cons
- Overwhelming amount of smoke with poor ventilation.  Disgusting smell and irritating on the sinuses.  Just walking through the hallways to get out (without gambling) makes you smell of smoke.
- Bad view from the room.  As others have mentioned, most rooms look out onto a roof full of equipment.
- Closet light was broken and wouldn't turn off.  Waited on hold for 15 minutes for the front desk, gave up, and stuffed towels in front of it to sleep.
- Expensive.  You can pay less than half as much elsewhere and get about the same experience.  Expensive food and drink inside as well.
- Somewhat of a maze, and that's probably on purpose.  It was really cold when I came and very annoying how long it took to get from our room to the strip (and then of course everything is spread out there)",0,0,0

One major negative about the Venetian--VALET PARKING.  They took over an hour to retrieve our car.  It was Sunday night and they only had three people working to retrieve cars.  People at the valet desk were screaming and yelling and I heard one gentleman threaten to call the police when they would not let him retrieve his own car.  Another man missed his flight due to the delay.  I have never had any problem with valet parking at Palazzo, but for some reason the Venetian valet was seriously understaffed when we were there.

The walk over to the Palazzo was very hard on me since I am a cancer patient.  No one offered any help for me to get to the Palazzo.  Reasonable accommodation should have been made due to this unexpected change.  The next day I was so tired from this experience that I stayed in my room until noon.  I wish to never go through such an experience again.  Getting help to go from the Venetian to the Palazzo would have been great but no such thing was offered.  I plan on not staying at the Venetian or Palazzo again.  I passed this information to my sister and brother who frequent the Venetian.  My brother called the Venetian and asked what happened to my  reservation.  He was surprised how I was treated.  I told my sister because of this experience and that I will never stay at either hotel in the future.

The rooms are nice and comfy, the staff is very friendly, the decor is, the shopping is great, and their are some fabulous food options there. They have 3 different pools and while the main one gets really busy, the other two generally have less people and so you can always find a place to sit. 

The Canal Shops are pretty nice. They have the usual Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton type stores and then stuff like Victoria's Secret too. It's like a nice mall. There are some decent restaurants in there too. Taqueria Canonita serves up some pretty decent fare - they have awesome salsa, very smoky. Cool atmosphere with the gondolos going through, the ceiling that looks like sky (and changes), and the *statues*. 

What I don't like about The Venetian is - 
1. It's really at the end of the strip. The Wynn and the Fashion Show Mall (which is an awful mall) are the only things past it. (I think, could be very, very wrong) The view is nice and hotels like The Bellagio and Caesar's Palace are very much within walking distance. But if you want to head further up the strip, it's a little far to walk (unless the weather is really nice). 
2. There are small booths that sell tickets to shows scattered about the hotel and shops. This last time we stayed there (and this is the only time it happened and it never happened to us at other hotels) the people working at the booths would come out from behind their booths and block our way asking us to buy show tickets. It wasn't like they were just speaking to us from the booth - they would jump in front of us and sort of accost us about tickets. It was like being in Mexico with all those damn time share people. Got old really, really fast.

These poor dealers are so nice considering how some of them are treated by losing players.   

About the hotel rooms, I like them the best, bc they're all basically junior suites.  Flat screens in every room. One time we stayed at the palazzo though, and we had an outside patio that was amazing!  It had a fireplace, lounge chairs, tables and it was a huge private patio for just our room!

I got a package deal through Expedia for a Bella Suite in the Venezia Tower. Upon reading the reviews and descriptions on Expedia's website it appeared to be a great choice and a killer deal.  Then after I booked the room about a week before the trip hit and I started to get anxious about my decision. I read some more reviews on sites like Yelp and many were very negative, especially regarding the Venezia Tower.

Upon checking in I requested a room upgrade if there was one and to my surprise the clerk upgraded us to a strip view bella suite, although it was still in the Venezia Tower.  

One of the biggest complaints I heard regarding the Venezia tower was that you had to take at least three elevators to get anywhere. And while this was partly true our room was a corner on the 8th floor and was adjacent to an elevator bank. That being said it was no problem getting in and out and you didn't even have to go through the casino to get to the front or the parking deck. 

And although the Venezia tower hasn't been updated in a while it was still a huge room and very well appointed. 

In summary, if you stay at the Venetian do try first to get a room at the Palazzo and if that's not available try the Venetian and if that's not available the Venezia tower is not a bad choice but I don't think I'd stay in it again. Honestly, though, when I go back to Vegas I think I'll stay at Wynn\/Encore.  Although no one would be dissapointed to stay at any of the three Venetian towers. The Venetian is also located in an ever so slightly more central location than Wynn, (they're practically next door but...)",1,1,1

The rooms are the highlight (and, really, isn't that why you stay in a hotel). They are big suites with a sunken living room, two flat screen TVs a and a big sitting area.

But if you're in Vegas how much time do you spend in your room?

The rest of the place, there are some very impressive architectural details to it, but the ambiance is sort of bland. The staff at the front desk was efficient but not very friendly. The waitresses in the bars and casino are attractive, but not particularly efficient which you could overlook if they were friendly at all, but they weren't.

I have a huge mad-on about places that charge you for internet access. I think I have gone beyond the notion that internet access should be free, I appreciate it when it is but I no longer expect it. Internet access in the suites was $12.95 a day, which I think is outrageous considering the price of the rooms.

There was also a nice tub that we promptly filled up with ice and liquor and a shower. The crapper was nice, we frequented it quite a bit. I didn't like the green marble or whatever in the bathroom.

The beds were comfortable and didn't have any mysterious stains on the covers, so that was good. We had a nice view of the strip from our room. Made for great scenery while we boozed it up.

House keeping was great to us. We had a ton of people staying in the room and left a generous tip along with a list of stuff we needed, so we went out to gamble, came back and we had a bag full of soaps, shampoos, conditions and chocolate. They gave us more than enough towels. Very accommodating.

Check-in\/out clerks were friendly. They gave us a bunch of key cards and some coupons. The security guard at the resort room elevator entrance was cool too, we rolled in with some new friends we made at Tao and he just gave us a big thumbs up and a wink.

Gambling:

Gambling here is expensive, but not as expensive as its neighbor, the Wynn and the more upscale Bellagio. Expect high minimums and lots of sharks.

I like the poker room here a lot. Probably because it's been good to me the few times I went. The cocktail waitresses are quick to serve and the dealers are knowledgeable and fun to talk to. The poker room also has a ton of TVs to keep you occupied during downtime.

I'd sign up for the Club Grazie player's card if you intend to gamble here or at the Palazzo a lot. They're usually some bonuses that you get for signing up for the first time.

The rooms are clean comfortable and the location is central to everything on the strip.

The hotel staff handled the situation in a timely manner and the guy even noticed we were missing our ice bucket so he said he would send one up which I'm assuming the person he told forgot because we never got it until the next day but no biggie!

I love this hotel!!

My only grievances were:
1-There was an old lingerie outfit sitting in a pile of dust, peeking its way out from behind our dresser. *shudders in disgust*
2-The hotel room service kinda sucked (which I don't really care about since there are a billion other food options on the strip AND in the hotel). The food was almost always tasteless and the entire service does not do well with ANY kind of alteration to the dish. Which means if you want your bacon on the side...it will still be on the plate. If you need them to send up spoons with your order even if the food itself does not require spoons...you will not receive the spoons. If you want them to come pick up the dishes an hour later, they will never show up so you MUST put everything outside for them.
3-The hotel doesn't offer refrigerators for personal use in rooms. It advertises it does but upon check-in, we were told there are only ""a handful"" of them and all had been ""checked out for the duration of [my] booking.""

That is honestly the only real complaint I have. 

Otherwise, what a great hotel! One of the love and hate things about this place was the way to get to our suite. I think there were about 4 or 5 different ways and x amount of elevators so it was easy to get lost. I had to remember landmarks on where to turn in the halls just to make it back up to my room from the entrance. Pretty fun when you are mildly intoxicated. 

The room was lovely. Though, i thought the design was odd. Instead of having the beds at the far end of the room, the living room was? I felt like that didn't make any sense to because you would have to walk pass people sleeping to go sit. Maybe I think it should be the living area first then the beds? Just an idea.

Suites in the hotel are comfortable and elegantly decorated, with lovely, supportive beds, and useful living areas where you can receive your friends in comfort. The bathrooms are spacious and stylish, appointed in luxurious marble--the whole presentation is at once restful and impressive.

Service matters a great deal at this level. During our recent stay, my wife needed a fresh order of towels delivered quickly. It arrived at light speed, together with complimentary tiny bags of chocolate squares, a very nice touch which we both greatly appreciated. In addition, we enjoyed luncheon in our room, easily the finest hotel food we have ever experienced (I heartily recommend the Pappardelle with meat sauce, an absolute masterpiece!); apple wood smoked bacon, croissants and bread are every bit as good as what you will receive at Bouchon Bistro, in the Venetian Tower.

But most importantly, when check-out time came, we found ourselves running out of organizational talent...: friends who were also staying in the hotel needed to be transported swiftly to the airport, and there we were, bags barely packed after a fun--late--night, with only minutes left to exit the room. And then we realized with no small measure of horror that our valet ticket was nowhere to be found! 

I phoned the front desk and explained that the thing had gone missing, and was transferred to the valet desk, where Paul very helpfully assured me that our car would be located post-haste. Then another call was placed to the front desk to explain that it was essential the luggage person get to our room quickly as possible. We finished packing at a frenzied pace, and just as everything was finally under control, Gary the Friendly Bellman showed up at our door. He was an absolute professional, quick to reassure us that the car would be waiting immediately upon check-out, our bags safely stowed in the trunk; Gary helped us manage a panic-free departure, and he remained pleasant and controlled throughout the process.

I had made a reservation for a smoking room and they gave me a room in another, lesser tower called Venezia. After going in my room I found there was a horrid smell (at a hotel that charges premium prices) and asked to change rooms, even if it wasn't smoking. They told me they could not change the room that day but would do so the following day. I had to sleep in that room with a horrid mildew\/vomit smell for that whole night. Another unacceptable thing was when I called the front desk they said there was nothing in the system that I had asked for a smoking room even though when I got my keys they said they had the request right there. 

The following day came and I called the front desk to assure of a room switch. They told me they had no more rooms and it was too bad, I had to stay in that room and they'd send someone up to clean it. They came in and cleaned the room and It still smelled. I called them again after finding the source was a certain spot on the carpet. They came up to clean it again and I pointed to the exact spot where the smell came from. Once they smelled it for themselves, they suddenly decided to be more helpful. They cleaned the spot specifically and the smell continued to stay. This suggested the smell was coming from mold, a health hazard.

My mom had to call them in order for them to even consider changing my room. Finally after nearly 2 days, they switched our rooms even though they had said they had previously said they had no available rooms. 

In review, I find that they
1. Will not help the customer if they're younger and will dismiss them as of lesser importance
2. Will not help the customer unless they are pointed out to a problem first hand that may indeed lead to legal issues
3. Had a disrespectful front desk person who's name is Alex. Seriously just told me ""too bad so sad"" about my room smelling like mold. 

This is ridiculous especially because they wouldn't comp anything, wouldn't switch rooms, it was literally just ""too bad so sad"". It's very unfortunate because my friends and I have Gold membership there and will certainly not be staying there in the future.

The worst part of this place is their customer service and their lack of attention to detail (hint hint:  REVIEW your INVOICES!!).  I booked TWO suites this past Labor Day weekend and explained to both the reservation agent as well as the front desk person that the weekend was a very special birthday weekend for my mom who was turning the BIG 6-0.  All I got was a fake smile, a ""how nice"" and that was pretty much it.  

Now, I know this place is HUGE.  And I know that this is Vegas but hot damn, can we at least get a nice note from the Guest Services person?  Maybe a bowl of fruit or an extra sewing kit for the room??  Something?  I spent a pretty penny on those suites and all I got to show for it was a citrus-infused shirt.

The reason I bring this up is because one of my all-time favorite hotels is the OMNI in San Francisco.  Man-o-man are they meticulous and Boy, do they pay attention!  I think when I reserved my stay with their reservation agent over the phone, I may have mentioned something in passing about a special landmark birthday being celebrated.  I guess she made a special note on my account information because when we arrived, the front desk person greeted us warmly and wished us Happy Birthday.  Not only that, but we were upgraded to a suite and waiting for us in the room was a mini-chocolate cake with an array of fruit and a chilled bottle of champagne.  Also, the Guest Relations Manager made sure to check in with us to ensure our stay was enjoyable.  Omni, people. THE OMNI!!!  Not a rinky dink, no name hotel.  This place was packed yet they took the time to think of their customers.  They truly understood and practiced the dying art of customer service!  

Back to the Venetian, yeah...  They so did not do anything remotely like what I just described.  Booooo.

Another thing, the suites have 3 TV's.  In our rooms, 2 of the TV's worked.  Then one morning, at about 4am, I was awoken by a loud cackle.  Turned out that some VERY DRUNK party goers were plopped right outside my door on the floor laughing, yelling, naging on the walls.  We called security.  Nothing.  I called the front desk.  A very unhelpful front desk person named ""Joe"" (they are not allowed to give last names appartently) said that it shouldn't be THAT bad and to not worry about it especially because this is Vegas and it's a holiday weekend and people are out and about having fun.  Ummmmm....  In other words, my ""complaint call"" was too harsh and judgmental on those poor happy kids who were just trying to have a good time.  I felt like one of those cartoons where old people yell ""Got off my lawn""...

On top of everything else, when I tried calling down to the front desk, I repeatedly got a ""we are experiencing heavy call volume"" which kept me on hold (several times) for 15 minutes at a time each time.  It was much faster to put on my slippers and walk down in my pajamas to the front desk.  

Caution to you all:  If you just want a pretty place to stay, the Venetian is pretty.  But you can find prettier, cheaper and probably with better customer service.  If you don't care about any of that stuff, then...  OK.  Have fun.  Bring lots of cash (ATM's charge on average $25 for a $200 withdrawal).  Bring big bills of at least 100's (20's are considered ghetto unless you're playing penny slots).  Don't put your money in an envelope and take it out whenever you're re-buying.  Get a Club Grazie card (first timers sometimes get slot credits).  When you leave for the airport from the hotel, take the ODS shuttle - it goes straight to the airport and is a super cheap $6!!  The shuttle leaves every half hour so check with the doorman about departure times just to be sure.  The doormen are a hidden source of very useful information and offered the best customer service among the lot of them - tip them well, they deserve it.",0,0,0

The hotel is perfectly located at the heart of the strip giving you a good choice of places within walking distance. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms are all suites with two beds, a table and a seating area. There is also an abundance of places to shop and eat within an elevator ride and short walk. I must admit I was addicted to the bouchon bakery goods. The pools are fabulous and Tao Beach and Nightclub are right there. If I was rating on convenience and location alone I would give the Venetian 5 stars.

#GirlProblems: We had 99 problems and location ain't one! If you are sharing your room be warned! The see-through shower (which has no ledges for leg shaving convenience), bath, and sink are in one large room with a smaller toilet room. The bathroom looks fancy but the setup is not conducive to 4 girls getting ready at the same time.  If one person is showering the sinks, vanity, and toilet are inaccessible. The only reason we were able to manage is because there is an abundance of mirrors (including 2 full length mirrors) and a magnified mirror (which had a broken light) on the vanity that can be moved into the suite area- voila 4 beatification zones! 

A major problem was lighting, there was none! All the lights in the room are extremely dim. Worst of all the bathroom has awful lighting. Our room faced a wall so we had no natural light, it was awful. Girls, it is never fun to beautify in the dark. The closet is very tiny so be prepared to request additional hangers. None of the plugs in our bathroom worked, which created a real hassle. The bed area did not have enough plugs to accommodate our phone chargers so we needed to plug them in the suite area (the plugs near the door were being used on hair tools). 

There is no iPod dock or aux option on the radio, so bring your own speakers. Other than our girl problems our room was very nice. I did bed bug check, there was none. The hotel staff are very friendly and extremely accommodating. When we ordered things they came up within minutes, except for the luggage. I would not recommend using the valet for bags. The hotel is large so this service is very slow. On a similar note: the cab line can be very long so if you are trying to make dinner reservation, a flight, or a show send someone down early to save a space in the cab line.",8,4,4

They only had the suite available & I didn't care how much it cost to get out of the Monte Carlo.

Would I stay here again?  Yes, very easily.  Found the 2 level room at a great cost.  Easy walking to many places both inside and outside of The Venetian.  Enjoyed the food, the casino, sitting in St Marks Square. 

--MOST ENJOYABLE MEMORY--  Purchase coffee at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf; purchase a pastry or breakfast to-go at Bouchon or Carlo's Bakery; Go to St Marks square where there are tables, music and an easy-going mood to really relax while having your to-go breakfast.  Closest thing to St Mark's square if you never go to Venice.      

Getting to the Venetian
Easy to get to.  Turn lanes from both North and South approaching.  Watch out for pedestrians as most do not watch out for cars.

- First Time Check in (stay the left after you enter from the street)
- Self Parking - easy for my stay.  Stay to the right and proceed past all the taxis around the corner.  It will be a left turn into the parking structure.  A few floors of easy parking while I stayed.  
- Valet Parking available; I did not use it
- Check in; easy; nice people to chat with and answer questions

The Room
- Security Guards at every hotel entry to the elevators leading to the floors; BRING YOUR ROOM KEY every time you plan on leaving the room;
- Seventeeth Floor; very different from other rooms I have stayed in.  Two level room separating bed area from desk\/tv\/living room area. Bed was very comfortable; Couch in living room area had a pull out bed that was used.  Had to call for linen, spare blanket and spare pillows;   
- Standard shower; separate tub; plenty of towels; separate door for toilet area; 2 sinks; standard amenities; hair dryer in the vanity drawer; 
- TV's in Bedroom, Living Room, Bathroom
- No Refrigerator; no coffee maker; very small ice bucket
- IMPORTANT:  Bar Area has sensors that when you PICK UP anything it reads it as a sale. This rule applies:  LOOK -- DON'T TOUCH (hint:  $5 bottle of water that you can walk to Walgreen for within 5 min of hotel that cost $2.
- Room Safe; 4 digit code to lock and unlock
- Drapes and curtains were opened and closed by a remote control; great for staying in bed and opening \/ closing at night
- NOTE:  On Desk; 2 plugs; 1 USB charging port; Plugs around the room however bring a power strip to charge more items;

Casino
- Standard Casino games

Smoking
There is smoking in the casino. I noticed both cigarette and cigar smokers sharing the area.  Note that there is a cigar shop in The Venetian however the prices are pretty high for what I normally pay for a good cigar (I think the lowest I saw was $14).  Bring your own cigars if you can.  

Food \/ Drink 
- Short notes; more in depth reviews on their own: 
- Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf on the floor above casino just off escalator; Dark Chocolate Latte; Black coffee; good service
- Bouchon Bakery on the Casino Level - grabbed something here each morning.  Kouign Amman (I think it was pronounced ""Queen Uh-mahn"" (Almond Paste Puff Pastry); Chocolate Croissant; excellent service
- Carlo's Bakery - In the Grand Canal Shoppes area; Check the map for 
fastest route to it; They run out of the Crumb Cake usually; The Crumb Cake was fantastic and worth the $4.50; 20 minute wait for the Crumb Cake as it had to been baked yet in the morning (it was 8AM when I went)
- Cafe Pan - Casino Level Food Court - Good Gelato; grabbed one every night I was there
- Grand Lux Cafe - Casino Level - Ate here for breakfast; had buffet available however chose to go with the Brioche French Toast (totally worth it to skip the buffet and just get a normal plate).  They are big enough to satisfy.  

Extras
- Make sure to walk into the Grand Canal Shoppes to enjoy looking at the people taking their boat ride through the canal
- Canyon Ranch Spa Club - used the fitness gym every day; clean; some different machines I had never tried before (A Stair stepper type of machine that reminded me of the Cross Country Ski machine -- first time I tried it); Locker rooms etcs.  Water Fountains (cups provided) cleaning wipes; towels; magazines; Bring your own headphones if you can; 
- 3 pools (2 close to the Canyon Ranch Spa Club; 1 on the 10th floor that I did not visit); 1 square hot tub spa that could easily fit 8+ people from what I saw",7,0,2

Let's start with the room because I know that's what y'all are interested in (if you're reading this).  We reserved the Luxury suite which is basically the least expensive room you can reserve for the hotel and let me just say that even for the inflated NYE prices, these rooms were incredible.

If the floors weren't covered with decorative cozy carpets, they were covered with marble, particularly in the entry way and the bathroom.  The room was impeccably clean.  I'm a bit of a germaphobe and never once gave a second thought to walking around barefoot.  The view as good except that another large building was across the way from us.  Still we could see a lot of Las Vegas, the mountains and the pools down below.  One complaint about that: They stated when I reserved the room that it would be between the 14th and the top floor, but the room was actually on the 12th floor.  It's possible that I mis-heard them but I'm pretty sure I didn't.  The floor we were on though was pretty great.

The room was VERY quiet although on rare occasion, the sounds from the less-than-quiet guests wandering the halls late at night made it into our room much louder than we would have expected but that rarely happened and certainly not enough for me to ding a star.

The bed was SUPER comfortable to me. Almost TOO comfortable.  If you're not careful, you'll end up lazing around all day in the thing which we could have easily done absent a strong desire to explore.  The showers and bathrooms were (as stated) VERY clean and well executed.  There's the his and hers sinks, the tub (which we used) and the separate vanity area which we used as well.  The bathroom also has a private water closet.  There is no exhaust fan in there though but there is a vent.

One of my favorite things about this room is the climate control system.  It works just like central air at your home.  No crappy self-contained window-unit that works only in that space.  It works great too!  In fact the thermostat is BETTER than what's available at my own home where you can set it to auto and it will chose whether AC or heat is required to keep it within whatever temperature range you select.  Why do I notice these things?

Also the service: this can't be understated.  At every instance, their staff was available to me whenever I needed them.  I never waited on hold more than a couple of minutes and when we ordered room-service, it arrived within a reasonable time.  It was MUCH more convenient than any of the other options.  Speaking of which, the step-down living space is better than advertised.  This is where the pics just don't do it justice.  These rooms are very good size, much bigger than I would expect even for NYE timeframe prices.  When the wait staff brought in our food, everything was covered with silver -- well, covers -- and placed ornately on the dining table.  Yes, there's a dining table as well as a living room area, as well as a desk area.

I didn't test this, but it looks like you have to purchase WiFi access separately which I was disappointed about but it didn't stop me anyway since my phone helped me get the access I needed.  Afterwards the check-in process for our bags at the holding area was well executed, however the line was a bit long for that.  Still nothing to dock a star for.

All told, the venetian was a GREAT experience and I'd be blessed should I have the occasion to stay there again.",0,0,0

Now that I finally got to come back to Vegas in Feb 2012, I got to see it for myself after hearing all the hype.  What a beauty!

This is by far the nicest hotel on the strip outdoing Cesar's Palace which held this title for the longest time.

The interior of the hotel has a beautiful outdoor setting of Venice is more like a huge mall rather than a hotel.  Beautiful shops, all the big names, classy restaurants, it has it all.  

Bought some Godiva chocolates, Harley D shades, and a few other treats that we can't get back home.  

One thing I noted is that many of the shops, even the high end shops have sale signs all over the place, like 50%-70% off for Gucci, Versace....wow.  Where were these sales back in 2000?

We didnt need WIFI since we have unlimited data, they complied. I was like great!! So I thought nothing of it that night, well the next day I was checking my Credit Card balance and noticed a 450.00 charge from the hotel, yes you read that right 450.00!!! We go down to the desk to find out why there was that large of a sum. They said its the resort fee. I calmly explained that the previous night upon check in that there would be no fees. Well after a little bit they agreed to remove the hold. I was like great now this is on a Saturday, gave it 24 hours and the hold still hadnt been removed. We left on Monday and they charged the amount that was taken from the mini bar. But the 450.00 was STILL PENDING!! FINALLY ON Thursday the hold was taken off. Beautiful hotel, but sneaky on the fees.

The very upsetting part was with how ill I was I needed to check out quick and catch a flight home, in my haste of getting packed up left multiple prescriptions on the counter in the bathroom, one yes was something that I am sure they could use or sale but the other 2 were heart medications that are very costly. After arriving home found out that I had left them there and called the hotel, unfortunately nothing was turned in from the cleaning staff, I understand that in some cases things happen but to not turn in some medications that a quest leaves behind is very disheartening as I paid for a suite and at that cost per night I would expect better from this hotel. I am sure they could not turn in some and not all and that is why they were all taken. Be aware when staying here that you do not leave anything as it will not be returned.

The rooms are huge.  Every room in the place is a suite.  Not a little studio suite either.  Their normal suite is larger than any other hotel room that we have ever stayed at.  The beds are so very comfortable.  The bathroom has all the amenities including a television.  There are two other televisions in the suite as well.  So no need to argue with the wife about what to watch.  The tvs are located far enough from each other that the volumes do not interfere with each other.  The living room with the sofa is also comfy for resting and relaxing.  In some suites, you have to take a couple of steps down to the sunken living room (very cool).

It is not the perfect place to stay.  There is no free Internet access.  It costs almost $16 per day if you want it.  Another option is to pay an extra $25 per day for their resort fee.  This extra $25 gives you Internet access and use of their gym facilities.  I must say that their gym is pretty impressive.  Every cardio equipment is clean, new, and even have televisions attached.  Headphones are also provided.  There is a separate weight room included with much equipment.  There is a rock wall for climbing.  

Fortunately, no resort fee is needed to use the swimming pool on the 10th floor.  Definitely bring your swimsuit!!

Have not played at their casino lately.  Did notice that the minimum bet at the blackjack table is $15 during the day.  The ventilation system seems better than previous years.  Either that or I'm just getting used to second hand smoke.

What makes the Venetian so great is how large the hotel is, the large array of restaurants, the wonderful shopping, and it's close connection to its counterpart, the Palazzo. The problem is that the hotel has a lot of work to do when it comes to great customer service or great value. To begin with, check-in created a long waiting time. I reserved a room online, on the hotel website, the day that I stayed. This meant no discount and I was paying a lot of money. I wanted a mini staycation as I am local. There was a massive convention that day and they got great rates on their rooms. The room I reserved was supposed to have a really great view. When I got to the room, the door was a problem as I consistently had to put the key back in several times just to get it to open. Then, the view was mainly of the pool with a lot of structures obstructing the strip and I specifically asked for a view and that does not mean a pool view I called to make sure I was reserving appropriately and I was told view means of the strip. This is not what I got.
We ordered room service at night and were told that the wait would be 45 minutes or less. We actually waited an hour and 15 minutes for our food. We were less than impressed with this as we were debating between going down to eat or staying in as 45 minutes or less was doable. Adding an extra 30 minutes to that, as we were very hungry, would not have been doable, but we ordered and were stuck with waiting despite being told it would be 45 minutes or less.
When we called for valet the day of checkout, I was told that the property was too large for me to be able to call down for my car to be ready. Please note that Caesar's Palace is way larger than the Venetian and I have never had a problem calling for my car to be ready from any of its locations so this was a little bit disappointing for me. I brought my ticket down and we waited for our car. When the car was driven over, it was surrounded by several other cars within moments and we could not get out. We had to get somewhere and we had already waited 20 minutes for the car to come. The guy in valet, Richard, asked why we were in the lane that we were in and we explained that this is where the valet dropped off our car. He went on to say we had no choice but to wait until all the cars got out of our way and these cars had no one claiming them and they have not moved in a while, including two cars in front of us that had been there for the whole 20 minutes while we were waiting! He was very rude about it and we were completely beside ourselves. Being local, Las Vegas is known for customers service and this was the exact opposite of that. He continued to be very rude and as we were driving off, he was laughing, sarcastically, at us. I did call to make a complaint with the concierge but I do not know how far this is going to go.
This hotel was a fortune this Saturday and I paid it and I will not be considering paying it again. I will do what I can't to steer away from this hotel due to the poor customer service. The bed is just OK and the pillows are soft which may be too much for certain people, yet the room overall is nice. Still, Las Vegas has many fabulous hotels with very nice rooms and similar prices with even nicer rooms. I am very disappointed in the Venetian. I do not plan on staying here again. There are too many way better choices in Las Vegas.",2,1,0

You can do a ton of shopping and choose from over 30 places to eat without even having to step foot outside! The standard rooms at The Venetian are large and luxurious, same goes for the bathrooms. The sunken sitting area has a couch that can be pulled out as a bed, so you could comfortably fit 4 people or more into the room. The rooms are not only equipped with THREE flat screens (one in the bathroom!), but I was surprised to also see a fax\/copy machine!

The only downside to my stay here was prior to checking in, we were given the option to stay at The Palazzo for no extra charge and were told it'd be no problem for us to change rooms in the middle of our trip. However, when we called from our room to get that done, the guy who answered blatantly lied to us about how there were no rooms meeting our preferences available at The Palazzo. We called The Palazzo directly and found out there were plenty of rooms available! After going down to the reception desk to get this sorted out, we were finally able to change rooms AND be upgraded to a 1200 sq ft suite at The Palazzo.",1,1,2

I was here for a company conference. The conference facilities are great, but getting to them is not. Below is a list of things I did\/did not like about my stay.

The Good:
1. The appearance of the hotel is fabulous.
2.  The room I had was a standard King and very nice with lots of space. The hotel room I stay at in NY for work would fit in bathroom of the Venetian room. Hard to imagine that hotel rooms in Italy have that much room, but very nice here.
3.  The food is great from insuite or any restaurant.

The bad
1. The layout of the hotel is NOT designed well for customers.
2. Walking into the lobby is nice and then it goes down from there.
3. Signs to find anything in the hotel are difficult to find\/read or non-existent.
4. Difficult to get from hotel room to conference center. If you are doing anything at the Sands Expo book your room at The Palazzo and NOT THE VENETIAN.
5.  The refrigerator in your room is NOT for your use. If you remove something from the mini bar you will be charged regardless if you open the item. I removed the beer in the fridge and put in my own water bottles. When checking out I was charged for everything I moved even though I moved it back before checking out.
6. If you would like a fridge you have to request and pay extra.
7. Late Checkout requested as I needed to be at the conference center till 2pm. Answer = ""NO"" then hung up on.",2,0,0

The rooms are all suites; the building connects with what I believe is the best  group of shops you'll find on the strip; the building also connects all the way over to the Palazzo. You could (and we did) spend three (3) hours simply walking, taking in the sights, and not see all that the hotel and shops have to offer in the Venetian.  

The room: 
Again, the rooms are all suites.  I booked a King Suite, and was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a room with a premium view.  Seeing as we stayed almost a week, this would have run us an additional $50 a day (approximately).  The room was beautiful, and definitely worth the money.  The only downside to our trip was the room upon arrival.  Someone had left half eaten food and small piles of trash\/refuse around the room, and the bed was slightly disheveled.  It almost looked as if some of the staff had used the suit as a break room and forgotten to clean it up.  However, seeing as it was nearly 9pm, it was hard to understand how it was still dirty.  We contacted the desk and room service; both of whom seemed puzzled by our report, and wanted us to solve the problem.  Both asked, ""what would you like us to do""?  You'd think the response would be something along the lines of an apology, and an immediate remedy, but such was not the case.  It was up to us to figure it out, and neither the desk or housekeeping was going to make any decision.  If you've ever stayed in a large Vegas hotel, you know it can take 7-10 minutes just to get to your room.  So even if we wanted another room, did we really want to come down from the 25th floor, walk all the way back down to the escalator, then back down to the main floor, and across the casino.. having already tipped our doorman who brought up all of our luggage?  Or simply have them come clean the room immediately?  We opted for immediate cleaning, although immediate was 45 minutes later.  To be fair, after my second call to the desk after a 1\/2 hour wait, the desk told me they should have warned me it would take approximately 40 minutes for a response to my room.  Overall, that was my only gripe, and to be honest it was highly unacceptable for such a fine establishment.  But we refused to let it ruin our vacation, especially from the start.  

Again, overall we had a very pleasant stay.  But it was not the best start.  However, unless that sort of thing is regular (which I highly doubt) I would recommend the Venetian as one of the top picks on the strip; at least for those looking for a more luxurious and adult set up.  Don't get me wrong, there's is plenty for a family, but I mean ""adult"" as in you aren't staying in some pirates or medieval themed room or casino.  This one is tastefully designed with an Italian inspiration and flavor.  

P.S.

Should you so desire, the YardBird, located very close to the rooms, was a fantastic gourmet take on Southern Food and completely unexpected.",0,0,0

There's no equal to a relaxed walk under a realistic blue sky littered with little puffy clouds, while passing high-end stores and boutiques. 

The rooms at the Venetian are suite sized, well appointed, comfortable, and feature gorgeous bathrooms... but if you look carefully you can see some maintenance is in order to spruce them up (bathroom door handle loose, one sink backed up, dent in the wall near the bed, in-room safe wasn't closing, etc.).

They added The Palazzo since I was last here in '00 and it's enhanced the allure and entertainment options immensely.

We enjoyed dinner at Dal Toro (Lamborghinis viewable through the glass wall), and breakfasts and lunches at the Canyon Ranch cafe (cheap and yummy! Plus: normal portions). SambaSushi was lively and delicious, if a bit pricey (but what isn't in Vegas, right?) 

New Year's Eve dinner was at Valentinos for a 10:30 pm seating... the rear room was a little blah with a burgundy color scheme...all went well up until near midnight, when our waitress forgot to serve our Moscato D'Asti to go with our dessert--nonetheless a lovely experience.

I got the standard Venetian room, with a nice little bedroom area, and then a sunken in living room with a couch and chair, writing desk, and table. I did get a view of the pool, which was nice. The bed was very comfortable, although it did have the worst case of ""not fitted sheets"" that I've ever seen - just laying down untucked all of the bottom sheet, guaranteeing you'd be sleeping in a wadded up mess about 5 minutes in to the night. Feels like for what casinos like this charge, they could get themselves some fitted sheets.

Nice big bathroom, soaker tub and glassed in shower, plus a double vanity, plus a little side table with makeup mirror. So that's pretty cool. Although...no ventilation. Man, this place is making its way on to all of the bad hotel lists.

My major complaint here was layout. Holy god - to get from the main lobby to the room, you go through this weird little back entry way by the reception desk, and up an elevator from the *Venetian* lobby to the *Venezia* lobby, which by the way, is completely unused, although patrolled by security. Then you walk down a really long hallway, twist and turn through some more hallways, finally walk through a hallway where there are actual hotel rooms (If I had one of these rooms, I would be furious) and find yourself in another elevator. Then you take that up to your floor, and walk a while to get to the room, depending on where it is on the floor. Quite a hike. I wish I had brought a pedometer to gauge the distance, but I did clock it - my usual brisk walking speed still took me 11 minutes to get from the room to the conference center. Crazy. Maybe this is to be expected, but it seems bizarre. The double elevator thing really blew my mind this time.",4,0,2

BEAUTIFUL view of vegas and the Venetian sign lights up at night. So pretty!

There are so many different rooms in the different towers. When in doubt, ask someone where your room is! I, without fail, get lost in the towers and end up going up the wrong elevators into the wrong tower. Make sure you're reading signs (located on the entrance before the elevator rooms) that will tell you where that set of elevators will take you. 

There is free parking for self park so take advantage of it! Try to find spots closest to the elevators in the back corner of the lot. Remember to take a picture of the sign closest to your car so you remember where you parked at the end of your stay. There is also a valet service if you're fancy ;)

The housekeeping is so sweet, always accommodating and talkative. It does take a while to get something to your room once you order it as they have so many rooms to take care of. I recommend just finding a cart that is in the hall for turndown service and ask them for towels! Ps. They have chocolates :)

It was the best move I've ever made. After just an evening I realized just how much having to dealing with bicycles everywhere else degrades the experience and the general quality of life. Yes, Las Vegas is a manufactured environment, but it's a GOOD manufactured environment. For the first time in a long time I feel completely relaxed after a weekend away.",0,0,0

I had my birthday here not too long ago and had a big suite. What I loved the most about it? The shower!!!! It's flat, no door, the water doesn't go out, it's big, and lots of things can happen in that bathroom overall. hahahahhaa :)

Needless to say, everyone hooked up in the suite. Shoot. The place was big, there were people everywhere, but whatevers man. Good times right?

There's also this buffet that's $55 to $60 which is on the top floor of a little restaurant (can't remember the name), but I think it's their Sunday brunch thing? Anywhoo, sorry for being so vague about it, but if you ask the concierge where you can eat at a buffet which is upstairs for about $60 they can point you here. Anyways, it is SO good. Aqua de Pana water in wine glasses, filet mignon, cheeses from all over the world, seafood galore, desserts, and more. One of the best meals I have ever had. Dammit! I don't remember the restaurant name! 

Well as you can see, suites, service, food, club (tao), bars (v bar), and everything in general has been a great experience for me here.

CHECK IN: Very professional. but let me tell you what really knocked my socks off is when they offered me an upgrade to a suite that was more than double the sq footage for a deep discount due to it being a slow day. I DEFINITELY accepted that offer.

SUITE: I opened the door to this 1,400 sq ft Piazza suite and my jaw dropped. I thought the room was pretty darn luxurious, even the shades\/curtains were automatic and controlled by a button. The bed was truly amazing to sleep on and the master bathroom was spacious and inviting. The bathroom amenities included a dental kit, hair spray , vanity kits , mouth wash in addition to the normal shampoos and body washes.

POOL: The Venetian and Palazzo Hotel pool are connected by a walkway so it seems you can use either without an issue, the hot tub was huge and the actual pools themselves were pretty nice as well. There appeared to be ample chairs available.

CASINO: The Casino is bright and inviting, at the casino bar they give you snacks while you play- nice touch!

Nice size living\/tv area. Seats 8 easily. Duel desks.

Large bay windows! See pics.

Canyon Ranch spa is located at this resort. Largest spa in the world from what I have been told.

Spent two afternoons at this spa. Absolutely loved it. Can't wait to visit again.

Pool area was so nice. Private just for resort guests. They pass out cucumbers to place over your eyes while you sun bathe. Lovely and relaxing.

Lounge chairs are available in the shallow end of the pool in order to get the most out of your sun bathing experience keeping you comfortable in the summer heat.

Enjoyed dinner at Bouchon first night. Exquisite! Dinner at Delmonico Steakhouse a second night. Filet Minion was excellent.

Since everything is based on weight in the fridge, if you lift something up you have to pay for it.  The front desk told us they could not do that but they could give us another mini-fridge for $50 a day!  So don't believe the ad when it says that it comes with a fridge.  They said that they couldn't empty the fridge we had because then they could not sell all that beer, etc.  However, they don't replace it all between guests and nothing in there HAS to be refrigerated so I'm not sure why that would be.

When my fiance' and I decided to marry in Las Vegas there was no doubt in my mind where we would be residing and having the My wedding trip (of all trips), however, would mar my image of the resort.  Tthe suite they provided us (29-335) left a lot to be desired.  The décor was old, dirty and run-down.  Nothing like what I recalled of the Venetian's quality reputation.  We were both tired and anxious as our big day was scheduled for the following day (9\/10\/11) and we didn't want to lug back to the front desk to request another room as we still had phone calls to make and our garments needed to get to the cleaners. While taking a shower, I discovered a large lump of long hair in the corner of the shower (please see attached photo).  I was disgusted but too tired to deal with housekeeping as it was approaching midnight.  The next morning I called housekeeping and asked to have the shower and tub thoroughly cleaned.  I also asked to have the floors vacuumed since discovery of the hair prompted me to note the overall cleanliness of the room. There were marks on the walls, doors and the ceiling.  The couch was filthy and there was no soap in the guest bathroom.  Nonetheless, housekeeping apologized and agreed to have it corrected while we were out for the day.  When I returned to the room at approximately 2 p.m., the hair was still in the shower.  I couldn't believe it.  I called housekeeping again and requested they attend to it immediately.  However, by the time they responded we were dressing for the ceremony and agreed to return after we were done. I would have been better off staying in a regular suite and paying less money.  On several occasions leaving the room and seeing the suites that were being cleaned on my floor, I noticed the furniture and the ambience at a much more suitable ""Venetian"" level.  My only conclusion for the room I was given is that I booked through Hotels.com.  Otherwise, why would you give someone who requested a larger sized suite (who also booked a wedding at the hotel) a crummy, nasty, dirty suite?  Is it standard practice to provide guests with less quality (and cleanliness) if they book outside of the hotel? To make matters worse, upon returning to the suite along with my wedding guests, we found the ice bucket's top had mold\/mildew growing in it (see attached photo).  I was embarrassed as one of my guests noticed it.  I could have called down and complained or requested another room at this point as I had more than enough reason to, but it was not fair to me or my guests to have to stop celebrating my big day to complain.  I shouldn't have been put in that position. All guests should expect, at the very least, a clean room.  It should be the Venetian's priority to ensure that customers stay in sanitary living quarters as a result of ensuring that staff has thoroughly completed their jobs.  If a guest complains about the cleanliness, I would think that the hotel would quickly remedy the problem and ensure that there are no other sanitary issues within the room. I complained to Christina and Janson at the front desk when I checked out on Sunday, 9\/11\/11.  They took notes, appeared to be concerned and stated they would advise management and send me a customer satisfaction survey.  I did not receive the survey until 9\/14\/11 and it states ""there will be no direct response to feedback as the survey and comments are handled by a third party"".  Really?  That's what your customer service has reduced my satisfaction and my patronage to?  I have no intentions on staying at the Venetian again.  I also intend on yelping my experience. Times are rough and when people spend their hard earned money to vacation, they expect what you guys have gotten away from...no stress, no worries, good customer service and a CLEAN room!

If you look in the right places for discounts and deals, there are many offers to find.  While attending WWD Magic for work, for three nights I had the pleasure of calling the Venetian my home.  

The Venetian is attached to the Palazzo.  Actually, all of the hotels on The Strip are basically attached to each other, forming a long chain of hotels on top of casinos, shopping malls, and expensive restaurants.  My room was almost 600 square feet with two queen sized beds, a living room, and a great view of the city from the 6th Floor.  The fanciest part of the room was the bathroom--- covered in marble, with; a standing shower, spa tub, separate toilet room, two sinks, full vanity with magnifying mirror, French doors, and a chandelier.  The bathroom was by far the best part of the room, even though it needed some paint touch-ups and was a little outdated.  The remote control curtains were pretty nice, too.

Since it was my first time in Vegas, I did not know what to expect, other than lots of gambling.  I did not know that Vegas is actually more of an entertainment center that is even more expensive than the grandest Disney park, including the food and attractions.  Taxis cost almost $25 to go two miles, and public transportation is absolutely awful, if you want to get off of The Strip to find normal priced items and food.

It was awesome that my stay was during Chinese New Year\/Tet\/Sol Nal, because there were so many beautiful gardens and decorations celebrating the year of the lamb\/goat.  With that, more than 50% of the gambling tables were filled with people celebrating the Lunar New Year and hoping for good luck.  There were some people even praying to the goat statues and fountains.  Also, there were many open Asian restaurants in the hotel serving, to my surprise, authentic style Hong Kong, Vietnamese, and Chinese dishes.  While the hotel restaurants are waaaaaay more expensive than they should be, the food was great quality and the service outstanding.

Check in - Due to their partnership with InterContinental, I was able to check in at the invited guests line. Only one person ahead of me. Hooray! Even with my comped room on a Saturday night, they upgraded me from a Luxury View to Piazza since I have gold status with Priority Club. They even let me check out at 4pm instead of 11am. Loves it.

The room - The Piazza suite was ginormous, 1400 sq feet to be exact. It had 1.5 bathrooms, a four person dining table, king bed and pull out couch. The decor was spartan and dated. The rooms need a refresh. The Palazzo rooms look better and I swear some of the furniture was missing from my room. Did they give me the ghetto Piazza suite? Who cares...it was better and bigger than the room I had booked.

Canal Shoppes - Most of the stores are too pricey for me so I just window shop. I've been to the Venetian in Macau and the mall there is about 4x bigger.

1. My husband called the Venetian the morning of our arrival to request some champagne to be delivered to our room so it would be there when we arrived. He was trying to make our honeymoon special. They told him that they would not be able to do that. Upon check in, they said we'd have to check in first and order it from room service or buy it from the store.

2. We upgraded our room to the Piazza Suite. They gave us a tiny discount but did nothing really to make us feel special for our honeymoon. Other than a ""Congratulations!"".

3. We used their Spa for a Couple' Massage. We booked it the day before and it is not cancellable. At $310 for 50 minutes, we were hoping it would be worth it. When we showed up for the appointment, I mentioned to them that I saw a Weekday Special discount that I wanted to utilize and they told me that we had to mention it while booking and we could no longer use it. I told them that I felt they should have mentioned it to us upon making the reservation and their failure to do so was neglect on their part. 

4. The place is filled with Barkers. I could not stand how hard it was to just walk peacefully along and not be approached by people trying to sell us stuff. I felt like I needed a fly swatter to swing them off as we walked by. Totally overkill and put a huge damper on our enjoyment of the resort. The only people that were not instrusive were the ones who are near the maps and helped tell us find what we were looking for.

5. Signage is poor. We walked through that place as lost as could be. Directories were even hard to find! I had no sense of direction in that huge place and the signage was not consistent to lead us to where we wanted to go.

6. The pool is nice and all of that. The whilrpool is in desperate need of plaster,, though. It isn't as hot as I would have liked it but the jets were nice and strong.
But ordering two drinks in small plastic cups during the weekday shouldn't cost $32. And that's with going to the bar and bringing it back yourself to the lounge chairs. Too overpriced!

7. Upon check out, they didn't even ask how did we like our stay. Every hotel always wants to know if we are happy with our stay and they didn't even care.


Next time we come to Vegas, we'll be checking out other hotels. We know we'll pay more for luxuries but we want to find places that will at least appreciate our business.",6,0,0

The 3 TV's was very appreciated by the boyfriend, so he could watch golf and I could listen to the news while getting ready for a night out. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful and check in and out was fairly easy (especially for Vegas in the summer). The pool was great but get there earlier for a good spot. And the Spa was absolutely the best! Canyon Ranch is my new hero!!! The only thing that was annoying was our room was somehow looked over 2 days in a row for cleaning, but once we called housekeeping they were very nice about it and it was cleaned ASAP.

I really hate that you have to walk hella days just to get anywhere in the hotel! The casino areas can get quite crowded, even to the point where you have to start holding hands with the people you are with. 

The Grand Canal Shoppes are pretty cool--it always feels like midday. The gondola ride is a waste of money unless you can get your gondolier to sing you Italian opera. I've gotten lucky and had them sing arias to me both times I've ridden them.

If you plan to stay at the Venetian be prepared to walk around a lot. I know that in Vegas, walking around is expected, but methinks the Venetian is designed to confuse people so they walk around more and buy more shit. Be careful!",0,0,0

I really liked how the Venetian connects to the Palazzo because it makes the hotel seem even bigger.

This hotel is huge. The first suite I stayed in was with my cousins - five girls in one room - we were able to easily all shower and get dressed and the double beds were comfortable. We all laughed how we could watch TV in each 'room' of the suite.

The other room I stayed in was with my other cousin and we shared a king bed. The only complaint I had about this room is that we couldn't figure out how to turn off the lights to the stairs.

One could say I basically grew up on the sidelines of the casino, biding my time in the arcade and waiting for the day when I could participate in real gambling and win some money instead of stupid arcade prizes. About 4 years ago, that day finally arrived and I haven't looked back since. The standard rooms at Venetian\/Palazzo cannot be compared to any other resort casino on the strip. The standard rooms are literally suites and extremely spacious, you can even entertain guests in there if you'd like lol I love the beds and pillows, extremely comfortable . I've been fortunate enough to stay in various different suites such as the Rialto ( bigger suite but a lot of space you can't do anything with...like a foyer, but hey...it certainly looks cool) prima suite...huge and you get a dining table which is pretty awesome if you're dining in (but really, you're in VEGAS...why are you dining in??) My personal favorite is the renaissance suite, as of right now it is the most magnificent suite i've stayed at in Las Vegas I mean seriously there is a bench in the shower AND a jet tub, TVs everywhere, huge living room so you can throw your own after party,  and spectacular views. The customer service at the Venetian is unparalleled (unlike at Cosmo, where it sucks even if you're an identity member but the hotel is cool so whatever )they definitely care about their guests and the experience their guests have when staying here. They are fast, efficient, and extremely polite. Never had a problem. I prefer not to stay at their Venezia tower because it's too far of a walk, but on the bright side Bouchon is also located right around there and that is one of my favorite brunch spots. If you're in a rush you can always grab coffee and a snack at the express Bouchon. I've been to Grand Lux cafe over 15 times because the hours and great and it's extremely convenient(there's one right by the casino at Venetian, and one at Palazzo(lol a little excessive but hey, when in Rome...) also you can't really go wrong with cheesecake factory ( grande lux is owned by them) I love their beignets in the morning. Sushi Samba over at Palazzo is a very eclectic restaurant, like Brazilian Japanese fusion, if you like sushi i would definitely give it a try.  I love the yard long margaritas at Lime Ice as well. The Grand Canal shops are conveniently located (THE SEPHORA IS HUGE!) Walgreen's is great to stop by and pick up the necessities you forgot at home (don't go to the Apothecary shop by the room elevators, its 9 dollars for toothpaste lol crazyy) I've only ever been on one Gondola ride , very cute photo opportunity and you get to feel European for half an hour ( but if you're a gambler you might consider it a waste of time, just sayin) My favorite part is coming during the holiday season and enjoying the annual ""Winter in Venice"" Festivities.Beautiful decorations all around the resort, and New Years eve fireworks are a sight for sore eyes and the huge Christmas tree is beautiful. don't skip out on the ice skating, it really is a lot of fun. If you're more of a summer person have no fear, you will not be bored. I'm not crazy about Tao and Tao beach club but a lot of my friends enjoy the parties and DJs there. I prefer the relaxed spa like environment of ""Azure Luxury Pool.' Hmm what else..THE CASINO(how could I forget??!) is lively and huge, the tables are packed on hectic weekends but then again that's common to all the good casinos. Waitresses pass by often for drink orders , never waited for than 15 minutes. If you have kids or you don't like to gamble and need a day time activity check out Madame Tussaud's wax museum and check out the creepily funny replicas , people come by from all over Vegas to go there so might as experience it if it's right under your nose. I could go on raving about this place in it's entirety but i'm sure you get the point, there is so much to do and you won't regret staying here. If you  gamble, make sure to sign up for Grazie, they are by far the best player's club in Las Vegas..best perks including triple point weekends and you can use your points at the gift events for top notch stuff, I got an iPad and a Michael Kors wallet..not bad at all ;)",1,0,0

Keep in mind - I wasn't even paying to stay here because I was on conference and I still left early. There are people in front on the sidewalk handing out fliers that state that the health department found bodily fluids on sheets, comforters, and furniture. I can actually believe it now - you want to lounge around in a Jizz-Palace, go for it; bring your black-light and get a free show when you turn out the lights! I can't believe this place is the Venetian that people raved about. No one at upper-management cares about your complaints, so don't bother. This isn't big business, It's MONSTER business and you're an ant....a piss ant. I don't know if the fliers are true or not, but from the funk smell in my suite, it makes me wonder. Someone wrote about ""bed-bugs"" but I didn't see anything like that (they probably couldn't stand the smell and moved to a smoking room).  The food-court is pathetic, crowded, and consists of wannabe-trendy eateries with jacked-up prices and slammed down quality. Johnny Rockets Burgers: Cheeseburger, fries, and shake was $22.00 and it sucked! The Panda Express also sucked. There's a Nathan's where you can get a hot-dog with grilled onions for $6.00 (that was okay actually). The tower suites are really set up weird - like a labyrinth. You take an elevator up, walk a long maze, and then take another one up to the suites. I saw a few lost drunks confused and bewildered; I helped one, but another I sent to the parking garage elevator just for kicks...I was bored.

From the automated draperies that come in heavily at a marvelous scarlet color to the fabolulous classical style of the building. Everything was beautiful, gorgeous, and classy. I loved every bit about this hotel and would definitely come back assuming I've already visited all other 4+ star hotels on the strip of Las Vegas. My girlfriend and I stayed here on the last day of our stay in Vegas. We thought we'd splurge a lil by coming here and experiencing the luxury of  the privileged life. Let me be the first to say that this place was well-worth the nearly 200 dollar a night room for an upgraded venetian suite on the highest floor. The room was magnificient, and the beds were extremely comfortable. There were 3 flat-screen tvs- 1 in front of the bed, 1 in the living room, and 1 in the bathroom. the bathroom is tiled the room comes with a safe, a desk, 2 nice chairs, a L shaped sofa, a single sofa psychiatrist chair, and the entire room is temperature controlled. 

I would recommend the venetian side, rather than the older venezia side towers. I would also recommend you ask for a higher floored room because well.. everyone likes being on the higher floors because of the view. When I asked, I got it at 0 cost, and my view was like the view you would ordinarily see in the movies.. one of the entire view of all the luxury and excess that las vegas has to offer. 

To me, a very nice place to stay for vacation is vital to the amount of fun I can possibly have on the trip overall. Because of this, the Venetian serves as a very eloquent, classy, quiet, clean, and spacious place to enjoy your vacation in vegas. after the venetian.. you won't want to spend your hotel nights anywhere else when u are in nevada. yahh..

We arrived there around 330 in the afternoon and the party had already started without us! We entered pain about $20 per person. However, after entering we realized that we wanted to have a daybed. We went back up and changed our request and that change cost us $300! I must admit that we ran into some difficulty based on the fact that originally the hostess said that tax and gratuity was included in the price. We later found out that that was incorrect. After further discussion with management they were very gracious enough to accommodate what the original hostess quoted us. They adjusted our bill accordingly. I was very satisfied with this action especially noting that one of our hostess was very very rude.

I enjoyed my time at the beach party the music was great the people were nice and everybody just seemed on the up and up! We ordered sweet potato french fries chicken wing lollipops and shrimp wraps. Everything was so tasty but after two pictures of tea and vodka, it made it hard for us to eat all of our meal. And keep our sexy going!

They explained it to me that the charge was a room upgrade fee, because the original room I booked was not available at the time. I asked for refund because I did not ask for an upgrade, they just put me on hold forever when I asked to speak with a manager. 

I found it outrages. I might be even ok and agree with the upgrade, if they told me the truth when I checked in. But what happened is fraud. Definitely going to share the words around.",2,0,0

We had no choice but to take the accessible room as we are not smokers & can't take the cigarette smoke. They promised us a room change the next day which took 5 - 6 hours and they didn't honor their promise to call us when the new room was ready. On the last night my husband requested a late check out @ either 12 or 1:00 and @ first they said ok but then phoned us right back & said sorry but they had a VIP coming in the next day & they needed that exact room (non-strip view) & we must be out by 11:00 am. They didn't honor the birthday invitation offers at all either that came w\/ our reservation deal. Having to use a handicap room while battling my Lyme Disease, unpack & repack to move the next day.

It was my fourth time in Vegas but my first time staying at a ""nice"" hotel and not for work purposes. I must say that the service here is excellent - from check in, to security, to the gym, restaurants and TAO nightclub. From start to finish we were treated like royalty! The concept of ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies in Vegas.

The room was beautiful, with a large king bed and a slightly lower suite area with a pull out couch. I would have liked a fridge - minibars are not fridges, apparently, so I'm glad we were warned not to touch them (or be charged). The bathroom was nice and very spacious, but I wasn't a fan of the see-through shower. Considering there are two sinks, a makeup vanity, and a toilet, you would expect some privacy for someone to take a shower while someone is getting ready or using the other amenities. Oh well. 

Our view was decent - we could see a parking structure (not great) but also the LINQ's High Roller (great) so that was cool. Also, considering the level of noise in the hallway, it wasn't too loud at night. I slept great!

My one serious complaint is the way the hotels and elevators are laid out. Just to get out of the hotel (to the lobby or to the car), we had to walk through multiple hallways, take multiple elevators, and walk through more hallways. I've never in my life had to go down an elevator, walk through down a long twisty hallway, then go down another elevator, walk a few feet, then go back up ANOTHER elevator just to get to a parking garage. BIZARRE. I can only liken this layout to the ever-evolving, ever-changing stairs of Hogwarts castle in Harry Potter. You never really know where you are going or where they are taking you. It took me two solid days to figure out what the heck was going on. Oh well.

Harry Potter stairs aside, I would come here again for the fantastic service and recommend it to someone looking for a unique and elegant hotel on the strip.",3,4,3

Also, the lack of coffee makers in the rooms serves to be a problem when you need a cup first thing, and your room is in the farthest-away  tower from the casino.   The fact that I needed to get up, walk all the way to the elevator (long walk), then go downstairs to another hall, then to the lobby, across the lobby and then through the casino and up the escalator stairs to the shopping area to get a cup of coffee was frustrating to say the least.

The two other towers were the Palazzo (higher end shops in that one) and the Venetian (canal, gondola rides). The casinos smelled better than in most hotels on the strip. All of the decor was nice. The walk to the meeting rooms from Venezia was very long, but at least the check in lady warned me, so I didn't mind. The restaurants are overpriced, but that's everywhere on the strip. The shops are the same I can find at home, so I wasn't excited about them. 

The main pool complex needs more shade in my opinion. I strongly disliked the Azure and Tao private pools' booming sound systems - I can't imagine relaxing in either, though the music itself was good enough. I hated the Azure gimmick of saying you had a free admission with a pass, but not telling you that just to sit down inside, there's a $100 minimum drink order. ($400 for daybeds) They don't even allow outside water bottles, though I imagine that's because some folks smuggle booze that way. I found the attitude over the top and decided not to go in. I've seen the photos on the web, and the pool doesn't look like anything special. Based on overhearing others, I think they jack the drink prices up a TON - like $250 for a bottle of champagne.  That sounds high to me, but I don't drink alcohol, so what do I know. Not my scene.",0,1,0

The down side of our stay was with the security of our stay. This is very important considering 4 ladies were staying there at the time. At approximately 2am our room was rummaged through and robbed. We reported the incident to the front desk, who then transferred us to the security department. In waiting for someone to come and take an incident report, a strange man entered the room again. This stranger saw me and left. In a panic we watched him stroll down the hall, and take up a conversation with acquaintances. Security took over 20 minutes to come to our room, discouraged us from making a report, was rude and demeaning, and not prepared with the specifics to file a report. Management would not speak to us personally, and disregarded our claim, saying that it ""was out of their hands"" since it was passed to security. after the return of our visit, we took the following actions- 
(1) I called the Director of Security yesterday, and left a message. 7:45 am
(2) I decided to wait it out for the 1st business day of the week, and follow up today 8:00 am...
We were told to follow up with Risk management. 
(3) I was then passed me onto, Bill Parker- Director of Claims. I spoke with a woman named, Amanda 8:10 am who then told me that this was not handled in their department, and asked me to call Guest Relations. 
(4) I then spoke with the coordinator of Guest Relations, Janet 8:12 am. She is now telling me that her department usually deals with ""guest satisfaction"", but graciously agreed to be my point of contact at the current moment.

So in conclusion, I was supposed to hear back from this woman by that Thursday, to give her a chance to gather the information, in which I never did. She did inform me however, that normally her department deals with ""situation of quality of room, etc."" We did not hear back from the hotel, or ever receive copies of the reports filed.

Anyway, onward with the review.

The suites are very luxurious and I can't find much to complain about, other than the bathtub being slightly too small and the toilet area being a little bit creepy (it's very small and there's a mirror inside). The suite is divided into a living room portion and a bedroom portion, both of which are equipped with LCD TVs for your entertainment. The living room area has a huge couch, coffee table, and dining table for you and your guests to drink and chat over. In the interest of time, we had two of our meals there and amused ourselves by drinking bottled water out of fancy wine glasses. Classy. My only other complaint is that the overall layout of it is a bit nonsensical to me, as the bedroom is located closer to the entrance while the living room is in the back. 

The service and staff are top-notch. I had two major issues during my stay here (neither of which are the hotel's fault) and they were quickly resolved. Issue #1: The suite they initially gave us smelled like weed. I called the front desk and they immediately moved me to a new room. Issue #2: Drunken woman mistakenly tries to enter my room at 4:00am. She bangs on the door when the key doesn't work and wakes me up. I call security and she is escorted back to her room down the hall. They are very professional and very respectful toward their patrons. I would recommend this place to anyone if they don't mind walking a bit to get to the hotspots on the strip.

*update*
After staying at a few other places and paying similar prices, I've decided to upgrade this place to 5-star based on the value. No reason why I should pay $100 per night for a hotel room when $50 more can get me a luxurious suite.",0,0,1

Have stayed previously at the Paris and Planet Hollywood. Because we were celebrating our anniversary we decided to scale it up and stay at the Venetian. Upon entering our room we were pleasantly pleased with the nice finishing touches of our King Suite. However, inspecting the bathroom we noticed a large clump of used toilet paper stuck to the door jamb of the commode room about 18 inches off the floor. It was dried in place. Odd and gross but I let it go as an unfortunate miss by the cleaning staff. Bed was comfy as expected but the mattress was strangely askew which was a simple adjustment. No big deal really. 

Next morning I decided to take a soak in the tub. Not the norm for me but I was at the Venetian after all. When I turned the water on I noticed there were probably 5-7 hairs in the tub that I rinsed out. Again, far from the end of the world and I could have maybe overlooked but things are beginning to accrue.

So we depart for a long day on the strip. Saw the Chris Angel show and it was great. Had a leisurely buffet at the Monte Carlo. Light crowd and very relaxing. Anyway, we did a lot of walking, talking and seeing the sites and with heavy eyes arrived back to our room at about midnight. 

As soon as we entered the room we discovered room service never even came. Our morning towels still on the floor in the bathroom, bed the way we left and the remnants of that crusty toilet paper was still in place. Not even my overnight stays at a two star motel in lesser known parts of the country have ever forgotten room service. 

At that point I did call room service to make sure I didn't miss something in the Las Vegas hotel industry standards about room service. I'm being serious here. I'm thinking maybe some new environmental law took hold on the strip and room service is by request only...seemed like a rational possibility although I wasn't made aware of it at check-in. The front desk did assure me that my room should have been serviced and they offered to either send a cleaning crew right away or send towels.

I just opted for some clean towels as it would seem odd to watch people clean my room at midnight when  we'd like to just crawl in bed and sleep. 

I was told the front desk manager would be told but not given any reassurance beyond that. I thought about really looking around my room a little closer for other anomalies before going to sleep but decided to report this instead. Maybe someone in charge will make this right in the morning when regular staff are here. I will update. 

So two stars for the culmination of everything. I know personally from running my own business for 13 years that expectations and how a company follows through to meet those expectations makes the difference between average, outstanding or sub par. Considering the relative high cost of the Venetian my expectations were not met compared to other hotels I've stayed at on the strip. My star rating may change (up or down) depending on how they address the problem in the morning as I am booked here for another night.",7,3,1

Coming from California...we are spoiled with no smoking indoors policy. Too bad the casinos in vegas haven't followed suit.  I'd definitely gamble more w\/o the 2nd hand smoke.  Called Housekeeping before I left to gamble to clean my room.  I come back up 3 hours later and the housekeeping staff just started to clean my room.  No point in calling them...but if you don't they may skip your room altogether...it has happened to me before that is why I always call and hope they can come when I'm not in the room.  This is on a Monday...one would think they are not that busy on a weekday. When I checked in on Sunday the guy at the front desk told me I can have late check out till 2pm.  Of course..me having bad experiences in the pas.....I called to verify if I did have late check out on my departure day.  Lo and behold they said they have nothing on the computer for late check out.  They said if you want late check out you would have to pay like $50 extra.  After explaining to them what I was told during the check in process they compromised and let me stay till 1pm.  So I went down to the casino to gamble a bit...and won $745 on slots.  I would have loved to play more but I had to check out by 1pm.  So...in hindsight this may have been a blessing for me because I could have lost the $745 in slots had I continued to play.  So it all worked out in the end.  :) Also paid about $40 in resort fees.  Which I don't mind since I do use the internet alot.  The connection of the WiFi is fast...there is no need to pay for an even faster connection.

Amazing!!
We have never stayed in such luxury, very quiet rooms very clean rooms and very very nice hotel all around..
The rooms are spacious and comfortable with a shower serrate from the tub which to me is very nice so if you just want to relax and take a soak while you partner wants to shower so it works out very nice.
This place is so big we haven't seen all of the property believe it's a definiate must at least stop by and check it out for yourself even if your not staying here as a guest.
Something like 40 restaurants and shops yes you can go shopping while staying here with never ever leaving the building.
Pools I am not sure but like maybe I think 10 or 11? Now I could be off by a few so I might be wrong but dang... It's beautiful all around..
The staff are very very helpful especially for first time guests like we were...
I really cannot say anything bad about this property ok just one small little thing Lol... In the casino people can smoke.. Lol I know it's a casino but if your used to being in places with no one smoking then walk into a place they can it's kinda like a shock but not a real deal breaker I don't gamble so I just avoided that area all together..
Definitely will make a return trip...
 it's worth many more....

We had a group of 12 that fit comfortably in two suites. They were bigger than my apartment (Sad, I know) and super clean. I'm a hotel room clean freak and if there's a stray hair in the shower or a masked cigarette burn in the wall paper, I'll find it. Nothing, although the doorknob in the bathroom got pulled off and popped back in a couple times over the weekend.

Housekeeping will come back once an hour, every hour until you're ready for them. They'll clean with you in there too but we turned that down. And they were right there with extra towels for a room full of showering girls.

The beds. Oh the beds. They might be the most comfortable things that ever happened. I came home and thought of what I needed to buy to make my own bed feel that good. Crisp, cool cotton sheets, down pillows and the fluffiest, lightest duvet I've ever felt. We found it impossible to lay down on those beds, even when we were totally awake and just waiting for someone to finish getting ready, to stay awake! They put you to sleep!

My husband and I had never been to Vegas before and decided to go here for part of our honeymoon.  The Venetian was one of a few of the hotels suggested to us by our travel agent.  After asking around family and friends we decided to stay at the Venetian and it was one of the best decisions we made. 

When we arrived the check in was quick and efficient, though I felt like the front desk staff acted as though we were looking for freebies when we mentioned that we were here celebrating our honeymoon (even though they asked our reason for visiting).  At that point I was less than pleased.  I know that Vegas is a big place for quicky marriages, but we weren't looking for anything just sharing our experience. 

Once we were done with check in things started looking up.  The hotel and casino are visually stunning and a pleasure to walk through.  I don't know if it is just that we were in a desirable location, but I didn't find the hotel or casino too difficult to navigate as is mentioned in other reviews.  Yes it was big and took a bit of walking to get around, but it was fun. 

As we were walking to the elevators we passed by the Grand Lux Cafe (which every staff member mentioned a million times, but is a good option if you don't feel like going out) and then we reached the Bouchon Bakery Kiosk.  I was in heaven!  First order of business order macarons. 

Then the hotel room...Stunning.  We had a room on the 33 floor that overlooked a golf course and though it was not a strip view it proved to be even better on the fourth of July when we were able to watch 18 firework shows at once from the privacy of our room. 

The bathroom was spacious and though we didn't take advantage of the tub, the shower was very nice with good water pressure. 

The bed was wonderful and very comfortable for a hotel bed.  

I have said it many times while staying here and afterwards that when we return to Vegas we will definitely stay at the Venetian.",3,0,0

My admin booked a suite at the Venetian, where I have never stayed before.   It was mid morning, and there were two attendants at the check-in counter, not counting the Japanese only section at the end of the counter.  There were only 4 people, me included standing in line to check in.  I waited for what seemed like hours!!  In reality, it was only about 30 minutes, but come on! this wait took forever, and nobody seemed to be in any kind of hurry at all.  Once I did get to check-in, the attendant was very nice, and processed my transaction very smoothly.  I can't figure out what the long wait was all about.  The other people trying to check- out were really getting ticked off.   
One more thing about the Venetian... bring a compass, gps, bread crumbs, or something.   The signage and floor number system is completely worthless!   Everyone I met in the hallways was vainly searching for their rooms!!  Its apparently so bad that they hired people to help with directions, but they were more lost than I was!

My organization's annual convention was in Las Vegas, and most of our activity centered in The Venetian.  I was lucky enough to have a hotel room here too.  This was quite possibly one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in.  It was huge, with a separate ""sunken"" living room complete with a couch that could seat 6-8 people comfortably.  There was also a huge flat screen TV.  In the ""bedroom,"" I scored a king size bed that was comfortable, with cozy linens.  Another flat screen TV hung on the wall so I could watch from bed.  The bathroom was marbelous (yes, I meant marbelous) splendor with a soaking tub and separate shower.  One more flat screen TV in the bathroom completed a trio for the room.

All in all, this room itself made for an exceptional stay.  Being sick for a good portion of my time in Vegas, I really appreciated the comfort that the room provided.  However, I haven't even mentioned the amenities or the staff.  Both which were top notch.  I was greeted by every staff member I passed.  Often, I was asked how my day was or how my stay has been.  The amenties were plentiful and the pool was fabulous.  Wish I had the time to take advantage of that, but I was working.  Check in and check out were both a pleasant process - quick and efficient.

I'm not a huge gambler, but the casino was clean and bright, and if people were smoking, you sure couldn't tell.  Then, there's the shopping and dining.  The Venetian boasts all kinds of high end shops and world reknowned restaurants.  If you don't lose your wallet in the casino, there's a good chance you'll lose it in one of these establishments instead!

My only complaint is that there isn't access to any kind of drug store for necessities.  Sure they had the little stand selling asprin for $4.49 for one of those little packets, but if one has the need for a full service drug store, they're walking to the Walgreens - 25 minutes down the strip.

We arrived at 12:45 pm, clearly too early for check in - so the concierge temporarily held our bags until a room would be available, and said they'd call us when one was ready. **The next time we go this route, we're going to leave more than one contact number; at 4:30 pm, when we didn't hear back from them, we walked back over to the concierge to see what the issue was - apparently they'd tried the phone number we'd left, but weren't able to get a hold of us.

No matter, we get our keys and head up to our room - gorgeous suite! 1100 square feet, 5 girls, 2 queen beds and 1 couch in the living room; our room comfortably fit all of us. Lots of lighting, by the beds, in the foyer, by the mirrors and several dedicated areas for girls to get primped before going out for the evening! With dual sinks, a tub, a seamless glass shower, and a vanity, we had plenty of room for applying makeup, doing hair and soaking of feet. 

Small nuances
- This may have just been our suite but the front double doors would not shut perfectly, so everytime we left or reentered, we literally had to slam the door. This offered little to no elegance to the Venetian's atmosphere, especially when it felt like we were disrupting our entire floor by announcing our departure and arrival. 

- Our suite was not fully stocked when we arrived. As we were already scrambling to get ready on our first night out, some of us raced into the bathroom only to find out we had no shampoo, facial soap or enough towels to accommodate us all. 

- We did not have a 'please do not disturb\/cleaning service' sign....really? Aren't these little suckers standard? Well, without ours, the cleaning service barged in on our naps and sleeping in, two days in a row. Venetian, please put these on every door! We like them! We use them!

I have stayed in several hotels in vegas and the venetian has become my favorite after my stay during this past summer. It was the week of EDC so the hotel was packed full of crazy people but I guess that's what added to the fun of this experience. My boyfriend and I came here with a group of friends not for EDC but just for the fun of vegas. 

Our room was amazing! We got placed on the 38th floor and I loved how the security personnel checks your key card before you're able to go up the elevators. It made me feel safe in a weird way haha. The first thing I saw when we opened our double doors was a baby grand piano, say whaaaat? Not only was there a giant piano in our living room but we also had a humongous I'd like to say 50-60 inch flat screen in the main room. There was a full dining table that seated 8 and our room came with a fridge, and a wine cooler. For the rooms we had 2 full king-size bedrooms each with walk in closets. Each room also had a 4 person jacuzzi hot tub, a stand up shower that had 2 shower heads with a gigantic bench inside it (I'm guessing it's meant for more than one person? lol) an in suite gym, and a dressing room with mirrors all around. We had 2 full bathrooms and one 1\/2 of a bathroom. We had a fantastic view of the strip and the water show. We had some fun watching the people splash around obnoxiously down at TAO's pool party too. The bed's were so comfy that I had a hard time getting out of bed. 

For the three nights we stayed at the venetian we found the service to be exceptional and by the push of a button we had a bell hop or hotel worker at our door within minutes. Room service was okay, though it's not quite up to par for the price they charge you. The casino's were awesome and I ended up winning $200 the first night woo! The venetian also has a little mall connected to it that's fun to shop. Most major designers (Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci, Ferragamo, Prada etc..) are available for your interest. There is a food court in the mall that kind of sucks but that isn't the venetian's fault. I recommend eating outside the hotel if you want good food. Come on, I mean, you ARE in vegas!!

The Bella suites are a good size, enough for 6 girls to sleep comfortable and I love the drop down living room area. The room was super clean and we got a nice view of the pool.  The bathroom was huge, with enough mirrors for 6 girls to get ready comfortably.  The bed was very comfortable and the service pretty quick. We ordered extra towels and blackets and they were delivered within 15 minutes.  Our suite was equipped with two big flate screen TV's one in the sleeping area, then one in the living room area. The only negative I would say is the fridge situation. It was fully stocked and you had to pay money if you wanted to move anyting in there to keep your own personal drinks cold.
The location of this hotel is perfect! Near walking distrance to restuarants, clubs, shopping. You really don't even have to leave the hotel, the Casino is pretty steep but it's Vegas.
I also visited he fitness center, which I may add was pretty impressive! It's bigger than som of the gyms I've been to. Fully stocked with cardio, weights, free weights, pretty much anything you can think of. There is even a rock climbing wall but you need assistance to use it. The locker rooms are stocked with fresh fruite, and flavored water. 
The pool area is huge, you must go early to reserve a chair though, it was difficulty to find 6 free chairs for the girls but we made due and checked out Tao Beach Club.  Overall, I would stay here again, especially I fyou have a bigger group because the suites are perfect!",0,0,1

You gotta admire the thought, the effort, the imagination, the design and the roominess in their suites. 

Quite painful to reserve it (chi-chiiiiing), but with 4 people, with an advanced booking, it's not a bad stay for an interesting weekend in LV.

I didn't like the help-desk people, (no-smiles; stinky faces) and I hated the fact that the bella-suites (2 queens) didn't have fridges! THOUGHT#1: ""if you consider yourself a 4+ star hotel and have pretty high prices have a freaking fridge in the freaking suites"" !

Back to the review. I loved their bathroom\/restrooms, I loved the view towards the small pool on the Venezia Lobby-floor. 

The corridors are pretty fun to run, to jump and take pictures. There are some psychotic security guards, who see a girl (me), dressed up from head to toe, and checks for my key in case I was an ""intruder"" (logic=0, with some people). 

I loved their shoppe area, the fake sky is something to admire, once you step into that place, you lose your sense of time, regardless is 9:00am or 3:00am it's still blue and ""naturally"" fake.

The casino: uninspiring, the TAO; had better, restaurants: overpriced but good quality (refer to the specific upcoming reviews)

The Venezia Lobby- Pool area is quite relaxing. You would see some families with their noisy kids, THOUGHT #2: ""why would you come with your family to LV? Very puzzling to me"" Other than that it was the best chillaxing area.

The pool gets warm from the weather, there were some annoying people who thought that they owned the pool and they took over the place, but me and my friends managed to take back some parts of it. 

Not a bad choice to stay, but I'm considering on my second visit to LV the Palazzo instead.

The shops between the Palazzo and here are also very nice to walk through - the gondolas are fun to listen to and watch. I will say that the court yard at the end of the shops is a good representation of the courtyard that is in Venice where Lavena is. Just here they won't charge you to sit and enjoy the music. 

If you can stay here it's worth it just to walk into the lobby and walk through the shops, also the Venetian theater is gorgous, if they have a show in there DEFINITELY see a show there!

I have stayed at other hotels in Las Vegas multiple times and I have to say, I think Venetian is ranked top 3 in my preference of hotels. Also their room service food is actually REALLY REALLY good. 

I felt like at the other hotels on the strip, all their food was quite on the salty side. But the room service at the Venetian was the same as if I ordered at a 5 star restaurant. The interior of the hotel is a little outdated in terms of style but I liked the ""timeless-ness"" of decor that made me really appreciate the OLD VEGAS. 

Also this hotel casino was way lit up, it felt clean and bright. Other casinos are so smokey, dark, and grungy in a way, but at the venetian casino, it felt more luxurious and neat. I definitely recommend Venetian for your stays in Vegas. I can't wait to come back here!",5,1,3

I used to stay at the other end of the strip closer to MGM...but ever since my first stay at the Venetian, its my Las Vegas home!  I love love love the rooms, but only the rooms in the Venetian tower.  I do not like the Venezia tower at all!  It's like a maze inside the Venezia tower.  The Venetian tower is laid out much better and is easy to access your room, especially after having quite a few drinks (hint hint)!  The beds are so comfortable and the remote control for the shades are awesome. 

Sign up for the Grazie card...that's my number one tip for y'all!  I visit Vegas quite a few times a year and I always have my rooms at Venetian or Palazzo comped.  My last trip was for my birthday weekend and Club Grazie provided my room, slot credit, and gift basket for free. 

There are 2 places that I always end up eating when I stay at Venetian...Grand Lux and the Noodle House.  Tip for the Grand Lux when eating breakfast, go for the express breakfast buffet. It's worth it since it includes all your drinks.  I made the mistake of eating at Grand Lux for breakfast without the express breakfast and the drinks alone were so expensive (i.e. orange juice and coffee, etc) that it makes it more economical to just get the buffet, which includes made to order omlettes.  The Noodle House is next to the sports book and is good for an informal, fast meal...try to the wonton soup!  It's excellent!

First the rooms arent sound proof, expect to hear screaming children at 4am in adjacent suites, generator noise from outside your windows, noise from clubs, guests above you walking.  

Second the staff arent very accommodating for room changes or addressing the noise issue.  Most hotels will do room change regardless of time of day.  I was told to wait till morning and the staff seemed okay with the family next door's children run up and down the hallway and scream.  

Third, most places treat Amex holders well, this place treats you like a nuisance.  Amex Plat holders using FHR are supposed to get free upgrades, but when you arrive for check in, they ask if you want to pay for an upgrade avoiding any mention of the amex upgrade, but get a bit unsettled when you mention the amex upgrade.  The free breakfast for amex customers is a costco pastry and coffee that must only be done through room service.  The comp dinner or lunch is restricted to one restauran(bistro pinot)t, and its limited to a set meal for amex holders with limited selection.  Would have taken even a 20 dollar credit that could be used at say Bouchon or B&B. Other hotels will offer a generous dining or spa credit, comp champagne, etc.  

Fourth, this is supposed to be a luxurious hotel, yes its beautiful and the rooms look great at a quick glance,but upon closer inspection its obvious that an accountant runs this place.  Everything from the cheap chinese brand toiletries(not even hotels in china would use), Aomni brand TVs, lack of sound proofing, blow dryer without a cool button(what is this 1989?), to mushy beds(I actually slept on the couch and its quite comfortable) shows they care very little about making your stay great.

I spend about 10 days a year in vegas every year for work for the last 6 years and I never had any complaints about any other hotel.  There are much better options nearby, like the Wynn, the newly renovated rooms at the Mirage, Encore, Aria, Cosmopolitan, Caesars.

The are some positives, they have great restaurants, Carnevino, B&B and good shopping at Barneys well by Las Vegas standards anyway.",0,0,0

For breakfast or lunch, the coffee shop restaurant on the casino floor was excellent-- huevos rancheros, bagels and lox, Joe's special, burgers, salads, pasta.. all so good and excellent service.
Complaint:  Our suite's bathroom was gorgeous-- but the marble floor and marble shower floor were super slippery when wet!! The shower could use a grab bar. Also, some of the shops that rent space in the Grand Canal shopping area were SUPER PUSHY and obnoxious, worse than used car salesmen!

The beds were super comfy but the pillows a tad on the soft side. 

The hotel has many pools and they were all great and really clean. It's super easy to get chairs (and we needed 4). The waitress service at the pools was awesome (Amanda was the best of them all). They were super friendly and were on top of things making sure we always had what we needed. And they always had more than enough towels at the ready. We even used the indoor showers at the Palazzo pool on our last day before heading to the airport. My only suggestion would be for them to offer some shampoo\/conditioner\/soap in those showers. Thankfully we thought ahead and brought our own.

ROOMS
The hotel remains the most classically elegant in Vegas with incredible ceiling frescoes, but the rooms are showing their age. Main dislike is the suite tower layout, which is confounding labyrinthine and quite easy to get lost in. Suites are very spacious and well laid-out. Had a room facing the inner courtyard and pool, which was nice and quiet. Didn't care for the bathroom toiletries at al.

SERVICE
Room service is spotty - was flawless on day 1 but then arrived 30-minutes late the following morning, not really acceptable.

DINING
Delmonico is one of my favorite steakhouses in Vegas.
Bouchon (Thomas Keller) features fantastic brunch offerings and also good for dinner. Bouchon Bakery has amazing pastries.
Noodle Asia offers casual, surprisingly authentic Chinese cuisine.
Espressamente Illy - love Illy! Espresso affogato is divine.

If you want to know more: I was excited to stay at the Venetian on our last trip to Vegas, as on another visit a couple of years ago I had been impressed with the hotel's beauty. (Note to some Yelpers who have commented how pathetic an imitation of Venice the Venetian is--no duh! Did you actually expect it *would* be in any way comparable to the real thing? For Vegas--that is, over-the-top and flashy--I think the Venetian is generally lovely and opulent. Anyone who thinks it will compare to Venezia, Italy, however, is going to be sorely disappointed.)

Anyway, the rooms are huge and generally comfortable, although the bed is nothing special, and I even thought the sheets were a bit rough--certainly not 5-star quality. The pillows, too, were sub-par, even a bit on the hard side.

The bathroom was what my husband and I appreciated the most; it was pretty (prettier than the room, frankly, whose decor was nothing special), and while the toiletries were not luxurious, they did have a wonderful scent akin to orange pekoe tea. That might not be to everyone's taste, but I loved it.

I noted many comments by other Yelpers about bad service, but all staff we encountered were nice and helpful. The women working in the business center, which we visited twice to check email and print driving directions for the next part of our trip, were especially helpful and very sweet.

The only service problem occurred when one woman at the front desk directed us to the wrong place--and I mean WAY in the wrong direction--to catch the airport shuttle the morning we left, which I thought would have been pretty basic knowledge for anyone at the front desk to have. Fortunately, we were only going to the airport to pick up a rental car for the next leg of our trip, so missing the shuttle was not a disaster, and we got a taxi. (FYI if you're trying to save money on taxis--their airport shuttle runs only once an hour, on the hour.)

What we both disliked about the Venetian was feeling nickled and dimed at every turn. Call  me naive--or cheap, even!--but $35 A DAY to work out in the fitness center? Yes, I know it's Canyon Ranch, but I just wanted to use a treadmill for 30-45 minutes. I could see paying something--though not $35--for a fitness class, maybe, but I thought guests could generally use the standard equipment in hotel gyms for free. So, my husband and I just burned calories walking down the Strip and sweating them off (literally!). 

Room service was also stratospherically priced, and I have been fortunate enough to have room service in other 5-star hotels not only here but in Europe. I think room service in the real Venice might actually have been slightly cheaper, but if not, the food would certainly have been better. My husband's lamb chops cost $42, and he said they were good but not great. My bowl of minestrone was so salty it could have been Campbell's. (At least it cost only $8.) We were also charged several dollars for my pitcher of TAP water. (No, ""TAP"" is not the latest luxury H2O brand.) The cheesecake we split was good, however, as was my husband's glass of Merlot. I'll just say that the total room service bill, NOT including the extra tip we gave, cost more than the two nights' accommodation, including breakfast, we paid for later in the week for a simple but perfectly nice motel in southern Utah. Yes, I know it was the Venetian, but that's why the quality of the food should have been in line with the prices.

As others here have noted, they do try to pressure you to upgrade to a larger, more expensive suite upon check-in, but I didn't think the woman who was checking us in overdid it. I politely made it clear we were fine with what we'd booked, and she left it at that.

Bouchon, their Thomas Keller restaurant, was a big disappointment (check out my review if you're interested), but their Grand Lux Cafe was reasonably priced and had pretty good food and friendly service. We had both breakfast and dinner there one day.

At least one Yelper commented unfavorably on the large number of kids. I concur. If you are going to bring children, why the Venetian? Try Circus Circus or someplace else kids will enjoy (and where you won't blow your family's monthly food budget on one night's room service). While I did not see any kids behaving badly, I could hear some children shouting in their rooms--the walls are pretty thin--and in the hallways. Since I doubt the average American parent is going to teach his or her children good manners anytime soon, that's one more thing you may want to take into consideration if you're thinking of staying at the Venetian.",1,0,0

I started my day by going to Tao Beach, and to find it completely over crowded, I left and chilled at the pool outside in the Venetian. I ordered a drink because I wasn't exactly staying there, I was there strictly for the Tao Beach event. I wanted to pay back the Sands for atleast letting us into their pool area. The drink costs $9 each and they do have bartenders walking by taking your orders. 

I found a nice spot right infront of the Tao Beach line and was able to get a good tan before heading in again later. The water in the pool was definitely clean. The life guards were spot on. As soon as some moron attempted to bring a drink in, they would blow a whistle and call fouls on them. I thought this was smart on their part to keep the water clean.

In the evenings I had give the boat sailors some props for giving gandola rides at like 4 am to drunks and families of 4 obese children. The employees there were still hard at work at all hours of the night. All of the restaurants closed up by midnight, but the food court was still an option for all your late night munchies.  I give this place 5 stars for the setup and the amazing friendly environment they have provided to a non-guest. I will definitely consider staying in one of my future trips and compare it to the Wynn.",1,0,1

When it comes to the higher end hotels on the Las Vegas Strip this one is at the top of my list. The suites come with a bedroom section that has it's own television and a feeling of privacy from the sunken living room. 

The living room has a flat screen television along with a nice table to get that ""work you promised your boss"" you would do while on the road. The couch is a huge sectional and pretty comfortable for your ""club randoms"" to crash on at night. Great huge bathroom and an overall quality in your suite will leave you sleeping fantastically every night.

My female friend was very disappointed that in November the pool was pretty much cast in shadows all day which really seems like a design error. Clearly the pool area was designed by men if they didn't think woman would want to bask in the sun all day. 

Another bonus is your attached to the Palazzo Hotel which has some great dining\/shopping options. It also doubles your indoor gambling space without having to endure the evil Vegas sun. If you are brave enough to walk outside you have a pretty central location on the Strip making it a quick stumble to anywhere you really want to get or a cheap cab. 

Bring some cash if your going to gamble at the Venetian since you will run into some of the higher staked tables on the Strip as well. Parking structure is always crowded but the amount of security leaves me feeling better about leaving the car inside the deck than most places.

The best kept secret at  the Venetian is the Grand Lux Cafe. It is the best valued place to eat on the Strip if you want good food at less than $15 a plate, here is my review: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-6#hrid:jzPqiv5JxNLjVhJB7sJCKg",1,1,0

Everything is decorated with gold accents around the hotel, and the gondola area is reminiscent of Venice as well as the frescoes on the lobby ceiling.

I wasn't overly impressed with the service or the atmosphere of the rest of the hotel. It was opulent and elegant, but was just missing something.  Upon check in, we walked aimlessly around the casino searching for the guest elevators because this place is so huge. Some direction would have been nice. Our luggage was brought to our room quickly and the bellman gave us restaurant recommendations which was nice.  It was March Madness, but the hotel was packed and smokey like all of the others, so maybe that's my problem.

Saturday and Sunday at the pools was a nightmare.  Getting to and leaving them was even worse.  The entire area of several pools and patios, which is massive if you include the pool area near the Palazzo, was crammed with 20-somethings, many (far too many) of whom, for whatever reason, couldn't act any older than 13.  The fact that there were NO UMBRELLAS anywhere on any of the patios forced all of them into the pools, with drinks in hand or on the side of the pool.  (Hint to Management:  Buy some umbrellas!!!).  Poolside profanity was common.  Sitting on the steps so that no one could get in or out was a...well you get the picture.  Pathways to the elevators, not to mention riding in the elevators, just added to their idea of fun and games (and more profanity).  It reminded me of the videos I've seen about Spring Break in Florida. Zero out of 5 stars.

By Monday, however, civilization returned.  An older (translated more mature) presence was obvious throughout.  Ahhhh.......

We were told that sometime ago the Venetian started marketing to younger demographics.  We were also told that by Sunday night the average age would start to go back up.  Given the constant booming and pounding of hip-hop Saturday and Sunday, followed by the mass exodus sometime over Sunday night\/Monday morning, and the resulting calm, it is possible that both could be true.

Our room was fantastic...well-appointed and spacious.  We had room-service breakfast once and it exceeded our expectations.  Staff was polite and very accessible.  Food at the local restaurants was good but very pricey (except the Venetian Cafe Lux, which was good and reasonable).  Lots of families and an older crowd throughout, but who's to know if they were actually staying there. Four out of five stars.

It seems that the Venetian has turned into a party hotel.  That's a shame.  This results, in my mind, to an overall rating of 2 out of 5 stars.",1,1,0

Our view was of the lower roof of the Venetian and surrounding inner walls of the hotel. So ugly. The suite itself looks like the Bella Suite, but with a lot more floor space. Whoever designed it did a poor job as I felt like the space could've been utilized better; for example, adding a second toilet\/bathroom. The room also seemed kind of dark, old, and outdated.

The rooms here used to sleep 7 comfortably (two queens & 3-person sofa bed), but they switched out the L-shape sofa bed with a regular 2-person sofa bed. Lame.

The rooms were super spacious considering we had 9 nine girls. There were more TV's in that one suite than in my house...

I never once was told about the perks and benefits during my stay at the hotel. I ended up paying full price for certain attractions, that with a free membership I could have received $ off. Housekeeping was just awful. My husband and I spent two days with our ""do not disturb"" sign up as we didn't need freshening up. But our room was dirty (especially the bathroom) from check in. We looked past it and carried on. I have never had a bad review to leave at any hotel but this really bothered me considering the price. On day three I called housekeeping at 9:30am with two requests. One fresh towels, and two a sheet change. As I've worked in the hospitality industry before I fully understand standards and commitment to guest satisfaction and was blown away when housekeeping did not arrive at our room for five hours when we were told twenty minutes, even after a couple phone calls. The best part is when someone did arrive sheets were thrown on our bed and she left us to make our own bed!? I have never once in my entire life have had to strip a bed at a hotel and re-make it myself. This was shocking and unfortunate. I also ordered custom items from the Venetian shop for my Husbands birthday and spent almost $200 just to find out the day of it wasn't available and something else was offered that wasn't of much interest. I did go with it because I had no time to plan anything different. 
Maybe because we were in a basic room we weren't considered VIP guests we were left to fend for ourselves but you would think a high callibur hotel with a great reputation would try and make the best impression possible. I am extremely disappointed in this place.",1,0,0

I was impressed by the artworks on the ceiling and sculpted fountains, but once I saw their hotel rooms, I felt like I was in heaven. I've experienced Rio, Flamingo, South Pole, Treasure Island, Wynn, Caesar's Palace, and so on, but nothing could compare to Venetian. A one night room is about $300 for 2 queen beds (can't imagine more than one day price), but I guarantee it's worth the money. The Venetian Gondolas is unimaginably beautiful because of the sky-painted ceilings, designs for the shops, floors, and walkway, but especially the mini canal that goes around the place. 

To ride on a boat in the canal, it costs $80 for FOUR people. While you're on the boat, the person rowing it would (from my experience) sing for you.

I assume any room has this, but I'm not 100% sure:
There's 3 TVs (bathroom, bedroom, and living room), a shower and bath (if you want, you can ask for a room with a jacuzzi), a living room containing couches, a work desk, a table near the window, heater\/AC, iron, robe, hairdryer, and a fridge.
There's a container with sex materials on the drawer, under the living room tv, above the fridge.

Caution: like any hotel, whatever you drink, eat, or use for sex from the room costs money, excluding anything in the bathroom. 

FIJI WATER = $4  

MOVIES = $18, but there is $6.99 movies

There's wifi in your room! Just use the last name you registered the room with (ex. if your registered name is Sam Smith, put Smith) and your hotel room's number (ex. if your room is on level 23 and number is 210, put 23210)

P.S. You need to ask for ice AND if you get a room with a radio, the radio is for iPods and anything that's not iPhone 5, 6, and above. I'm sure Samsungs won't work either D:

Things you need to know:

-Sign up for their email promotions (I booked a suite for $109 a night)
-Ask for free room upgrades during slow seasons.  You can get upgrade to their Venezia tower which is the concierge tower.  They will do turn down service and leave cute chocolates on your pillow every night.  Leave a note asking for extra chocolates, they are da BOMB!
-Pool get's crowded, get down there the moment the sun comes up. 
-You get into Tao free for ladies and $10 for guys if you call concierge and put your name on guestlist before 7pm.

If you have an issue they will not do anything to help you. My boyfriend and I rented a moped to get around. We leave the moped in motorcycle parking for about 3 hours while in our room and guess what we found when we returned?? A stolen moped. The hotel has no cameras in the parking garage to make it even better. The motorcycle parking is on the first level right by the entrance where cars are constantly coming back and forth and no one even saw anything. Unbelievable if you ask me. That was our last night and they didn't offer to compensate us in anyway. They claimed that we had to call risk management in order to be compensated. We call them and they say they can't compensate us and that's just what the hotel tells people. So we end up losing our deposit on the moped rental, missing reservations, and coming out of extra money because we know had to take a taxi if we wanted to get around. People spending all there money in a hotel and get nothing in return when we get a motor vehicle stolen which is a felony. They want to hold no responsibility for things that happen on their property. I would hate to what to know if it was our car that got stolen if say we drove from California or another surrounding state. We'd just be out of luck car less with no way to get back home. Oh and there security on site(Cory) was horrible and a liar. Cory told us the police wouldn't even come to the hotel and that we'd have to go there. So of course we waste time and attempt to go to the police department only to find they were closed. So we ended up still calling 311 and had two officers come out(even though we had to wait several more hours for them to show). Now remember Cory said he knew for a fact that the police wouldn't show up because it's the hotel. When in reality they probably just didn't want the police to show up and make their precious hotel look bad. This hotel is just out for money like many others I'm sure. I'll never stay here again especially if it's costing me money. Also Jonathan, the front desk hotel manager was another name I remember who was no help at all.

I did not stay at The Venetian so this review is just on the experience of strolling through it. The Venetian is among the classiest strolls you can take in Las Vegas.To me it does not seem tacky like some of the other themed hotels. The gondolas are really cool and have singing gondoliers. Next time I would actually like to take a ride! Perhaps my favorite thing were the Carnavale performers. They can sing really well and are accompanied by other sorts of performers like jugglers!!!! Truly memorable!!!! They perform in a plaza next to the gondolas which gets packed.

Other great aspects of The Venetian is the fact there is a great deal of variety in the food court and that the guest elevators are close to the parking lot. Best of all, it is hooked up to three fabulous malls!!!!",16,12,14

Their service is horrible. Their manager Manuel and Sherry have no class what so ever!! Their front desk woman Tasha is extremely rude. This hotel is possibly the worst hotel in Vegas. Also, my child broke a lamp and got hurt and we were forced to pay the charges. Their security guard, Michael, claimed that my son threw a pillow at the lamp and it broke, but that is not what happened. My son got up from the bed and the lamp was too close and he hit it by ACCIDENT and he got a large cut on his arm. Michael, the security guard investigating, reported that my son threw a pillow at the lamp and we were forced to pay, but I disputed the charges. Also, their rooms are the dirtiest yet. When we first walked into the room there was a moth flying around, and the room was also very filthy at the time. On Friday night, we requested to have the room cleaned while we went shopping for three hours. When we came back, the room was still filthy and uncleaned. Overall, this hotel is the worst to ever exist, and I recommend to not stay and spend your money on this hotel because it is a piece of garbage. This isn't It worth spending your money because your overall expense will come up to at least five thousand dollars. I recommend not staying at this hotel!

There is a great Panini Café on the Casino floor and an awesome ""Glam Rock"" Whiskey Bar which is great for people watching.  There is an OK Oriental Café on the Casino floor which says its noodles but in fact it is Oriental Fusion and a great stop over for lunch.  

There is always lots to see and do at the Venetian and its located on a great part of the strip.  Its classy and trashy at the same time, a great people watch but a mixed crowd.  If you into the James Bond kinda dressy romantic place to spend a couple of nights and you can dress up then this is a good place, if you're the younger generation looking for sushi bars, great clubbing, short skirts, big heels and boobs then the Cosmopolitan will be more you.

I have never been to such a dirty pool in Vegas... and everyone there seemed to think it was normal.

This past weekend completely changed my view on this hotel and I will never stay here again.  Over the weekend, 4 of my girlfriends and I stayed at the hotel in a Rialto suite.  When we came home from a night out, we realized our door was cracked open and $5500 worth of property was stolen (purses, wallets, shoes, sunglasses, watches, jewelry).  Hotel security did not arrive until an hour after we called them and was completely inappropriate with questions they were asking.  They asked us what we were wearing that night and why we had such expensive things.  Asked us where we worked to afford those things.  The next morning we spoke to Manny who was apparently the manager on duty and he simply shrugged his shoulders and said there was nothing for him to do.  We requested to move to a different room.  Still not satisfied with the hotel's response and their attitude about our safety, we called another manager, Jaime Dorado, and she finally said she would comp one of the two nights we stayed at the hotel.  We then took it upon ourselves to call the cops and file a report but they requested we come in to file in person. At that point in the day, we didn't have enough time to go there in person and complete the report before the station closed.  Now after spending what will amount to about a week talking to different investigators and guest relations at the Venetian and taking time out of my work day to speak with them, we are still left with many unanswered questions.  It wasn't until I spoke with Nick Oates in guest relations and the investigator Eve Williams that someone from the hotel apologized and said they were taking this seriously.  We understand that unfortunate things like theft could happen in a hotel but it is really the hotel's response and the conversations that took place after the incident that leave us completely disappointed.

The room rate is too pricey as well of course. The swimming pool is one of the pride of this hotel. I love it. Just like other hotels, casino and restos are in the first floor. One thing about this hotel which I didn't like is, it's such a big maze. It's hard to get from point a to Point b because it's big and the directions are very confusing. Another thing- the bell desk guy didn't take care of our luggage so one of my friends bag got a huge tear at the bottom and she lost her cellphone charger, we address the issue but the lady just told us to go to Walgreens and get a new one.

Two things happened on my last stay that didn't make it a fully five star experience for me, despite the huge marble bathroom and incredibly comfortable beds:

1) The water pressure and temperature in the showers are connected. (At least in the Bella Suite we stayed in.) That means if I wanted more water coming at me, the heat had to go up as well. Considering I'm a delicate tulip who can't handle too-hot water, every time I showered I had so little pressure that the trickle felt like I was just being peed on. Come on, man! 

2) I was the last to leave the room at checkout. As I walked out alone, one of the employees hit on me and was super creepy about it. ""You're really pretty. Can I be your friend? I'm just kidding. What's your name?"" WTF? I doubt this would have happened if even one other female friend had been with me. He saw me walking alone and he had to take a shot. So gross and unprofessional!

My friends and I were walking around the casino at around 5 in the morning looking for food after a very hectic night. We were a group of 3 Asian American guys, 1 Indian American guy, and me (Asian American girl). We approached a manager (his name was Jeff), to ask (in perfect American accents) if there were any food places around that were open at that time. He seemed willing to help, and looked over our group for a few seconds, then told us that he wasn't sure what kind of Asian food was around, but that there might be some ""Vietnamese or Thai places off the strip"" if we wanted to go that far. My friends and I were so surprised by this blatantly racist statement, and gently told him that we were looking for any kind of food, not just Asian food. He seemed a bit flustered, as if he realized that what he said was a bit of a faux pas, and directed us towards a couple open restaurants within the Venetian. We thanked him and left, somewhat in a state of shock. 

Admittedly, it was very early in the morning, and I understand that Jeff was most likely trying to be nice and giving us selections that he thought we would be familiar with. However, I would think that out of all the different people visiting Vegas every day, the staff should be a little more wary of statements that could be construed as offensive. I'm not saying this guy should be fired, since it was clear that he was trying to be helpful, but I hope he learns that when dealing with customers, it's very important to be aware of political and social correctness.",11,9,4

Only option given was to move to another room and pay the extra 50.00 per night for a view of the swimming pool and construction. Both room service and house keeping averaged 2 hours past promised times (average time). Calling the front desk was just as challenging to speak to a live person. Various items broken in room or not cleaned such as lighted mirror or mold in the shower or the dust on the toilet phone. Not sure why you need a phone in a closet bathroom. Maybe so you can call housekeeping when you run out of TP? Staff never seemed concerned with the issues.

I would actually book a room for myself at this place if I had the money in contrast to the W Hotel.  But of course, at the time of my stay, I wasn't financially there and wouldn't book a room to save my life.  Luckily, yet again, the Venetian was free for my broke-then-maybe-now-ass.  Muhahahaha.  

Well, it wasn't that great as it sounds now ... ""free.""  We were told that a friend who had suddenly gained a lot of money, wanted to treat his friends to a few rooms at the Venetian.  Little did we know of how many people he invited ...

So we're on our way .. driving at the crack of dawn to Vegas - restless and hungry for food and thirsty for alcohol.  We finally arrive at the much anticipated Venetian ... awed by the splendor of decor and richness of bling bling.  A bunch of us - girls - open the door to ""our"" room in excitement only to find a bunch of strangers, smoke, alcohol, and sadness inside.  So happens, this generous ""friend"" invited everybody and their moms.  We obviously had NO WHERE to stay, much less a place to SLEEP on.  

At 6am in the morning, pissed off and frustrated, several of us decided to check out their ""famous"" pool ... all we found was a jacuzzi and a sorry water area.  No pool?  Correct.  We were so tired and sad that we had no where to stay, that we slept our sorry asses outside on the pool chairs in the jacuzzi area.  We woke up an hour or so later to a old white couple staring at us from the jacuzzi.  Oh, the thoughts I'd imagine they had ...

Long story short, there were several other people who had rooms and we ended up crashing with them, 3 girls to a bed, and still free of charge.  

The room was the Venetian Bella Suite, two full beds and lounge area with a couch that unfolds to a bed (my bed to be exact =\/ ).  chairs, a table, TV ... the works.  Despite the uncomfort of sharing a couch-bed with two other girls, it was still a nice hotel ... a nice room ... and a nice bed.   

Words of advice:  don't expect satisfaction out of 'free' things.  I'd rather pay for a room then to have to stay with strangers.

I've been a fan of this hotel for some time and recently had to stay at this hotel again earlier this month for a bachelor party.  This place never fails to meet and exceed my expectations.  Although the ""newness"" of the hotel has faded away over the years, one thing that remains the same is the high quality service from the staff and the decor of the rooms.

As mentioned above, we stayed here for a bachelor party.  We had 2 Rialto suite rooms.  When you go to a room w\/double doors, you know that you've officially arrived in Las Vegas and are in for a good time.  As for the inside of the room itself...this rooms are freaking huge.  If we were truly trying to be asian and save some money, we probably could've fit all 10 of us in this room comfortably with room to spare.  The room came with 2 queen beds and 2 sofas (1 can be used as a pull out) on a separate level.  Bathroom is pretty standard for Vegas hotels.  Typical...glass shower, whirpool tub, dual sinks, and toilet.

If there is one complaint I have about this hotel, its that the furniture could just a bit of renovation.  It seems a bit dated and you can see a bit of the wear and tear over the years.  Secondly, I'm not a fan of not having locks on the bathroom doors but I guess that's their theme or thing.  So that's not really a complaint as much as it is a suggestion.

Overall, the experience was great and met all of our needs.  Everyone left that trip with nothing but a great time and good things to say about the accommodations.  Definitely would stay here again.",0,0,0

Venetian is good for visitors but not for folks staying in. The standards have dropped significantly from several years ago. Like the moisturizer, soaps, towels. Nothing is as bad as how they treat you. I was left with the feeling they wanted to suck as much out of me as it was legally possible. At check-in I asked if I can get a room that faced the strip, I was told if I need a view with a room I needed to pay $45. When I hesitated the clerk added it would be on the highest floor. That sweetened the deal I paid up. Took a long walk with my family up to the room, only to find they gave me an inside view and it was on one of the middle floors!
 When I complained and tried to get my money back they said that would mean me moving to the bottom floor. I call it extortion! not to mention the hidden resort fee.

There is not even a pretense of good service. If you don't arrive in a limo, be prepared to be dropped off across the road from the lobby - the only place where a taxi can drop you. There are no welcome greetings, drinks or even a smile.

I was expecting luxury since I PAID for luxury.  My complaints start with the customer service - I have seen better more friendly customer service at IHOP!  The room was nice but there wasn't a good resturant in the entire hotel (either tower!).  My first night there I ate at the Grand Cafe Lux .  My daughter ordered a dish with shrimp and her food came back undercooked, she didn't order a steak where you might expect that (and did I say that we were eating at the Grand Cafe Lux?).  I ordered a waffle that was so dry I used for sides of butter just before it looked edible.  After I sent the food back and we were leaving a server came up to us and said ""Good Night I hope you enjoyed your food"" so I took a moment to share my experience and SHE WASN""T SURPRISED!  She said that if she would have taken my order she would have steered me to either another dish or to have my shrimp dish cooked twice (How was I supposed to know that in order for my shrimp to not be moving I would have to have it twice fried?).  She said to please try the resturant again in the morning because there are different chefs then.  So because my children were starving (and did I tell you that the other resturants in the hotel were awful????) I tried the Grand Lux Cafe again and again my order was undercooked - this time it was sausages?!?!?!?!?!

Now to my room.  I am on a relaxing  vacation (my only vacation this past year!) so I 
paid for a luxury suite with a living room, etc.  When I checked in I asked about the ""heated pool"" because I believed that there was an indoor pool in this hotel (another reason I chose this hotel).  The attendant said that one of the pools was out of service but there was a heated indoor pool in the other tower.   She drew on the map where this ""indoor pool"" was located.  I went looking for the indoor pool the next day (this is NYE and LV was supposed to snow so ""Indoor"" was supremly important) and to my utter disbelieve the security guard was the person to tell me that there wasn't an indoor pool in this hotel and the pool that the attendant mapped out for me was in fact outside.  In addition to that the attendant put me front side of the pool that was beling worked on so every morning I woke up to hammering and banging.

When I was finally ready to get the hell out of this ridiculous hotel, I call for a luggage attendant and literally an hour later I have to call back to make sure that someone is coming and the operator tells me that there is an hour wait on the bell hops.  I finally get a bell man and he packs 1\/2 of my bags (I did have more than a couple of bags) and looks at me like I am supposed to carry the other 5 bags down?  I tell him that the additional bags need to be taken to my car  as well and he huffs and throws my luggage on the cart.  I proceed to check out and reiterate the complaints that I had been calling the front desk about my entire stay and I get ""Oh sorry"".  I am livid at this point and go to the valet to get my car, I wait an additional 45 mins until I see my car and when it finally gets to me, my luggage is not where to be found.  Cue another 45 minutes (and I have the valet attendants looking at me crazy by this time) and the bell hop finally gets my luggage to me.  He loads 1\/2 of my bags gets his tip and leaves.  I go to find out what the hold up is and I find out that my trunk lock is broken.  

Needless to say I had to stay an additional day with more attitude, I missed a show, both my daughter and I  missed a day of work and now I have to go thru a risk management process just to get my issues attended to.

I had made our reservations months ago and had let the concierge know that we would be arriving around 1030-11:00am. I knew check-in wasn't until 3:00 but they asked me anyway. 

To our surprise when we walked up to the front desk, our room was ready. They said that the note in the computer helped us guarantee we'd get an early room if possible. I was thrilled! 
They let you use your room key as a credit card throughout the hotel as well which came in very handy so I didn't need to travel around with many credit cards.
 
The hotel was gorgeous. If you haven't looked at pictures of the room, be prepared to be impressed. Sunken living room, vanity in the bathroom, stall shower, flat screens? It was great. 

The Canal shops make you feel like you're walking around outside in Italy. Gondola rides indoors AND out. Tons of restaurants, fast food courts and drinks! High end shops as well as the usual gift shops. 

When I made the reservations the woman who helped me said ""we have everything- you don't even need to leave our property."" I didn't believe her at first. She was right! 

They also have Phantom, Jersey Boys & Blue Man Group all within the hotel. 

I definitely won't stay anywhere else in Vegas again. Can't say more good things about this place!

*Tips* 
I requested to be near an elevator (most resorts in Las vegas are HUGE and you might be walking a mile to your room - no exaggeration!) this ended up being great.  

Like I stated earlier, I let them know what time I was getting to the Venetian, in case a room was ready. They can also hold your bags if you get there before 3am so you are free to explore.

Take the Executive Las Vegas shuttle from the airport. 6 bucks each way, and Venetian is the first stop\/last to be picked up. Located lowest level of Baggage Claim by Door 1\/2.",5,2,0

What is that smell? I LOVE it!  they have this scent that spray's I believe it's called seduction.  Every time I passed the lobby my nostrils where in bliss:)

Our room was awesome with a sunken living space to sit and relax.  The tub was a good size perfect for two:)  There was also a tv to enjoy in the bathroom while getting dolled up.  The bed was very comfortable and we basically sunk in after long nights or mornings however you look at it teehee.   The casino was nice and we had the pleasure of meeting cool dealers...although I wasn't very good:(  But thats ok because Club Tao is there to dance away the woe's!

The Palazzo is adjacent and there are tons of shops to visit.

- Pools are great, but crowded (as any Vegas Hotel pool).  


- Casino was incredibly overpriced (typical of any upscale Strip Hotel). 

- On-Site Restaurant selection was great.

- Spa was nice (but small)

- Massage was okay (felt rushed)

- Good In-house discounts were offered

The hotel was very difficult to communicate with about my missing luggage.  One month after I filed the claim on the bag, it miraculously reappeared.

It would be a long time before I got my first chance to stay there, and between the opening and that day a lot of other hotels were stood up.  Needless to say, I've been a bit spoiled by the more recent players in the suites-only hotel game and Venetian feels a bit old in comparison.  

The actual property including the gaming, restaurants and venues are still top-notch.  I actually like the fakeness of it all, walking around the shops eating ice cream and watching people meander down the small indoor canals in the least romantic gondolas I've ever seen.  It may sound like I'm being sarcastic about liking it all, but as a person who loves theme parks, entertainment design and film, it is quite fun to walk through a place that doesn't feel like home.

The rooms themselves feel a bit dated now with decor matching something from my parents' home rather than the bleeding edge of interior design trends.  Part of this is understandable to match the high-end but traditional sensibilities of old world Italian luxury, but that doesn't mean you can't update some of the lighting at least?  In the piazza suite we last had the warm, but very dim, lighting made the whole suite feel stuffy and a bit eerie.  I much prefer the smaller suites which never had that same feeling.  The bathrooms were impeccable and quite large, and the shower door never leaked gallons of water.  I hate having to walk through the a large part of the casino to get from the lobby to the guest elevators though. 

The Canyon Ranch Spa is definitely nice, but I still prefer the one at Caesar's.  The gym is pretty decently sized with a variety of machines and a large area devoted to cardio.  The pool area meets the same high standard set by the rest of the property.

Overall I like the place and would stay again without hesitation, but it just doesn't wow me as much as some other properties around the Strip.",5,6,5

BED: was awesome to sleep in. However, there were blood stains on the comforter. The front desk took cared of it and brought fresh towels. 

TOWELS:  were super rough. For a $$$ hotel, they should at least spring for some soft towels I can rub my body with. Pshhh..and I usually bring my own. 

BATHROOM: Shower was nice. It had the view of the tub. FYI, the tub is not big enough for two people. lol. Mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all? There were a crap load of mirrors there. 

ROOM: Purrrrty nice. We didn't really utilize the living room area, but I guess it's nice to have. Oh yeah, the bathroom TV did not work. Lame. 

VIEW: Sucked. That's it. 

Tip: We used the in-suite WiFi, but it was on and off. Mostly off. We didn't get to use any of the terms for the $25 bucks a night fee, so they waived it. My question is that how do they actually know who is using the wifi? I can see ethernet. Not sure if they assign IP addresses per each room (unlikely), but whatever. We saved $100 bucks since we asked to waive it. 

I'm not a big gambler, but slots are slots. The black jack table was better at the Wynn. They had single deck black jack.

the service was not quite up to par, unfortunately. since vegas is a customer service oriented oasis, i expect better than the best, every time. there were far too many missteps during my stay to warrant more than 3 stars. here's a few:

- package services is highly understaffed. i had to inquire if i had packages (no one informed me). i was put on hold for 20 minutes each time i called, and they misplaced one of my packages. i had to provide a tracking number in order for them to retrieve the box, which might i add, they were sure they had already delivered to me.

- i got attitude from a bellman when i told him my coworker was on her way to my suite with her bags. he scoffed ""well, i just can't sit around waiting all day. pssh."" she arrived less than 2 minutes later.

- they charge to leave documents at the concierge for fellow guests

- the room was SO dark! even when i opened the blinds and turned all the lights on in the middle of the day, i could barely see.

- the concierge wasn't very helpful when it came to tracking down packages. she just told me to call the package center. no number provided, just that simple advice.

- my pre-ordered breakfast was 30 minutes late (i had asked for it to be delivered in a time frame). when it arrived (after i had called to locate it), the server complained that too many people wanted their breakfasts on time (um...ok?)

- they only left me the menu for the pre-order breakfast on the first night of my stay.

I've stayed at the Venetian about 10 times, and it never fails me.  I know its not the absolute best hotel, but it seems to suit me perfectly.  At some point, I stopped bothering to even leave the Venetian as it has pretty much everything I need: alcohol, food, gambling, partying, entertainment, relaxation.

I've had my room upgraded almost every single time I've been here.  Every room is a suite with a pull out sofa bed, so you can comfortably squeeze 6 people in their most basic of rooms.  I've stayed in most of the different types of rooms and their Rialto suites are the best deal in my opinion, but there aren't many of them.  The table limits are generally higher here than the Wynn (about same as Bellagio), but this can be nice cause the tables are usually less crowded.  And for some reason, I tend to always win when I'm here so I can't knock them for that.  If you valet your car and leave it for a couple days without taking it in and out, they'll wash it and vacuum the inside (I don't know how or when they decide to do this, but its happened more than a couple of times).  The service and staff seem to really go out of their way to make sure you have a good time, including getting you on other club's guest lists at the last minute, extra room keys, roll-aways, refrigerators, and upgrades.  I don't think I've ever encountered any pretentiousness from the hotel staff.  They definitely know how to take care of you.

I always make sure to grab brunch at Thomas Keller's amazing Bouchon, which is nicely tucked away from the Casino ensuring little to no wait even without a reservation.  I always make sure to hit up Noodle Asia for their Schezuan Beef Noodle Soup and Kimchee -- yeah, the Kimchee is $6.50, which is why I ordered it because that is among the most expensive Kimchee I've ever seen so I better damn try it.  Just so happens it is the best Kimchee I've ever had and I've probably ordered it 12 times since.  I made sure to try Bellagio's Noodle's $7 Kimchee, but it doesn't even come compare with free Kimchee I've had.  If I want to make sure everyone enjoys themselves, we make sure to hit up Tao Nightclub too -- somehow, its managed to be heads and shoulders above all the other clubs for so long now.

Being a girl from a small town, of course this place blew me away!! We got immediate parking, checking in and out was no hassle, and the interior is gorgeous! One of the things I like about this place is the security - you must show your hotel key before they allow you to access the elevators. When arriving at your room, you're greeted with a huge square footage of luxury! Bathrooms have stone floors, LCD tv, a separate toilet room, and mirrors mirrors and lots of mirrors. My girls and I definitely enjoyed that! The room has separation of the beds (with their own LCD tv) from the common area that has a sofa pull-out bed, and an amazing view. Our room faced Tao beach, so it really felt like we were on vacation. Prices are fantastic but expect to pay $800+ when booking on a weekend during spring break. The other convenience is that after having a night out at club Tao, the room is just so and so floors above. I have no problems with the hotel except for the fact that it's HUGE (got lost couple of times) and the crazy lines for taxis outside (but what hotel doesn't have that?).

Our room had a king bed, 2 tvs, a dining table with chairs, office table with a work chair, a couch, 2 single seat sofas, and a coffee table.

4. Do. Not. Touch. Any. Snack. Or. Drink. In. The. Room. Seriously don't. Even if you pick up the can of Pringles and put it back right away, they will charge you!
5. Because there is alcohol in the room, it's sitting neatly in the fridge so you have no fridge space whatsoever to store drinks or leftovers.
6. Take advantage of the ice room. Use it as a makeshift fridge or even drink it when it melts. Water is so hard to find in this hotel. No water fountains nearby.

But it's a modern-day version of Venice without the sinking buildings, the cracked walls, or the floating garbage. Perhaps it is the historical feel, the soon-to-be-gone concept of Venice that makes it romantic, of which the Venetian falls a bit short.

The rooms are spectacular. Of all the hotels I've stayed at on the Strip (and that includes most), this is one of the best. I appreciate the concept that every room is a suite and that every suite has the same ""basic"" amenities at the very least. Marble floors, granite countertops, separate bath and shower stalls, separate toilets (am I a fan of bathrooms or what?), semi-ornate furniture, sunken living room. Then comes the amenities of the actual hotel--beautiful swimming pool, Grand Lux (on par with Cheesecake Factory in ambience but infinitely better in quality and quantity of food). But I have to admit I have yet to try their buffet--I know, sacrilege. I keep going back to the buffets offered at Bellagio, Paris, and Wynn.

All in all, this is a great place to stay. The only downside is that there isn't much else to do there besides stay there, gamble there, eat there, and swim there. There aren't any to-die-for clubs, shops, or high-end restaurants. That is the only reason I gave it a 4, if I could I'd give it a 4.859...just a nose hair away!!!",0,0,0

Strange, random things first:  
-  There were snacks already missing from the tray, but we called it in immediately and they noted it and did not charge us.

-  We bought ramen noodles (after clubbing comfort food), and there was not coffee maker in the room, so we called for a water boiler.  They charged $7 to borrow it.  

-  There are 2 TVs, one in front of the beds, and one in front of the couch.  But they're pretty close together, so I can't imagine watching both at the same time.  Ohhh, I just figured it out.  If you wanted to watch while on the couch and then move to the bed... I get it.


Pros:  
-  calls for more towels and bath salts were fairly quickly answered.  There were lots of bath salts, but the number of towels were wrong twice (once short and once excessive, so I guess it evens out).

-  The room is not a bad size, especially for 4 people.  There are a few steps down and a bit of space between the sleeping area and the sitting area, so guests can have a bit of separation, even while in the same room.

-  The room was clean, bathroom was large, and the shower makes a nice attempt at a regular shower head and 2 extra nozzles that spray from the front.  Water pressure from the top shower head is pretty good, and the small ones in the front are just a nice addition.  Tub is large.

-  Baggage check-in to hold luggage after check-out:  the line is long, but it moves very quickly.  All your stuff gets put on a trolley together so things don't get mixed up.  You can also call in for late check-out (sorry, I don't know when that is).",0,0,0

The room was fabulous.  Roomy.  Comfortable bed.  Wonderful bathroom w\/separate tub and shower.  3 tvs were nice.  Couch\/living area was great too.

Only complaints are (1) that our room was on the 4th floor and had absolutely no view and (2) on our first evening as we were unpacking the cleaning lady walked right in without knocking (left her cell phone charging in the bathroom).  Perhaps the quality of our view was due to our room rate?  No worries though.  Who really needs a view when in Vegas?  

Casino, restaurants, shopping, etc. were all great.  Would recommend the hotel to anyone who has not stayed here.  Next time we are in Vegas we would consider trying the Wynn, Paris or Bellagio.  Wynn had a very nice Casino.  Paris had a great ""feel"" to it including the cobblestone streets.  Bellagio is simply ""over the top"" luxury. 

Pools were nice.  Crowded on a Saturday.  Much less crowded on Sunday and Monday.  The ""shade"" pool was a great escape from the LV heat.  Drink service was slow.  We ended up making drinks in our room and bringing them to the pool.",0,0,0

The bed was super comfy filled with some comfy pillows. I must agree with another yelper, it's not a standard king or cal king, this king was kinda on the short side. My SO mentioned that his feet was touching the end of the bed. As for my 5'2"" frame, it didn't make a difference to me. 

The bathroom was perfect for the size of the suite. The throne was enclosed with it's own door, separate glass shower\/ tub, his and her sink & a vanity area for the Mrs. I loved the fact that the tub had a nice slant to it, it was super relaxing during my bubble bath. The his\/hers sink was major plus considering that there was not a mini fridge in the room, we utilize sink #2 as an ice cooler and stocked it with alcohol. :) Minus 1 star for not having a mini fridge to keep our cold drinks & issues with our key scanner\/reader & the long hallway to our room.. It took us several tries to unlock our room. One night we actually were locked out, but the facilities tech response time was very reasonable.

We stayed here because we planned to party at Tao and we didn't really want to walk or cab it there.  Tip:  If you're staying there, go to the concierge desk and show them your room key.  They'll give you VIP passes.  If you're not staying there, just walk around the front lobby during the day.  You're bound to find one of their promoters passing them out.

We bought our airline and room on Expedia (5 days\/4 nights from DC for about $1700).

The Venetian seemed to be like a fantasy to me. Really beautiful. We didn't get to ride the gondolas but I wish we had. They looked cool.

ROOM: We stayed in the luxury suite. It was really nice. Comfortable bed, living room with sectional couch\/sofa, 2 sink bathroom with tub and shower separate. A television in front of the bed, in the living room, and even in the bathroom. Remote-controlled shades.. awesome. Pure luxury. The only thing I didn't like was that the wi-fi wasn't free but I heard that's how it is with most of the Vegas resorts.

CASINO: This was our first time at a casino. In comparing it to the other casinos on the Strip, I liked the Venetian. We stayed at the slots mostly. Be prepared to come away smelling like smoke. But I think that's how it is with most of the casinos.

SERVICE: Customer service was excellent. Everyone was nice and professional. The concierge was able to answer any question I had about how to get to places, walking vs. cab.

SHOPS: They were okay. Nothing like at the Bellagio or Wynn. The Venetian is right next to a Walgreens... and Sephora.

EATING: Make sure to eat at Bouchon. We had brunch there. Delicious. The other cheap restaurants were okay. I wish they had more variety. We didn't eat at any of the other restaurants because they didn't have great Yelp reviews.

I highly recommend staying here! If you plan to bring your children, this would be a good place (however, I don't understand why anyone would bring their children to Vegas).",0,0,0

I don't come here much because I think the smell they pump through property is obnoxious, also the place is so big and without ample signage it is hard to find certain places\/venues

Soul 2 soul is a great show and we had a nice dinner at Zepphirino(spelling dicey)

The cocktail server in the pit however was NOT amazing. 

Ordered about 15 minutes into new blackjack shoe(normal), 

We were the only people playing at the table for 45 minutes so a single drink is obtainable by Vegas service standards of 15-20 minutes rounds

Got through the entire shoe up double so we had just colored our chips out when the server came with our drinks and claimed to not know who we were and what we had ordered.  

This was not incredible as we could see our drinks on the tray.  I don't think this is acceptable and I am certainly not into this sort of behavior at a five diamond resort

I don't so much care about the drink as I am with the lack of hospitality.

Our first interaction was with Chelsea who accommodated us upon check-in. She was genial, informative, and energetic despite the late hour of our arrival. A good first impression!
Our room was spacious and luxurious. A large bathroom with marble sinks and private toilet coupled with a huge suite featuring two large TVs and a beautiful view of the pool areas and the red rocked mountains in the distance. The bed was very good but not great. It tended to feel worn and by the end of the week we yearned for our home king. The bed wasn't bad, but certainly forgettable.
The interior of the hotel is cavernous and the details spectacular. The varied and vast restaurant offerings will have you questioning your need to leave the property. We frequented Tao nightclub and it was electric but crowded. The doorman expedited our entry and waived the cover probably because of my wife because the guys in front of us didn't earn the same favor. We don't tend to be clubbers, but I was impressed with the sound system, ambiance, and clientele. A little rowdy and loud, but that's what clubs are for. We also went to the Bourbon House for two nights to close things out and disappointingly the music had little variation. It is 80's themed, but the same music was played each night. Our waitress was brutal and the guy who served as an MC was as cheesy as it gets. 
For cheap eats (relatively speaking) we ate lunch one day in the food court. We had pizza at Social LIfe and it was actually one of the best pizzas we have ever had, and I consider myself a pizza connoisseur. We did the build your own and it was extraordinary and filled us for the rest of the day. 
Many people have commented on the smoke in the casino. I gambled less than I had expected for that very reason. Inhaling smoke from every direction was the best way to keep me out of there. I am surprised that they don't do a better job with filtration or segregation of smokers. 
Our last night there we returned from another casino and the Valet service was brutal. No one would give me a ticket and the one employee named Harry ignored me and brushed past me when I asked him if anyone was available. If a resort boasts five stars, there can be no missteps. I asked the next valet (Chris?) if it typically takes this long, and he said, ""What do you want me to do, I am the only one here.?"" Ironically he wasn't the only one there because the first gentlemen who I parked with was more rude than Harry, but I didn't get his name. I empathized with (Chris) because he was the only one hustling. Waiting ten minutes to have someone give you a ticket for your car is a bit much particularly after a long night. We got in around 11 PM, so it wasn't as if it was rush hour.
Overall the hotel is extraordinary and I would gladly stay there again. The level of service is vacillates between top-notch to disappointing. We tried the Concierge desk late at night and instead found a Guest Services agent who was curt and devoid of knowledge. Given that I have only been here once, I don't know if this is the norm or the exception. The pool area is tremendous and the grounds are meticulous. A great place for couples or friends who want to have a good time in Vegas. I would recommend for those over 30 as the vibe is more traditional. We barely scratched the surface in our four days there, but is there ever enough time to uncover everything in Vegas?",0,0,0

It's supposed to resemble Venice, Italy and although I've never been, it appears to do it justice at this hotel. Just look up the pictures and you'll see the magnificence of this place.

Me and my gf got a luxury suite with a king size bed. The room was 600 sq feet and looked amazing inside and was very spacious. We got a stand up shower and a bath tub with 2 vanity mirrors. In addition to our bedroom area, we also had a step down to the living room which had a dining table and desk and corner sofa. Although we didn't pay for a window view suite, we did get a small view of the strip. We had three flat screen tvs in our whole room and even one in the bathroom! So cool.

As for the resort and other amenities of this hotel: there is free wifi for the suite and wifi for when you're just walking around the Grand Canal and looking at all the shoppes. I highly recommend downloading the app as they give you special discounts at their restaurants and shops and have a map of the resort hotel. Many of the shops and restaurants are very high end and I never even heard of them so we didn't buy anything. 

It was a beautiful hotel to walk around in and the great thing about the Grand Canal Shoppes is that it's indoors! Although it looks like you're outside with their sky painted ceilings.

The decor, the bedrooms (we had two TV's plus a bathroom TV!), the amazing bathtubs you can lay down in, the cleanliness of the entire property. Not to mention all the restaurant choices between the Venetian and Palazzo. You basically don't have to leave the resort for food - they have something to satisfy any craving.

One of my absolutely favorite things about staying here is the housekeeping crew - on top of the usual housekeeping things, they left us little chocolates to snack on and laid out soaps and lotions on a little towel right on the bathroom counter. They even moved some of our bathroom essentials that were already out (razors, deodorant, etc..) onto the towel. Normally I hate when people move our stuff but I thought it was incredibly thoughtful to put everything in an easy to reach spot!

Pros:
-We never heard anyone in the rooms around us. The ONLY time we heard noise outside was super drunk people yelling outside in the hallway but that's not a big deal, really.
-Huge bathtubs
-Room was spotless
-Furniture had 0 scuff marks or damage
-Housekeeping staff went above and beyond our expectations without us even asking
-Storing luggage at the bell desk is super simple
-Front desk staff were incredibly friendly and made check in simple and fast. We didn't use the concierge at all so I can't comment on it.
-Video check out on the TV worked perfectly (I feel like half the time they don't work, so this is definitely a plus for me)
-Have you SEEN the size of the rooms?! Have you seen how beautiful these rooms are?!
-The hallways were very clean.
-Casino is very bright, and doesn't smell like no one has cleaned the carpets in 50 years (you know the smell if you've been in Casino Royale or the Flamingo...)
-There are TONS of food options!
-WiFi is included in the resort fee and wasn't sluggish. Obviously not top tier speed but enough to surf the web as needed without being frustrated.

Cons:
-Obviously with the 5 star service and cleanliness of the hotel, comes a hefty price tag. We got a 33 percent off coupon but it's real expensive without a discount.
-The casino is pretty tight compared to Mirage across the street or at Casino Royale. But it's a much nicer casino than most of the others on the strip so it's a little expected.
-A very minor con, but holy crap it's easy to get lost in the Canal Shops!",2,0,0

I love how there is a sunken living room area in every room, which means hanging out and lounging in the room doesn't mean some people have to resort to sit on the bed(s).

The bathrooms are also top-notch (and very large) with high-end materials everywhere. Marble tiling on the floor....marble tiling on the walls. There's a soaking tub with an adjacent all-glass walk-in shower stall, his and her sinks, a vanity mirror and seating area, and the toilet is hidden in its own little room by a door next to the sinks.

TAKE NOTE!!! First time guests planning to book a room at this resort...keep in mind that The Venetian has TWO separate hotel towers. One is the main hotel tower and the other is called the Venezia tower. Although the Venezia tower is newer (built in 2003), the main tower rooms were remodeled in 2007. The rooms you see on the website are for the rooms in the main tower. Venezia rooms, while still really beautiful, are decorated and furnished in an old-world European style as opposed to the contemporary style of the Venetian tower rooms.  Either way, you can't go wrong...it just depends on your furniture style preference.  See below:

Venezia tower room: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ybs46yw

Venetian tower room: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yzs523q

All four times I've stayed at The Venetian Resort, we've been booked into their Venezia Tower, which is their version of a ""boutique hotel within a hotel"" kind of thing. If you don't mind the slightly outdated furniture, I would highly recommend getting a room in this tower as the Venezia has its own pool and spa garden that's strictly for guests staying in the Venezia tower and it closes an hour later than main The Venetian pool area. Plus, it has its own separate check-in lobby that's NEVER as crowded as it is for main Venetian registration desk.

The resort itself is MASSIVE and the layout of the entire place can be a little hard to figure out if it's your first time staying here. Can't tell you how many times I've gotten lost in here, even after multiple visits.

Pretty much everything I would ever want and need is in this Resort, which gives me hardly a reason to ever step foot outside the hotel other than to visit a nightclub other than the resident mega club, TAO or to catch a show at another hotel.",23,4,5

The rooms there are very similar to what you find in Vegas.  Ours was roomy and the two beds never felt crowded.  The little railing separating the beds from the living area was a nice touch (and again, you get the same deal if you stay in the Macau version).  I slept relatively well here and would consider staying here again for the room.

I'm not that big a fan of gambling here as with other higher-end Vegas casinos it can get costly to play with the higher table stakes.  The gambling atmosphere is fine though honestly I wasn't too thrilled with the dining options here.  I ended up grabbing a drink at Buddy's where the atmosphere was nice and the bartender was pretty cool.  

In terms of location this place is decent - it's not too far of a walk from Caesars, Bellagio and the other big time casinos.  The Grand Canal Shoppes are fine though personally I a fan of the Macau version more because it's simply much larger and has a better variety of shops and restaurants.

This casino\/hotel is amazing.  Let's start with it's opulent furnishings and design.  As soon as you walk in, there is a fellow playing the accordion in appropriate garb.  The floors are polished and pillars are clean, and the ceiling is painted to make you feel like you are right there in Italy.

The restrooms are lavish and clean as a whistle, always well stocked, and deserve an award themselves.

The air is clean throughout, no overwhelming smoke or other odors that you might find elsewhere on the strip.

They offer free shows throughout St. Marks square (at least every time I've went in the summer).  The actors and singers and entertainers (including jugglers and statues and marionette artists) are pleasant and genuine.  Dazzling and entertaining for any age group.

I love sitting at the oxygen bar at the end of the canal, listening to the opera singers rowing their gondolas while I'm getting a massage.  Probably the most serene experience of my life.

Food!  The food court is fantastic.  Grand Lux is off the hook - their menu as big as a the bible, open 24 hours, and the Cuban pulled pork sandwich is amazing.  Postrio, Wolfgang Puck's corner of St. Mark's Square, is phenomenal.  I plan my whole trip to Vegas around his home made sausage appetizer with a trio of mustards, and his burger with onion marmalade.

The customer service is so shiny that you need to wear your sunglasses as not to be blinded by the ocean of smiles.  I believe this place is as close to heaven on earth as is possible.

The gaming is great.  Payouts are abundant at penny and dollar slots alike every trip so far.  The poker room is HOPPING, with 60+ tables at any given time.  All the dealers are friendly.  I also like the uniforms the security guards have to wear.

I booked one of the tower suites for $179\/night for a business trip to Vegas. Having stayed in many hotels in Vegas, including the Rio just a week earlier, I have to say the Venetian is my favorite so far. The rooms are enormous with ridiculously huge bathrooms, beautiful fittings and amenities, a terrific selection of restaurants within the hotel and convenient access to the Sands Convention center. The staff were professional and personable, the service what you'd expect from a high quality establishment, the decor throughout the hotel top notch. They also appointed the bathrooms very well with plush towels, robes and even thought to include Q-tips and a nail file.

The only way it could have been better is if the in-room internet access were free. Well, that and the fact that getting to the tower suites is rather a trek through this giant hotel block. Several other guests got lost and decidedly irritated. The suites, however, are far enough off the strip and out of the way of the casino that the rooms are blissfully quiet.

We will definitely stay at the Venetian again given the opportunity. The suites are suitably well appointed with a seating area that you could easily host a meeting or have a romantic in-room meal comfortably. (Room service is expensive.)

This was my third time staying here and I can now say, like many others, that it's overrated. Somehow the prices have gotten ridiculous, and even for the pathetic $129\/night I paid, I felt a bit jipped. When you factor in the resort fee ($22.40) and tax ($15.69) you're really paying $167.09\/night. While the rooms are nice, I don't think they warrant that kind of price.

I now notice all the dings and yuck marks that others have mentioned. I also noticed the near broken shower handle and the flippant attitude of the check-in staff. I really super-noticed the lack of places to obtain reasonably priced drinks and on-tap beers. Lastly, I really noticed just how far north the hotel is. 

My next time in Vegas I'll gamble a bit and select a lower end hotel. Although I do not subscribe to the old Vegas adage ""...you're only in your room to sleep"" I don't think it's necessary to have such a nice room when you're only in it 1\/2 the time.

From check in to check out my stay was perfect.  Check in was easy and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  From the front desk girl, to the bag check men, to the complimentary cucumber and fruit water attendants, everyone was amazing.  

The hotel itself is big and opulent but never felt gaudy and tacky like some other large hotels in Vegas. I appreciated all the little details that made you feel like you were in a mini Venice.  The frescoed ceilings, numerous paintings, statues, water fixtures, even the lovely elevator music made me feel like I was in a special pseudo European oasis in the desert.  The hotel was extremely clean, and their casino floor was bright and well ventilated.  After walking through other hotels nasty, smelly, dark casinos I was extremely grateful that I chose The Venetian.  

I enjoyed the grand canal shoppes immensely. The indoor sky was pretty cool, and sitting down with a cup of tea and a confection from Le Macaron or Paris Baguette while watching the gondolas pass by and listening to the gondoliers was such a relaxing way to pass the time after shopping.  Some of the kiosk workers were annoyingly aggressive, but being from Hawaii I was used to it. But I could see how it would irritate other visitors not from places with a big tourist economy.  

My room was a standard King, but it was surprisingly large, clean, and comfortable.  The bed was soooo plush!  The bathroom was huge with lots of mirrors and a grand bathtub. Very swanky.  My one complaint was that the air in the room felt even drier than the outside air. But it could just be me since I'm not used to the weather or being in air conditioning for long periods of time.  Unlike other reviews I read, I found housekeeping to be efficient and thorough. I would go out then return to a spotless tidied up room each day. 

The best part of The Venetian are the numerous high quality food choices. This is a great hotel for foodies!  While there I regularly had good coffee and to go snacks from Bouchon Bakery, had the most delicious breakfasts at Bouchon Bistro, decadent lobster tails from Carlos Bakery, some of the best pasta I've ever eaten at Canaletto, and one of the best steaks I've ever had at Wolfgang Puck's Cut.

My wife and I are both poker players so for us, the poker rooms are one of the most important aspects of the visit. In the Venetian poker room they really treat their players well and genuinely want you to be there. I feel that in some of the other poker rooms they could really use a bit of customer experience uplift. We do jump around the other poker rooms depending on how things are going with the tables but we generally spend the majority of time at the Venetian.

We had pay ANOTHER flight change fee when we got to the airport to leave on Sunday, the same day we checked-out of the hotel.  Of course we couldn't reach Las Vegas Sands Vacations because it's a Sunday.  So we paid the change fee and had to leave at midnight which is way later than it was supposed to be scheduled for.  Oh, and they screwed up our departure dates and plans as well.  LOTS of drama.  So we called during business hours on Monday and complained only to be told that we had to submit our complaint via email to the After Vacation Department.

Room: Very spacious (they're all suites after all) and nice view from the 31st floor. But there's no coffee maker. The window whistled loudly when it was windy and you could hear the atrocious American Idol styled music blasting from the pool area. This is nitpicking, but you could see the wires hanging from the bottom of the wall mounted TV. The lighting was weird and dark. There's no separation between the beds and the living room, so if someone wants to watch TV while someone else sleeps, good luck. Why not put up a retractable curtain between these areas for some privacy and noise control? They have them on the windows. 

Pool: Kind of gross and needs some serious cleaning. They also need a lot more umbrellas or shaded area in the summer. Duh, I know it's hot, but I still want to hang out and take a dip in the pool. I shouldnt have to fry to death in the meantime or pay hundreds of dollars to rent a cabana.

Spa: Hits and misses (see separate Yelp review)

We've stayed here many times before, but this last time will probably be our last. The reason we've stayed here is its location, its reasonable prices, and the room size. Every room is a suite with a double bed and a living room.

Unfortunately, we were beset by what appears to be a re-structuring of the hotel's housekeeping service. Our habit is to leave for breakfast and notify the housekeeping service to make up our room while we're gone. We like to come back after lunch and nap, and hate to find them only getting around to making up our room when we're back. 

So, the first day, we called at 9am, asked them to clean within the next hour. I left my wife shopping at 2pm. Guess who had just gotten started on making it up. I came back at 3, and they were gone. BUT, I found our newspapers and used glasses and coffee cups not removed. Also, the bathroom floor had some kleenex or possibly toilet paper on it. I didn't say anything then.

Next day, we call again at 8:30am. Go downstairs for breakfast. I get back to the room at 10am. Room not made up. I want to do some work while my wife shops. Call housekeeping. They tell me they'll do it as soon as possible. I say when is that? She says, right away. I change my plans and go do some exploring. Get back at noon. Yep! not done. The person says they're in the middle of changing housekeeping systems and they're sorry.

Room was cleaned that evening, but we napped on dirty linens. Shouldn't happen at a first class hotel. I've stayed in many many hotels and never had that problem. While I didn't ask for some credit on my account, I expect a first class hotel to offer some sort of compensation, maybe just a credit on a future stay. Nope. Nothing. Nada.

And yet...I think 75% of the time, we find ourselves staying at the Venetian. Why? Mostly because a typical day in Vegas for us means getting breakfast at Bouchon Bakery, then shopping, then lunching at the Grand Lux Cafe, then relaxing at the pool, waiting for our food to digest before squeezing in a workout and hitting a show (that's usually in or near the Venetian). Our nights usually end with a late dinner and drinks (often times at the Grand Lux again because it's open 24 hours).

Bouchon Bakery and Grand Lux Cafe are mere footsteps away from the room elevators. America's coolest Walgreen's is just right outside the hotel. The Canal Shoppes are in the hotel grounds and provide a good mix of fantasy window shopping and things we actually can afford (Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, etc). And if we need to hit the department stores, Fashion Show Mall is right across the street. When it comes to getting our fitness on, the Canyon Ranch Spa has an entire floor dedicated to cardio machines and a room just for weights. And finally, the hotel is right smack between Caesar's Palace and Wynn\/Encore (if you wish to go any farther south or north, respectively, though, walking may not be the best option, depending on the weather and\/or your shoes).

So she reserved two suites 4 girls in each room, 2 weeks before our visit  2 girls dropped out so we figured we could have 6 of us in one room but the hotel refused to cancel one room reservation. My friend tried everything she could but they would not budge, I felt horrible so I offered to pay more since everything was being divided and  my girls were kind enough to pitch in also. Okay three girls in each room will be more than comfy, we shrugged it off and continued the excitement for the weekend. The day we left to Vegas three girls including my friend Angie left in their car a bit early and checked in while the rest of arrived shortly after. Our evening would start at 5:30pm, arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and when we reached my friends room she informed us the other room was still not available yet. So we all just got ready in her room and left to meet our limo downstairs before we left my friend went to check the status of our room at 5:30pm and it was still not ready. So you wouldn't let us cancel our reservation and yet you don't even have a room we've paid for ready  more then 2 hours after check in? So frustrating!!!!! we leave enjoy our night and don't return until around 2am and I was done for the evening but apparently the girls placed me in our room which was finally available to us. The next morning wake up and look round the room to notice it is disgusting weird stains all over the satin headboards, dings and dents on the walls and the tv . You can view my pictures as see it for yourself,  as if rockstars occupied our room before us and trashed the place and the hotel thought they could clean it and find it suitable for us still. Some of the outlets in the bathroom did not work either,  just highly disappointed with the hotel after all its supposed to be one of the nicer hotels on the strip.

I love the Venetian, it's a very beautiful hotel.. But..

Our pillows and sheets smelled like a man's armpit! 

Really. Did not have that clean fresh smell!... I told the hubby that I'd call down and say something about it.. At least have them change the sheets.. But by that time, we had already settled in and unpacked our things, and my husband is a very private person when it comes to hotel services.. He didn't want anyone coming into our room.. So we ended up moving all the stinky sheets and pillows aside. That definitely took away from the comfort... I definitely expect more from the Venetian! Seriously, how was it missed?! 

The room and hotel  itself is nice otherwise and the bathroom was spacious. 

I also took advantage of their fitness center. They have a ton of cardio machines.. Weights.. And rooms for various classes.. First morning at the fitness center was pretty empty. The second morning was full. 

The parking garage is also not too far from the elevators to the suites... Of course there's a small walk, but generally not too bad.. So it was easy to come and go. 

Bouchon bakery right by the guest elevators, smart move! Try the chocolate almond croissant!

I am definitely more into the modern contemporary decor so the Venetian wouldn't normally be my steez BUT it didn't even matter! They spared no expense when designing this place. You can really just walk around and take in how well done everything is especially on such a large scale. 

I arrived a day later than the rest of the crew so I had a drunk guy trying to bring me up to the room. That was fun navigating the halls. Word of advice - pay attention to where you are going! There are so many twists and turns, you may get lost. The suites in this hotel are crazy! They are all really, really big. We ended up with connecting rooms so it felt even bigger. Each room had 2 comfy queen beds and a surprisingly comfy sofa bed. Coming in at 8am pretty much designates you to sofa bed duty - a task that was fine with me. Each room has 2 LCD TVs, a DOPE shower, a ginormous tub - the only thing the room was missing was a TV in the mirror.

Spending money is what is done in Vegas, so the ""sneaky"" extra encouragement is not needed. {The lack of frig space and the lack of a microwave oven is the reason for my 4 stars as opposed to 5}.

Not impressed.  Although the casino is beautiful and has a pretty good feel to it, I was continually annoyed with the dealers and cocktail waitresses.

I switched to a different blackjack table with just about the same result.  I decided to try some caribbean stud and almost walked away before even playing a hand.

Maybe a beer would have made the experience better, but cocktail waitresses were very sparse.  Then, once they finally got around to us, they were grouchy too.

Their partner casino (The Palazzo) provided a better gaming experience, but worse (barely possible) drink service.

^ That's what I say to my buddies who have never stayed in this classy and beautiful hotel.  Whenever I go to Vegas - which I'm averaging about 4 trips a year so far -the Venetian is always on the top of my hit list.  In fact, it is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas and I'm a frequent guest here...

The Venetian and Bellagio are the only 5-star hotels on the strip and while I've never stayed in the latter, why would I?  All the rooms in the Venetian are suites so you get a huge room complete with a nice bathroom, 2 TVs and a living room.  All this and beautifully furnished for cheaper than staying at the overly-hyped, way too pricey Bellagio?  The Venetian is a bargain in comparison and it's equally as luxurious with the top hotels elsewhere...and we're just talking about the standard suite here.  And if you're trying to go on a bargain with travelling friends, consider this: the room can comfortably sleep 8 people with the amount of space in this room as the sofa is a bed too.  But let's just keep this secret to ourselves, yeah? ;)

If you want to 1up yourself at this resort, try the newer Venezia tower that have slightly bigger rooms and more lavish furnishings.  Not to mention the separate lobby is not only huge, but absolutely gorgeousb like you've stepped into a Renaissance museum.  Even the separate outdoor pools and gazebo are top notch.

The Tao night club is currently the ""it"" place to be so definitely check it out.  Casino is huge and everything screams luxury.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",3,0,1

The word 5-star invokes opulence, star-treatment, flawless customer service and impeccable rooms and grounds.  Perhaps, at one point in time the Venetian ruled along the strip as the epitome of 5-star, but I don't think that's the case here anymore.  

The city has suffered at the hands of this economic downturn, and hotels have responded, primarily by reducing their staff.  Venetian was clearly understaffed, from front desk, to bell-hops and luggage staff and especially the Concierge desk, they were always ill-equipped to deal with the crowds during high traffic times.

As other reviews have mentioned, the atmosphere is ruined by the perfumed scent that is pumped into the facility. It is positively nauseating and the smell is so strong and so empowering that you don't want to enter the reception area. Also, another atmosphere annoyance: management insists on playing the Phantom of the Opera soundtrack on a loop in the elevators - (that marketing scheme will only hurt you, who wants to see that musical after it's been blasting in your ears for the last four days?)

Restaurants on site are better than average to awful (i.e. its food court), with the best one being Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bistro located in the Venezia Tower. Their complimentary breakfast is served in a tiny two floor room. Their continental breakfast offers pastries and croissants with some sorry looking bananas and apples, along with self-serve coffee and juice. 

The little food that is offered is okay but not sufficient for a place that bills itself as a 5-star establishment. The space itself is cramped and cavernous with only a few tables where you can sit and see the view. Here, they are also understaffed with very few tending to replenishing the food and drink and cleaning\/turning over the tables.

Their pool area is also not terribly impressive. Between the Venetian and the Palazzo, the area offers four pool areas. There is visible ugly construction obscuring the sky. Their towel service is nice, offering both a chair towel and a swimming towel. There are far too few hot-tubs that are either over-run with children or filled to annoying capacity. If you want to relax, sit far away from the Tao Beach Club that plays club music at the maximum volume level. 

Though the lounge chairs aren't as nice in the Palazzo pool area, the mood and atmosphere is decidedly calmer. With no food service to speak of, drink service was sporadic, we ended up mostly going up to the bar to fill our orders. Cocktails $10 a pop, beer $7, wine $8.

As I'm sure you've figured out by now, there is nothing reminiscent of Venice at the Venetian. The Grand Canal Shoppes, along with the indoor\/outdoor Canal along with St-Mark's square is bordering on Disney-cheesy (but it's Vegas, so it's to be expected?)

The rooms, their size is what saves this place. We stayed in the Bella Suites and these rooms were big. Two flat screen t.v.s, one in the bedroom and then the other in the living room suite. Sizeable bathrooms, separate toilets.  Plenty of room to pre-game most importantly and to get ready for a night out on the town. Complimentary toiletries weren't anything special - bitter orange. Nice shower pressure, but both towels and robes were overly starch-y and old. 

The furniture has seen better days, and there were a few items that needed tending (i.e. towel rack was loose, some light bulbs were burned out and needed replacing, fleece blanket had a huge hole in it) Maid service always came early in the morning - and they were seemingly thorough, except for one day when a cleaning glove was left behind on top of our bathroom sink.

With all the new hotels (Westin, Hilton) offering plush bedding and ""heavenly"" beds, you think the nicer hotels in Vegas would follow suit. Not so. The mattresses were lumpy, some dipping in the middle (clearly needing an overhaul) The pillows were flat and not plush. I would have preferred at the very least, a duvet. Most of us slept badly.

Your value for the money was decent, but only when the total cost of the stay was split seven ways. If I would do it again, I'd spend extra money and stay somewhere fancier or more modern (Think Bellagio, Wynn, or newer properties). I would not return here.

The added charge of a daily $18 resort fee for access to the gym and a daily newspaper that you must obtain yourself (both items which we never took advantage of) was ridiculous and unnecessary.  Not to mention when I elected to do a quickie checkout (to avoid an hour long wait) by filling out a form, I never received an itemized bill of my charges.",7,3,4

The Venetian is almost 5 ***** Star in my book but ...................The only thing wrong .... NO ICE or vending machines on the 11th  floor! WTF -1* Star
I spent a several days here on a recent business trip. Company dime, hell yea!
4 days no police, no ATF officers, no DEA, no FBI, not even a single meter maid, this place is boring. I'm going back downtown where shit happens and it don''t cost $10 bucks for a pack of smokes and nobody looks at ya funny for ordering a bottle  of Bud or for wearing a trucker hat and having a rebel flag tattoed on your neck. I miss Fremont street.",22,26,23

What's nice is that it had a separate pool area (Venezia Garden Pool) however still extremely crowded and no room in the shade.  The hotel as a whole was very well-kept and clean. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Our check-in had a long line but moved very quickly. We were able to check in early which was nice.  The room itself was beautiful, very clean, and very comfortable bed and pillows.  My only complaint is that there was no coffee maker! Some of us need a cup of coffee before we can go downstairs to purchase a cup of coffee.  It's very possible to spend a couple days in Vegas and never actually leave the Venetian property. Shopping along the canal is a blast because of the retail and unique boutiques, amazing restaurants, but ultimately it's the the decor, ambience and the canal itself! Even when we stay at a different hotel we often come here for the shopping. Parking is free which is very nice!  The previous time we stayed was December 2001. Upon check-in they gave us a free upgrade to a suite that normally runs $1200 a night (16 years ago mind you)! It was larger than the apartment we lived in at that time. To this day I have never seen it's equal!  One of the differences I noticed between last weeks visit and the one in 2001 was that there seems to be a growing number of young early 20-something clientele. There are plenty of trashy party hotels already in Vegas, I would love to see the Venetian keep its class and elegance!",0,1,0

There's gondola rides, for $80, they have tons of shoppes, even one dedicated to fucking whiskey!  Ok so that last one isn't very italian, but goddammit you can SAMPLE the whiskey FOR FREE. There are tons of delicious, yet overpriced, restaurants,  including chipotle!  So the service was fucking great, we had 2 seperate bookings, why? Don't worry about it, that's why. Anyways, one was booked for a king bed, the other for two queens. Mind you, I'm here with my wife, why the hell would I want two queen beds???? They ended up being able to ""downgrade,"" yea...like being able to sleep in the same bed as my sexy wife is a downgrade...to allow us to have a king bed for the duration of our stay. The room itself was awesome, there are 3 tvs, sunken living room, comfy ass beds, etc. We also partook in the canyon ranch spa, which was definitely worth it, the massages were great, don't ask me about happy endings...perverts.  Oh, and let's not forget the casino. Can anyone say Blackjack??? Well, lemme tell you, the fucking dealers sure can. Ok, it wasn't that bad. I did win about $60 playing for a good 10 minutes. Cocktail waitresses are quick on service at the table games, not so much on the slots. If you have to ask why, get the fuck out of the casino. You're the reason I lose at blackjack. Who the hell splits on 20 with a dealers up 6....christ. this hotel was great, a little pricey, but definitely worth it. You could stay on the property the whole time and be content with the stay, if you're not, stop being whiney and learn how to have some damn fun. Don't stay anywhere else, unless you're cheap as shit, and if you're cheap as shit, what the fuck are you doing in Vegas in the first place?  You're the reason I fucking lose at blackjack....but I digress. Stay here, stay at the flamingo, stay at Mandalay bay, I really don't give a shit. Just don't play blackjack with me",0,0,0

Because I'm a gym rat, I have to give them credit here first: Their gym is fantastic for being at a hotel! Lots of cardio machines, all sorts of machines and free weights. Everything you need for an intense workout. They offer towel service and you can borrow headphones for your workout.

The room service, customer service and overall care they show their guests is second to none at The Venetian. We asked for a crib for our baby boy and they delivered it all assembled, with a bib, blanket and baby toy. We asked for a mini fridge and they delivered one in 20 minutes and there was no additional charge.

We signed up for special pricing on Venetian's website directly and so they periodically send special pricing for booking. We get amazing rates for their suites compared to the other higher end hotels on the strip with similar size and design.

They have two pools and a beach party type of people as well for day parties until 6pm.

The indoor shopping area is beautiful. They have indoor lake with gondola's riding people around and the gondola staff signing songs. Cost is $20\/person. The ceiling is painted like a clear blue sky to make you feel you are outside. The ambiance is amazing and our favorite go to hotel in Vegas.",27,11,23

I delayed writing my review because I was waiting to see how they would respond to an unfortunate incident that occurred on our second day at this property.  So how did they respond?  In the words of one of the RHONY, ""Not well, B#%!""  As a result, we will never stay at this place again.  

The incident:  on July 11, our second day at the hotel, we were going to exit the hotel property through one of the large access points off the mall.  As we walked across the marble floor, my husband slipped and fell on a large puddle of liquid.  Two ladies walking next to us stopped to assist and offered to stick around.  We didn't think it was necessary.  Another guy who was soliciting people to eat\/drink at a nearby pub across the way yelled over to us that security was on their way.  He then told us that a couple of inebriated guys came through there and threw their drinks on the floor.  As we waited, the maintenance guy showed up and started to clean up the mess, but lots of people were still walking through the large spill.  They are really lucky that no body else fell, mostly because we kept waving them away as we waited for security--it took about 15 min for a security person to show up on a bike.  When he did, he asked us what happened (he also parked his bike across the walkway to keep people from walking on the wet floor as they only put up two signs for the large area.). We told him the above.  Then he asked about injuries.  My husband had no visible injuries, but falling flat on your back on a marble floor is pretty jolting so he was not sure.  Therefore, security called their EMTs.  As soon as the EMTs arrived, security guy left.  EMTs did a brief check.  Nothing external or obvious.  Anything more would need to be done at a hospital.  At this point, we didn't think a hospital trip was necessary.  They had my husband sign an acknowledgment of first aid.  I asked if a report was going to be made, they said this was it.  I asked if we could have a copy.  No copy but said we could take a picture.  

The next day when we checked out, we were asked by the reservation clerk about our stay.  We told her it was nice until this incident happened.  She asked if security made a report.  We said the only thing we got was by photo from the EMTs.  She then asked if security gave us a card that had the phone number to risk management.  We said no, and she gave us one and said we could call them if we had questions.  We had lots of questions so I did call.  I asked why they don't have security posted at these large entry\/exits or at least someone monitoring.  If they did, a hazardous wet floor would never go unattended like it did when we walked through.  The risk management person then said if the guys who poured out their drinks were ahead of us we should have seen the wet floor.  Ugh!  She totally was not listening and was making a lot of assumptions.  We were not literally behind these guys.  The guys who poured their drinks on the floor did that long before we arrived.  How were we supposed to know the floor was wet.  They didn't put any signs up until after my husband fell.  

Next question, why didn't the security guard make a report or give us a card.  Person on the phone said there was a report and gave me the #.  I asked for a copy of the report and she said no it was confidential.  I asked why an incident report would be confidential when it's about my husband.  She said it's proprietary info and could only be released by a subpoena.  Ok, so to get a subpoena, a lawsuit needs to be filed.  So in essence they are inviting a lawsuit.  As the conversation continued to go downhill, the risk management person eventually said she would have someone else call.  Another person did call my husband, and the conversation continued in a similar manner.  Except this person now said there is no report other than the EMT acknowledgment.  Still no clear answer about why security didn't make a report or give us a card.  As for why there is no one monitoring the entry\/exit ways and why a large puddle of liquid was allowed to remain on the floor after some inebriated folks poured it, the answer was how were they supposed to know, they can't be everywhere at all times.  Oh really?  A large casino\/hotel such as this can't be expected to monitor its own property at all times.  Right.  Do you smell what I smell?  Word to the wise, if you are unfortunate enough to fall on a wet marble floor at this place, call the police and get them to take a report because security won't do it, and even if they do, they are shady and won't release to you.",5,6,2

I had been once before so I already knew the lay of the land. It can be a little disorienting the first time around. It is huge! And ever so beautiful. Ornate doesn't always mean schmaltzy. 

There is so much to do here. Shopping, shows, gondola rides - nice to get taken for a different kind of ride in Vegas. Food, food and more food.. Did I mention food? Yes. Good stuff.

We splurged and got a two bedroom suite. Honestly, the master bathroom was almost as big as my apartment. And the view of Las Vegas was breathtaking. The little touches made it all the much better.

And now for a couple of helpful hints: Bring your own water. Unless paying $6 for a bottle of water doesn't frost your cupcake. Get some ice, fill the sink with ice and put the bottles of water in. 

Turned out we didn't really need to do that because my dear brother lost six Gs playing blackjack. One of the floor guys came over and said, ""Rooms on us kid."" So... lose - win. We were also given free passes to Tao. Which wasn't my bag. Had a couple of drinks and hightailed it back to the beautiful bathroom and took a nice long soak and drank a little more. Fell soundly asleep in the big, incredibly comfortable bed.

Next day I had an hour long Swedish massage in the spa. I was a puddle by the time she was finished. (Note: too classy for a happy ending). But it was sweet nonetheless.

Brother swore off the blackjack and we went in for a little poker (really hoping your mind doesn't go THERE). This time he didn't drink - hint. Big hand for the little lady. I won his money back. And gave it to him for his birthday. 

Love this place.",5,5,5

I guess all the rooms are suites with a large living room area. The bathroom is amazing with a tub and a shower stall. I guess for the most part, the tub is used for filing ice and alcohol. The room has two flat panel screens and even an ironing board so you can look sharp for a night out on the town. 

For some reason, I am also obsessed with their body wash\/shampoo\/conditioner. It's very orange-scented and quite refreshing. 

Anyways, other than that, the room is very spacious and comfortable. The floor plan is very open and made to house additional guests if needed. The hotel is also very professional with a security guard posted at the entrance to the tower to allow only guests with key cards.

Really, you can air-condition the desert!  Great service from our cabana host, Chris, who was quick and charming.  The cabana was spacious, close to the restroom, clean, nicely stocked with cold non alcoholic drinks and fresh cut fruit.  Unless it's something you're looking for, my only advice is to request to be placed away from Tao Beach (mostly college kids and thumping techno music) but not in the smaller pool (mostly families with really little kiddies).

I almost always stay and play at the Venetian\/Palazzo for my frequent Vegas trips.  But this weekend (when I had many things planned) private gaming lessons, specific room requests and multiple appointments at Canyon Ranch Spa (see my separate review), all came out a little screwy.  

The rooms are very nice and very spacious.  They have some of the BEST restaurants in Vegas (i.e. Cut and Bouchon).  Having a Walgreen attached to the campus is very nice.  And their late night Noodle Asia is amazing and life-saver for 3a comfort food.",0,0,1

The atmosphere in the Venetian is amazing! What a fun\/elegant feel that takes you outside of Vegas and into Italy. The location is wonderful and is right next to a Walgreens so you can pick up some cheap commodities such as souvenirs and bottled water.

I loved the pool at the Venetian, and Riva by Wolfgang Puck is a must for breakfast purely for the atmosphere. The drinks by the pool are AMAZING as well. Don't forget to try the Spiked Bellini.

The cab ride from airport to Hotel was great, once we arrived we were greeted by the door staff which were nice to recommend to always pay cash to cab drivers because it's cheaper and they don't get all tips if you use a CC. Once at front desk, young man called Mayool checked us in with no problems, we did arrive very late after midnight so we had to check in to a smoking room, we are not smokers and Mayool just wanted us to try it out because it had a phenomenal view up high, just for the night and have us move the next two days, we had no problem with it because the room was not in bad condition nor too smelly and it was an amazing view. Next day we moved to a none smoking room which Mayool nicely had blocked for us and which we are thankful for.

Next day we did lots of shopping and entertainment so we just wanted to relax and watch a movie, our movies in room were having a little issue so I called the front desk and a girl by the name Jennifer was incredible pleasant, she has the nicest voice and very helpful attitude, she called maintenance for us because it was in issue she couldn't resolve on her end.

No later than 10 min, a gentlemen by the name of Brian from maintenance came to room and did some magic, my movies were fixed in less than 5 min.

The next morning we decided to use the Gym, all good equipment. After that we headed to Canyon Ranch café where a very cheerful Joe Arroyo, recommended what could possibly be one of the best smoothies I've ever had in my life (Banana, mango, peach and whey protein) nothing special but I wouldn't have come up with that combination and I love when people recommend something when I don't really know what to get.

That same day we took the famous Gondola ride, needless to say, its mind blowing, an incredible experience and one of the most romantic moments we spent at the hotel.

To finalize our wonderful stay, the next day we had a delightful brunch at an Italian Bistro, not sure the name of it but I believe it was Zeffirinos? The place is a beautiful little spot with patio that every single person was taking pictures in. A wonderful British woman by name of Alethea was our server, who wouldn't enjoy the services of a British accent person!? Truly, it just made me feel like I was in Europe.

Overall it was a Phenomenal trip to Vegas and I wanted to take the time to thank all the staff for the wonderful services and I'm sure all other departments that I didn't mention, do a terrific Job as well.

Thank you, because of you is that we shall return.

I have only been to Vegas 1 time in my life but stayed at the Venetian a whole week. 

I went to all the other resorts but nothing inspires me like the Venetian. Once you go Venetian there's no other way to go. 

The Venetian is the place to take your significant other!  Its one of the most romantic hotels in Vegas.

Yeah, every thing is pricey at the venetian.  I bought a single gillette razor in one of the stores downstairs and it cost $20 but so what!
Insipiration and the art are worth it!

The Venetian just inspires me in every way. The Venetian lobby is just jaw dropping. It's architecture and ceilings are an absolute architectural masterpiece.

The suites are so nice that you don't even want to leave. The view of Vegas from the suite i stayed in was unreal! 

The tvs in the regular suite are not plasma or lcds but who cares there are 2 of them and its not like you came to vegas to watch ER. 

The mall located inside the Venetian is so nice. It has so many nice stores for the shopper in your life!  

The coolest thing about the mall is the square with a cool looking sky mural that looks like the real sky. It looks so real!! almost holographic!
They sell the coolest tasting Gelato in the square! 

Next time I go to Vegas i'm staying at the Venetian. Yeah i really want to try the other resorts just to see what's they are like but why should i. Could they possibly be better than venetian? doubt it. A hotel can't get better.

Oh yeah I almost forgot. One of the coolest clubs in Vegas the Tao night club is located inside the Venetian. I always heard about the Tao on tv and how many celebrities party at the Tao. Its a cool place, unfortunately when I was there i didn't run into any. 

The casino inside Venetian is also pretty cool. They have all the games! Good times!

For the last several years I've been staying here during the Microsoft Management Summit and it has really made me a Vegas Hotel Snob, which is sad considering I don't have to pay for the room.  Still, if I DID have to pay for a room, I would probably want to pay for a room like this.

There is a spacious working\/sitting area with a TV, and then a spacious bedroom area ALSO with a TV.  A Giant Bathroom area, with tub and shower ALSO with a TV.  That's a lot of TVs!

On the downside, pretty much every time I've been here, the previous occupant has made off with something.  Last year it was water from the expensive ""Pay Fridge"".  This year was one of the two plush robes (that wouldn't even fit my girthy frame should I choose to want one).  They have always been most accommodating in removing these things, but it sucks that I always have to play ""Find the stolen thing"" when I get here.

They have raised the price of the Internet, but the good news is that at least it is a PER ROOM cost and not a per USE cost. That is, if myself and my better half want to use the Internet we only pay the once.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone coming to town.",1,1,1

We got married in 2004 when I was 3 months pregnant with my first child. We arrived at the hotel almost midnight (we drove from LA to Vegas, stopping at Yosemite and other places) and the staff, seeing how tired I was from the long journey (my husband also told them that I was 3 months along), pulled a chair out for me to sit down while my husband checked in. We told them that we were getting married a chapel the next morning and they congratulated us and upgraded our room to a penthouse for 2 nights. It was a great ""complimentary"" service on their part. I told myself, 'Great job Venetian. You'll definitely be seeing us again"".

We returned again in 2015 with the child who was in my belly (11 years old then) and his 2 other siblings! The service was a wonderful as the first time we were there. Although we didn't stay in a penthouse this house, this room (with a separate living room on another tier) was excellent. It had the space our family of 5 needed and the service was again, excellent.

Although there is room for improvement, I will likely not stay anywhere else when I come to Vegas. The hotel is large enough but is also small enough so you don't get lost. LAVO has a nice bar and restaurant and I like the lounge. I am not a big fan of Tao Beach and Nightclub. An added bonus is that it is right across the street from Bare at the Mirage, my favorite pool in Vegas. 

The Big:  The rooms are huge. King bed with a sunken living room and two sinks and a separate tub from the shower.  The food court has a lot of variety and the Grand Lux is a great 24 hr joint that is close to the hotel towers. There is an Expressamente to buy coffee and a bagel, Bouchon Bakery to also buy something on the fly and Cocilino for gelato. It is also close to the Canal shops and my favorite Italian restaurant Zefferino that my Italian friend turned me on to.

The Little:  The towels and robes are too small and not plush enough for a $200\/night hotel. In addition, the made did not give me more bath soap after the first night. Lastly, the internet connection was spotty and the TV reception wasn't much better. I hate paying for a resort fee when crap doesn't work properly.

(I am writing this review from with in the Venetian suites)
1. I was visiting with my wife and booked a luxury suite, upon check in I was offered to a newly remodeled suite (which turned out to be false once we were in the suite) with a great view for additional $45 on 29th floor. I agreed and checked in. The suite was pretty well decorated and comfortable. The trouble started since the following day morning. They started some construction and drilling work all day long since 9am and it made the annoying drilling noise which was so loud my wife literally had to shout out to talk to me inside the room.
2. I called the front desk complaining about the same and they said they can't stop the construction but can shift us to the 8th floor normal suite. I was surprised by the indifference the lady showed. When I insisted I had booked a luxury king suite and also have paid extra she offered to waive the $45 I had paid in case I decide to move. The noise seems to be getting louder and very annoying. Moving is painful as it literally means you do a complete packing! I never expected such an attitude and poor planing form a huge hotel resort like Venetian. They seem to be taking guest's for granted. If any construction was planned at all the suite should not have been allotted at the first place. very poor service and even worse customer complain redressal.

I did have one problem however. I had booked 4 suites in the Venetian and I was told that they WOULD be side by side and even connecting. I was asked if I wanted a view of the pool or the strip and I said strip. I called back several times and I was given a confirmation each time of the rooms and where they were situated.

Upon arrival, I only had 2 rooms that were next to each other. One down the hall and one in a different wing. When I spoke to the lady working at the front desk, she informed me that there was no guarantee on room arrangements and that whoever had told me there was, would be penalized. She even told me there was no such thing as connecting suites in the Venetian. When I got into one of suites, low and behold there's a door that connects to the suite right next to it. Unfortunately, the connecting suite wasn't mine. 

I should have complained but I really wanted to just enjoy Vegas. So middle finger to you Charlotte and your bad attitude, you still won't stop me from having the time of my life! 

Other than that, the suites were beautiful, spacious, and comfy. The selection of food downstairs was a little overpriced but it is Las Vegas. TAO is probably one of the best nightclubs at the strip too and yes! it is located inside the Venetian. There's naked women dancing in bathtubs with only petals covering their goods. What else can you ask for? And Im a girl!

All I could say is that I had a blast in this hotel. Who wouldn't with $10 blackjack tables??? But be careful, although it is only $10...Margarita will be sure to take away all of your money and still leave you a glimmer of hope at redeeming your lost money by smiling and cheering you on...only to find out 30 minutes later you're now down double what you were before.

It was quite interesting to stay at the Venetian after having stayed at Palazzo so many times.  It was like going back in time to see the original designs; I kept comparing the rooms to see what the Palazzo had upgraded when it was built.  Pretty much everything.

The rooms are strikingly similar.  Where the Venetian has the wrought iron ""divider"" between areas, the Palazzo has a marble-esque ""bench"" where you can actually sit or put some stuff.  The Venetian's TVs are smaller (so not a big deal), the beds are in a worse state (comes with being older, I suppose), and the tower is smaller (so the views aren't as good).  What is better, I'd say, is the bathtub.  I'm a sucker for a soaking tub and, while the Palazzo's is awesome, no question, Venetian's has this little shelf in the tub so your arms can rest underwater.  It's a small detail, but I like it =)

What I perceived as the main difference between the two, really, was the amount of people.  It was Labor Day weekend and every place was crowded, but Venetian was a madhouse. People everywhere.  That, and the shorter ceilings, makes one feel a bit claustrophobic at times.  Palazzo is less crowded and chaotic.  I like that a bit better.  

At the end of the day, however, my rooms are free, so who cares?  We'll be back (but probably at Palazzo)!",7,5,3

My visits at the Venetian went in stages throughout the years. First it was about gambling, then it was hotel stays when I was visiting, followed by a great poker room, and now just to check out their exhibits.  After all these years, I still love the Venetian.  

Been a year since I stayed here and the rooms are very nice, clean, and spacious.  Comparing their average rooms against Mandalay's, Venetian wins hands down.  Another thing about the Venetian hotel is their check in and check out.  For a strip casino, the process is usually quick and painless here. 

The Venetian also has Tao (which I haven't been to in 3+ years), the wax museum, and exhibits (recently the Da Vinci). 

Still one of the cleanest hotels\/casinos that you'll find in Las Vegas with one of the best poker rooms.  I'm not saying easy games, just tons of action. Also not trying to tap the aquarium here, but the players here are pretty damn good.  Because of that, there's also a lot of action and if you play your cards right, you can have a big night.  When I have time off or a bunch of hours to spare, I will come out and play a little. 

I still recommend the Venetian to both locals and visitors.  My only issue is that I tend to get lost here regardless of how many times I've been here.  They're always adding something, taking something out, changing some of the decor, and even closing escalators & elevators down.  Yes, I get confused when I come here and when you have a little liquid courage in you, it's even worse.  Don't know how many times I'm trying to get to my car and end up at the Palazzo.

I also requested a few items, such as a cork screw, throughout my stay and the staff delivered within minutes.

Love the fact that TAO Nightclub and TAO Beach are located at the Venetian. We had guest list to TAO Beach and it was easily one of the better Vegas pool parties that I've been to. My group had fun at TAO Nightclub...probably because it was less crowded than usual. Or maybe it was the fact that the DJ didn't make my ears bleed by playing non-stop EDM. Either way, it was fun.

I probably would give the Venetian five stars if my suite had a damn MINI-FRIDGE. Come on, even most Motel 6's have one.

Staying at The Venetian gave me a new perspective on the property despite the many times I've been here for meals or shopping.

The check-in process was easy and the line moved quickly. The front desk area was easy to find, but it was a hike from the parking garage (typical for on strip properties). Major plus, The Venetian is not charging for parking. I'm all about giving my money to the properties that have not gone to parking fees!

We stayed in a suite in The Venezia Tower and loved our room. The walk from the front desk to the room involved two different elevators and a lot of walking. Other than that everything was perfect. The room was clean and large with plenty of space to spread out and relax. The bed was very comfortable. Most importantly, the room was quiet and I didn't hear any noise from surrounding rooms. It didn't get noisy until the morning when the cleaning staff arrived. The only thing oddly missing was a ""Do Not Disturb Sign"" and the cleaning staff didn't knock before trying to open the door. 

The Venetian\/Palazzo offers everything a hotel guest would need. Someone could stay here for a week and never leave the property. This property has one of the largest restaurant selections ranging from fine dining to quick service food court spots. At least half a dozen restaurants on property are chef restaurants. There are several coffee shops and a couple of bakeries. Between the two properties there is plenty of shopping. Of course on site they have a casino, spa, and pools as well. Entertainment options include about half a dozen show options like Rock of Ages and Human Nature. Low key options are also available like Madam Tussaud's and gondola rides. The property is beautifully decorated so it would be entertaining to just walk the property.",15,1,10

On first impressions, one might think this competes for a place in the upper echelon of vegas hotels with Wynn\/Encore and Bellagio. 

BUT there are many little things that prevent it from this status. For instance, the lines at checkin are more disorganized, you order room service in the morning and they say its a two hour wait, you order three towels to be brought to the room and they say they can only bring two. Lastly, while the hotel is one of the most impressive architectural structures ever built, it lacks the inspired vigor of the Wynn and Bellagio. 

A case in points is arguably the hotel's central feature, The Grand Canals. Certainly impressive and entertaining having canals run through the hotel. But also, somewhat derivative and gimmicky. On the other hand, the Bellagio and Wynn's ""gimmicks"" are unique and inspired: the awe inspiring fountains that grace Lake Bellagio's waters every 15 minutes and the unparalleled large-scale elegance of the Wynn. 

The Venetian is fantastic, and worth the stay - but it  is not in vegas' upper echelon.",0,0,0

Shortly after getting married, my wife and I decided to take a few days and go to Las Vegas for a quick vacation.  After scouring the internet for a nice place to stay within my allotted budget I came across the Venetian.  This place is easily a 4-5 star hotel with fantastic décor from the floors and ceilings to the pillars and statues in the lobby to the painted skies and Italianesque facades of the building in the shopping district to the gondolas running both through as well as outside the hotel.  This place truly was epic.

The room we stayed in was very lovely, featured a queen bed with a couch, kitchenette, armoire and dresser, complimentary robes, a large shower with separated bathroom stall and a lovely view overlooking the strip (we could watch the Treasure Island show from our window).  We were just minutes from The Bellagio Fountain show, from the animatronic statue show at Caesars Palace and from the several other tourists hot spots such as M&M World.  

The Gondola ride here was breathtaking, from the singing to the beautiful gondola itself, you really felt as if you were cruising through the Venice canals in Italy.  The blue sky with clouds painted overhead gave you that outdoor sense and the paintings and human statues were a sight to behold.  The Venetian has several shows that are put on throughout the hotel and we caught a couple and they were very well put together.  

Another great attraction located at the Venetian was Madame Tussauds Wax Museum which I will review separately.  This place is awesome as it is a modern twist on the wax museum with some interaction thrown into the mix.  They also featured the Blue Man Group which unfortunately we did not have money to catch on this visit (dying to see this show).  

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a beautiful place to stay in Las Vegas.  It is not the cheapest hotel on the strip but is far from the most expensive.  The amenities they offer for the price they charge is a great deal and they have also recently opened the new tower as well which is also supposed to be breathtaking as well.  This is one of the places I will definitely look at the next time we stay in Las Vegas.  My memories here are forever lasting and I hope there are plenty more to add in the future.",2,2,2

When I checked in at The Venetian on Aug 19, their computer system was down and they were taking everyone's credit card numbers by hand, writing them down, having you write your phone number and full name and signing.  I was very nervous about this, so I used my American Express card.

I had a great time at the hotel, but when I got home, I was alerted by Amex by multiple fraudulent internet charges.  I contacted one of the merchants and it turns out the customer had used my correct full name, credit card number, and phone number but the wrong billing address.  Interesting that they had the info I wrote down for The Venetian but nothing else.  

Amex took care of the fraud immediately, but when I called The Venetian, they didn't care at all.  They said that there was no investigation and that I couldn't prove it was someone from their hotel.  They put me through to the security department who took my information and then never called me back.

They do have a gym but good luck finding it (plus the hours are not the most convenient).

luckily, our room was comped. otherwise, your benjamins are better spent elsewhere if you're simply looking for a fancypants hotel to stay at with your honey. if you must do the venetian, AVOID the venezia tower, where you have to take a couple of elevators & read a bunch more signs just to find your room... NOT good if you're the stumble-home-drunk type.

speaking of which, did they lay off all the cocktail waitresses to save themselves some money? about 4 of us took up slots in separate areas on several occasions & not once were we offered anything to drink. buuut when we went to caesar's for some last-minute gambling, someone came by within a few minutes!

instead, it looks... er, smells like they invested the money they saved on some truly awful air freshener. not only did it smell bad, it was *strong* & pumped into every nook & cranny of the casino. i seriously considered donning a face mask & going around fob style.

their shopping offerings were ok - mostly stores you would pass by & sigh longingly at. & the check-in area could use a couple of benches so waiting guests don't have to sit on the floor... & passersby don't end up tripping on said guests sitting on the floor!

I'm a Venetian addict in that I've stayed here countless times.  I'm giving them 4 stars since I typically receive excellent service here with absolutely no problems.

No motorized curtains, no TV in the bathroom and a very long walk (complete with two elevator rides) to get to the casino.  I will say that it's much quieter in the Venezia Tower than the Venetian which is better for business travelers.

The room itself was nicely set up like a split level where you have the bed up top and then 3 steps down and you find yourself in a little sitting area.

The bathroom was very welcoming with its mirror covered french doors. It had a separate shower, tub, and even a little vanity for us ladies to sit and do our hair and makeup.

Came here for a conference and they were out of nonsmoking rooms so first offered to bring me an air purifier and move me to another room the following day, then offered to upgrade me to a higher-level suite for an extra $100\/night. Why they couldn't give me a complimentary upgrade the way airlines sometimes do if they're sold out of coach seats is beyond me - clearly they were uninterested in any future stays by me. That was unacceptable to me so the manager somehow found a nonsmoking room that hadn't been listed in inventory. 

After I spent some time outside and came back to the room, I realized why - it smelled like smoke - faint, but definitely there. By the time I came to that realization, I was too tired to deal with it so called the front desk and asked them to bring in an air purifier in the morning. When I went back to my room around noon to check on the situation, it was clear the air purifier had done nothing to help with the smell, so I requested to be moved to another room. They didn't have anything available right then but told me they would put something on hold for me as soon as something became available. I told them I wouldn't be ready to change rooms until later that night because I was working and they said that was fine. Got a voicemail later that afternoon that a room would be held for me but only till 5, so I had to call the front desk again (and by the way, every time I called the front desk it was a 5-10 minute wait on hold) and request that it be held until 6:30, which was the earliest I could get there. They had to have a 2-minute sidebar with their manager before they said it was fine. Apparently none of these people are empowered to satisfy customers by themselves, nor are the managers allowed to interact with customers directly, since this sidebar occurred every time there was a problem.

When I came to the front desk to get the hotel key for my new room, they couldn't find anything at first. Another sidebar with the manager. Then when I asked to assess the new room before I checked out of the old room, another sidebar to get permission. Once I made a decision, I had to call the front desk (another 10-minute wait on hold). Are you getting the idea?

Fortunately, the new room smelled much better than the old room, so I did move my belongings. The shower in the new room, unfortunately, ran from barely tepid to not quite hot enough with the dial cranked all the way to the left, but by this time I had learned not to expect any sort of customer service, so I didn't even bother reporting it.

We were told that we needed to give a CC to hold the deposit for another time and we would be charged an additional $50.00.

Why book guests on a floor that is slated for renovations? Why rush guests out from the room for said renovation, so much so that you further lack the supposed customer service your hotel is supposedly know for? 

The hotel room was less then up to the standards for a hotel that would charge as much as this one did-the bathroom had a fine stench of urine. Did I mention that they were going to renovate the 5th floor, could this be why less than meticulous attention was paid to the room's maintenance?  

From promptly 11 pm until 11 am the following morning, we were serenaded by the pounding, hammering and overall annoying sounds of renovations being made on the floor above. We were lucky if we got about 20 minutes of true sleep.

Make a call to a ""manager at the front desk"" and  you are given a the phony assurance that all issues will be addressed. They assured me that they would speak to the construction mgr to quieten down, as working @ 3am is not conducive to rest. That doesn't happen. They assure me that they will credit the spa treatment that shows on the hotel bill. That doesn't happen. The offered to "" allow us to have late check out"" This doesn't happen, they neglect to share this change with from numerous people that call up to the room to complain that we needed to be checked out nor do they share this information with the numerous people that knock on the door to state that we need to get out of the room as they need to start renovations.
They assure that they will offer a free nights stay for future use... how much do you want to bet that doesn't happen?! 

The only bright spot is when I contact Nan Wong, Concierge to get preboarding passes for Southwest and as she offered, it was waiting for me at the Concierge desk when I am forced to checked out.

We had 7 people stay and we had plenty of room. We were on the top floor (28th) of a newly renovated floor and the furnishings and beds were comfortable. Room was quiet and clean. Large formal dining table which would have been good to play poker.

I reserved the room about 1 month ago to take advantage of a birthday special. I told the phone agent that b\/c of the large group of 12 in the bachelor party and we had people departing at various times- we would probably downsize to 1 suite only on Sunday. I was told that since we had a special rate that it was more advantageous to keep the existing 3 nights and then, decide on Sun morning which room we would not need. Otherwise, we would get a much higher rate if we decided to add a nite. Since there was no charge, it was a no brainer.


Sunday 12:15p. Tried to checkout on the tv, but it was after 12:00 so 'not available'. Tried calling the front desk from the room, but placed on long hold since many others trying to check out. Moved all of our stuff into the smaller Luxury Suite.


Had to get over to our table at Encore Beach so I used my cell phone to call front desk enroute to Encore. After 3 unsuccessful attempts- long hold times and after getting connected, got disconnected- I finally got thru to someone. This time the phone agent stayed on the line until the front desk answered (that was appreciated since I had gotten cut off previously). They said no problem and that I was checked out of the Piazza Suite. I went back around 5p to turn in the old keys and get correct keys for the smaller luxury suite.

Went up to the room and there was a sign on the Luxury Suite- Room maintenance in progress. Curiously, once inside, the adjoining room doors were still open on both sides. I closed up the one on our Luxury suite side and deadbolted it before we left to go out. When we returned, again both adding doors were open. There was no one new who checked into the Piazaa suite- the 2 roll-a-beds were still there and no luggage.

Went out again and when we returned around 3AM, the adjoining doors on both sides were open again. I don't know how that could be unless someone came inside our room and opened it again. Couldn't figure that one out.
 

Anyways, we were having an enjoyable experience until time to check out on Monday. I wanted a physical print out of the totals for both rooms so that it would make my accounting easier for the shared expenses. Went to hotel front desk and got the Luxury Suite receipt for the 3 nights without issue.

When they were reviewing the Piazza suite bill, they incorrectly charged the entire 3 nights. I was not given an invoice. I told her that was incorrect and the agent went to talk to her manager (Sang). She came back to tell us that it was correctly billed since they have no record of me asking to check out early on the Piazza suite. She asked me who I spoke to on the phone. After being transferred around and disconnected, how am I suppose to know who I spoke to?

A multi-national LV Sands corporation doesn't have a billing reservation system that logs all calls and identifying the employee ID? I find that very hard to believe.

She asked if I wanted to speak to the manager and (even though my cousin was waiting in front), I did. He came out- and was not very apologetic. He essentially said that the charges are going to stay on my credit card and he will conduct an investigation. He also asked me who I spoke to on the phone (seriously, you're a billion $ corporation and you can't figure that out?!). The manager stated that he would ask for the security key lock log of the Piazza suite and if we did not indeed access the suite after our late 3p checkout Sunday (I already swapped keys so how could we have entered?), he would refund the charges then; otherwise, they stay on. He also had no answer for why our attached suite door had been opened again when we returned.

My brother and I both queried him on this and I suggested a fairer way would be to immediately reverse the charges, make them pending (like credit card companies do) and then conduct their investigation (we didn't have the keys). Basically, he implied that they don't trust us on our word and that if they can prove that it was their error, then they would correct it. For the small amount of $ they were trying to ""get"", they just cost them a lot of potential future business from not just me, but also, those who find this useful on how they value your business.

Now, I'm glad that I didn't gamble there.

This action on his part has left a very bad taste in my mouth with their hotel management. (esp when they dropped the ball).

$300 for all this negative perception and ill will. Poor form, Venetian, poor form.

The suites are still pretty big, and you can definitely stuff plenty of people in them if that's your goal because you'll usually have a king-sized bed and a pull-out sofa.  And the bathroom is top-notch, made of marble and individual shower stalls.  But now, the design is all just a bit blasé now.  I'd probably say functional, but not as aesthetically pleasing compared to other newer breed hotels.

The casino floor is nice, but all the tables\/machines are pretty smushed together.  It can be a real pain in the ass when there's a bunch of people, because it gets super crowded.  Everything also begins to look the same after a while, which is an issue if you're trying to look for something. The poker room is isolated from all that though and very large with plenty of tables.  The sports book is top-notch with the numerous huge screens and leather chairs.  Great place to watch sports.  The shops are nice, and who can complain about the gondola??

b) the room wasn't well dusted. i understand there's a lot to clean, but a lot of the ornate decorations\/etc make for a lot of areas for dust to land, and those areas were gross. i did a fingertip test and my finger was sandy brown. blah. 

c) no slippers with the robes.. they typically provide slippers with your complimentary robe.. but where are they?

d) the bed linens were torn, frayed, and falling apart. even if it's good quality thread-count percale sheeting, they shouldn't be presented in that manner. 

e) the in room breakfast wasn't up to par. no morning flowers or morning papers complimentary anymore? what's the matter? they didn't set it up either. bleh. 

f) the lampshade over the dining table was dirty, dented\/cracked and torn.. but they obviously un-dented it and turned it the other way so you wouldn't see it..

In order to make my review a little more helpful though, I'll add my ""Best of Drew"" winners at the end of this review.

The Venetian is massive and a good blend of everything you might want in Vegas.  There are plenty of restaurants, a nice mall, a large casino, and one of the best locations in Vegas.

If you are looking for a home base for a crazy party, then the Venetian is a great choice.  The rooms are large enough to accommodate a large number of people (if you want to cram), and the location is within walking distance of the hottest clubs in town: PURE, JET, Tryst, Tao (at the Venetian).

If you want a nice, quiet weekend, then the Venetian is also a good choice.  There are plenty of restaurant choices, the best spa in town, lots stores to visit, and even museums.

The Venetian is really the best overall resort in Vegas, and with the new Palazzo Resort being built next door, it will have even more to offer.

PROS:
- One of the most interesting and useful malls in Vegas.  While others might have higher-end brands, this is one where you can actually shop for that last-minute outfit.  I'd say that the Forum Shops at Caesar is the only other casino\/mall that is better.
- One of the largest (soon to be the largest) resorts - you have everything you could want in a resort.
- The Canyon Ranch Spa is still the best spa in Vegas.  Not as exclusive as other resort spas, but much more professional.
- All rooms are ""suites"" which really means that they are mostly large studios with a ""living room"".  But for a group on a budget, it's the best room in town where you can reasonably fit 6 people into a single room (2 queen beds and a pullout couch).
- Great location in the heart of the Strip.  Across the street from the Mirage, connected to Treasure Island by a pedestrian bridge, walking distance to Caesars and the Wynn.  There is also a convenient rear entrance from Koval, which makes it especially easy to get to the airport.

CONS:
- Can be a little pricey for a couple - better suited for a group.
- Not the most exciting resort for the younger crowd - geared more for families and older visitors.
- Some of the rooms haven't kept pace with the newer resorts with the furnishings (e.g. flat-screen TVs).

BEST OF DREW - Vegas-Style!
- Best place to stay if price is no object: Four Seasons
- Best place to stay for a bachelor party: Palms
- Best place to stay for a bachelorette party: Venetian
- Best pool area: Mandalay Bay
- Best place for a couples getaway: THEhotel at Mandalay Bay",3,0,1

But, since I have family there, I've only stayed in a hotel in Vegas once before.  When my boyfriend and I decided to pay a visit, I spent a lot of time looking at various places online.  I hate to admit it, but the bigger-than-necessary suites and the ""17"" LCD HDTV in the bathroom"" touted on their website sold me.  I'm glad I booked here.

The suite was fairly clean (although it looked like someone had fun with a jelly donut in the tub, as there was some sort of red gelatinous goo on the wall near the tub), the hallways were quiet, and the common areas of the casino and hotel were clean and well-kept.  The hotel (and attached Palazzo resort) is full of nice places to eat (Bouchon, Bouchon Bakery, and Dos Caminos are recommended), shop, etc.  (Hit the wax museum and bring your camera.  I promise you won't be disappointed - it's lots of fun!).

The basic luxury suite is 650 square-feet, has three televisions and three telephones, a shower and tub, a two-sink countertop in the bathroom, a vanity area with makeup mirror, there's a sectional sofa, a three-seat dining table, and a desk with fax\/copier\/printer, and the room has plenty of light as well as remote-controlled shades and curtains.  It's completely over the top, but that's part of the fun of Vegas.  The decor isn't minimalist, but it's not overly ornate and gaudy either.  The bed was large and comfy.  Didn't make it to the pool so I can't speak to that.

The staff and service was hit-or-miss.  The woman who checked us in was very nice as was the guy who brought our bags upstairs (we checked them when we got our of the cab in case our room wasn't ready yet) but the woman from whom we picked up our already-purchased Phantom tickets wasn't so friendly.  The operator I called when I realised we had no shampoo was nice, but we didn't get a visit from housekeeping for thirty minutes (and she brought bath gel, not shampoo - finally I just washed my hair with conditioner).  The staff at Bouchon was nice but the people working at Bouchon Bakery were a little surly.

The perfumed scent they pump in isn't the best, but you get used to it and it does help minimize the cigarette smell.  I thought the bath products (bitter orange from Agraria, a San Francisco-based company) were nice, though my boyfriend (and many other Yelpers) didn't care for the scent.  

The actual casino doesn't seem very large and there are few poker machines.  Walking a bit to the Palazzo, which is connected to the Venetian, is a good bet if you want to gamble for a while - the Palazzo is brighter and newer and has a less confusing layout.

Be sure to sign up for the Grazie card - one of the perks is free internet, which is otherwise $10\/day.

It's beautiful inside the lobby and outside the front. Their suites are a 3, but their lobby bumps up their score .5. Their suites are sort of dingy and outdated. I learned Venetian had something called ""the pizza party"" you could order from room service. I was out with the girls and some of them took a taxi van back to our room to order ""the pizza party"".

The other two girls convinced me to stay out with their friend, a promoter. We were heading over to Christian Audigier's club which I was against as I don't even like his shirts and can only imagine what his club is like. The promoter was friends with 3 6 Mafia and the girls were stoked about meeting the short one with gold teeth. We were walking over from Haze and met up with the 3 6 guy on their way out of the club. They invited us to go to another club and all I kept thinking was my feet hurt and I really want to try ""the pizza party"". At this point I had sent 5 texts and 2 phone calls regarding when the girls were ordering and how soon it would arrive. I had it in my head I was going back to eat and no one gets in my way when I'm hungry.

This guy in all his cocky rapper glory was like where are you going mamma?! I wanna go where you're going and and what's this party? Um..... I'm going back to the Venetian because they have something called the pizza party. It's this unusually large pizza with salad and wings. What?! You don't want to party with me? Can I go with you for this pizza party thang? I said sure, but it's going to be very boring as we're just a group of girls dressed in pjs eating our brains out. You'll have more fun with the club and the other two girls want to go with you so it was nice meeting you, bye-eeeh. 

The promoter and I rushed back to the suite to eat, eat, and eat. I got back and asked, ""where's the pizza party guys?"" They said it was just too big and we ordered from a regular place. WTF?! I said fine, but I'm eating how much I planned to eat and I hope there's enough food left for everyone else. They just laughed and said ""oh Grace"". We received our delivery and there was just enough food for me and the girls. As we were finishing the other two girls came back and asked, ""Is there any food left?"" The girls answered um no.... Grace, nuff said. 

Why did the girls come back early, you ask? Because that rapper guy stuck his head up one of the girl's dresses in the middle of the club while she was dancing. They freaked out and left immediately. 
Lessons learned-
1. Don't order just enough food when you're with me because it's not enough.
2. Don't choose rappers over food because, at least food will not bend over and come up your dress.",6,7,3

The Venetian is probably my favorite hotel in Vegas. I'm not hip enough for places like the Palms or the Hard Rock, and I'm not stylish enough for Encore or the Cosmopolitan, so there you have it.

We've stayed in the Venezia Tower twice, and it's beautiful. The tower is accessible from a small hallway off the right side of the main lobby, or from the valet parking area. The Venezia has its own pool area, right outside Bouchon. The rooms are standard Venetian suites, with two queen beds or one king. The living area is several steps down from the bed. Most rooms have probably been renovated since my last stay.

Pros: Amazing restaurants. Bouchon and Otto (Grand Canal Shops) are phenomenal. The Grand Lux Cafe (coffee shop) is way above the Vegas norm. Easy to get on their loyalty list, with plenty of discounts. Blue Man Group. Very friendly staff. Unique stores in Grand Canal Shops. Good cocktail service. Coca-Cola products sold on property. Rooms are quiet. 

Cons: That gardenia smell will penetrate your brain after a few days. High table minimums for gaming. Terrible video poker. Tight slots. Minor items are expensive. Valet parking is non-intuitive.",0,0,1

We stayed in the Venezia tower in a Bella Suite (2 queens).  Since the Venezia tower is a few years older than the Palazzo or Venetian towers, it's decor was a bit less modern, but still nicely appointed.  Other yelpers complained about the long walk to this tower and it can be a mission when you're drunk, but on the other hand, got to burn off those calories someway!  It's about a 6-8 minute walk from the lobby, but when you're in heels, it feels a lot longer.  By the end of the weekend, we were kicking them off as soon as we got to the Venezia lobby.  Anyway, I thought the Venezia was worth the lower price tag - it was the same price as one king bed in one of the newer suites.  So, if you have a big group and are on a budget, this place is a good deal for the money!  Oh yes, and eat at the Grand Lux Cafe - it's basically the same thing as the Cheesecake Factory!  I ate there THREE times during my stay :)

+1 Inside the Venetian, which has a billion ammenities 
+1 Central location on the strip

The hotel\/casino is top-notch and very detailed in every aspect. They clean and scrub areas of the hotel regularly and it shows. I've seen staff clean and scrub the restrooms and the lobby areas late at night and early mornings. People spill drinks at the casino table (me haha) and they have tissues to clean it up immediately. Everyone is very courteous here.

The rooms are spacious; every room has a separate sitting area with its own TV and a sofa that may or may not be a pullout bed. The bathroom has a separate tub and walk-in shower, 2 sinks, and a private toilet behind a door. All of this makes it convenient, so someone can be using the toilet while others could get ready using 2 sinks. There is also a chair and table for ladies to make their face in the bathroom. If someone is using the bathroom, there is a mirror in the foyer for the ladies to make their face :)

During 2 separate visits, we encountered some problems. The first is that we gave the bellman our luggage, which were separated into multiple tickets. When we called for it, they only delivered luggage belonging to 1 ticket and marked our room as ""done"" in their system. Two hours later, after multiple inquiries and being given the run-around, we went downstairs to retrieve the luggage ourselves and had to wait in the lobby while they looked for it. About 1 hour after picking up our luggage, we received a call checking up on the issue; they resolved it by offering us a $50 dining credit.

The second time, we checked into a room to find a used cup, body print on the bed, pillows laid out, a used towel, and a dirty tub. It looked as if someone accessed the room, took a nap, and washed up before leaving. We got switched to a new room immediately. About 1 hour after the incident, we received a call about the issue and they offered us complimentary internet access to make up for it.

The customer service is amazing. They are quick and eager to resolve issues to the best of their abilities. Love love love this hotel. Definitely my #1 out of all the hotels in Vegas.",9,0,2

We arrived in the early afternoon on a Wednesday and while it was pretty busy we were directed to a check-in counter very quickly and a friendly clerk made our registration fast and efficient. She gave us directions as it was a bit confusing how to navigate through the various elevators and corridors to our room, and we headed to our residence to drop off our luggage.

If you're new to the Venetian, it really is a bit confusing and somewhat difficult to get around. We were required to take two separate banks of elevators to get to our rooms which seemed to be in a completely different building. Fortunately some friendly guests and a few employees were able to help direct us around so we found our way around quickly. 

Our room itself was quite large with bathroom first (near the front door), followed by the bed area, then a sitting room which was a step down and separated by a railing, giving the impression of a sort of two-room style. We also had two tvs, one at the foot of the bed and one in the sitting room (and both somehow controlled by the same remote if you pointed it at the right angle). Overall the room was nice but the layout left a bit to be desired as we felt a bit uncomfortable with the stair down (we felt we didn't need a step when returning to the room after a night of drinking) and the location of the bed directly next to the toilet meant you could literally hear every noise right through the wall. The view was nice but the layout could have been a bit better.

For the price, the size and the service, this was a good deal and for one of the upper end hotels, it's definitely nothing to sneeze at for sure. Out of preferred Vegas hotels on the strip, it's not one of my upper choices though, but it is definitely nice to check out at least once and isn't a bad option if you have particular restaurants or shows right in that area and want to minimize your walking or travel times.",2,0,0

Pros:
* Price.  I booked my room via Priceline and got a Venezia room for $90\/night.  When I arrived there I upgraded to the Venetian tower for $20 because of the Venetian's recent renovation.  I received a nice coupon book as well.
* Amenities.  The Venetian's got shopping, many restaurant options, an excellent pool, spa & workout area, and two huge gaming floors (Venetian + Palazzo).  I had a great dining experience at Dos Caminos.
* Room size & amenities.  All of the Venetian's rooms are suites, making the hotel a good option for larger groups.  The bathroom was large w\/a great tub, shower, and a TV inside.  My room showed only small signs of wear-and-tear.  

Cons:
* Location.  The Venetian is on the north side of the strip.  My personal preference would be for a more central location.  I think the Bellagio is the best-located hotel on the strip.  
* Lines & waits.  I waited in longer-than-expected lines for check-in and a long line for bag check.  When I got to my room luggage delivery had me on hold for 45min.  My guess is the Venetian has been cutting staff due to the economic downturn.
* Resort fee.  The Venetian charged an ~$18 resort fee for pool access, internet access, etc.  While I didn't think this was egregious it's something to keep in mind.",0,0,0

The pool area is like spring break on steriods (good if you are 21, not so good if you are trying to get any relaxation in and are not 21..).

My husband and I however decided to come to vegas for my 30th birthday. In the past we have always enjoyed staying at the Venetian and thAt is why we continue to return despite it being g one of the more expensive hotel\/ casino on the strip. We were so excited to get away for a couple days and excited to stay in the beautiful rooms the Venetian has to to offer. That's about where our enjoyment of this hotel ended,upon pulling up to check and check our vehicle into valet we were greeted (well not exactly greeted) by a very unfriendly valet who had an uppity better than you,we found this to be common behavior by all the employees outside of two(a very kind Russian woman and a bell boy). There was this snootiness that all the employees had and o was disgusted by the rude and sharp way they spoke to us as if this hotel was to good for our money(because we were staying in there basic suite) this isn't the first time my husband and I have gotten this type of behavior because truth be told we dress very punk rock in roll and between my plugs,colored hair and our tattooos and his beard people are constantly treating us like we are up to no good. The irony is that we are two of the kindest people and always ready to help,we own a very rapidly expanding business and inthw next year will be very well off..My point is don't judge based on looks,which is what the employees did time and time again. The funny thing is we had planned to return later this year and book one of there much larger suites,but as of know we will not. 
 Outside of the hotel and it's employees behavior and I was incredibly upset about the lack or actually no communication,we placed a room service order for breakfast and quite literally 2 min later decided we wanted to go out instead. We immediately contacted room service to gently make sure it would be ok to cancel since there is no way the could of started the food,they behaved as sure fine and the. 45 min later brought the food anyways and tried to charge us for it even though we sent it back and had informed the. If the change immediately after ordering.. 
  Upon checking in and getting into our room we awaited our bags to be delivered (we had been given two different times 10 min and 20min)no worries ,it's a big hotel and we understood.So 10,20and the. 30 min passed ok well a few minutes after they said but (we could wait to eat),45-50 min later still no bags so we call the front desk and they very rudely said that the ticket we had given to the check in person was never put through and we would have to wait,finally over an 1 hrater our bags finally arrived.
 There were a few other little things but those and the prior frustrations are not what would keeping us from staying here again,it was the prior mentioned behavior that ruins it for us. So thank you Venetian,you made it very clear that the there are other special occasions people come to vegas for and that is why I do not try to even do anything a little nice and behave kindly,you made it abundantly clear that our money is not good enough for you and made it crystal whom you considered a valuable guest

This is a lovely hotel. I was here with my best friend riding on her tab. That being said I do not think I would ever stay here unless that were the case. Someone else chose it and was likely paying for it. I dunno, It needs something. Like WiFi, cable or a stereo in the room. It was always so so so quiet in the room. They charge to listen to music on the t.v. or watch the t.v. and ten dollars for two hours is too much for t.v. music if you ask me. I found the decor to be bland as well. It kind of felt like I was at my Mom's apartment were she more conservative. The bathroom is freaking rad though. A separate room for the toilet. A stand up all glass shower with body jets as well as a separate tub that two people can easily fit in. A vanity complete with stand up cosmetic mirror with built in light. Two sinks and lots of marble. Bathroom was pretty gangster. 

I liked how spacious the rest of the hotel was but decor was boring and the beds could be more comfy for how much the hotel costs.

I give the Venetian an additional star for stellar customer service. Housekeeping was fantastic as well as room service. Every morning they would come in and line up our shoes, straighten our toiletries and just generally make us feel very looked after. The hot tub was too chlorinated for me to spend much time in but the pools were very pretty. 

Many of the hotels in Vegas pump some kind of scented deodorizer through the buildings. Likely to mask cigarette smoke. The Venetians was actually the worst I smelled though. So strong. 20 minutes in the lobby would be enough to give me a headache. I joked that the front fountain was full of febreeze not water.",0,0,0

The halls of the Venetian are lined with high-end shops, and the roof is painted to look like a somewhat cloudy sky. The casino looks great, although I've never gambled there. I usually walk in through the first story entrance from the strip, and take the escalator up to the entrance of Tao.

However, this recent experience completely was totally unlike all others.  I have stayed at more than a couple of hotels in Vegas, and this was truly the worse stay...ever. 

Day 1: room #1,  felt the springs in the mattress. Was told room would be changed in the morning. Fine.

Day 2: room not changed but was changed promptly when we asked.  We walked into our new room (#2) and has not even been cleaned! When we called the front desk, we were placed on hold except they never came back on the line.  We called them again and they told us they would send housekeeping.  Why would i want to stay in a room when I've seen how dirty it was!  We had to physically go back to the front desk, tell them again what happened and have our room switched out, yet again.  
Day 3: We come back to our room (#3), and SURPRISE! our key doesn't work.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt, switched out our keys at the front desk and it still didn't work! At 2am, this is seriously really irritating.  We had to stand outside our room waiting for security to open up our room.  Even more irritating was the fact that the front desk kept calling our room.  The room we couldn't get into!

Finally, we decided to call to let the hotel know how dissatisfied we were with our stay.  We weren't expecting to get anything out of this except to voice our distaste.  However, the result of that conversation was the hotel offering us ""complimentary late check out"" when we already told them we will be checking out at 7am the next morning. My friends and I come to Vegas more than a couple of times a year.  In the past, we have stayed at the Venetian as invited guests and had a wonderful experience.  Since this trip was a business trip this time, we booked our rooms like any regular guest and received this kind of crap service.  For a hotel that claims to be ""the world's largest five diamond resort and casino and sets the standard for four-star Las Vegas hotel accommodations"" they completely missed the mark.

The room was expensive, but excellent. Offering views of the strip, and beyond comfortable accommodations. Personally, I was happy as soon as I stepped foot into the room, with modern and clean set-ups, and a pleasant lay-out. 

The location was perfect. With all the hot clubs only a short walk away, and the hotel literally on the strip, it truly made my birthday a memorable one. Their casino never died! You could walk in there and it'd be just as packed as any hour of the day... and trust me, I walked through the place all hours of the day! All types of crowds, but mostly the rich and beautiful. An amazing experience! Definitely check it out!",1,1,0

The customer service is one of a fly by night setup. After booking four suites and staying there for four days, it never changed, but got worse as each day progressed. At check in the special request for our rooms were not done. We spent over 30 minutes trying to figure out why things were not accurate after booking each room weeks in advance. The rooms as mentioned by another review were substandard, and I was not impressed at all. On our third day we got harassed by the valet parking workers, and were accused of not being hotel guest. After a major scene was caused and lies were made, my car was then vandalized by them. I had left my car with the valet for less than 5 hours. They completely scratched off my tags and license plate.

It's a nice hotel, the casino area is pretty and fancy, and if you've never been here, definitely walk through to get a semi-luxurious feel for the place.

So, why 3.5 stars? Well, I've not a big fan of fake blue skies, and the shoppe at the Venetian feels a little crowded and a little bit cheesy\/unrealistic to me. This is probably from the slightly narrow walkways thronged with people, and the canal.

Lavo and Tao are located here, as well as the Tao Beach. We enjoyed the gelato stations and of course the Gondola rides!

My wife and I stayed for the long Memorial Day weekend.  Great lobby and nice hotel staff got things off to a fun start.  They have a nice selection of good restaurants, the pool area is not a large pool where people are trying to hook up, and the rooms are grand.

A few things that really knocked our experience down from where it should have been.  First, when we got to our room, something smelled funny.  I finally tracked it down to some leftovers a previous guest had left in the fridge.  And by leftovers, I mean stink wad of mold-covered something.  I called down, the guest desk apologized meekly, and they sent someone to pick it up from the spot I put it outside our door.  

Next, we were originally booked at the Palazzo.  They asked if we would move to the Venetian and I said sure to be nice. The room was still fine, but the bellhops had a bad attitude about having to make the trip.  One asked if we'd just pull our car around to the Venetian so he wouldn't have to walk so far.  I told him no thank you and that the hotel asked us to work with them.  He didn't complain any more, but the damage was done.  

Last, when I checked us out at the desk, there was a bill for dinner at the Grand Lux Cafe and about nine beers on our folio.  Problem was the dinner charges were while were were eating with our families elsewhere in the hotel.  And neither my wife nor I drink.  I told them it could theoretically have been my 5-year old, but she never smelled like beer and it's hard to imagine her picking up a drinking habit so early in life. The charges were reversed.  Still, one doesn't expect those kinds of shocks at a hotel the caliber of The Venetian\/The Palazzo.

Again, it is generally a very nice hotel that just misses on its execution.  Oh, and the pervasive cigarette smoke made us yearn for Denver or San Diego.  Not the hotel's fault on that though, and we ended up making rounds in th Canal Shops and Forum Shops a lot to avoid the smoking.

My wife and I agreed we would probably try the place again if there were a deal, but will otherwise look at Bellagio, Wynn, or the like, next time we visit Vegas.",2,3,1

Honestly can't compare the 2 since I can't remember that trip since it was like 5 years ago...but there are a few things I didn't like about the Venetian. First off omg why are the rooms so dark. After staying in the Langham which had amazing lighting I felt like I was in a basement bedroom it was so dark in there. Another thing was I get carpet can get gross but to step in sections that were ""harder"" then others grossed me out. My husband's biggest issue is...why aren't there coffee machines in the room? We ordered 2 cups of coffee & it was $25 the first morning we were there. I wasn't happy about that charge. Next morning my husband ordered 1 cup & they didn't like that it was such a small order so they told him 1 hour to 1 & a half hours for a cup of coffee! Are you serious? Well so much for great service. I doubt I'd go back to the Venetian next time. Maybe if they remodel it I'd consider it.

You can read other reviews, as well as check out the photos of the suites and see that this place is pretty fancy inside and out. There were a couple things that I feel they need to do, granted these are just minor things, but everyone has the ability to improve. 

1) Ice machines. It is like a maze to find them, and there is only one on each floor. That may sound like enough, but when you take a walk around this building, you can understand my frustration. There were countless times we just drank our liquor at room temperature because we couldn't find the damn thing. If you're listening Venetian, hook a sistah up with some more ice machines. Or at least signs helping to find the one treasure on the map.

2) Mini Bar. Can we just have a mini fridge without being charged for everything in the bar when remove your items?? Luckily the receptionist warned me or I would have been rather upset if they charged for everything in the mini bar. She explained that they are weighted in, and once removed your card on file is automatically debited. Yikes!!

Other than those two minute details, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Venetian. The pool looked absolutely stunning, and I was hoping to take a dip in it, but it was far too cold when we went... That only means one thing. I shall have to return!",0,0,0

1) CASINO
The Venetian is one of my FAVORITE places to play.  Their $25 3-2 double deck blackjack tables have generous rules. (DD any 2, split up to 4 aces, DD after splits)  Only hitch that you might notice is that the pit tables ""hit on soft 17""... but if you're willing to take your game up a notch, they offer ""stand on soft 17"" in high limit at $100 min.  
...Some folks, including the people at VegasTripping have a bug up their ass about the Sands calling it ""artificial"" and claim it has ""lousy table ambiance"".  Well, screw you VegasTripping.  While you might whine about the lack of character in the casino, I look at the only things that matter:  The table rules & how busy the casino is.

2) RESTAURANTS
There's a fair amount of good food here.  
...Here's the good restaurants:  
Bouchon, Delmonico, Valentino, Canyon Ranch Café, Riva Poolside, and ""Woo"" over at the Palazzo. 
...Here's the bad ones:
Aquaknox, David Burke, Tao, Postrio, or virtually all of the restaurants in Palazzo. (Except Woo)
I have exceptions made for Grand Lux Café, Cocolini, and Noodle Asia.  They aren't ""first class"" restaurants but they are open late and provide a nice respite from the tables.

3) COMP PLAN
Club Grazie, their comp card, sucks.  I frankly don't know why anyone would play slots at the Venetian: My experience has been that they're fairly tight.  Although unlike Harrah's, they still have Monopoly & Wheel of Fortune which are favorites of many players.
...But when it comes to the table play, if you consistently go to the pits with $50+ average bets with a $2000+ bankroll, you'll get some nice ""as available"" 3-4 day invites.  $100+ and $5000+ bankroll and you'll get close to RFB fairly easily.  More than that and you're hitting what they classify as high rollers... let me be the first to welcome you to the Varsity team!

4) ROOMS
This is the thing I love.  The rooms are not just comfortable - they're PRACTICAL for business patrons.  Here's a few examples:
-- PRINTER:   The printer is an all-in-one fax\/scanner\/printer\/copier and has a USB cable off of it so that you can print from your laptop if you want to print your flight confirmation or your Vegas.com tickets. (Note: Wynn's printer lacks a USB cable!)
-- ROOM SERVICE:  Awesome at the Venetian.  The food from room service is just top notch.  Try the crab club. Yum.
-- REMOTE CONTROLLED BLINDS:  And drapes too.  Everything is controlled by an RF remote that will open and close both your roman blinds as well as your drapery.  Great for those ""mornings"" where you wake up at 1PM.
-- INTERNET:  The bandwidth charges are $9.95 for 24 hrs which blows but it's a consistent 1.5Mb which is more than I can say for the Wynn or Caesars where is an effing crapshoot as to how much bandwidth you'll get.  
-- POWER:  Lots of power outlets near the desk!  Charge your cell, laptop, media player, Bluetooth headset, razor, wife's cell... get it?  You don't have to search the room for another power jack.
-- WATER:  The water pressure is solid and the hot water kicks in in less than a second.  

CONCLUSION:
I love the Venetian, dammit... and to hell with the people that think it's 'fake'.   Like ANYTHING in Vegas is 'real'?  The only things that matter to me:
- casino table odds
- room amenities
- comp plan
- restaurants
... are all top shelf.  If you want to bitch, go across the street to Caesar's and get swindled out of your cash at the tables and get crappy rooms with lousy facilities, dammit.  That's just one more room vacancy for me to take advantage of.  Dammit.

5-stars, dammit!

INSIDER TIPS:  $20 FRONT DESK TIP & LATE CHECK OUT
Be sure to discretely tip the front desk $20 to have them upgrade you from a 5th-9th floor room that overlooks the parking structure to one closer to the 21st-27th floor with a strip view.  Trust me - the parking structure view is just plain depressing.  For success rates, visit:  http:\/\/www.frontdesktip.com\/fhotel.php?id=25.  
... I've been told by an unnamed source that a good solid tip at the front desk or with any back of house staffer (room service, bell hop) will result in a favorable 'note' on your reservation, serving as a notice to other employees.  i.e. Your level of service is met according to your level of generosity and that generosity may have history.  So go to the front desk, and change $40 into $5 bills and 10 $1's.  
... Also, for late risers:  Check out time is 11AM but if you call the front desk they'll tell you that they can extend it to 12Noon.  Very consistently, I've found that if you put out the Privacy sign, 12Noon really means closer to 1PM or even 2PM because no one comes to clean your room or anything.  Nothing extra is billed to your room and no one hassles you.",14,4,5

First, you can go and party like a rock star where you indulge your inner gangsta\/diva and show up wherever you land with style and swagger, or pack yourselves in- 8 to a room, stay off strip, and bargain hunt... If option two is your idea of a good time, you best take your fanny pack and perm and move on!  

When I go to Vegas- I like to feel like high roller, not just look like one.  Venetian is my favorite hotel on the strip, and trust me I have stayed at most of them.  Every room is a beautiful suite with upscale furnishings.  I adore the huge bathroom with marble floors and French double doors, huge Jacuzzi tub, large stand up shower and the lovely vanity and stool for all of my beauty supplies, which are key for my Vegas transformation!  Clearly I spend the most time in the bathroom!  But the living room and bedroom are fantastic too.  Two large plasma TV's, Wi-Fi, and plenty of closet space comes basic at any room here with the option to upgrade if you're a baller. At check-in request a view of the strip.  They charge more for rooms on that side, but if you ask at check-in they will hook you up if they can.  The service is great here.  The beds are comfy, the sheets are crisp, the casino smells like pleasant perfumed air- not cigarettes and there are not a lot of ghetto people staying here- just a few! :) Hey- it's Vegas, you can't control everything!   .  The hotel itself is stunning.  Its opulent and lavish and totally over the top amazing- don't forget to look up to see the replica of the Sistine chapel ceiling.  Why go to Italy when you can go to Vegas?!  

I don't gamble- I shop, and I love to shop in Vegas.  I heart that Venetian is hooked up to three really wonderful malls.  I can walk from the hotel to Fashion Show, my favorite mall in Vegas.  Fashion Show has a Nordstrom... just saying.  Not that you need to go to Fashion Show because if you stroll the shops between Venetian and Palazzo (both casinos have their own malls) you will find two fabulous malls with every store you ever needed including a Barney's New York, Sephora (its near the wax museum), BCBG, MAC, Michael Kors (my favorite store to visit in Vegas) and many many others.  

Another reason I adore Venetian is because they have a fabulous scene.  I have great affection for the beautiful pool!  I have spent entirely too many days having a spectacular time out there... In addition they have a great spa, great restaurants- especially Grand Lux at 4 a.m., dope clubs- Lavo and Tao... It's just a great time all around!     

I have stayed at Bellagio and MGM Lofts (my friend hooked that one up), which would be my next choices by the way, but for the past 4 years Venetian is my first choice in Vegas.  Hopefully I'll see you there! xo",3,2,3

Suite was extremely clean and beds are so comfortable even the pull out sofa bed was pretty comfy. Convenient shops and restaurants in hotel. If you haven't visited the location where they have the gondola and shops where it looks like your outside you must see it at least once, it's very pretty! 

Also, it's a journey from the time you check in, until you get to your room. You have to take one elevator up to a certain floor that all the suites are on, walk a mile and then take another elevator up to your floor level. Also when we arrived we were told that our luggage would be delivered in 10 minutes and it took 30 minutes, I normally wouldn't mind the longer wait but we were on a time crunch and needed our clothes.

In our roomy Bella two bed queen suite we didn't have a mark on the walls and the white woodwork looked as if it had been maintained quite nice. Our view wasn't too bad but I would of preferred to get a little bit more sunlight.

HAHA. So that weekend, according to the Venetian, I was instantly married with a child. 

The only HUGE problem I had with the hotel was when you go down to the casino the air freshener spray they use smells like old granny floral perfume. It gave me such a HUGE headache everytime I went down there.

The only downside was that they did not check me in until 5pm. I was there for an early checkin at 12 and also did the $20 trick on the front desk girl. I was upgraded to a strip view room, but I was also roomless for a couple of hours... which was not cool to say the least.

Stayed 4 to a room, which was plenty of space. All 11 of us were able to hang out in the living room area of one suite.

The property is huge & confusing, LOL

Great gym. You get charged up the wazoo for your resort fee-- might as well use it!

Too cold for the pool, but we did hang out by the Palazzo pool deck for an hour or so in the sun. You get to use Venetian or Palazzo amenities.

We went to the Tao club. At 44, I felt a little olde & wanted to protect all the drunk younger women. I had fun, but perhaps that means it's not very hip...

Canyon Ranch Spa is AWESOME!!!! Def book a treatment, if you like to be pampered

The towels and robes were horrible-cheap and rough. The bedsheets too- very low threadcount.
Coffee lovers...beware. No coffee pot in the room. You have to travel a mile to get your morning java. Sure, you can order coffee for 9 bucks for 1\/2 a liter.....but you will still wait more than 45 minutes for it. By the time it gets to you, it's cold!
Tip: Check your bedsheets before laying on them---mines were filthy.
This hotel gives you a great first impression-it's beautiful. But if you stay sober ( which most people find hard to do in Vegas), you'll""ll slowly realize it's not worth it.

Marble everywhere--the roman blinds are operated by a handheld remote control! The suite was shiny clean and in tip top shape. I believe their best rates are offered on-line. 

My only complaint (other than the non-paying slot machines!) would be their slow response to room service requests. It took an hour and 15 minutes to get breakfast today.

The Venetian...I LOVE it here.  Out of all the hotels I've stayed at, I prefer to stay here.  Granted I've never stayed at the Bellagio or the Wynn...yet.  But I have stayed at a lot of others.

The Venetian is just beautiful.  The rooms are awesome!  It's an all suite hotel and the rooms are big.  The room has two levels with about 3 steps separating the levels.  The bathroom has a small tv in it.  There is a shower and a tub.  The curtains are automatic.  The rooms are clean.  What else is there to say...

When you walk into the Venetian, you'll be able to smell it.  I can't put my finger on it, but its a good smell.  My friend and I LOVE eating at the Grand Lux Cafe.  They have all kinds of food.  My favorite is the carbonara.  Phantom of the Opera is a GREAT show!  

I would of gave this hotel\/casino 5 stars but it deserves 4.  Here are my reasons.

1)  There was 1 time where we asked for a non-smoking room and it smelled like smoke.  Almost as if someone had smoked a cigarette just before we came.

2)  Once in a while you'll get a room where something is broken, like a lap or the electronic curtain.  A lot of the times, the sink clogs.

3)  The dealers are not very friendly.  Come on dealers, smile or give me some dabs once in a while.  Geez!

4)  It is super duper hard to earn comps now.  A couple years ago, we would normally receive free room stays but now, nothing.

All in all, I would prefer to stay here...BUT it is pretty darn expensive.  Now that we don't get comps, we normally stay else where.",12,11,9

It has everything- fantastic suites, restaurants and shops within reach sans ridiculous cab fares, and now- the Palazzo linked with even MORE fantastic restaurants (see following posts). 

Venetian's luxurious comfy suites don't have that removed ""hotel"" feel, whilst still providing a pampering touch at every corner that reminds you that: Yes, you're still on vacation, and that your bedroom will never be as perfect as this when you go home. Our suite on the 21st floor was renovated with updated new lighting fixtures and new upholstering on the L-shaped sofas. Same flat screen TVs in both the sitting room and the bedroom (still 10 feet away from one another). Very convenient for uber lazy folks such as myself. My only gripe was that although the TV in the bathroom was a nice touch, it was not visible from the bathtub (unless you were to lie down at the faucet end rather than the intended way). Showers had great water pressure, the vanity is still every girl's dream, and the double faucets were spacious and well-lit. 

The remote-controlled shades (which provided pitch-black darkness like no other) were what made this room heavenly to stay in. Thanks to the 5,000- ply shades, we got to enjoy the plush Heavenly bed until well past noon. 

Other perks: with our hotel package at $189 per night on a FRIDAY and SATURDAY stay, we also enjoyed two complimentary passes to the Canyon Ranch Spa, $20 match-play, and in-suite breakfast (eggs\/ sausage\/ pastry basket\/ OJ\/ coffee\/ hot tea\/ lemon + honey to soothe our parched throats \/ cute jam jars).

I came to Vegas to get married and have a honeymoon.  People told me if I let the hotel know that they would make it special.  They did not do anything extra for us but then again they were not obligated to.

What really reflected my rating of this place was the way they handled our air going out on us.  The room we stayed in had problems with the air not working.  This is an upscale expensive hotel so you would think they would have immediately moved us.  This is not the case.  The first night someone came and did something to the air which did not make much of a difference.  The second night we called again and once again someone was sent to our room.  This time the guy they sent told us he could not fix the problem with us still in the room as it would be noisy and take awhile.  We were moved into another room.  Once again, seeing as this is a pricey resort you would think for the inconvenience they would have moved us to a better room or did something nice.  If you think that you would be wrong.  We were moved to the same version of our suite even though we had to pack and move in the middle of the night.

I just don't feel they did anything to try to wow us considering this is supposed to be an incredible place to stay.  It really was not.  They did remove the resort fee over the air but that was it.

Having been eclipsed by the Wynn and Bellagio and, nowadays, the Cosmopolitan in terms of sheer buzz, it's increasingly likely that you can find great deals here on traditional booking sites like Orbitz or discount sites like Priceline. And if you do find a deal here, it's well worth the splurge.",1,0,0

The hotel is beautiful... the lobby is incredible. Beautiful elevators (there are 6 elevators, two halls, so you never have to wait long for one!) I especially loved the fact that the elevators were playing music from Phantom of the Opera (I rode the elevators a few extra times just for the music alone!!) 

I loved our room. It's like living in your own luxurious mini apartment, sans kitchen (but there's room service available, so who needs a kitchen??) BEAUTIFUL bathroom (I wish I could redecorate my own bathroom at home the same way). 

The crowd at the Venetian is extremely friendly. Every time I wandered away and came back to check on the bf, he was in the middle of a conversation with another nice person. He even managed to make some new BFFs while I was at the outlet. Same goes for the dealers (Jamie, Shawn, and Annie on the blackjack tables; Miko on the pai gow tables).

The casino on the Venetian side is ALWAYS full\/busy (the Palazzo side seemed a little empty from time to time). The casino at the Bellagio never looked like it was full, either. Same thing at the Stratosphere. It definitely looks like the Venetian is the center of activity! :)

Phantom of the Opera is currently playing at the Venetian. All I have to say is: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. In fact, I'm planning on watching it again. AWESOME cast!!",4,1,2

To be honest I did go check out the room before the family arrived.  When checking in I was told it was ready but when I got up there, it looked like only half the place had been cleaned.  I called housekeeping, letting them know there was still dirty used towels on the floor, garbage to be taken, and new towels were needed.  Well someone came to bring new towels, he had no cart with him to finish the room.  I asked if he could at least grab the dirties off the floor and he still left a used bath mat and a used wash cloth on the floor.  So much for housekeeping.
     Can't say much for the rest of the hotel but it does smell pretty gross.  Anyone who says they can't smell that perfume stench must have something wrong with their sniffer.  Don't bother playing blackjack on the machines, there is no parlay button, and that's not very fun.  I signed up for a players card and was given nothing, while my husband signed up for a card and got 25 bucks in free slot play.  I did enjoy the Grand Lux Cafe and the coffee shop near the garage.

I stayed at the Venetian 11\/17-11\/19 (too short) I took my parents for their 44th wedding anniversary.

I originally booked my reservation through Travelocity and got ""upgraded to a ""venezia Bella suite"" but then I started to read reviews about the Venezia tower, and really did not think it would be convenient for my parents to stay in  that wing as they call it. The Venezia tower is not renovated, it's older and reviews weren't as good. I wanted to give my parents a wonderful experience for their first time in Vegas, and at the Venetian.

I called the hotel numerous times to ask about different suites, wheelchair availability. Early check in etc...and I probably should've got everyone's name that I spoke with, because everyone that I spoke with on the phone was absolutely AMAZING! I explained my concerns about staying in the Venezia tower and taking 3 elevators just to get to the room, and they completely understood. I did have to call Travelocity as well to make the request to be upgraded to the remodeled rooms. The venetian and Travelocity were both on the same page. My request was in, and all I had to do was check in, and hope that my request was approved.

We arrived on Tuesday around 10am, and decided to wait til about 1130 or noon to check in. (Early check in fee was waived) The bellhop was our first staff interaction, and for the most part they were very friendly and helpful. The second interaction was with the girl at the reception desk. Now I was going to try the ""$20 sandwich"" trick in case our room had not been upgraded, but it was. The girl was able to find my reservation right away, and said that our room had been upgraded to the newer renovated rooms , and no charge was applied. There was an actual welcome letter waiting for us when we arrived. It was awesome. Check in was quick and convenient. The only thing was that I asked the girl how much an even bigger suite was going to be, and she said don't worry about it, I'll take care of you, so naturally I got happy, and excited. But then she gave me the room keys to the 8th floor. Pool view, which wasn't too bad, but it was all the way at the end of the hall. And it was a regular Bella Queens suite,  it wasn't the bigger suite I had asked about,  that she hinted we were were going to get. That was a little disappointing, but the bella suite was still nice. I did call to have our rooms switched because of how far down from the elevators they were, and our rooms got switched pretty fast to floor 20 this time. Suite 20-108. It was much better. The suite was very clean, and spacious, and did not smell like smoke or anything. Had a view of the pool and the palazzo and partial strip. I had so many requests, anything from more towels, to more blankets, to someone making our heater a little warmer, all of them were met by the lovely staff at the front desk! The bellhop that delivered our bags was a little upset because I only had $2 in cash. (Sorry dude but you didn't have time snatched it outta my hand) I'm so happy that most of the staff met all of our needs, without having attitude or seeming frustrated with our requests. My parents had a wonderful time! They really enjoyed the whole hotel. It's a beautiful establishment,  and we definitely plan to go back for another visit! Maybe try the Palazzo!  We loved the Grand Lux as well and Bouchon! Yummy!

The only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the beds, that were not as comfortable as I expected them to be. They were a bit firm, and possibly not new, my back still hurts today. And my mother left with some back pain as well. 

The bellhop for snatching the $2 out of my
 hand.

The door lock did not work properly, had to have my keys changed a couple of times, that was a bit annoying.

The woman who had a bit of attitude when asking for a later check out than 1pm. She said 1pm is the latest complimentary, after that I have to charge you  $75 ma'am, nothing I can do about it.

And the girl who checked us in, which made it seem like we were getting a bigger suite. Although I offered to pay for a bigger room, and when she said don't worry about I'll take care of you, I thought we would've gotten a bigger suite.  But we didn't. 

And lastly because we didn't even get any special little perks, even though it was my parents 44th wedding anniversary. Like some chocolates?  Bottle of champagne?  Fruit basket? A better view?  Lol I don't mean to complain. But it would've been nice. 

Hopefully next time we visit, we get a room with better beds!

Would even love a complimentary suite upgrade! 

Thanks for a nice time Venetian! Hope to see you again real soon!",1,2,1

Upon opening the blinds we had a view of construction, and a dead animal carcass. I immediately contacted the concierge to request a room change. I was waiting on hold for a long time. My husband went down to the lobby, while I waited on hold, to see if he could get better results going to the front desk. I remained on hold. I spoke with 2 different managers that were extremely rude, and told me that they had no available rooms to change me to. They didn't care about anything I had to say, and basically it was too bad. My husband spoke with someone at the front desk and they told him there was a room available facing the strip but it would cost extra, which would have been perfectly fine. However, when the person tried to request the room she stated that there was a note on our booking stating that we could not be moved. What a terrible way to begin our trip. 

Next, we had access to a private pool that was open later than the other pools that we decided to go relax in. Well, guess what, there were drunk people jumping over the gate to sneak in. One of them tumbled over on me while I was sitting on the pool chair. Another threw up directly behind me. We gathered up our belongings and left. I immediately contacted the front desk. I was told that such behavior is expected because ""you are in Vegas."" I explained that it was a private pool and not a free-for-all to come in and swim, otherwise why bother paying the extra money to stay in certain areas of the hotel. Again, the staff totally didn't care.

Then, when I pulled out the extra blanket from the closet, it smelled like cigarettes, and was stained! I didn't even bother letting anyone because I doubt anyone would have cared.

It was truly disappointing. It was my daughters birthday, and it really was a huge disappointment that the vibe was so negative at the Venetian, especially when you pay so much to stay there.

I will not be back again. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will stay at another hotel on the strip. Take my advice, STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.",4,2,1

Wow, this place is gorgeous!

Stayed here for a business trip and was Wow-ed!  Been to Vegas 2 times before and have loved all the hotels I've stayed at, but the Venetian is over the top.

When my co-worker and I got to our room and opened the door we were literally jumping up and down like 2 kids in a candy store. We had a living room and all! The bathroom...incredible!! Huge bath...stand up shower, TV...I was loving it!! 

The pool was incredible! It was 90 degrees! The hottest it's ever been when I've been in Vegas. Loved it! 

Had a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in the hotel...was very pricy $6 for my small chai latte.  The shops are gorgeous, lots of high-end stores.  I loved the location as well, usually stay more North on the strip so this was a nice change.

A minor gripe tho is free wi-fi in the suites! Come on, how are you gonna charge $13 a day for wifi when people are spending serious $ to stay here. I hate when hotels do this.  Should be included. They did have free wi-fi in certain areas which was nice, but still annoying.

Still, the time we spent there was fantastic.

We were in Vegas for a joint bachelor\/bachelorette party; the first of our group arrived on Wednesday, and when they checked in they asked the concierge if our room could be next to or across from theirs.  When we checked in Friday night it turned out to be exactly that (across)!  Very convenient and accomodating.

The room itself was amazing.  WAY more than necessary for me and my boyfriend; we had the smallest room which still came with a pullout couch, so if you want to save money you could definitely fit more people in.  As it was with just the two of us though, it felt really luxurious.  Bed and pillows were comfy, and I love that they had a shower, bath tub, two sinks, and a vanity!  We did use the pool on Saturday morning.  Not a lot of people actually swimming, but the pool is heated so the water was warm (the weather was rather chilly, but okay in the sun!).

There was both a tub and living room for us to relax in.

The hotel is in a perfect location on the strip. I really enjoy it for gambling because it has a high class gambling area but also places like the casino royale are right next door if you want a different more up beat crowd or lower stakes.

The check-in\/out was quick and easy. The hotel has everything you need without even leaving the casino if you don't want to.

walking through this hotel feels like you are taken back in time to some ornate venetian palace complete with sentries guarding the way. they kind of freaked me out late at night when i was coming home from the club but i was also glad they were there.

the gym by canyon ranch is also really nice if you are weird like me and work out when you are in vegas. they also had a pretty reasonably priced little cafe in there serving healthy spa type eats.

bottom line: love this place and will definitely stay again!",1,1,1

I did not hear late night parties, music or hall noise (which for me is a big plus). Lastly, there were great places to dine and plenty to do without ever really leaving the hotel.

Not to mention housekeeping forgot to provide us with Robes. And the iron there was OLD and leaking water\/broken. The sheets were't that comfortable, although the bed was alright. To call the front desk I had to wait for like 15 minutes.

I want to take out my clothes and have somewhere to put them like a DRAWER. There were not enough hangers. The hallways are pretty narrow.

Then we started to get paranoid that they had hidden cameras in the hallway and were going to add the price of the robes to our room bill.  So we figured out a way to smuggle the stolen ones out without being seen.

Your standard room is split level with an enormous bathroom equipped with double sinks, a separate vanity, separate shower and over-sized bathtub.  Your bedroom area is closest to the entrance with an armoire and closet and either two queen beds or a king.  Walk down two steps and you are in the sitting area with it's own television and sitting area.  I still am not quite sure how you would be able to watch something in the bedroom area while someone watched something different in the sitting area (it's still close enough to each other that you can hear both TVs), but that was never really an issue on any visit.

I love the entry to the hotel.  The M.C. Escher-esque floor tiles, the ornate ceilings, everything.  The casino area is great as well as are the shops and the fabulous selection of restaurants ranging from casual Grand Lux Cafe to a fancy steakhouse, seafood restaurant, Italian restaurants, french restaurants...  We ate all but one meal in the Venetian on our last visit.

They are also connected to the Sand's Convention Center which proves extremely convenient if you are there for a convention at the Sand's.  

If you go to Vegas during CES (Consumer Electronics Show), it is usually accompanied by the Adult Entertainment Convention coupled with the AVN Awards.  I've never seen so many old men in brightly colored alligator jackets and no shirt underneath with women with boobs the size of basketballs hanging on their arms all in one place at the same time.

And to compliment my true uber dork generic convention uniform (polo shirt with company logo embroidered on it somewhere with the convention dog tag hanging around your neck with some company's logo imprinted all over the necklace), the Adult Entertainment show had similar attire, but their logos were for adult entertainment related companies - however, if you didn't look closely, you never would have realized that they weren't there for CES.

Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs).

We checked in late as our flight got in at 6pm.  Brandi greeted us upon arrival...everything ran smooth at check in, we even got our Bella suite with requested sleeper sofa.  She gave us a map of the place explaining where things were (as I told her I've definitely got lost wandering around in there before) and we were on our way... One thing I didn't think we needed was the resort fee, though the people I traveled with wanted it and a PLUS is that it was optional...some hotels don't give you an option of purchasing it.

Our room was FABULOUS!!! The ONLY problem I had was that all of the outlets in the bathroom didn't work...For a moment I thought my Chi Iron was broken till I tried an outlet outside the bathroom.  I didn't inform the hotel because there were working outlets in the room so it wasn't much of an inconvienience.  The room also had THREE TVs!!!!  Luxury for sure...

As for other things in this hotel they have something for everyone...The Bourbon Room for some crazy karaoke craziness, great restaurants, the Palazzo attached to it, and no shortage of stores or places to eat on a budget.

I wish the weather was warmer to take more advantage of the pool, but I did go out there - all of the staff I encountered were friendly.  

The security is also good as they do check if you have a room key upon entering the elevators.  

Our last dinner was at Lavo in the Palazzo - OMG AMAZING!!!!!

Our last morning we had breakfast at the Grand Lux Cafe...our server was fabulous, she even gave us extra coffee to go after partaking in the breakfast buffet.

My parents never would have tolerated us yelling in a hotel hallway!)  The bed was extremely uncomfortable and the pillows were so flat and hard they could barely be considered pillows at all.  When I'm coming home at dawn I just want to be able to sink into a nice soft bed and drift asleep.  

The check in process was great, we got pulled out of the line and checked in upstairs at the Concierge.  If the line is long you may want to try that...go through the elevators to Bouchon and go up to L, make a left and there is a concierge desk.  (We also checked out here)  Its definitely worth a shot.  The rooms are nice and large but they were lacking in some way I couldn't put my finger on.  Dare I say it was almost faux luxury?  

Room service was quick and filling, it is definitely worth the price.  (Which wasn't that expensive, certainly not the most expensive I've seen.)

My kiddos found potato chips crumbs, and I wanted to let it slide thinking it could be one off thing. The tub has some glitters and I found blonde hair in the shower. 

But guess what the next day after all day activities, my room was made up but the crumbs still there, seriously??! So they decided to skip vacuuming-how gross can it be. How long have they been doing that you wonder. And what else that they don't clean. 

To be fair, I'm pretty picky. Even $700 a night Bellagio was disappointing to me. For as long as I paid premium for any service I expect it to be somewhat impeccable.

I've never had such difficulty staying in a hotel as I did with the Venetian. This place was supposed to be a very good hotel but it turned out to have too many flaws for me to give it more than 2.5 stars.

We stayed 1\/1 - 1\/4. Upon parking, we lugged some of our luggage to the front desk, which was a little confusing to find from the elevators since there was not an obvious sign to say where to go. Once we were pointed in the right direction, it didn't take too long to find everything.

The line to check in was about 20 minutes deep and it was about 8 - 9pm. Our concierge who helped us was cheerful but did not give us good instructions and didn't even give me my comped suite coupons for free drinks and gambling.

After looking for the suite for nearly 30 minutes, taking lots of wrong turns and looking at a confusing and non-descriptive map, we finally made it to our luxurious room, which was the best part about staying there.

Getting to the room, however, was a HUGE chore. It takes THREE elevator rides to get there before walking down a long hallway. WTF. We stayed in the Venezia Tower just above the parking garage too so that probably was a big reason for part of the confusion. They did NOT design this building very well, dang it.

Having to ask three people where to go when it should have been obvious, which was annoying and quite off putting.  Going down to get my free coupons was also stupid and annoying. Why didn't these issues become solved before they were created? Seriously! Katie Farmer, learn to do your job better!

The room was huge, two LCD TVs with HDTV. Comfortable King and Queen Pullout beds were awesome. The shower and bathroom were also great with the toilet being the only part with privacy. Oh well. Oh, and why didn't the freaking air conditioner actually stay the temperature it was supposed to say? We had to readjust it twice to get it cold enough for our comfort! Come on, Venetian.

Overall, the hotel was nice, the stay was pleasant but the experience could have been much better. I was overall unimpressed with half of it but definitely enjoyed most of the room. If you stay here, make sure you stay in the main Venetian Tower or your experience might be totally confusing.",1,2,1

I went to the pool...its crowded but hey, its a holiday weekend.  Food here is wonderful.  The place is in a great central location, too.

I've stayed in Vegas many times, but nothing compares to the Venetian. 

***Please note, DO NOT use the limo bus to the airport when you leave.  I took away a star because never in my life have I ever experienced such a rude, obnoxious driver.  We all paid our fare of $7 to get a ride to the airport.  He mis-counted his money, and made us sit there until we were late to the airport, many people missed their flights, trying to force us all to cough up another $7!  I asked for a refund so I could grab a cab and I called the Manager of guest services over to the bus.  After a quick talk, we got going and the driver said to me, ""there princess.  Are you happy we are leaving now?""****

If you were looking for me in Vegas, this is the first place you should look.  Specifically, you should look for me in the poker room.

This is probably the nicest and friendliest poker room I've played in.  The room is bright and spacious, the tables and chairs are comfortable, the dealers are social yet professional, the waitresses are efficient and prompt and there are TVs all over the walls to entertain you should you need to focus your eyes somewhere outside the poker table.

The food\/drink choices here are top notch.  Fiji water (ooh - fancy) is the water of choice here and hell, they'll even bring you out a shake if you ask for it.  They don't skimp out on the liquor either but hey - do you seriously want to be drinking at the poker table?  

If you're hungry, all the food options available at the property are available to you and they'll even bring your food out to you by the table but again - do you seriously want to be eating at the poker table?

Depending on when you show up, the action is either fast or slow.  I noticed that the room starts to fill up around 11am or so on the weekends so if you want to get a seat and don't want to wait, show up before then otherwise expect to wait a bit for your game to open up.

They have a player's card which they offer all players and you earn comp points per the time you play so if you're logging time on a card, make sure you check out when you leave the poker room or you will not be credited any hours for your play.",5,3,4

The King suite was roomy and spacious with a sunken living room, double sink in bathroom suite with stand in shower and separate tub. The window to our room overlooked the hills in the background. It was perfect. Takes about 20mins to exit the hotel because of the size (lol ok perhaps a bit of an exaggeration but still!). Lots of food and shopping options. The main pool area is amazing and is connected to the Palazzo pools which you have access to. There seems to be an unlimited amount of pools so just go exploring on this level (4). There is also a smaller pool area on floor 10 which is shaded and quieter.

We arrived to check-in at about 4:30pm, well after the 3pm check-in period. Our room was not ready; we were told housekeeping was working on it, it would be ready very soon, and would we mind getting a phone call when it was ready? 

We said OK, put our luggage in temp storage (a convenient touch, no? Only it cost us an extra tip to the bellman... petty to complain about perhaps, but hey, it wasn't our fault the room wasn't ready). An hour and a half later, no phone call. My fiance went to check the status and not ready, not ETA. We gave it another 15 minutes and then were back in line to complain. While in line, we experienced multiple people ignoring the lines and just walking up to the counter... on several occasions they weren't turned away by the hotel staff, who seemed to think line jumping is ""OK""... the patrons waiting in lines didn't find it so... and that includes those in front of and behind us. 

Once at the counter we voiced our frustrations and became insistent that our room be readied immediately and that we be compensated for our troubles. Miraculously, a room ""became"" available and we were offered $50 dining credit (which, it turns out, was noted on our account but not actually added... we had to call back at the end of our stay to have the credit applied; we'll see if it actually happens this time). 

My second big issue is that they turn off the smoke ventilation system in the wee hours of the morning. I'm a nonsmoker and this is a problem for me. The smokey smell accumulates in the room during that time period (about 3 hours starting at around 3am)... it accumulates to the point that we could smell it in our bath towels. While expect to smell smoke in the casinos, I don't expect to smell it in my nonsmoking room and I CERTAINLY don't expect it to be so bad that it is in the towels and in clothes that were never out of the suitcase. 

While overall the room was lovely, I don't think I'd stay there again: too many other options, including at least 1 hotel right on the strip with no casino, which means no smoke.",0,0,0

For my 30th birthday, I decided I'm goin' all out (mmm-hmmm). My sister recommended that I stay at the Venetian. Based on the reviews here and on other sites, I decided to go for it. i got a great deal on Hotels.com (got slot credit and other discounts, plus used my Discover Card to get 5% cashback). 

I booked a room in the Venezia tower. When we arrived, there was a looong a$$ line at the check in. Then I remembered that Venezia had its own check-in. Oh yeah! (I'm doing the Cabbage Patch right now) LOL!

There were two people in line compared to the 50 in the ""General"" line. Hehe! When we got to our room, I was excited by how the room looked EXACTLY as it did on Venetian.com. Ok... Maybe it wasn't exactly. There was a button missing from the sofa, although it looks like someone tried to hide it by filling in the empty spot with black ballpoint pen. 

There were 3 TVs - one in the ""living room,"" one in across the bed, and one in the bathroom. 

I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture. The service was great and I enjoyed my stay. We ate at Delmonico (review to come soon), and that was also a pleasant experience.

I had found a deal for $130 a night for a luxury suite so it was a great price for such a fancy hotel.

So we got a bit lost in the casino with all our luggage because the place is ginormous, but once we found the hallway to the front desk (which was beautiful and made me feel like I was walking in a palace), everything was right as rain.

The lady at the front desk was very nice and helpful. She gave us our room keys and a bunch of coupons (such as free drinks to some restaurants, free admission to the LAVO nightclub, and even 2 free tickets to see Phantom of the Opera!). We also went to the concierge's table to check out other things to do during our stay. In addition to giving us some good tips and tricks, the concierge also gave us more coupons and more free tickets to nightclubs. NICE.

The rooms themselves were very nice as well. Everything was nice and clean. The bed was huge. The extra pillows, towels, and blankets we had asked for were sent quickly. Housekeeping was also very quick, though they came a lot earlier in the morning than we expected (about 9-10am).

As for the actual hotel itself, the casino is huge and the decor is beautiful. The Grand Canal Shoppes are also very pretty with a plethora of restaurants, from a simple food court to really nice high end places. The town square would have shows with costumed staff every hour and the echoes of the gondoliers through the shoppes made me feel like I really had stepped into Venice.

However, some downsides:

- none of the TV channels had any signal. My friends and I attempted to watch some TV while we were relaxing between outings and none of the channels worked. Almost all of them said ""weak signal"" and when they had signal, they would freeze while it searched for signal. Though I suppose if you aren't going to watch TV anyway, it wouldn't be a big deal.

- the light switches were very inefficient. There was no master light switch so each light had to be turned on and off separately. Also, none of the switches had any type of label so we had no idea which switches did what. Some of the switches did nothing as well, which was annoying.

If you're in Las Vegas for work or shows, or anything other than gambling really, this is a hiccup in the experience. But, you won't have to walk through it too many times, and there are many other redeeming qualities. The conference space available--and the service--is PHENOMENAL. We needed to change presentation rooms because the one we were assigned was terrible, and I forget the name of the guy who helped us (March 12 2015), but he was a complete all star and got us a wonderful space in their sister hotel, the Palazzo. (I did have to rig up an HDMI cable directly into the TV because they only offered VGA in the conference table surface, but come on. Am I really going to Complain about that? No.)

The rooms, for $170 a night, are nice studio apartments with a couple stairs down into the living area. The desk is great, with in-the-top-surface USB charging ports and power outlets. The internet works. The room service is prompt. When I was here, I could really see how writers used to live in hotels. You could get some great work done here. 

The only drawback to the rooms is the connector between them. It's two doors (of course), but they're not well fitted to their sills. ""Who cares?""

This hotel is beautiful, clean, and has the most gracious staff.

One of the things that kind of rattled me was when they told me that everything in the bar\/cooler has a sensor, and if moved, it will automatically be charged to my room. After check in, I was still worried because we needed a cooler for the food we brought (Our traditional Christmas meal). So I approached one of their staff to double check if what I heard was true. She confirmed that we cannot use the cooler in our room, BUT she said she would do something about it. 

When we got to our suite, they sent another cooler for us to use!! That was very nice of them. I really appreciated that gesture. 

Another thing I like about the Venetian is that they do not have a buffet like every other hotel in Vegas. I think one of the reasons why Vegas hotels get so packed is because of the casinos, of course, but their buffet also plays a big part.

The following day I called the front desk and it took an HOUR to receive extra shampoo and conditioner for us, and we ended up being late to a dinner we arranged for my birthday. I complained to a manager about the middle of the night calls on a Friday night, and the extreme delay and struggle of obtaining shampoo and I was told it would not happen again. The following night we received the same issue with receiving extra blankets. I called and spoke with a manager named Erica the following day and she was unable to track down the person calling and saw how upset I clearly was and refunded me the resort fees for the inconvenience. When we checked out I was informed that they had made a mistake on their part on charging (even though I booked the hotel through booking.com) and that they would deduct it from the refund I was suppose to receive for all of my inconvenience. Nice, right ? I called today to respond an email about my refund and was put on hold for FORTY MINUTES only to be hung up on. Even after my stay at this wretched place they're still giving atrocious customer service ! I HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest staying elsewhere such as the Bellagio and only going to the Venetian to shop and dine. If you do decide to stay at this hotel it's guaranteed your stay will be ruined by their staff !!",0,0,0

The view was ehhh (we were on the wrong side =\/) and the location suckedddd. It took us forever to get to our room.

We had to use 2 different elevators to get to our tower. It was super confusing the first time around, and annoying nonetheless. But whateverrrrr... the suite was still awesome and the hotel (no one can deny) is absolutely gorgeous!

The Bella Suite is made up of  2 queen sized beds, and a living room. The couch also doubles as a pull out bed, so there's lots of room for friends or company =) 

The only thing that bothered me: the bathroom doesn't have locks. I find that to be a little strange?...Especially in a room with 2 beds. And security can get annoying. They make you pull out your key at least 3 times before you actually get to your room. It sucks when you are sharing a room with multiple people (not everyyyone has a key!). It also makes it difficult for friends to visit you.

P.S. Check in is a bitch. Try to get there early!

However, those were in my gambling days when everything was comped (free room, free food, known as ""RFB"" in casino parlance).  

The Renaissance Suites are 1980 square feet, and all feature a separate bedroom with a King sized canopied bed, and a living\/dining room with a six chair table.  It is fabulously quiet and restful in that bed in their suite bedrooms.  In the large marble floored bathrooms, you will find either a dry sauna or steam room, and layouts include either an exercise area (with a treadmill, elliptical or stationary bike) or a large screen television viewing room with a very loud surround sound stereo system that will get complaints from neighbors if you play it too loud.

However even the regular rooms at the Venetian are nice, semi-suites, and 650 square feet, with a separated by balcony lining step down into living area and step up into bedroom floor plan.

The Venetian has finally updated all of their rooms to down comforters - in the beginning years it was all Vellux blankets.

All of the Venetian rooms feature Drexel Heritage real solid wood furniture.  By way of comparison, at the Bellagio it's all particle board \/ low pressure melamine plastic furniture that looks nice but is not solid.

The Venetian is located directly across from T.I. (Treasure Island) and is centrally located on the strip.  You may cross to T.I. across a suspension bridge over Las Vegas Boulevard.  The Venetian has the Canyon Ranch Spa, all 134,000 square feet of it, which includes the only gym in a Las Vegas hotel that includes complete free weights - bench, bars, dumbbells, and the usual steam\/sauna\/jacuzzi that you will find in the spas of all premium Vegas resorts.  The gym at the Canyon Ranch Spa is on the level of a 24 Hour Fitness Super Sport, as far as equipment.  It is far above the typical hotel gym.  The spa is world class too, with massages and all sorts of treatments offered.

The Venetian features multiple swimming pools, amid a five acre environment.

The Grand Canal Shops on the Venetian side, and The Shoppes at the adjoining Palazzo resort\/hotel provide high end restaurants and shops, including some of the top designers (for Louis Vuitton though you'll have to go to the Wynn, Caesar's or the Shops at Crystals at the MGM CityCenter).  Barney's of New York is here.  Madame Tussaud's.

You may ride a gondola down the Canals.

My favorite restaurant at the Venetian is Delmonico Steakhouse (the bone in ribeye is not to be missed).  I've eaten numerous times at Zeffirino too, which is good, but not in my opinion on the level of Delmonico.  Two of the restaurants I used to frequent and liked are now closed, DB Brasserie, and Pinot Brasserie.  I guess they have it in for the brasseries.

Tao Nightclub, Tao Beach, Lipshtick comedy show - all here.

The Venetian (along with the Palazzo) feature a combined 120,000 square foot casino.  If you are a Baccarat player, as I was, you'll love its high end Baccarat room which features multiple grand and midi Bacc tables open simultaneously, which is key to winning at Baccarat because you may move to a different table when the shoe goes sour and unpredictable.  There are private salon rooms for the ultra high end players.  As far as action, the high end tables are all $100. minimum, and for the most part you'll need to pony up $25. minimum to play blackjack, mini Baccarat or craps at most any table game at the Venetian.  The slots are the same as at any casino.  The blackjack isn't the greatest odds, do you research to find the lowest house edge in Vegas because where to find the best odds blackjack table changes constantly.  The Venetian does a great job too of hiring attractive cocktail waitresses and putting them in skimpy outfits, which let's face it, adds to the allure of any casino.  Dealers, pit bosses and casino hosts are all friendly too.

You will need to play pretty high end in their casino to get anything free, but this is pretty much the same at any top resort on the strip.

The vibe at the Venetian is upscale, but not necessarily older.  All ages.

In all, a fabulous world class resort.  One downside I would comment on, and this stems from the inevitability of being a huge sized hotel, is that it is practically a two day horse ride from the check in lobby or VIP check in, to your room - down the grand foyer hall through the casino and up the elevators.  It's basically just a long walk to get from your room to anywhere else. 
 Occasionally, your electronic room key will stop working and you will be faced with either that trek back to the lobby or VIP area, or a twenty minute wait sitting in the carpeted hall for security to get to you with a new key.

The parking garage gets about as hot as hell must be in the summers.  However, as of this writing neither Venetian nor Palazzo charges anyone anything for parking.",5,0,0

We stayed in a suite which was awesome, there was plenty of space and the beds were pretty comfortable.

Also, the person who helped us with getting our bags into the cab as we headed back to the airport straight out asked for a tip, which was very off putting.

Very simply stated: It's an above average hotel that gets the job done every time and on some nights may impress, but for the most part the Venetian isn't that special.  I'm not speaking nasty about it in any way, but what the Venetian has in size and grandeur on the outside, it lacks in room quality and customer service.

The Venetian is a very solid B+ property day in and day out.  It is leaps and bounds ahead of the mid level properties in Vegas such as MGM Grand, Caesar's Palace, TI and Mirage but still a step or two (or three) behind Wynn\/Encore, Aria and Bellagio.  This is a great hotel for groups since the rooms are typically much larger and less expensive than its closest competitor (Encore Resort Double Queen).  It is centrally located and is a relatively short walk from the center of the Strip, not to mention you have access to the Palazzo without even having to go outside into the Vegas heat.

Where Venetian lacks is the fact that it is in desperate need of a renovation.  The room I stayed in (Bella Suite) was showing it's age with torn wallpaper, worn out sinks and faucet handles and a shower head that was so worn the water literally fell out of it instead of being in the form individual jets like it should.  Don't even get me started on the worn electrical outlets that were so loose my iPhone charger needed a prop to stay plugged in.  Oh and did I mention the nasty stain on the couch...?...yuck.

The Casino area and general public areas are very busy and the amount of foot traffic is second to that of Bellagio.  The chances of seeing\/hearing rowdy people in the halls is pretty high here especially for a hotel that markets itself as a 5 star resort.  I understand that this could and will occur in any hotel as it is Las Vegas, but I was surprised how often I experienced it during my stay.

I will say that the food selection is very impressive, as is the shopping and walkability of both Venetian and Palazzo.  The sports book is fantastic and arguably is one of the best in Vegas.  Tao was great and reasonably priced for what it is.

I know I'm being harsh on the property, and in all fairness it is much better than most on the Strip.  I would recommend it to a group of people (Bachelor\/bachelorette party) that is looking for a product that is better than most and priced in a very reasonable and fair range.

Allow me to relay my adventure the first night in Sin City. . . .

There were six of us, all beautiful girls, enjoying ourselves.  We went out to dinner, we enjoyed a show, we got dolled up and we were ready for some dancing action.  Being a group of beautiful girls, all we had to do to was show a little leg to get into the hottest clubs on the strip.

I got lost in the music, dancing and alcohol for hours before I realized that I was missing something essential in my small dancing purse.  Dude where's my wallet and phone?!?!  Snapped out of my intoxicated haze, I patrolled the club and harrassed security with no luck.  With nothing left to do, I returned to the Venetian tired and defeated.

My exhausted group decided to go back to the room while I inquire at the front desk about a business center.  I am a responsible mature young lady; I needed to notify my five credit\/debit cards that my wallet was missing.

The front desk lady, whose name I did not catch, was Caucasian with medium long hair, tall, thin and working the hours between 3-4 am deserves an award and to be recognized.  When I told her of my misfortune, she not only found all five customer service numbers on her computer, dialed the numbers for me and waited patiently as I struggled to talk to ppl who may not reside in the country.  Once I had my card situation figured out, I had the audacity to ask if she can call long distance to my boyfriend so I can let him know that I am unavailable. . lost phone and all.

There could never be a more appreciative drunken fool to have stumbled through the Venetian than me that night.  Yes the Venetian is a beautiful facility with great rooms and a central location on the strip, but it is that lady who has earned my loyalty.

A word about the room. . . We stayed in the Rialto suite - two full size beds, pull out sectional, two TVs.  The bathroom is large, separate shower and bath tub and private room for toilet. 

Don't worry, some extremely good samaritan turned in my phone\/wallet to security with ID, cash and credit card intact.  The rest of my trip was salvaged and there are now permanent indentations on my phone\/wallet from my death grip.",13,13,14

It's one of those places where you really need to see the place for yourself, it blows your mind and takes your breath away.  You feel like royalty when you stay there.  At least I do. :D

If you can splurge on the upgrade for the venetian lounge, you should do it.  Finger food, drinks, and free wifi... can't beat it.

Greats location, Helpful Staff, Shopping centers, upscale decorations and beautiful suites. This is a more higher end hotel that is worth the money you spent.

I wanted to make my Las Vegas Stay a memorable one, so I booked a Venetian suite. Our suite came with 720sq ft room that contained a large restroom with a living room area and a kind bed. The room had 3 TV's, one in the bathroom, living room and bedroom. Everything about this suite was high class, from the bath robs to the glassware. Our suite was located in the 4 th floor, next to the spa and massage center. We didn't do much gambling in the hotel but we sure walked around the indoor mall. The art work in the indoor mall is Breathtaking. Everything about that mall was amazing. 

Overall, we had a pleasant stay. The only thing I disliked was the room next door. It was a bunch of girls having a bachelorette party. The noise level was very high and made our experience a bit less pleasant. But anyways, the hotel was great and I highly recommend this place at least one night while in Vegas.",2,1,1

The furnishings were lovely, the bathroom was marble-clad and big enough for everyone to get ready in. Beds were comfy and could fit three people if need be. I also liked that the bedroom was separated from the living area by little stairs.

The rooms: All suites!!! How can you go wrong with that? Huge bathrooms with a separate tub and shower. The toilet is in its own room. Which came in handy on the last stay with 8 guys sharing a room. The beds? Ridiculously comfortable. Almost make you want to stay in bed all day. Almost. Nice living room area with large couch. 2 TVs, ample closet space, and a safe.  Garbage cans are good for getting ice for cooling down 1.5 liter bottles of vodka from Costco.

The hallways: Convenient pineapple slice shaped couches in the middle of the wings of the floor. Good for resting or passing out from a long night of imbibing in the last legal drug. 

The stairwells: Good for some exercise should the thought of doing that pop in your head. Try 18 floors down, then up. You'll be good for the rest of the day. 

The pool: I think they have a party pool now which is attached to Tao, but not sure. The regular pool is the shit though. There are a ton of chairs and even some pedestal beds. We commandeered one of these on our last trip and everyone else at the pool was jealous of the women we attracted to it. We were there in early spring so there were no servers for drinks, so we had to get up to get a drink. Travesty! 

The gaming: Too rich for my blood. 

Ok, so maybe some cons. 
- What can seem like the Bataan Death March back to your room. Depending on where you are situated, be ready for the long haul. 
- Grand Lux. Avoid it if you can. 
- The sandwich place at the food court. Horrible. Try the pizza joint or Noodles Asia down the way.",3,2,3

The shopping plaza with the canals is so charming. With all the shops & restaurants in this hotel you have no reason to ever step outside. ;)

We booked the least expensive room at the Venetian.  On previous trips we had stayed at the Bellagio and wanted to see what another hotel would be like.  

From the moment we arrived in the beautiful lobby, we knew this was the right place to be.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was spacious and lovely, even for three of us.  My daughter slept on a pull out sofa for no extra charge and said it was perfectly comfortable.  Our king size bed was wonderful.  We also could not hear any noise through the walls or in the hallway each night we slept there.  

When we opened the curtains, we had absolutely no view, but since we weren't there to stay and admire the scenery it didn't matter to us.  A plus was being on the fourth floor, which is the same floor as the pool.  All around very accommodating, extra towels handed to you as you enter the area.  There are plenty of lounge chairs and it was not hard to find a place to sit, unlike some hotels where there aren't enough for all the guests and people ""save"" them all day with their belongings on top.  

My brother and his teenage son also came along on this trip, and although they asked for a non-smoking room, the previous guests apparently puffed away.  They were offered another room right away, but decided to stay in that room because they were tired.  The hotel put some kind of ionizer in the room and within a couple of hours the smoke smell was gone.  We asked for extra blankets and a few others things while we were there and everything arrived very quickly. 

 Another plus is the valet area in front of the hotel.  It was very easy and not time-consuming to wait for your car.  This is one of my complaints about the Bellagio Hotel, by the way.  While it is a beautiful hotel, you could die and have your funeral in the time it takes them to retrieve your car, and waiting in their covered, underground-ish valet area in the summer might hasten your demise.  

Getting back to the Venetian, the casino areas were not overwhelmingly smoky like some of the other hotels.  For a restaurant meal the first night (hubby's birthday) we asked the hotel to recommend something.  We wanted a nice but not extravagant dinner.  They recommended First Bar and Grill.  When we found it, we thought, ""Aha, they are recommending this because it is away from the shops and gondolas so probably these restaurants need more business.""  There were only a few other diners.  Well, it turned out to be the best meal we had on the trip, with lovely, friendly, attentive service.  I had the coconut red snapper which was a thick flaky large chunk of perfectly cooked fish, with an amazing curry sauce.  My brother had a steak which he liked, and hubby and daughter both had fish and chips.  

The second night we ate at Postrito, the Wolfgang Puck cafe in San Marco Square, also very good.  The only negative about that was altho' while making the reservation I had said it was my daughter's birthday, instead of giving us a nice table where we could easily see the singers and performers they sat us in the back.  

For breakfast both days we ate at Bouchon up on the 10th floor, where we all said we had the best breakfast in years both times.  (Coffee not quite hot enough, tho').  The eggs poached medium were amazing.  If you get them on the brioche the butter sauce sinks into the brioche, but if you get them with a baguette (better choice), the eggs come sitting in the butter sauce with the baguette on the side.  They make their own butter.  Surprisingly, ordering a la carte was less expensive.  Even my fussy daughter was happy with her choice, the sourdough waffles.  My nephew had the French Toast, which was served like a custard with caramelized apples inside.

 All in all, a wonderful stay.  Everyone from the bellmen to the valets to the waitstaff and so on were a class act.  Will stay there next time, and prefer this atmosphere to the very nice but not-as-much-fun Bellagio.",1,0,1

I have to mention though that I think we got completely ripped off this past weekend 11\/11\/11. They hike up the price just because of that date or whatever reason. It's ridiculous, the price was about double. The reason why I think it was the date was because I know someone who also paid double on 10\/10\/10. 

I went for a bachelorette party and there were 10 girls, but the rooms were ridiculously expensive with 2 rooms. I'd recommend a lower-key weekend if you're gonna stay at the Venetian. Because, honestly, the price was high but the experience was the same as any other weekend. The only difference I saw in the crowd at the Strip between 11\/11\/11 and a normal weekend was that we spotted a total of 17 brides. But there's really no reason why it should be expensive.

We got to see the Venetian Penthouse Suite because we knew some guys who opted for that room. Honestly, it was a lot like Planet Hollywood Penthouse, but just more classic. There's a piano at the Penthouse and the couches are beyond comfy, but I peeked into the rooms and they are just standard. The Planet Hollywood Penthouse view was 10 fold better than the Venetian Penthouse view.

Technically I am not a five-star hotel sleeper (although I hope to one day be one), so I don't really have the proper context required to judge a hotel and award [it] five stars.  None the less, the Venetian is a fabulous hotel.  I've stayed at the Venetian a couple of times in the past.  Take away the smoky casino, the crowded gaming tables, the oodles of mindless tourists (yes I too was a mindless tourist) and what you have left is an absolutely massive, all-suite, fabulously decorated, dining destination in the heart of the Las Vegas strip.  Of course these crowded, noisy diversions are what make Las Vegas - Las Vegas!

I stayed in the new Venezia tower which is billed as a an exclusive separate experience.  I did find the new upstairs Venezia lobby to be a little more private, and I sensed incrementally finer appointments than the registration lobby for the main tower.  It was certainly interesting to ride in an elevator with only two buttons that travels fifteen floors (the new tower is built on top of the old parking garage).   

Thomas Keller's Las Vegas version of Bouchon was situated just outside the Venezia lobby before the hallway for the hotel elevators.  I'll leave the review of Bouchon for the next review, but it's those hallways that have left me fully mystified and very much exercised.  I'm not sure if it was deliberate design (can't be) or creative design that resulted in a right, straight, right, left, right, right and then the elevators.  Once on the required floor (which by the way which are actually fifteen floors higher than their number) the journey to the suites are filled with more confusing left. left, right combinations.  Now I am no fool!  I know that confusing design is an intrinsic element of good casino design, but I think this is way ""over the top.""  My understanding of confusing hotel layouts relates to dark, confusing casinos with elevators situated at the heart of gaming action to promote increases chances of luring in new (and old) gamers.   These Venezia tower hallways are already far away from the gaming action.

Regardless of the overly complicated elevator hallway layouts, the new rooms are fantastic.  Spacey floor plans, well designed lighting and fine appointments.   The step-down living room is standard in almost all Venetian rooms and it adds the perfect touch of separation for the suite.   The view was lofty but industrial, being an eastward facing room, I saw the large expanse of the Sands Expo rooftop and the massive cooling towers used for the hotel HVAC system.  Being on the 27Th floor definitely made up for the lack of strip view.

Another mystery left me wondering... when returning to the room around 4:30am (i.e. a night loaded with indulgence)  I found the beds made down and a bar of chocolate nestled next to the pillow.  Exactly how does the maid service know that no one is around at 2:30am?  Are they watching the guests?  This and the other fabulous service all contribute to what always is an excellent hotel stay, leaving me dreaming that I could come and go as I please.  

I'll definitely be back.",0,0,0

Loved the huge bathroom with the sunken tub next to the glass shower stall. Soft bed, good pillows. Two sofas, 2 sets of tables and chairs. Three TV's. My only complaint was that my room overlooked the pool and I had to hear ""Poker Face"" 5,000 times in my 3 day stay. 

The hotel:
Huge as expected. Really appreciated the food courts for us cheap bitches. The gondola along the faux canal and the painted ceiling were nice touches. Blew a wad at the Venetian glass store. Beautiful things in there. 

The service:
Good. When the iron in my room malfunctioned, they were quick to send another. Housekeeping was quiet and efficient. All the staff I encountered were very nice and accommodating. 

The price:
Well, free because I was there for my friend's wedding, so I wouldn't really know. 

The smell:
Okay, that incense-y whatever it was got old within hours. Kinda cloying, really. And why did my room - located on the 9th floor - always smell like steak? I could swear they pipe that through the ventilation system to constantly make you hungry.

The casino:
They had my favorite penny slot, which was VERY good to me (won $127 with my first 5 bucks). The cocktails servers were attentive but not annoying. 

I would definitely come back and stay here. I'd even pay my own way.",0,0,0

I've stayed in both towers, the new and the old. The newer tower is more readily accessible from the casino\/main area of the hotel, by far. The Venezia tower, which is the older one, is SO CONFUSING. Whoever designed this place originally must be getting a kick out of how many people get lost trying to navigate themselves to their room. Labryinth! David Bowie style. Why would you want your guests to take TWO elevators to get to their room? And walk down loooong corridors. A girl in heels' worst nightmare.

But overall, the Venetian is a lovely place to stay at. It's connected to the Grand Canal shops, providing several options for shopping and eating and drinking. It's also located well on the strip, and has a Walgreen's right next to it.

 I have stayed at the hotel before and have always loved this hotel.
The Venetian has so many great reviews and I agree with most of them.
That being said  my review will be more about there Concierge Level
Suites and the Conciege Lounge.
The Venetian has over 400 reviews on yelp with very little info about the
Concierge Level suites\/Lounge.
So here's the 411 for those of you who like me may want  to kick things up a notch  when staying at the Venetian.
The Concierge Suites are the same as all the other Suites in the hotel.
The only difference is they are  on higher floors , in a separate tower and all have great views.
 You get to  by pass all the other shlubs by being able to check in at the 
  12th floor Concierge Lounge.
Sitting down no less in the fancy shamcey  lounge (phish posh parden me for breathing the same air ) said with a yiddish accent.
The Concierge Lounge is very I mean very STUFFY like your sitting in a museum. The complimentary offerings as they call it  are ( continenal breakfast ) from 6am to 11am very little food a few bagels ,muffins,
coffee tea juice. ( Afternoon refreshments ) from 1pm to 4pm with allmost
nothing but a couple of tiny quarter size desserts and tea.
( Cocktail reception ) from 5pm to 8 pm is ok if your a big boozer with free
mixed drinks,beer,wine etc.The food was tiny dry tea sandwiches the kind you get at afternoon high teas. They also had some fruit ,cheese and nuts.  The funny thing is they present the food on these two tiny little end tables the size of  ones you may have at the side of your bed. 
The Concierge Lounge is open from 6 am to 10 pm  with nothing to offer
guest in between the 3 refreshments presentation not so much as an apple. One of the check in Concieges will get you a water,soda,coffee tea
to drink if you can wait untill they are free I say BALONEY !
To stay in a  Conciege level suite and vist the Concierge Lounge is a $100.00 extra per day charge on top of whatever  your paying for your room.
We did not think it was worth the money and the Venetian should be 
ashamed of there sorry Concierge Lounge.
Even the Hilton and the intercontinal hotels have a much better Concierge Lounge.     Maybe we were expecting more from such a big
5 star hotel. I want to also point out that the Concierge Lounge on the hotels website is very misleading.
It shows all of this food they never had and they  also  make it look much
nicer and bigger  than it really is.

For my extended stay! wootWOOT!

I always do enjoy staying in the 650 square feet of greatly appointed indulgence that is the Venetian. And fortunately I was upgraded to the Towers. I love the towers... with the separate elevators and lovely mini pool and spas filled with families that would love to see my ink adorned epidermis *feigning sarcasm. The one draw back is that, if you have a large party it would behoove you to get multiple keys so you can get through the security check points that cover both entrances leading to the rooms. But in our case, dealing with 4 people wasn't that hard to pull off with 2 keys.

Other than that, staying here afforded us the luxury of being attached to the newer Palazzo and the ever fun canals. I found that the Palazzo didn't quite have as many people in their half of the floor space and that the canals are just as fun as I remembered them to be... especially when you are drunk. 

Oh, and another draw back is that if you are going to party like we did, it's all that much harder to really enjoy any of the amenities that come with your room @ their prices. Staying here, as with many things, especially while drunk... are all the same in the dark.

Actually given the maze like layout, it's much harder to vacate the premises, especially while hung over.

The rooms are beautiful and the pools are honestly my favorite in Vegas! However, my last visit for my Bachelorette party did not go as expected one night. 

The security guard brutally screamed at my fiance for him saying ""hold on dude"" while reaching for his room key. His name is Preston. He got in my fiances face and was pretty much bad mouthing him, my fiance just stood there apolagizing while I had to push off this security gaurd.  I went to the front desk and you can't file a complaint there only by the security center. Which was inconvenient and ruined my fiances night...They need to work on their system a little bit better on disrespectful employees.

We booked them for a day of spa treatments and were impressed by the extra care and attention lavished upon them both by the staff.

Yes....just like everywhere else on the Strip you pay a price for the pretty. We booked them on The Venetian's very short and pricey gondola ride but they loved every moment of it and still cherish the photos.

I think the big discrepancy in the ratings with this hotel is how much each reviewer paid for their room. I paid $250\/night on a weekend. I'm sure my experience would have been much better had I paid less than $150 like other reviewers. Basically that's what this hotel is worth.

Room - big but everything feels worn and old
Staff - not very helpful, not very friendly, kinda clueless
Services - Just try calling the front desk and see how long it takes you to get through.
Casino -  many dealers are not friendly and often times rude, which can make loosing money much more unpleasant when compared to other Casinos. 


I'm sure when the hotel first opened it must have been nice but here's the problem. The rooms although big are worn down and not well kept up, but that's not even the real problem. When I stay in a 3-4 star hotel, if I were to call the front desk they pick up pretty much right away. At the Venetian your on hold for 2-3minutes. When you call for the casino you are misdirected 2-3 times before getting to the right person after being on hold. When you check in and you have more than one room, they are completely confused and not very helpful, and when you check out they still get everything wrong. 

The best thing thing this hotel has going for it are it's restaurants.",1,0,0

All their rooms are suites which is nice, with 3 beds and 2 tubs.  The bathroom is definitely one of the most spacious out of all the hotels I've been to.

You've got the Grand Lux Cafe to eat at, Tao Beach in the day, and Tao the club for night time.  All are spacious and happenin'.

The Venetian is also pretty much in the middle of the strip (and everything) I feel.  The shops are great (I love how it always seems like it's daytime despite it being late at night).  The gondola ride is sappy but you can do it once in your life, and I've even tried those oxygen bars ('eh, didn't feel a difference).

The Venetian pretty much covers all your needs (oh, and it has a casino of course.  I just try to stay away from that, unless I'm playing War.  Yeah, you heard me.  Side note: I witnessed a guy continually win at War, so much so that they had to close the table down.  It can happen).",2,2,0

I am not sure if I would stay here again. I found some other hotels on the strip with more reasonable nightly prices, more live and exciting for younger people. 

I want to come back to Vegas more frequently because of my love for poker. I was hoping to stake my loyalty with the Venetian but that may not be the case anymore.

They stay here every year and have had nothing but great experiences until THIS YEAR! We arrived, I had booked and paid for our trip on AMEX travel, prepaid for all nights (stupid) and because of AMEX plat. guaranteed a room upgrade on check in. They said, they don't honor that and all the rooms are the same. You get what you get. Mt husband had prearranged a room assignment because he sent me roses and wanted them in the room when we arrived (aww) he had the room number and everything after calling and arranging. Separately,  I had had two packages sent to the hotel and arranged for them to be delivered to the room as a surprise for him. Both perishable and for Valentine's day!! Point 1.. Chocolate dipped strawberries and a dozen roses. OK. We checked in and when my husband noticed the room we were given keys for was not the room they gave him the preassignment for, he asked if she had notes in our file. She said yes, all was taken care of but the room number was different. So our room on the 30th floor with a view he arranged turned into a room over the extractor fans of the kitchen where we smelled food frying day and night overlooking a construction sight on the 22nd floor. OK back to My packages. I quietly asked the front desk attendant if two other packages had been attached to our reservation and she looked and looked in the computer and said no. Samantha said the package department was now gone for the day (VALENTINE'S DAY!!!)  but, she would look into it and call us in our room in a few minutes. She would see if someone could find them and get them to us.
Up to our dirty stinky room. My roses from him were there. Aww. We unpacked, changed and waited. We had dinner with our friends at 7 so we called down, it had been over an hour and no call from Samantha. Oh, they say, Samantha had gone to lunch. Sorry. We asked to speak to a manager and they said the manager was also at lunch. We said we were going out, please have someone leave a message. 
Gone all evening of Valentine's evening, get back to the room, no message, no flowers or strawberries. Called down, guess what....Samantha had gone home for the day. EFFF. We went to bed. We woke up in the morning to a blinking light on the phone. The message said the roses had been delivered earlier in the day. (they were talking about my roses that he sent to ME) I called and it took the whole day to track the packages and the Manager himself had signed for the packages and kept them on his desk and gone home. My husband got rotten strawberries and wilted roses the evening AFTER Valentine's day. $300.00 worth of goods. The hotel didn't care one bit. 

The Bouchon restaurant the service is SLOOOOOWWWWWW!!! 3 hours for coffee yogurt and bread with butter and jam. 2 hours for dinner with our friends before a show and we told them we had a show, the entrees came out one at a time. most people were finished eating by the time the last guests got their meal. We were nearly late for the show. We came back and went to the Grand Luxe Café for dessert. OMG!!!! The marble floors were sooooooo greasy, that even with rubber soles on my shoes, it was like ice skating into the restaurant. The ENTIRE floor was disgusting!!! We sat down and ordered desserts. 1.5 hours of torture waiting for a biscuit to bake for my strawberry shortcake. everyone was finished with dessert, coffee, tea, and still waiting, our waitress, was avoiding having to talk to us, so one of my friends went to talk to someone. When he asked why it takes so long for one dessert, no one offered a replacement, or told us of a delay until everyone had been served and were eating for a while, he was told to be quiet and go sit down. When he got upset at being talked to like that they treated to call the police and told him to leave.  OUT OF CONTROL!!

- came to Vegas for EDC but our group was staying for about a week in Vegas
- we were a group of 6 but wanted to be comfortable during our stay
- we booked a Bella Suite, which has 2 queen beds and a queen pull out bed - it was perfect for our needs 

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- pretty grandeur

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- huge (from the lobby, to the food court, to the casino, to the many different shops, to the room itself)
- the room was very spacious and the bathroom was too
- I liked how although there was bed room for 6 people, it felt separated (i.e. the 2 queen beds had their own space and their own TV; the queen pull out had its own space with the desk, a dining table of sorts, and its own TV)

CONS:
- no locks on the bathroom
- it would take a while for housekeeping services (i.e. to request more towels as ours got dirty)
- no fridge (there is a mini bar, but it's not like you can put your own drinks or personal food to keep cool in there)
- we had more than enough time to be out and about when we checked in but our bags took a very long time to get to us in our room
- not all of the dealers in the casino are nice; some just already give you that bad vibe like they hate their life - don't project that out onto me",3,1,1

Called in for early check in and was told it was a first come first serve basis, so I asked whether rooms were available (12PM) and they said yes and to come on by. Instead of going to lunch and etc after the 4 hr drive, decided to check in and relax for a tad before making it out. This was extra convenient seeing as how we could drop off our bags and not have to really worry about that situation anymore and once the car is valeted it was great to not have anything other than exploring the strip on my mind. 

The suite was nice and I enjoyed the full L shaped couch available and 3 tvs! The bathroom had his and her sinks and a nice tub with separate shower. 

Room was really clean, linens were tightly tucked in. 

Only draw backs to me are the resort fee as it doesn't seem like I ever use internet or other amenities outside of the pool at these hotels. I think I'd come back again, but only after having scoped out a few other hotels in this price range. 

Also: the front desk staff upon check in was extremely friendly and enjoyed the brief conversation of college\/basketball.

It's a great location too. Pretty easy walk to most other hotels and tourist spots so you can see a lot. All of the staff seemed helpful and nice as well.

My only complaint is the internet. Their WiFi is HORRIBLE. For most of my stay is was pretty much useless. This is a pain if you're trying to look up Groupon deals or places to go. They may as well not even have WiFi. It was a little better if you sat by the window, but still slow. The cell service wasn't great either.

Pros about the rooms:  large suites (easily sleeps 6 people or more if needed), three TVs (there's even one in the bath area to watch while you shower!), and you have to love those black-out curtains!  Waking up at 2 pm and not knowing if it's day or night...only in Vegas!

Pros about the hotel:  Italian-inspired decor, well-located on the strip, great restaurants (Thomas Keller's and also check out Grand Lux Cafe for a late night treat), relaxing pool\/bar, and nice shops.

The Venetian is huge and like all Vegas hotels, laid out like a maze so for all you directionally challenged people like I am, beware!   

I also like to stay at the Venetian because of Tao nightclub and the convenience of getting ready in the hotel and walking downstairs to go out dancing.

I had absolutely no problems with check in (it was under 5 minutes), valet (under 10), room service, housekeeping (other than the fact that they came at 8:30 daily.  Really?  8:30 at a casino?) or any of the staff.  The place is HUGE, as has been repeated over and over, so be completely prepared to do a lot of walking (and I can't stress this enough. The rooms are FAR from the action).  The restaurants, particularly Bouchon, were probably the best I've ever tried.  The minimum table bet, for blackjack at least, is 10 dollars, but I never managed to get near a 10 dollar table.

If I have any complaints about the place is that a surprising amount of people brought their kids along, and if I've said it once, I've said it a billion times, CASINOS ARE NOT FOR CHILDREN, even if there is a disney-esque quality to the gondola\/shopping\/wandering accordian players.

We had dinner one night ad Dal Toro (in Palazzo). The meal was great & our server was prompt and willing to answer all questions; even ones that did not pertain to the Venetian or Palazzo.

The property itself is amazing, being only 2nd to Bellagio.It has a classy ambience to it.There seems to be always something going on there.A great selection of restaurants, bars and the epic Tao Nightclub.I had a free line pass and admission to Tao but i showed up around 2:45am and they weren't letting anymore people in.A great time to be walking around the casino, as you get a great view of hot chicks walking around barefoot(for those of you with foot fetishes).I was a little too inebriated to go to pool, so i will have to check that out next time.Had a great time there and would actually be willing to pay for it next time.

Another thing worth mentioning, i ordered a pizza via in-room dining and I was told it would take about 35-40 minutes.Not true at all...it came in 20 minutes!When i opened the door I was shocked to see the clone of one of the greatest Heavyweight Mixed Martial Artists of all time, Fedor Emelianenko.the resemblance is fucking uncanny.If you are an MMA fan, make sure to order food late at night and catch a glimpse of Fedor's twin, Radek.",0,6,0

We booked a suite for two nights that ended up costing almost $500\/night when taxes and exorbitant resort fee of $44\/day were included.

The suite was nice and large but beware the mini-bar fridge.  It's wired such that simply removing an item like a $6 bottle of water will trigger a charge.

A bit pricey even in off season but was well worth it.. Husband and I wanted a nice hotel with all the perks. We don't gamble but love dining and just the relaxation of a nice room we can kick up our feet in at the end of the day. Are we the norm for Vegas? No....we enjoy getting to the room early evening and watching in room movies, snacking and just kicking back. Nothing like getting away from the busy life of work and kids. We live close enough and this was our third time this year. 

A nice thing about going this year was the weather. We've always gone when temps reached triple digits so this was a nice change of pace. 

Our room was amazing. It did feel like luxury. It was clean, had a mini bar (over priced but with a Walgreens right outside the Hotel-we didn't get into it) THREE TV's....one in the bedroom (Big one) one in the sitting room (where we watched The Equalizer before dinner)and in the bathroom. Who watches in the bathroom? They always have free wifi that connected fast and great service. We even opted for Valet parking this time. Never did that before. Yes, it was a special trip. 

We walked around the whole hotel and the Grand Canal Shoppes. Or should I say window shopped. Although the hotel is a wonderful stay....shopping here was way over my budget. I don't make it a habit of shopping in Vegas. 

Would I stay here again? As much as I would love to....we're just blue collar workers. I will stick to what we know and are comfortable with, besides we typically see shows while there and I would rather spend my disposable income on Penn & Teller and such.

This is was the first in ten years that my company was going to be closed for one week, since Christmas fell on a Saturday.  So when my family and I decided to sneak away for a few days we wanted only a five-star hotel to stay at.  
 
My husband, two teenage daughters, and I stayed at your hotel from December 22 - 24, 2010.  It wasn't going to be a long stay, but we were looking for quality.  I have to say, the hotel fell short in many ways.  Below are some points that I found to be substandard of a five-star hotel:
 
Upon entering the guest elevators, I noticed the crystal chandeliers had missing or broken crystals in them.  It was quite trashy looking.
 
Upon entering my room, I was disappointed to find it dirty.  There were LOTS of scuff marks on the foot of the door and baseboards...especially in the ""bedroom"" area.  (This was room 12-312.)
 
The desk had a splintered area of wood on it that my husband sliced his ankle on, causing bleeding and discomfort.
 
There was so much wear on the lounge at the foot at the bed that the gold edging had worn off one leg.
 
My reservations were clear that there were going to be four people in the room...for which I paid $70 for.  Yet, there were insufficient linens.  I had to call down and request extra pillows and blankets to accommodate for all four of us.  On that note, there was only one set of shampoo\/conditioner\/body wash and soap.  There were only two water glasses...yet four people.  This is NOT ample for four people...even for one day.
 
The safe did not work...even with the simple instructions provided.  When I called down, I was told that someone would be up to ""reset"" it.  We waited, and waited, and waited, then finally called down and told the operator that we were going to have to schedule it for later, as we needed to get something to eat and return to the room and wait.
 
We make reservations for the Blue Man Group on 12\/23\/10 @ 4:00 PM.  I sat in the second row from the stage, in the farthest left seat.  (If you were in the audience looking up at the stage.)  The performance was enjoyable.  However, my seat was wet.   Not damp, WET.  Even wetness wouldn't be too horrible if it didn't stink.  It smelled as though I was sitting on a seat that someone had vomited on, or one that had been moist so long that it had started to mold.  I ended up using my poncho, doubling it up, to try to put a barrier between myself and the sick smelling wetness.
 
Worse of all, the second night of our stay, the movie channels would not come on.  The commercial that kept taunting us...""Stay in and watch a premium movie"" kept playing, but we couldn't due to the rental service menu.  Again we had to call for service.  However, this time, the technician was there for hours, had to try THREE cable boxes and go down and reprogram them as the person on the other line of the phone didn't know how to.  The technician left our room at 9:16 PM, too late for us to stay up for a movie.  Our night was spent watching the technician try to do his job.
 
I mentioned my dissatisfaction to the clerk upon check out, and received apologies for the inconveniences.  The employee deducted the ""resort fees"" and movie rental expense from the previous night.  I appreciated his attempt to satisfy the situation, but do feel this fell short.
 
I'm at a point where I'm going to be leaving feedback on the standard sites, including Yelp, Yahoo, Google, Expedia, TripAdvisor, Travelocity, Hotels.com, VirtualTourist, MyTravelGuide.com, RateVegas and Bing.  I'd like to give you an opportunity to make right before I leave feedback on our stay.
 
Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

For our 11th anniversary we decided to spend a couple of nights in Las Vegas at The Venetian which both my partner and I have been hoping to stay in since it opened.  Maybe having high expectations of a luxury hotel was a mistake?  If you think the management of the hotel is going to give a damn about your time or comfort, think again.  PLEASE stay somewhere else.  We should have read the other reviews before staying here and we can say we will NEVER be staying here again.  Your money is not welcome and whatever so called efforts made to make amends are not really worth your time.

Arrived Friday night, waited in line for over 40 minutes in line to check in.  The front desk clerk was very friendly.  However, we get to our room and the keys wont work.  My partner went back to the front desk to have new key's assigned.  I waited in the 11th floor lobby.  

Housekeeping was delivering some items to ""our room.""  I ran over and asked to be let in, the housekeeper was very rude and told me to ""Go away the room already has people in it, it's not your room.""  I tried explaining, even showing the folder with the room number clearly written by the front desk clerk.  She turned her back, ignored me and walked away.  

I texted my partner telling him that the room was occupied by other guests.  He had received another set of keys for the ""occupied"" room so he had to go back and wait again to speak with the FOH manager.  For their error we were given a $50 credit to dine at any of the restaurants at the hotel.  So an hour and a half after we arrived we finally get a room.  The room is VERY nice, I can say that.  It's clean, and beautiful. 

My partner has over 25 years experience in IT and we were unable to connect to their ""free wi-fi internet"" service.   

We woke up late the next morning and left the room around noon.  We placed the card in the key slot indicating that we would like our room cleaned and decided to eat at the Grand Lux Café to use the $50 credit we were given.  We are in Las Vegas, if we had wanted to eat at a Cheesecake Factory we could have done so back home.  The Grand Lux Café is owned by Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is Cheesecake Factory fare, not impressed with the menu or the food but felt we deserved to use the credit we were given.  Tried to charge the meal to our room, it was declined.  Had to speak with the waiter several times and explain the situation.  It took him over 40 minutes to call the FOH manager to get approval for the credit.  Sitting in the Café for over 2 hours was not part of our plans.  So far over 4 hours in less than 24 hours of our romantic trip away was spent WAITING for their errors to be fixed.

We did some shopping and came back to our room at 7pm.  The room had not been cleaned.  We called the operator and asked for housekeeping to come and at least make the bed and exchange towels.  Took them another hour to get someone up to the room to take care of the basic housekeeping.  Once the room was cleaned I went down to speak with the FOH manager again.  Explaining the repeated crappy service we had been given and how much time we had wasted waiting for them to fix their mistakes.   She offered us another $50 in dining credit.  I explained we didn't want credit if we had to go through the same issues as we did at the Grand Lux, that dining credit was not really something could use.  She told me gruffly that ""sorry, that is all we can offer you so you can take it or leave it!""  Awful, awful, awful people skills and this is supposed to be a LUXURY hotel?",1,0,0

Ok in the sense of decor, the decor was beautiful and the gondola experience as far as the boat ride was one of a kind not the singing.  

I did find the following things to be ridiculous; the $32.00 resort fee per day.

After we left Venetian we received a $1500 charge for a ""damaged"" tv, that we had used to check out of the hotel and was working fine. We were told the TV was cracked by a bottle that we must have thrown, and then the hotel manager says she ""speculates"" that it could have also been a shoe or straightener, but something was definitely thrown. We have asked multiple times for proof, even just a picture and we have been told that they don't owe us proof and that their legal department doesn't allow them to give us proof (picture or damage report), and the burden of proof is on us. This whole process has been awful, we are now disputing with our credit card, and we were told by the managers at Venetian we should do that and then today the Risk Management Manager said if we do that and it gets kicked back that they will come after us via collections, but after talking to legal council the burden of proof is then on them if it gets kicked back and we will have a good case in small claims if they can't give us proof. It is also funny how the story has changed multiple times, first it was a small crack, and when we said could you have missed it on the last check out before us, especially if can't see it when on or in a picture and it has gotten worse with time. It then changed to a crack the size of a plate, then we were told you can't see the crack via picture, it seems like a scam to me. 

Lastly, the managers you talk to try to act like helping you and being your friend saying I am giving you confidential information and could lose my job, and try to make you feel bad for them, when they are the ones not being helpful and continuously transferring you to different departments. I think in the last 48 hours they have had me talk to 5 different people. When you ask to talk to their boss or a director you get told they won't deal with you, I shouldn't be dealing with you, you're lucky I am even talking to you. If they could have proved it we would pay with no complaints!

We had so much room for 5 people (and it was a good idea since the room was so damn expensive). They have ok slots, card games and roulette. But I prefer other casinos for games.

The first night we were drinking at the dorcey (their casino bar) and the groom accidentally knocked over a small table which had a glass top that slid off and broke. Why they don't have plexiglass I can't fathom. The large black bouncer with braids said we had to go and we did. 5 minutes later, near the elevators, he grabs the groom by the neck and aggressively walks\/drags\/chokes him back to the bar. Three security guards (Erick, Sanja, and David) and a manager (Ryan) show up and have us wait for over an hour talking about property damage and getting an estimate. Despite giving them all of our IDs, room numbers, etc. they refuse to let us leave and start telling a different story about how they warned us multiple times (not true). I explain to them that we are spending thousands of dollars here every night and it was accidental but still they held all of us for over an hour, dressing us down in public, and forced us to pay $100 at the cage for a broken glass table top. This is honestly the worst management failure I've ever experienced. That is not how you properly handle minor incidents.

The next morning I went downstairs and spoke with Mary at the front desk about our poor experience and treatment the previous night and I got the feeling that she really couldn't care less. It seems like despite this being a 5 star hotel there is not one person I've met who actually cares about the guest experience.

In 2008, I have visited Sin City a total of four times: New Years, Spring, Fall, and a week before Christmas. After staying in and visiting so many different luxury hotels on the Strip from Mandalay Bay, NYNY, The MGM, Paris, Bellagio, and a handful of others, I consider Venetian my favorite casino resort hotel in LV. 

Even though other hotels such as Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, Mirage, and the Wynn are excruciatingly lovely and no doubt quite comparable to the Venetian for luxurious accommodations, the Venetian is the optimal spot for convenience to enjoy the best of Vegas. IMHO, Venetian has everything to offer! In addition, due to its prime location on the strip Venetian provides access to the best dining, and entertainment.

Case in point: easy walking to TI for Pirate show, the Fashion Mall, Bellagio fountain show, Bellagio gardens, Forum shops, etc, etc. You don't have to rely on hours of walking, waiting in line nor spending cash for a taxi to take you to the hot spots, or wait for a shuttle. Tao and Lavo, Vegas party hot-spots are located within (drunk)walking vicinity. After a night of drinking and partying, it's easy to walk out and flash your card-key to the elevator hop to stumble into your room. Or if you feel like eating after a night out and don't want to line your stomach with crap-food, you can kick Denny's to the curb and enjoy the Always open Grand Lux Cafe for amazing food options. 

And of course the other reviewers can tell you that the hotel rooms are huge, there's a sunken living room, 3 lcd-tvs, excellent service, etc. That's a given. But why Venetian is at the top of my list is simply due to its easy access to the best of Vegas. 

And it doesn't hurt that the suites are big and comfy enough to pack huge groups of 20-somethings who love to vacay in Vegas as much as I do!",1,1,1

One of them had managed to finagle a suite at the Venetian so I could stay there but the catch was that I would have to share the room with 7 other people.  

I've come to that point in my life where I've decided that I am too old and make enough money where if I'm staying at a hotel, I don't have to share a bed or for that matter sleep on the floor. The exception to this rule is Vegas. I personally can't justify spending a pretty penny on a room in Vegas when I'm only in it for a couple hours a day. I would rather spend that coin on gambling or eating at a nice restaurant. 

That being said, sharing a room with 7 other people is overkill. It is reminiscent to being 12 years old at summer camp. Yet surprisingly I didn't find that to be the case. I can rehash the hundreds of other reviews about how nice the room is but the biggest draw is the spaciousness. We had two people each in the beds, two on an inflatable mattress, and two on the couches, and it didn't feel claustrophobic at all. It still felt quite spacious actually.  

The only real drawback is that after riding in the elevators, you will have memorized the entire soundtrack of Jersey Boys and Phantom of the Opera. How one place managed to have the best musical and the worst musical in house at the same time still boggles my mind? If you are wondering which one is which just note that one of the musicals is about a deformed man who lives at an opera house and falls in love with a girl who doesn't find taking vocal lessons through a ventilation system from a faceless specter at all odd.

I've also stayed at The Wynn and I would say that I prefer the Venetian out of the two.

It was easily one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.  The entire building oozes elegance and beauty.  The service was first class -- we ordered room service once or twice and they were on the ball.  And the suite was gorgeous, too.  Very clean and immaculately prepared.

Everything else in the building was fantastic.  The shops were great and the street performers were talented and entertaining.  The pool area has a great layout and overlooks the strip.  I definitely got used to grabbing a mimosa and sitting by the pool -- it was a great place to relax, nurse a hang over, and admire the surrounding architecture.

And I know, this is Vegas, I'm sure other hotels have nice rooms too, but in my experience (I've stayed at the Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Paris, Hilton Las Vegas), the rooms here are by far the nicest.  I actually wish my apartment in Manhattan resembled it.

With it's ""living"" room area separated by a few steps that elevated the bed space, you definitely felt like you were in a nice studio apartment.  The bed was big and comfy, the sheets and bathroom clean, and despite it being a 1 bedroom, the 2 televisions (one for the living room space and the other for viewing while in bed) added to that studio-like apartment feel.

I also loved the easy access to the variety of shops connected to the Venetian.  If you're not in Vegas to gamble, then why not window shop...right?

Oh, and for Vegas, I found the staff to be EXTREMELY helpful.  Upon my return home I immediately discovered I had left a small bag of random cables and adapters.

We visited the pool but we did not get to swim as it seemed to close extremely early every day. We were told they were on winter hours. At one time it was closed at 4:30. I definitely recommend finding out the hours from the front desk before you try to visit. The pool on the 10th floor in the other Tower is open until 10 p.m. but it was quite a walk away from our Tower. Our only problem was it seems like we couldn't find the best entrance to come in.

One of the coolest hotels in Vegas!

I have never stayed here, but I've visited every time I've been to Vegas. I basically go here for the shops :) 

I love the decor of the Venetian. I've never been to Venice, Italy, but this gave me a little taste of what it's like there! I love that there's the water canals all along the inside, with the gondolas and people riding in them. I'd love to ride on one one day! I also like how there are little bistros and cafes next to the canals that really make you feel like you're in Venice! Definitely made me nostalgic of my past trips to Europe!

They have a pretty good amount and selection of stores\/shopping here. I did find it a bit hard navigating through the shopping\/canals area because the maps were hard to understand...and the Venetian architecture makes it harder to understand also because everything kinda looks the same. They have a good mix of high end stores and regular stores - probably something for everyone here.

The biggest reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because my boyfriend and I were seriously confused by the self-parking structure. Why is there only one set of elevators on each floor?! Apparently we parked in the complete opposite direction of the elevators, so we thought the parking structure just didn't have them at all and ended up walking down the stairwell...getting confused on the ground floor, and then walking back up the stairwell, and then walking all around the entire garage floor that we were on until we found the elevators on the complete opposite side. NEED BETTER SIGNAGE, PEOPLE! It was sooo frustrating trying to figure out how to leave the freakin' structure just to get into the hotel!

I did notice that when they redecorated the rooms a year ago they removed the pull out couch in the living area.  There's plenty of mirror space so if you happen to be staying with a few girls it's not a problem.  Housekeeping and room service are always great.  One time I forgot to pack hairspray and before I went to the gift shop and paid for an over priced travel size, I decided to call housekeeping and asked if they had it handy.  Sure enough they brought one over.  The concierge is wonderful too.  They take pride in making your experience all that it can be.  If you want to go to any of their clubs they set you up with a host which will later call you and make arrangements to walk you through the doors.  Also, they have contacts to most of the clubs in Vegas so they can put you on a guest list or at least give you a free or discounted admission card.  I love to play craps and the pit bosses and table staff are really nice and helpful.  One of the pit bosses actually remember me even before I gave him my player's card and actually came over and gave me a hug.  I was pretty shocked because I hadn't been there in 2 or 3 months.  If you have time, catch The Blue Man group and check on their website because they normally have a package combo for tickets to the show and hotel stay.  I can go on and on about how great the Venetian is but one last thing, check out the jacuzzi, most of the time it has late night hours it you want to unwind after a long night.",1,0,0

As you walk in the main entrance, the check in counters can be easily located. There are two towers. Venetian is on the right while Palazzo is on the left. Check in staff member that helped me was courteous asking me how my day was going and if I was celebrating any special occasion. She helped me obtain my room in a timely fashion and wished me a great stay. 

Let's start off with the basic room. There is enough space for you to roam around. You have your huge bed which is decorated nicely and neatly and a separate ""living room"" area off to the side with couches, tv, snacks (extra cost), coffee table, and the window. The bathrooms are perfect with tons of space that includes a big enough shower, two sinks, toilet, and a small tv. Overall you feel welcomed in the room.

As you work your way out of the tower, you instantly see a change of scenery. The casino is on the lower level where you have the standard card games, slots, bars, etc. On the second floor is the shops, restaurants, and other entertaining festivities. Since Venetian and Palazzo are close together, it's a short walk to go to the other tower. They have a couple of night clubs in between the two towers which includes TAO and LAVO. Of course there are a couple of shows but I think the most famous one is the Rock of Ages. 

The Venetian is one of the most entertaining hotels in Las Vegas.",7,2,3

It's been our favorite place to stay since 2009. The structure (both interior and exterior) is beautifully designed. For someone who loves taking pictures like me, there's plenty of picturesque areas worth photographing. 

The rooms are very spacious and clean. There's a separate area for the beds and another more like a living room with a pull-out sofa. Each area has its own TV. My teen has made the living room area his own ""room."" That's pretty much his own space every time we stay at the Venetian. And now that we have another baby, they provided us with a crib. Nothing fancy, but I imagine it's really helpful for those who don't bed-share. The bathrooms are immaculate! They have a his and her sink! Plus the tub is separate from the shower. 

Another area we enjoy is the family-friendly pool at the Venezia tower. It's quiet and has plenty of shade during the day. The clean and dry towels are well-stocked too! Additionally, there are plenty of food choices inside the hotel. We always eat BBQ pork ramen at Noodle Asia & try out new things at the Grand Luxe Cafe. These two are our favorite places to eat whenever we come to Vegas. There are two food courts inside the hotel as well. The mall aka Grand Canal Shoppes is themed after Venice, Italy so I completely feel like a tourist when I'm there. Every corner is so picturesque. The gondola ride is definitely a must-try at least once!

I shared a room with 4 other girls for a  Bachelorette party. We were getting ready for our first night out to dinner and I had my handy dandy ipod ready to be docked so we could get the party started but to my dismay, there was no ipod dock in sight. Flat screen TV, yes, but no freaking ipod dock...are you kidding me? In its place, they had a single cd disc player\/alarm clock combo. Boo! And the kicker was that it didn't even work, despite the fact that a friend thought to bring CD's, so we ended up playing it on the DVD player in the room and it was kinda weak.

Disappointment #2 was in the restroom. There's a small flatscreen tv above the sinks and we thought, ""okay, maybe we can put on some music video channel while we're getting ready."" Sure, if the damn thing worked! Aaaah!

Disappointment #3: No coffee maker in the room. WTF! Do NOT come between a girl and her caffeine. 

Disappointment #4: El cheapo hair dryer. I initially thought the room didn't come with one, however we found it tucked away in the vanity drawer.

Final disappointment: the mini fridge in the room was stocked to the freaking brim with incidentals that we could barely fit our own stuff in it. I.e. our $1.00 waters instead of taking their $5.00 waters that tempt you when you're in dire need of some thirst quenching. 

With all the money you fork over for this otherwise pimped out room, you'd expect all of the basic amenities as mentioned above, and then some.

Hopefully the Venetian staff will take my comment card suggestions to heart and get with the program the next time we visit! I can be forgiving if they make amends.",3,1,1

1. Great location!  It is located in the center of the Strip (Las Vegas Blvd).  It is a great jumping off point no matter where you want to go on  the Strip.

2. The rooms are all suites.  They are beautiful, as well as comfortable.  It's a great place to stay.  Also, if you book ahead of time, you can usually get pretty decent rates, especially for the quality of the hotel.

3. The casino is so pretty and not stinky.  Yes, people are smoking all of the place (YUCK!) but the ventilation does a great job at cleaning the air.  Some hotels smell awful, but the Venetian never does.

4. Restaurant Row has so many great places to eat.  They have high end to casual, so everyone should be happy.  My favorite place there is AquaKnox and give it a shoot because you will LOVE it!  There is also a food court and Grand Lux on property.

5. Lots of parking.  The garage is huge!  It can be a pain getting out after a big event, but normally it easy.

We really did enjoy the spacious room though. There were 3 TVs, one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. I wish my apartment were half as nice as a suite at the Venetian.

The 24-hour cafe downstairs served up huge portions of well-made foods. I had spaghetti carbonara which was so delicious.

My bf's two complaints about the hotel are:

1) They seem to pump some kind of perfume through the internal air system to combat the smell of cigarette smoke. (He has sinus issues, so this was a minor annoyance. It didn't really bother me.)

2) The hotel\/casino has a more confusing layout, especially in comparison to the other hotels.

In summary, the Venetian, and its newer counterpart the Palazzo, have the best rooms in Vegas, competitive with the likes of Bellagio and Wynn. Every room is a suite, so you will always end up with a living room area, bedroom area, huge bathroom and 3 TVs.

I'll probably stay at the Bellagio next though, because it's right across the street from Bally's and Paris, and those hotels give convenient access to the monorail. 

Side note: 
The monorail seems to be the most cost-effective and timely way to travel up and down the strip. There is a 3-day unlimited pass for $40 which I will definitely get next time. Trolley is too slow, buses get caught in traffic, rental cars cost more money than you'd think, and taxis are too costly. Monorail is the way to go!",2,0,1

Excellent stay -  2nd time here and even though I left  some blood on the poker tables, I will be back.  Piggybacked on my wife's conference stay for a few days.  It was my 9 yr old's 1st Vegas trip, so I decided to try to make it memorable:

Check-in was the only thing holding this back from a 5 star rating.  Some confusion on corporate vs. personal credit cards left a 1K hold\/charge on our personal credit card for several days, even when reversed. This would've been a bummer if we didn't have plenty of credit line.  I think the front desk person was ""new"".  Take note, 1st impressions COUNT, this could have ruined someones whole trip.  Quick bite dinner at the Lobster place in the shopping area, pricey but excellent.  Walk up espresso and pastries European style was inexpensive and spot on.

Rest was gravy... The grounds are beautiful and kept up well.  All the rooms suites w\/ sunken living rooms, big bathrooms, lots of space to stretch out.  The Venezia tower is a bit of a trek from the main hotel (12 minutes from the casino floor), at least it has it's own pool.  The pool complex is fairly large, the huge main pool is busy with tons of people watching.  TAO Beach (European\/topless) is steps always, cleverly camouflaged by jungle foliage. There is a pool near the spa, with it's own cabanas, a little more mellow. When staying at the Venetian you can also access the pools of the Palazzo.  

Cabana - Grabbed a cabana near the main pool, service was great - it was really hot, like 107 most of the afternoon.  Without a shaded base of operations, you really can't hang out there by the pool very long. TOTALLY worth it for the day.  The 9 year old loved getting snacks & daqueris brought to her like a little princess.  The pool host even came out to the pool when we were swimming and brought us drinks.

Food & Libations - Bouchon was great, casino bartenders do a good job w\/ my Manhattans... burger & pizza joint in the main hotel\/casino area open 24\/7 and were pretty good.  You want  MEAT?  4 steakhouses on prem.  HEAVEN, plus a burger stuffed w\/ foie gras... YUM!

The only con is that you have to pay a resort fee of about $25\/night for amenities like the gym and Wifi, but the Internet doesn't work very well and can be extremely slow at times.

I started with a 4 or 5-star first impression, despite the long, Disneyland type winding line to check in and the sales job to then get you to pay more for a room with a view. Got to our room and we were wowed by the spaciousness, complete with sunken living room. TVs in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom. Wow. Huge marble bathroom.

Then night falls and you turn on all the lights.Every. last. one. And yet you still can't see. Then you wait, thinking they must be the type that slowly warm up and get brighter. It was literally still dark in the toilet area when you turned the light on. I could never see my face well enough to put on make-up easily. And the lighted make-up mirror never worked, despite us leaving a note every single day.

They had a mini fridge, but it was fully stocked and you paid even if you just picked something up and didn't use it. The charge went through based on the shifting weight. This meant we couldn't put our own water, food, or drinks in the fridge. I hated that.

I am not a fan of only flat sheets on beds. I like fitted sheets over the mattress so you don't risk having the mattress pad exposed and your body touching it or the mattress. This was the case here. It grossed me out. 

Then fast-forward to our last day, and housekeeping never came to our room. We got back around midnight and needed to pack and shower, and we could do nothing until they came to make the beds and replace the towels. They put us on a list and said they'd try to be there in 20 minutes. WHAT?? 45 minutes later, they had made up and refreshed our linens. Even after talking to a manager twice, NOTHING was done to expedite the service and nothing was taken off our exorbitant final bill.

We stayed here for the first time this past weekend for a friends 40th and from the moment we walked in to the very crowded\/chaotic smoky casino hotel it felt as though it was a bad choice. 
 
Here were the negatives for us: 
-Staff at every encounter were not smiling or friendly\/helpful. No sense of guests being made to feel welcome. 
-Valet only for registration,  but not throughout your stay. 
-Bellman services took exceptionally long: at least 30 mins to receive luggage. 
-We had to walk through the casino to get to our guest elevators and by the time we got to the room our hair and clothes stank of smoke (including our child)..the entire time... so gross. 
-Rooms felt outdated and ""old people"". Our room didnt get much natural light, so felt dungeony even though on 33rd floor. 
-Have to pay for Wifi
-Exceptionally expensive room service: with delivery and taxes a pot of coffee is $24
-This is trivial, but the TV channels offered are lame! 
- Definitely not great soundproofing: we were  awakened the first night (past 2am )by drunk partiers going up and  down our corridors. Its Vegas, we get it-but still you could hear everything from the hallways.

Today as I was shopping they had a Italian street show that was amazing. My two kids loved it. The guy on stilts was so skilled and exciting to watch. 

I was able to shop and the kids loved watching the city views. They loved the gondola ride. 

I've never ridden the outside gondola so when my boys asked of course I said yes. It's $80 for four people and it doesn't matter the age or size. Under two are free. I liked the outside ride, but if you want romance make sure it's dark. The inside ride was more romantic when I did it. The outside had a lot of drunk people trying to talk to us.

The parking garage was really dirty and had a lot of trash in it. I don't blame the hotel or casino because it was a Saturday afternoon and people didn't want to use the many trash cans available.  I just think the diapers and trash needed to be cleaned. 

The rooms here are nice. I didn't stay here this trip but I have stayed before. They are a mid grade Vegas hotel. They will offer upgrades if you ask for it.",11,5,7

We all seemed to enjoy the place. We ended up with a couple of adjoining suites and packed them to the gunnels. 

The couches and beds were comfy. The rooms were properly equipped with ironing boards, multiple TVs, Hi ball glasses, etc. We were wishing that we had some bigger ice buckets! As it was we had to do the motel 6 move of taking the igloo to the ice machine and well you know how that goes...

PRO TIP #1: Always take the free Valet parking!

The hotel provided a myriad of little bathroom items that are always needed by someone; shower cap w\/scrunche, mending kit, emery board and something, and q-tips. That is in addition to the standard soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion.

The decor was nice and with the suites not low end. The rooms were narrow but long with a railing for the living room area but no fridge or cooking area at all.

PRO TIP #2: make sure you always have a key card with you or the group you are in whenever you go downstairs. They post guards to key card check the rooms... annoying but gotta keep the hookers out somehow eh?

The main entrance has some wonderfully colonnaded arches and vaulted ceilings. The colors are matched throughout the entire facility. Dark wood accents in the restaurants to the furniture in the rooms. Khaki stonework throughout the main casino entrance and hallways as well as the paint in the rooms.

Overall it was a great stay, but its a bit pricey I think as well. The hotel service  was lacking at times as we had to order extra towels and didnt end up with maid service in one of our two rooms grrrrr... but overall it was a great stay for us.",10,8,9

I love the couches in the rooms, very comfortable. Service is always good. Hotel is very clean. Great combination of restaurants, bars and casino.

Kinda confusing to have to take 2 different elevators to get to your room, but who cares?  We ordered 6 extra pillows and 10 towels, and no one batted an eye and our stuff was at our door within 15 minutes.

It's luxurious, in a great location, & the staff is very customer service oriented.  While Wynn and Encore are newer and slightly more refined in some of their decor, The Venetian was wonderful.  The Venetian was a great option for my bachelorette weekend, the suite was a great size, with two queens a sunken living room with pull out sofa bed, and a spacious bathroom for a group of girls to get ready in.  The vanity was also wonderful, and the lighting in the bathroom, wonderful for all those selfies and bathroom pics ladies!  The hotel is absolutely beautiful.  And the room was clean.  No issues with the wifi here either or cell reception, as I had with Hard Rock and a couple other hotels on the Strip.  I love how there's plenty of food (from really good to decent and cheap) and shopping options as well.  Walgreens is conveniently downstairs too, and we must not forget there's now 2 Bouchon Bakeries there, get your macaroon fix on!  Customer service was wonderful here; a nice gentleman brought me a bunch more towels, glasses and blankets after calling the operator.  And upon checking out at the front, the front desk even asked us if we wanted some bottled water.  

The only gripe I have with this hotel, is that it's huge with different towers, one friend said ""this hotel is not drunk girl friendly.""  Hell this hotel isn't sober directionally challenged Cat C friendly!?  We got lost a couple times, and after I checked in, we were instructed to go pass the front desk to a set of elevators, then you walk around a huge maze on the floor it lets you off at to go to another set of elevators in order to get to your room floor.  The signs aren't very clear either; it's like a huge maze.  Other patrons were confused too, so it's not just us.  Though Tao isn't as cracking anymore, it still draws a crowd and is conveniently in the hotel.  

The only reason why I wouldn't stay here is because the confusing layout, but my friend said that it seems confusing because of the Venezia tower I was in.  But who knows, I may stay here again, depending on pricing.  Venetian was a more affordable price to house my bachelorette party.

We're here for 4 nights of which 2 have passed. And it's an experiment. My husband really wanted to stay here because of the poker room and the pokerroom rate they offer (a discount on your hotelroom rate if you play at least 6 hours a day on average). I hesitated because I prefer a suite with a little kitchenette.

The good things. It's a real classy hotel with a very friendly staff. More than like in other hotels we've stayed. The choices in shoppes and restaurants are huge. The're 10 pools and whirlpools.

But the're also downsides (for us). The WiFi is the worst I've ever had in such an expensive hotel. It's slow. It's spotty and although you might have full coverage, there is no connection. Not what you expect.

And although the're a lot a pools and places to rest the're no (free) parasols. I really hate that. Unbelievable: in the middle of the desert they make you pay for an parasol. You have to rent a day bed or a cabana. Luckily: there are a lot of shady areas. But it means you have to switch places a lot. And it's in the sun, or out. Nottingham in beween. So it's not possible to sit in under a parasol with your had and your lees in the sun. Beds are also very close to eachother.

And a few minor details: the light switch for the lights next to the beds is just on one side of the bed. The water pressure is not impressive. It can be noisy at night in the hallways. Valet takes up to 10 minutes. And I really miss my kitchenette..........",6,4,3

Loads of low to high budget places to choose from. I prefer the Wynn resorts to the Venetian, but still a nice place. Service is okay, could have been a bit better, but the pool attendants were great. Very accommodating. The pool clubs make the whole pool a little louder than most pool goers seemed to appreciate and the music from the Tao club could be heard in all of the rooms facing the pool. Is the club scene for 150 people really worth making everyone else have to listen to blaring music in their rooms all day? Their wifi is the worst I've ever seen in a hotel (LaQuinta Inns has better wifi and no resort fee...). You're better off not using it. If more than one device is on it, it completely crashes, the wifi doesn't reach throughout the entire room, so good luck using it in the bath or in bed.

We managed to fit 6 people into the Venetian Bella suite quite comfortably with two people in each of the queen size beds and two on the L shaped sofa (which has a pull out bed with bed covers already on it). 

There's even three LCD HDTVs in the room (one in the bedroom, one in the business area, and one in the bathroom). There there's a separate bath and shower stall but the whole can't be used if one is taking a bath unless you want to see some of your family members naked (Nooooooooooo, I'm blinnnnnnnnd).

Shame that there's no free Internet ($10\/day use) though you can order movies (with the adult variety cough cough) here. 

What the heck is with the $8 box of Kit Kat bars??? Are they make of gold? 

The canal ride is lame unless you want to be stared at the entire time around shops that you can barely afford. If I was a lady, I would punch the guy in the face for taking me on a canal ride.

Had the key in my hand 60 seconds later, and had my bags in the room and a drink in my hand 5 minutes after that.

We requested house keeping to go at 5:30pm and no one showed up, finally of wednesday house keeping was cleaning while we where in the room. My friend asked if they could change her bed and ahe said they would have to charge her for it, but she could leave the sheets for her... wth, it's  not like we got a free room we paid a lot of money to get the suite.  Lastly on our departure we called in to get our luggage out of the room at 10:50a.m. and asked for a late check out, not only did they not accomdate us, they keep tranferring us from one department to the other and kept being on hold. They said they could do the late check out and to get the service to pick up our luggage it would take 30-45minutes which we didnt have time to spare.

Long store short, we had checked in out luggahe and had the car parked in valet.  By the time we where ready to leave I  was told it would take 15 minutes to get my car and luggage... IT TOOK OVER 1 HOUR and the guy that brought the luggage was yelling at me, didn't  even  help us store our luggage and still wanted a tip.... You got to be f***** kidding me.

We were celebrating our anniversary and decided on the Venetian. We we were greeted by a great valet staff and had an easy check in. The room had a great view  and the setup exceeded expectations. 

The Pro's - Great service, and most definitely the In Suite dining. We ordered breakfast and dinner and received delicious food with substantial sized portions. It is expensive but worth every penny with the setup especially if you have a room with a view, you can dine in with an great view of the strip. The staff were very friendly and kind and did their best to fix some of the bad experiences we had.  

The con's - The bed was not clean at all when we arrived. We found a dead spider on the pillow and when we pulled back the covers it was very dirty as if not changed at all. We called housekeeping who were very nice but they took quite a long time to arrive to fix the issue. Also, while the in suite dining was great. Expect a waiting time of at least an hour or more. The food was great but the length of time was horrible. You pretty much have to order the food 1 hour before you are actually hungry. Lastly, if you use valet. Be prepared to wait a while.

Additional comment: when choosing a place for us to stay I was considering Wynn but decided against it because it seemed to far from the center of the Strip.

The employees at the Venetian and Palazzo are very well trained and are very engaging\/professional. The hotel complex is very well staffed and organized.

I reserved a 3 night stay for our anniversary and checked in on a Friday night. I'll be listing the issues in order of importance. 

Issue #1
We woke up the first morning of our trip and found the bathroom flooded. Now not to be disgusting, but I really had to go so I couldn't call them and wait for it to be cleaned and fixed so I could do my morning duty. So I had to get on my hands and knees and dry the bathroom floor with all of our towels so I could use the restroom. Didn't come to a 5 star hotel to walk into a bathroom with 1"" of standing water on the floor! Or clean a restroom! The cause was a very old toilet supply line.  Do they not know these things get old and must be replaced from time to time? Or do they just wait for it to leak and cause a flood then fix it?  

Issue #2
So after cleaning the flooded restroom and using the toilet, I came to the study to call the front desk and let them know about the flood in the restroom and what do I see on the floor? A prescription pill! A quick Google search showed the pill was an anti-psychotic and extremely dangerous of swallowed by children. What If I had my kids with me on this trip? Kids out everything in their mouth. For all they know it could look like candy to them! Was this room even vacuumed before being given to me? Apparently not! I didn't notice it the night before because we hit the bed as soon as we checked in. 6 hour nonstop drive pretty much killed us. 

Needless to say, the Venetian pretty much ruined our vacation for the most part. I will never stay here again. 






Issue #3
They gave us a room on the 11th floor, except the elevator that's the closest to our room doesn't go up to the 11th floor. It only goes to the 10th floor and you have to take the stairs up 1 flight, or take the other elevator on the other side and walk about 12 minutes from one end of the hotel to the other to reach our room.

You can ask up to 4 extra towels at a time.  But just call again if you need more. They call you back later to check if you received the amenities you requested. We were given 5 keys too.  And they have sewing kits if you need one - just ask.

Vegas seems to be hurting these days, we booked a regular room for $199\/night and were upgraded to a suite in the Venezia Tower when we checked in.  While the suite itself was really only one big room, divided into a bedroom and living room by a railing, it was certainly worth it for the price.  Marble bathroom, big tub, comfortable bed, & nice TV.  If you're in town with a group or family you could pretty easily sleep 6 people in one of these rooms.  The condition of our room wasn't impeccable - some of the furniture was scratched and the walls had scuffs, but again it was certainly nicer than some of the Vegas rooms I have had in the past.  

My favorite thing about the Venitian is that you can spend the entire weekend there without ever really going outside.  The casino connects to  the canal shops which in turn connects to the Palazzo shops and hotel.  We had all of our meals and drinks without ever leaving the boundaries of the property.  

A couple of recommendations - if you are interested in the pool deck get out there early or you won't find a chair.  We casually made our way out there around noon to find it packed with people and no free space.  The private Venezia pool was the same way, we had better luck down there later in the afternoon though.  Also, the Venitian has some strange policies about billing you in advance for incidentals and then crediting you back the money when you check out.  I guess this is to prevent people from running up charges and skipping town, but strangely when we tried to bill something to the room it turned out there was some kind of additional fee for that?  Drinks at the pool deck were expensive.  Don't bother with valet, there's plenty of parking.",0,0,0

There are five of us in the family and the Venetian was a perfect hotel to accommodate us. When we arrived in Vegas, our room wasn't ready. It was super busy that weekend because of Independence Day. The room we had had two beds, 1 L shaped pull out sofa bed, 2 HDTVs, walk-in closet and a bathroom with a bath\/shower. The bathroom even had a TV in there. Sweet!  Don't knock over the water or candies sitting on your dresser as they are magnetized and will charge you a lot of money for things you can pick up downstairs cheaper.

The rooms are far enough away from the casino and in order to get into the room area, you have to flash your room card key. There are different choke points of where you can enter to get to your room. Elevators are the only way to you room and there are enough of them so you don't have to wait. Watch out for the drunk people stumbling in. I was in the elevator and this guy had to be held up by his friends because he was that hammered. 

The casinos are nice and so is the pool. You can eat at the Grand Lux Cafe or you can go see the Blue Man Group. Make sure you get their players card to get points on whatever. I enjoyed their sports booking area, with large HDTVs and up to date sports scores. The first night I placed my bet on Brock Lesnar to win and won money that night! 

The prices vary and you can get a good deal if you go on off days and not weekends.

Oddly, I've never gambled here before. The Canal Shops are nothing short of tacky, but kinda cool I guess...in a Disneyland sort of way.

The whole place just feels high class. From the casino to the Canal Shops, to the aforementioned rooms, to the awesome selection of high class restaurants. Everything is just great. Room Service comes by twice a day, and leaves the most amazing chocolates.

The view of the strip is great. Not every room has it though, and we got a free upgrade because our room wasn't ready by 3. From the 29th floor we had an amazing view of Treasure Island, Trump Tower, Fashion Mall, and the Mirage. As well as the mountains that I never knew surrounded Las Vegas until we arrived there.

THe hotel has a bunch of pools, they do close a bit early at 8, but there's plenty else to do at night. The casino is ridiculously high table minimums though, usually around $25, but it's really close to IP and some others if you're gambling on the cheap.

Ok, so a couple of complaints:
1) Turn down service is kinda late... like 8-10 PM. Make sure you put up your privacy sign if you're around.
2) Check-in takes forever. Go up to the Venezia checkin as there's hardly ever a line.
3) The TV Checkout crashed on me, and I had to spend 10 minutes in line to have them tell me it actually worked.
4) All the food and such in the minibar is on a sensor. If you touch it or move it, you immediatley get charged. It's also sort of in the way of the TV. Annoying.

I didn't try room service or anything, so no comment there.

The front foyer of the hotel is absolutely beautiful and clean. Another plus: you can't smell the stale scent of cigs and carpet cleaner from the front desk. So we checked in then we went up to our room.

The casino does smell funky, but you really can't smell it past the elevators. The horrible smell does not travel far. We got to our room and I was so happy. We had a standard room with a king-sized bed, but for a standard room, it was HUGE! (and absolutely gorgeous). Marble floors in the bathroom, his\/her sinks, deep soaker tub, stand-up shower, separate toilet room, vanity, gigantic bed, recessed living room with an l-shaped couch... just way too much to mention. My view wasn't great, but honestly, I didn't care when I could sit on the windowsill and just stare at my room. It was ahhhhhhhhhhhmazing.

The place was just so nice and clean. The bed was beyond comfortable. There was a little ottoman-looking thing at the foot of the bed. I don't know... just too many things that made me happy. I did NOT want to leave!

CLEAN.

Clean. Clean. Clean. Clean. Clean.

SO clean. Everything is clean.

The casino and resort is super clean. Every time I pass by this casino and resort, some staff are either cleaning the doors or windows or glasses. Super clean everywhere. They even clean out the bottom corner of an entrance wall to a restaurant. I was amazed. I have never seen any other casino\/resort that I have visited nearby has done so much to clean around. I was pretty impressed.

I love the Venetian and its theme and setup. It makes you feel like you are in Europe, not so much in America anymore. I liked it. 

Tips:

The boat ride is around $18-20 per person for 10 to 15 minutes without counting tips. 

The Madame Tussauds located outside the Venetian costs about $15 - $20. Retail is around $25. Half price tix is $18 per person.

There are live performances inside the venetian (I don't know the name of that central space area) a couple of times throughout the day. The actors often engage the audience so it is a lot of fun.

To go to Tao Beach, I recommend arriving early. Because you have to check in with a table first to make sure your name is on the list, then you all go wait in the second line before the elevator. Then they let some people in the elevator one at a time. Then once you are upstairs, you wait in another line to go in. Then after that, there was a final line to go into the actual Tao Beach. Tons of lines and the towels run out really fast so get there super early in the morning.",6,0,0

Shane\/Shawn, ashleyann and Patricia were the people working the doors to the seating area and they were all extremely rude and unprofessional they could not give us any help or any clear answer as to why we are waiting an hour plus for our show to begin!

We wait for another 15 minutes and Leslie comes out and says she is going to advise the box office that the show is cancelled and the box office needs to refund us or schedule our show for the next day.

As we stayed we received a complimentary $15 credit to use within the casino, which we tried to use at about 1am on the Sunday morning. We wanted to use the hotel credit at the Blackjack Bonus tables the dealer and Manager of the tables told me I needed to get a special band (as I'm from the UK). 

I queued to speak to the grumpiest security guard I have ever met. He checked my ID (for the second time as I'd already had it checked in order to get my voucher), and handed me my arm band. I went back to the Blackjack Bonus table where I was told I could not play that table with the credit... Why they couldn't have told me that in the first place is beyond me. The Manager in charge of the Blackjack Bonus tables was extremely rude and when I asked for clarification of what tables I could use the credit on he vaguely pointed to other blackjack tables on the next bank.

If they don't want you to use their credit then why give it to you??

Frankly, if you are invited to stay (being a -low- rated player still has its benefits), then take advantage of it if you are only going to use the room to lay your head down and nothing else.

However, I tend to try and enjoy hotel rooms - I mean, if I'm going to be somewhere, I like to sit on the couch, eat a breakfast, read the paper, etc.  Well, not here.

The Wife and I checked in after arriving in the morning since our previous evening's flight was delayed and subsequently rescheduled for the morning.  We simply dropped our bags and left - my brother's house was calling for the Thanksgiving meal.  When we came back, I was dismayed to discover burn marks in the credenza and that the couch was missing buttons and looked ragged.  The property was certainly showing its age that day.

The following morning we ordered room service and decided to lounge around.  No issues with the in-room dining or delivery - the staff was gracious and the food was good.  My only bone in the experience was that the table almost tipped on me because it was wobbly.  Thankfully the eggs benedict went down my gullet and not into my lap.

The gaming was the same as last time - it's crowded, the dealers are cranky, and the space seems a bit more closed off.  This is where the Palazzo has a leg up on its sister property by having the extra high ceilings that do not make you feel closed in.

If you're here to party and cram yourself eight to a room like some, then by all means, stay here.  Especially if its free like my four nights were.  But if you're looking to actually try and enjoy your hotel room, either move to the Palazzo or just stay at the Red Rock.",2,1,2

The proximity to Walgreens was convenient when we needed to purchase a few things we had forgotten to bring along. 
Now for the negatives. We stayed for 3 nights, and while the Wifi was fast at first, by the time we left it was so slow we stopped using it. The mini fridge was completely full of alcohol and if you touched it they would charge you for it, leaving no room for leftover food. There was no microwave in the room. The lighting in the bathroom was very poor for putting on makeup so there was a lighted mirror on the table in the bathroom, unfortunately it also had poor quality light. There was soap residue left in the shower from the previous guests bar of soap. The bathroom sink would gurgle loudly at random times including the middle of the night, and there was absolutely no fan in the bathroom to vent steam or other smells from the bathroom.

A huge warning to all those people who like to party too hard though. All of the things in the fridge and on the platter in front of the TV have weight sensors in them that automatically charge the room when your remove items (even if you don't use it), so be super careful to avoid knocking anything over.

We stayed on the fourth floor (which is also where the pool and Tao Beach is), which doesn't have a particularly nice view, but the view from the 19th floor (some of us got a room on the higher floor) isn't that much to talk about either. Since the Venetian is near the end of the strip and not facing anything interesting (Treasure Island woooooo), there isn't exactly much to see.

The shops and the cute Venice canal mock up is definitely worth seeing at least once, even if you don't stay at the hotel. Occasionally you can hear the guys rowing sing random songs during the day too. The food available in the hotel is probably the best in the area (also lots of cheaper options for those on a budget) with some of the big name chefs like Thomas Keller. The bakery has some really good pastries as well. All and all a great experience (just pricey).",3,0,2

The room that I stayed at the Venetian are a large suite with a living room for working and relaxing.  A large queen\/king sized bed and a large bathroom with a bath jacuzzi that was never used.  Oh yeah....BONUS TIME....three televisions with one in the bathroom.  Imagine watching NFL Sunday or ESPN News while taking a shower, it makes you want to get one at home...hehehe!

Granted this was a business trip and I probably would not want to pay $200+ a night on the strip during a convention weekend, but if $$$$$ was no object, I would definitely stay here more.

Also...internet access is not free and I am a big believer in free internet access to the guests staying in your hotel.  Oh well....one Yelp Star deduction....no big deal this time!

the rooms are all set up the same. when you walk in there's a good size bathroom: a seperate shower and bath, two sinks, a bathroom, and a make up station :] WITH a tv which is great when you're getting ready or taking a bath :]

when you walk in you either get 2 queens or 1 king. there's a closet and yet again another tv. then theres a few stairs to the ""living room"" with couch (pull out bed) and 2 desks and yet another tv haha.

i would recommend everyone and anyone to stay here. it's a great place to stay and there's a bunch of things to do! you can seriously be happy staying at venetian and never stepping outside! (since it's connected to palazzo) also on the 2nd floor there's shopping and restaurants (connected to palazzo's shopping and restaurants as well). i've never been shopping there since i come to vegas to eat, party, drink, and GAMBLE!!! but the restaurants are great (well the one's i've been to) i've been to wolf gang puck's bistro, first food & bar, and sushi samba. all which are great (read my reviews!!!) also venetian is home of TAO night club and palazzo is home of LAVO. when staying at venetian and you want to check out tao, just stay in the invited guests line (takes about 10 mins) which is for guests staying at the hotel. 

another plus very close to fashion mall, mirage, bellagio, encore, wynn, and treasure island...also harrahs (carnival court FTW!) and imperial palace (ginseng 3, hash house a go go, and fat tuesdays yay!!!)

*I booked a non-smoking room 2 months before coming (I have asthma, allergies, and chronic sinus infections), but all of the non-smoking rooms were filled when I tried to check in. I was; therefore, placed in a smoking suite (with an air purifier and humidifier) that the Marlboro man would have been displeased about. The smell of stale smoke was overwhelming.

I was coughing and had a migraine to start my week long work convention. I asked to be moved that morning, and the woman at the front desk tried to tell me that I had to stay in the smoking suite because that is what I checked in under (even though I was forced to take it because of availability). I wouldn't give into staying in the smoking room. My health and performance were\/are too important to me. 
*The room accesses are not convenient to the conference center, gym, pool, etc...
*The Venetian tower (where I was first located) had a security guard checking door keys to let you up. The Venezia tower (where I ended up staying) required that you had to take 2 elevators to get to the room, with a security guard at a desk, that could have cared less of who was coming and going.

The Venetian

If you haven't been to the Venetian for a stay or just a visit, this review should serve you well.  Stayed here many times, always enjoyed the stay, but I'm not going to talk about the rooms. I'm going to talk about the beauty. 

Last night I had a late dinner at the Grand Lux situated just off the casino. Always liked this place, the late hours, and its symbiotic connection to the design, intent and purpose of the Venetian. As a side thought, when I think of, The Venetian, I think great, we'll eat at the Grand Lux. 
 
Okay, so the cynics will say the purpose (I just mentioned) of the Venetian is to make money. No, I don't necessarily believe that. There are the exceptions wherein you create something beautiful and the money follows. 

I love museums, architecture, and the men and women who create; who risk and built what might even be considered contributions to culture.  Placing you in a state of awe is not taking your money. That feeling comes free. 

And so I took that walk of mine after dinner, the same walk I've taken through the Venetian, many times. (I often wonder what those in Security are thinking as I do this.) Each time I play the same game and I doubt I'm the only one who does this.  

I seek to find a square inch of this place that the Owner didn't put great thought into; if only a minute, irrelevant corner where I could locate an extension cord, or a web of dust; some abandoned, non-specific, unimportant spot in this massive facility which wasn't thought out fully when they built the place.  

It's never happened. I couldn't. I can't. The place simply 'is', as if molded and designed and born to be only beautiful.  Such a place cannot only be about money. It's not about distraction; cheap Vegas gimmicks; lighting, flashes, or even expensive\/massive - still distractions - chandeliers, or hanging fabric you find in other places.  

The Venetian is about rock solid beauty. ""Rock Solid""... that's The Venetian. 

Someone wanted to give us something. Something magnificent. Something beautiful. So if you intend to stay or merely visit, see if you don't feel the difference from the other pushing and shoving to get your money strip locations. Walk though St. Peter's Square and listen to the operatic love songs, sung live and free of charge. Follow the beautiful ceilings, the second floor canals and marvel at how they were built while imagining the look on the architect's face when the Aldelson family suggested such a feat. This is not your daddy's casino, or your grandfather's gambling house. The Venetian, from the Grand Lux to the Palazzo, to the waterfalls in between, and back again needs to be seen. So dress up and feel comfortable. Get away from the Vegas grime and realize there are still places hanging on to their virtues.",0,0,0

Service:  had requested room service, spa service, and additional bath robes\/slippers.  I also called concierge with questions on the best bars in the hotel for my friend's drink preferences (my friends love craft brew!).  All staff was fast, friendly, and helpful.  All staff was able to fulfill my requests.

Room Quality:  luxurious yet cozy, clean, and spacious rooms.  Have stayed in 2 bed and 1 bed suites.  Soaking tubs w\/jets are extremely relaxing.  Additional area to put on make up makes you feel like a queen for the week!

Spa:  very clean, helpful staff.  Prices were expensive, but it's Vegas.  Worth every penny for my pedicure!

Room Service:  all food came to order and was hot and fresh.  Exactly what we were expecting, standard American food.  A couple of dishes have a modern twist if you're looking for something different.  Otherwise, many other restaurants do take out, so you can call the restaurant and go walk downstairs to pick up your order.  Not a bad deal!

Last weekend when I was there, the bf and I checked out on Sunday and were going to go home, but we were on a roll playing poker so decided to stay an extra night.

As the various hotels on the strip continue to go through remodeling and or replaced with new ones, the Venetian\/Palazzo is definitely the BEST that you will get. You cannot beat the size of the suites and the location.  Exceptional rooms in size and amenities. 

The standard suites are equipped with comfortable beds, clean, upgraded with timeless decor.  There are TV's in every room literally, including the bathroom. I appreciated the bathroom suite with a ton of mirrors, vanity area, a TV etc. I had to come here for work and stayed for the week, but if I was to come on a personal trip, you can definitely share a room with friends - the suites are huge!

I would totally recommend using the Canyon Ranch Spa within the Venetian which connects to the Palazzo - solid 5 stars. Review to come.

From the room service, convenience, cleanliness, the list can go on - definite 5 stars. 

One last note, this casino actually pays out which is an added plus :)",5,1,2

The bathroom is the size of a small room, equipped with both a bath, shower and the toilet has its own door. Nice vanity in there too. The shower has 3 shower heads, one for your head, 2 for your body, it sure comes handy. The beds are so so comfortable! You'll have no problem falling asleep. The living area, has some nice chairs, table, a couch that pulls out into a bed and a nice view. The only thing I don't like about the room is that the mini fridge comes fully equipped, so if you have leftovers you have no room to put it in. Also be careful with the mini fridge, do not move or adjust anything, since it will automatically charge to your account if you take out a drink. Also the Snacks by the vanity in the living area, are not FREE. You will be charged. They're pretty expensive too. Another thing I don't like about the hotel is that it's so difficult to navigate. It's easy to get lost. You have to take 2 elevators to get to your floor. Why? No clue. You take one to get to the Venetian floor. Once there, you walk until you find another elevator and you take that one to your floor. The hotel itself is pretty enormous, there's so much to do, so much to explore. There's the casino, huge shopping mall, food court, pool area, and apparently there's a gym too. The pool area isn't large, don't bring your towel down from your room, there's plenty here. The hotel overall is very decorative and artistic. You can easily split a one or two bed suite with your friends\/family. They only give you two keys though and only the ones who booked the room should check in. If they find out you have more people in your room, you will be charged extra each night (I believe $83 per person?). Really nice hotel overall.",0,0,0

Apparently all of the rooms at the Venetian are considered suites, we got the most inexpensive one. It was still fairly large. The bathroom had a separate tub and shower, two sinks and a separate room for the toilet. The main area had a king sized bed and then a couple of steps down led to a generous living space, with a sectional sofa, desk and fax machine and a small breakfast table. The room also had 3 TVs: One in the bathroom, one facing the bed and one in the living area.

The hotel hasa large shopping area (the Grand Canal Shoppes) and along with its sister hotel Palazzo, has a TON of restaurants. The Venetian also has some of the most popular shows on the strip, including the Blue Man Group and The Phantom of the Opera.

The only thing I have against the Venetian was the location. It's at kind of the northern end of the strip. Since all of our friends were staying at Planet Hollywood, it was a good 15 minute walk to get down there. But I'd say that's a very small negative; even with that, I'd love to stay here again.",2,0,0

The room itself was lovely; I loved the bathroom (I'm such a girl!) with the vanity separate from the sink that I could get ready at.  Not to mention the nice big tub :) 
The suite had a nice big comfy bed with two TVs and a wonderful view of the pool area and strip.   We didn't have a tower suite, so I can't compare, but I liked our room very much.  I'm surprised that these high end hotels don't offer free Internet access (esp. when much cheaper places like Hampton Inns do), but being as we were out boozing in the casinos or catching a show, it didn't really matter.  Extensive room service menu and plenty of amenities. The only thing that really bothered me was the car\/parking\/valet situation, it was a complete mess.  You have to wait quite awhile for your car or a taxi and it was always crowded.  We ended up reserving a car to take us to the airport when we left, rather than take our chances in the taxi stand. 
I would definitely stay here again; hopefully in the tower suite.  And if I had more time, I would like to check out their Canyon Ranch spa.  But I loved Vegas and I loved the Venetian (Tao was a lot of fun as well).  Would def recommend this hotel.",2,0,0

Simple in theory, but every time I came up I saw people having to stop for directions....just to get to their room!   At least there is gorgeous decor to accompany you on your aimless lost wanderings around the halls of the Venetian. Gas lamps, gilded accessories, comfy chairs to rest your weary legs in...

The hotel rooms are great. The Rialto suite is set up the same as the standard bella but with much more sq footage. The downside to this is that the tv in the bed area is pretty far away from the beds. BUT it's a much nicer room! Heres our messy room right before leaving:
http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s94YhFxa5VM

Free things to ask for: Humidifier (it was actually really dry without it), crib (comes with a little baby toiletry set thing), extra fridge (for the baby milk, of course).

Decent channel selection on the tv's (theres a small one in the bathroom, but positioned so you can't see it from the bathtub unless your head is where the faucet is), but when you change channels there is a delay which can get annoying.

The rooms are great though! So are the lobbies. 

Room service is overpriced, if you must eat in your room, order Grand Lux to go.

To get roses to your room it's way overpriced.. Champagne is overpriced as well, but not as much as the flowers...

Theres a huge convention center between the Venetian and Palazzo... if you need to use the (small) business center, it's $7.50 per 15mins for computer\/internet use, but you can use the 15 mins on separate visits... so you can check your email real quick each day.... in room internet is $9.99 per day I believe, but don't bring a laptop to VEGAS!

The casino floor cocktail service is not that fast, unless your lucky.

The Grand Lux Cafe is GREAT! It's from the same people who do the Cheesecake Factory. 

The Salmon Baguette from Bouchon was the perfect breakfast.

The variety in fine dinning is great.

The Canyon Ranch Spa is really nice.

If you stay in the Venezia tower beware of the strong almost perfume smell in the lobbies and elevators. I don't know why they make it so strong.

I didn't go to the pool, because it was kind of cold. But it's where Chris Angel walked on water ;)

The poker room has a lot of players. During the deep stack extravaganza tourneys they extend the card room out into the slot machine territory! There are a loada really good, local, players who play here quite a bit. If you go on a holiday weekend, there are a bunch of loose players! Always use your club grazie players card when you play, they will give you at least a dollar in food comps for every hour you play. Overall if you play smart and figure who your up against at the table, it's a great room. Oh, Daniel Negreanu stopped by last time I was there. He didn't play, but yes... I bugged him for a photo and hand shake.

Overall Las Vegas Sands Corp stock is down from over $100 per share to $7ish right now... but hey, pretty sure it went to around $2 not that long ago, I know they are trying to get a cash flow from stuff in Macau, but they really are trying in Vegas to make the Venetian and Palazzo continue to be one of the top few Resort\/Casino's on the strip, and as far as I'm concerned it's working!",1,1,1

The room was magnificent (we got a suite in one of the towers). It had 2 queen beds and a sofa sleeper in the living area with 2 separate TVs. The bathroom was gorgeous with a shower and a tub and everything was spotless.

We ordered room service, which was amazing (mozarella sticks, quesadillas, bruschetta, and belinis :)). Everything was top notch quality and top notch service.

Lastly, everything is located in the Venetian! They have the casino (obviously), shops, food, Tao Restaurant\/Tao Club\/Tao Beach, and more pools, it's huge! Definitely amazing...

The -1 star rating is due to the fact that we got the last room in the corridor (great for not getting called for making noise, but bad to walk to). We had to walk down 4 very long corridors just to get to our room every time. It is probably due to this and the size of the Venetian that the room service takes long to be delivered (about 45 to 1 hour).  

Would definitely consider staying here again on my next visit.",0,0,0

The casino is great and I especially liked their video roulette with live wheel. $5 minimum w\/o having to share a table with everyone else. I was constantly asked for my ID and I didn't have not one cocktail waitress ask me if I wanted anything though...the hell

Grand Lux Cafe (upscale Cheesecake Factory) is open 24hrs and has a large menu. No buffets here but Thomas Keller's Bouchon IS here.

The pool was pretty cool and hosts Tao Beach - a beach club. There's also Tao Asian Bistro and Tao Nightclub. The bistro turns into the nightclub. Didn't go but it looked nice. 

They strictly enforce the display of a room key for entry into the suites

For some reason, the Venetian wasn't worth the hype that I expected. Maybe it's because I find the hotel has created a small Venetian village in the holodeck on a Star Trek spaceship.

Vegas is an amusement park for gamblers. The hotels and casinos do a great job creating an illusion of exotic places from around the world. My one night stay at the Venetian Hotel suite was good as can be expected for a five star hotel. The room (esp. the bathroom) was spacious and comfortable with amazing views.

The indoor shopping plaza, waterfalls, canal and singing gondolas (which are $$$ to ride) adds to the charm. As for the casino, it has all of the game tables and machines that will either make or break a gambler.

From my small sampling of the Venetian Hotel and Casino, I would give three stars and will add one star for spotting Rod Stewart.",2,1,1

We first checked in friday 5.27 memorial day weekend.. which btw ( never ever go on a holiday weekend) Thank god we arrived on friday there wasn't too many people checking in around 5pm so we were lucky. 
We get up to our room and find out its on the 9th floor in the back corner by the elevators and a exit ""stair well""... When we booked the room we asked for a smoking room and come to find it smelt like there was four 80 yr old men smoking cigars and died in the room the night before.. There were cigarette burns all over the carpet and some gum on the couch.. Now i have stayed in smoking rooms before and have never experienced a smell like this before. The room was just cold and erie feeling in that room.. We were all so frustrated that we payed 400 a night for this awful room... We decided to go down to the front desk and ask for a different room but of COURSE they were fully booked and we might of had a chance tommorrow. whatever, long story short we didn't want to move by the time we got ready to go out in the room and our stuff was everywhere.

I recently went to Vegas with seventeen people. There were fifteen staying at the Venetian twelve of them in three other adjoining rooms and me and my friend Sean in our own room down the hall. It was a very special young lady's twenty first birthday so needless to say we were partying like no tomorrow. 

Upon checking in i slipped Melissa (concierge\/check in girl) a twenty dollar bill and asked for a room near my friends with a nice view where we would not disturb anyone. We were placed at the end of the hall on the ninth floor looking out over the pool and the strip...ridiculous.

Once we settled in we called room service for extra ashtrays and glassware...no problem, how many would you like?? The VIP concierge (cowboy) got us all hooked up no line no cover at Tao (that's a huge group), Tao Beach club rocked out, once again show your room key and your in. If your a drunken slob like me and bring your glass down to the pool all loaded up with your favorite beverage do not fret... the super excited to help you, hot girls working the towel mansion will be happy to take your glass and turn it into plastic...full of your original tasty beverage.

It seems like every single review I read on the Venetian is like ""O MY GOD I AM SO DUMB THAT I CANT EVEN FIND MY WAY AROUND THIS PLACE CUZ ITS SO BIG"" Cmon...really? that's it? your big complaint? Well my only complaint is the Venetian is full of girls and guys too stupid to either 
a) read a sign
b)ask directions
or c) remember where your room is(i know this is really hard, but if i can do it it full of drugs, saturated in alcohol with eight grams of pheromones spread across my upper lip...i think most of you stand a chance).

If you're ready to spend $500\/day (low side) for a room w\/2 beds and one decent (for two) meal per day, the Venetian is your spot.
There are no finer hotel rooms in Las Vegas. Period. However, you will pay dearly. And why not? My mom always said, ""go first cabin and you'll never be disappointed."" She was right. The Venetian does not disappoint--on the inside.
The casino floor is full of new slots, beautiful music and clean, non-smoke, air. The sportsbook is state-of-the-art (but the service is awful for the money you spend) and your dining options (I eat at YardBird or Delmonico's) are superb.
Different story on the outside: the Venetian pool has two separate banks of sound blaring at you: beach club hip-hop and old-school elevator; awful beyond belief. Your best bet is to hang out at the Palazzo pool (long and shallow), with chaises sardined. For the pretty-penny you'll be spending, the worst set-up in Vegas. Moreover, with huge, east-facing Palazzo blocking your summer sun and south-facing Venetian blocking your autumn and winter sun, you're pretty-well hosed as far as bagging rays in the AM during those seasons, but you will be hearing head-pounding, nerve-thumping hip-hop from noon forward. If you're in your 20's and can make the financial stroke, this is clearly your spot.
Too, you'll be paying the daily resort fee for excellent internet access and use of their outstanding workout facilities.
If you plan to gamble occasionally, hang out in your room web-surfing, and working out at the spa, this is your spot. OR, if you visit in December (ice-skating at hotel entrance) this is your spot. The best of the best. If venture to the pools, be ready for disappointment. Three stars.",0,0,0

Otherwise, the Venetian still offers a great deal for larger groups because of its great location and suites that can squeeze up to 6 or 7 people comfortably.

We ordered suites and we were told it is fine to get two kings and to call back to ask for the rooms to be connected and it was a $10 fee to have them connected, which I was fine with. I called back to ask to connect them and change a mistake on my reservation. I was told I can't connect two kings and when I explained some other lady said I could and asked if there was anything he could do. I was told the rooms are non refundable and when I check in they could maybe do something about it then since rooms are first come first serve. He didn't try to help at all. I'm going mid-May so I doubt they'll have the availability. Really wish I wasn't lead astray and when I ask to correct it they weren't rude and snarky.

It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

If only you knew the drama and the stress that us girls went through in order to choose which hotel we'd stay at in Vegas on our girls trip. We went from a slew of hotels to stay at... our heart was set on the Venetian because a) It's a 5 star hotel and b) It's sleek and sexy! Normally I stay at the Bellagio and my friend stays at the Wynn so we're used to NICE FANCY hotels... in the end we chose the Venetian and the Palazzo suite for our stay... 1400 square feet of ballin! Or so it looked like from the picture...

Arrived on Friday at 11:30AM to check in... my friend hadn't arrived yet so even though check in isn't until 3PM I tried anyway... LONG line to check in... LOOOOONG line! An employee saw me enter the velvet ropes and asked if I was checking in and I said yes... he said that if I didn't mind going up the elevator that was no wait to check in upstairs... score! So I went up stairs to check in... my room wasn't ready and I requested a couch with a pull out sofa sleeper but I was told that there were no rooms available with the pull out sleeper... but that if one was available Saturday they could switch our rooms... a lot of trouble if you ask me to switch rooms so I asked about a roll away bed and they said normally it's $35\/day but they would give me one for free since no sofa sleeper was available. Brownie points for them! They said they would call me as soon as the room was ready but that they would hold my bags for me... easy enough. We went shopping!! 

I got a call around 2PM that the room was ready. My friend arrived at almost 4:30PM so we checked in thereafter. Got our keys and headed up to our suite... arrived at the END of a VERY LONG HALLWAY and was ready to see our pimpin suite... opened the doors and..............................................................................

was extremely disappointed. BEYOND disappointed! Um was this the same room as the pictures?!?!?!!? Cuz it sure didn't look like it. The rugs were worn and dirty. There was no L shaped couch. Just a dirty yellow ""love seat"" which didn't look very lovey. Two small chairs and a small table in the living room. The living room looked... empty. Pathetic. Lonely. Everything looked... OLD. The bathroom was nice so I'll give it that. But that's about it. We called the front desk about not having an L shaped couch which I was told we'd get when I checked in... he stated it only comes with a ""love seat"" and I mentioned it was fraying, dirty, and old and that it wasn't lovey or lovely at all and all he did was apologize. My friend and I were... confused. Debating on what to do. We were supposed to meet up with 2 other friends to go to the Wynn Buffet for dinner so we decided to go do dinner and talk about it. Talking was short. We hated the room and felt cheated! So after dinner we went back to the front desk, IN PERSON, no phone calls...

We inquired about having a room that was ""more 5 star quality"" and the nice gentleman helping us started to show us bigger suites in his book... we explained it wasn't the SIZE of the suite that was the problem... hell we had 1400 square feet which is practically a house!... it was what was IN the suite that LACKED 5 stars! We listed everything and then he did some researching... and he showed us a different suite at the newer Palazzo connected to the Venetian and asked us if we'd consider moving there... and we agreed. He even mentioned that our suite has yet to be renovated and that it is older but that they are renovating next year... helllooooo FALSE ADVERTISING!!! The pics look NOTHING like the room itself. Ughh it was GROSS! 

Bellman took all our stuff to our new suite in the Palazzo... and it was a BOMB ASS SUITE! (I'll write a review under Palazzo for that one)... but Venetian, you FAIL, an absolute EPIC FAIL... and never ever ever ever again will I even CONSIDER staying with you... lesson learned for me and my friend...

I am not sure how much it cost because I didn't end up paying for it but whatever it was I'm sure it was worth the money. I liked that they had people checking room keys before you could use the elevators as well. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because we wanted to ride the gondolas but felt it was pointless because the outdoor area it would go through was closed and dried up.

To Whom it may concern;
ATT:
HOTEL MANAGER



 
After staying at the Venetian last March 27th  for my 36th wedding anniversary and having the most pitiful disgraceful room, as well as my wife cutting her foot open on the exposed carpet tacks on the stairs in the room, we moved out of this horrible room and was accommodated beautifully at the ENCORE, for less money in a suite of much higher standard. I was told at the Venetian that there were no suites available. However when I called into the reservation center, there was no shortage of rooms, just the rate was an issue. To say the least when I had to call to the front desk about our room for six hours until finally I gave in around midnight, my wife who wanted to just get out so we could have the few minutes left of our anniversary. Fortunately we were made very comfortable at the Encore, never to return to the Venetian after running my anniversary. 

After a couple of weeks we received a two day complimentary offer from the Palazzo Hotel in lieu of the horrible experience we had at the Venetian. I choose to take a chance and took up the offer from the Palazzo to spend my 60th birthday in May. To say the least the room was great the stay was as nice, until I was accosted from a very poorly trined security guard Mike at the entrance to the self parking garage.  I did not come to a complete stop at the garage entrance and he started raising his voice and being exceptionally rude. When I opened my window he asked me if I was blind and then flashed a high power flashlight in my eyes. I got out of my car and had several harsh words with this unprofessional and dangerous employee. I was refused assistance from the hotel staff at the scene when I called in. Only after I came into the hotel and went to a manager in the floor. He summoned a security manage, who introduced me to a very professional young man by the name of Matt. I filled out a hand written statement, and to date I have not had any apology or response to this assault from your poorly trained guard. A typical rent a cop attitude. 

The one thing that the Venetian and Palazzo has truly done is to make me a 100%  Wynn\/Encore client.

Definitely my favorite, go-to place to stay while I'm in Sin City. Everything about this hotel is awesome, and couple it with the Palazzo next door, and you've got almost NO reason to leave!
I love the lobby, just walking in from the from doors just gets me in the mood for fun, as I now know I'm in VEGAS. HUGE walkways lead into the casino, all beautifully designed, and I can't help but marvel at the stone pillars and paintings on the ceilings- gets me every time.
The staff at the front desk was top-notch. Incredibly helpful, incredibly professional, but also very personal and charming. I was checked in within moments, and was happy to notice that I was given the room I had asked for in my reservations I made online.
The room was just as perfect as I had expected. The last time I stayed I was in the Venezia tower, this time I was in the main tower above the casino area, and they're just as nice. The strip view was awesome. I LOVE the fact that the bedroom is separated from the main living room area. If you come back to your room in the middle of the day, it's nice to be able to plop down on the couch and turn on the TV for a bit. Cool touch having remote control window shades too.
The beds were ultra comfy- I slept like a baby every night. The bathroom is spectacular- love the look and feel of every bit of it, especially the toilet having it's own little room. Wide open sink area, huge shower, huge tub, marble and gold EVERYWHERE.
Couple the spectacular rooms, great service, and great location with the TONS of great shops and unbelievable restaurants, and you've got yourself a first class casino.

The second time was better so I wasn't sure what to expect at The Venetian. It's a 5 star hotel so of course it's nice. The service and details were better than I expected (compared to my first time at Palazzo where the wall paper was peeling off and service was slow). One complaint I have though is that the Venezia Tower is reallyyyyy far from the lobby. It's two elevators away and many winding hallways.

The rooms are very large, like the Palazzo, so that's great, especially for groups.

Grand Lux Cafe is open , but who wants to stand in line with a bunch of spray tanned club whores just to get a little something to make the booze go down easier? 

The worst part was that they pump scent through the HVAC system there that is so overpowering, you'd think you had a Drakkar drenched guido  following you 24-7. 

The rooms were well appointed and nicely decorated, however our wall had a punchole in it (to me, not the sign of a 5 star hotel) and I had to call the front desk to make sure they knew we didn't get crazy and do it.

Our initial room was on the 5th floor and the windows opened up onto a BRICK WALL. You have to pay extra to get the view. On site it is cheaper to upgrade, only $49\/day. We upgraded to the 10th floor. 

We asked the front desk to remove the feathers (make the room hypoallergenic.) When the maids took out the pillows and comforter, they shook feathers all over the room. I still had problems the whole time, unfortunately.

Apparently, this is a VERY common request. They did not have enough blankets because everyone else wants hypoallergenic rooms.  This was problematic. I had two sons with me. One was 9 months old. They had RUN OUT of cribs even though we had reserved one, called ahead one week and also called that morning. So, they told us they could give us ONE BLANKET to replace the comforter for the bed. What would my two sons sleep with? So they allowed us to have ONE MORE blanket for my son on the couch. 

My 9months old baby slept on the FLOOR in the BATHROOM on TOWELS. 

They brought me a crib the next day. I asked for it at 7:00 a.m., I am sure this was the only reason I was able to get one. I also asked for another blanket at this time. I was still sleeping under the robes provided because I was too cold. (My husband and I have different temperature tolerance. Normally, I just use a blanket, but since I could not obtain more than one, we had a problem.)

They gave me a nice baby package (shampoo, powder, etc.) for the baby at this time with a small baby blanket. Why didn't they give me that the day before?

What was very nice was that on level 2 was the shopping with the beautiful canals. We really enjoyed that. Also on the first floor was the breakfast buffet. We could go there while my husband napped.

Why not have some hypoallergenic rooms already set up? Why not buy some hypoallergenic comforters so people with allergies do not have to freeze to death at night? One would think for a property of this caliber that we would not have service telling us how many blankets we can and cannot have. We did not feel like we were at a first class property.",1,0,0

And I guess this will be our last visit here or any of Sands properties. In a way I wish I had not stayed here and stuck to Aria or Cosmo, would have been able to romanticize this place since I love Venice and Italy so much. I wanted this stay to be nice but may be it was a mistake to stay here trusting all the lovely reviews on Yelp. 

So here's what went wrong during my stay here, I was in Vegas for a business trip so did not expect too much as I did not have much time at the hotel so a comfortable bed and a nice shower would have been lovely. The trip started on a lovely note being able to see all the suite areas for the first time and then it just fell apart. After a long day at work I came back to the room and wanted to shower and the water started pooling in the shower stall. I thought it was the pressure from the shower jets so the next day morning I did not start any jets, but still the same situation. I was not able to shampoo my hair in the morning as if I left the shower ON for more than five mins the water would become ankle deep and the only way it would go is if I shut the shower for five mins and started again. Seriously?? 

Also I didn't know my husband had asked if we could check out late when he checked in. I was at the HD show so I didn't know this but, they had told him that the hotel was fully booked and that's not possible. But when the shower disaster happened and I called the front desk to let them know. The first thing the front desk person asked me was if we needed late check out. Still wondering how this works. You want to charge and overcharge for everything, literally and still have the guest not expect even a decent shower. Sorry to say this but I will not be returning to Venetian any time soon. You gave us a room facing a parking lot on our first stay, and we did not complain as we were told that the hotel was fully booked and then this. I expected much more from such an old place, I used to come to bouchon every time I visited Vegas but now I am not getting anything at the Venetian.

The sofa folds out as a full-size bed, transforming the lavish livingroom into another bedroom. The large window has Roman blinds and curtains that open and close via remote control near the bed.

There are gondolas that travel through the shops area with singing gondoliers and beautiful ""walk-over bridges."".  One thing about this hotel is it is always packed full of people.  The Phantom of the Opera show was very nice and again draws a lot of people.  The shops are upscale but not the top designers.  The restaurants are average to fine dinning with a food court in the casino.

The rooms set a standard in Vegas.  They are large all suite rooms featuring a sitting area with a sofa that converts to a bed.  Again, over the top Italian decor but luxurious non-the-less.  I believe the smallest rooms are 800-900 sqft and the upper floors hold rooms that can be jaw dropping.

It's basically it's own world and you wouldn't even need to leave the hotel if you didn't want to.

The rooms are beautiful and well maintained, and I find the beds to be particularly comfy. The bathrooms have a luxurious feel to them, and I love the fluffy white towels.

Walking around the hotel is really fun, as they have attempted to re-create Venice with the river running through the central concourse and the gondolas and the gondoliers with their jaunty black hats. There is always some sort of entertainment going on, and there is always something to do for entertainment.

I highly recommend this hotel. But again, if you hate the smell of smoke and want to avoid casinos, you have to walk through the casino to get to all of the hotel rooms. Also, I can't forget to mention the beautiful pool. There is plenty of seating, and spring and fall are the perfect times to visit to enjoy the out of doors and pool area without suffocating due to the heat.",1,0,0

The only downside to our trip was for my husband , he had purchased food on Wednesday nite (3\/11\/15) from the Subway that is in the mall of the Venetian, by 2am he had food poisoning , a very bad case of it. The next morning he was not better so I asked for the concierge for assistance in who to report this to, I was directed to security , security then came up to the room with an EMT to check on my husband . The next day the management called the room to check on my husband and offered us a late checkout for Friday if we needed it and if he needed anything from the in room refrigerator it would be comped. They did tell us that the Subway was new, only 2 weeks open. I never did see a report written up on it but hope they did as a way to track if it happens again.

The room has 3 areas: the bedroom, bathroom, and living slash dining slash office room. Each area has its own TV, and the one by the neapolitan room has a dvd player. Remote-controlled curtains. Bathroom's like a huge walk-in closet with separate shower stall and bathtub. The toilet is also given its own privacy in one corner so if you had a little too much of Panda Express downstairs, might wanna close the door if you're doing numero dos because the bathroom has no ventilation.

would i stay again?  not unless i find a great deal!

although the goods outweigh the bads at the venetian, what's bad on the list is a non-negotiable item, at least for me.  

the goods:
- suite is huge with a sunken living room and 2 flat screen tv's.
- bathroom is beautiful with marble floors, separate bath and shower, another flat screen tv and double vanities.
- there's a door to toilet room(!) which makes things a lot convenient and less embarrassing in case you have to take #2 :)
- great restaurants and shops so you never have to leave the hotel premise.
- the main lobby is about 30 feet from the casino, so the hotel feels less crowded and gives the un-vegas like impression, especially if you are staying in venezia tower.

the bads:
- mind boggling layout of the place (10th floor on main tower somehow becomes 4th floor on venezia tower).
- valet parking is always full...is that even possible?
- pool area is not a place to flaunt your dd size boobs (so friggin' fake and i am not being jealous) nor a fashion show runway to sport your gucci stilettos.
- 1 ply toilet papers...wtf!!!  this is so ghetto for a hotel at this caliber and absolutely non-negotiable.

the venetian hotel is NOTHING like venice, italy, except for its confusing layout.  the main theme here is ""bigger the better"".  the only reason i'd ever book this hotel in the future would be to enjoy the tub and the room itself.  and this time, i'd make sure to bring my own charmin ultra soft with my bf in tow.",12,11,10

I just recently stayed in one of their Bella Suites with a few of my girls, and experienced the best service ever! All of the employees are wonderful, and treat you like royalty. I especially love how they give personalized service. For example, whenever I called for more towels, they would say, ""Good afternoon Ms. Lee, how can i help you today? ..... Alright no problem, is there anything else i can get you Ms. Lee?"" 

Besides the top notch service, The Venetian is located in a great spot if you're looking to hit up the nightclubs at Encore, Wynn, or inside The Venetian. You can save, by just walking over as opposed to spending money on a cab. The pool and jacuzzis are also very nice. There are also multiple jacuzzis if you want your own for your group. 

There are many food choices inside the hotel \/ casino. My favorite is Grand Lux Cafe for a quick lunch or dinner; their burgers are the best and they're also open 24\/7. And definitely join the Grazie club if you're going to gamble. As a perk for being a new member, I got $25 free slot credit to play with!

We reserved a room for NYE.  We were there early and the hubs was at the poker table.  He was running hot so I left him at the table and went to check in.  After waiting in line for over 20 minutes, the agent tells me that I can't check in because the rez is in hub's name.  That's their policy, no exceptions.  Fine.  I tell her that he's playing in the poker room and ask if can she page him so we don't have to get back in the ever growing line.  Nope, she won't do it.  WTF?  Really, why not?  Can't pick up the phone to call WITHIN YOUR OWN HOTEL?!?  Is that five star treatment?  Whatever.  I go get the hubs and he gets in line while I ask for the manager.  Again, I wait.  He comes out maybe 10 minutes later.  No, sorry for making you wait.  I tell him what happened.  He reiterates the policy but says that he'll get someone to help us if we come over to where he is.  No apology for the other stupid employee.  

We get our ""non-smoking"" room and it smells like smoke.  We wonder if it's the room next door and I call down to report the problem.  The agent says that the floor below (29th floor) is a smoking floor and that the smell may be coming through the vents.  No offer to change our room, no apology.  Basically, it's too bad, so sad.  Again, WTF?  It's not non-smoking if we can smell smoke.   

I get into the shower to freshen up and discover these Chinese branded toiletries that I've never heard of that smell like baby shampoo.  I thought this is the Venetian, what's up with this Chinese stuff?  The hotel has gone ghetto on its toiletries.  Come on...  it's like going to the 99 cent store and seeing all those Mexican brands of canned or prepared foods.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with things like that but you're not expecting them at a""5 star"" resort, ya know?

Anyhoo, the final blow came when I got into bed later.  Those had to be the scruffiest sheets I've ever slept on in a hotel of that caliber.   What's going on?  We just came off a stay at Treasure Island and its bedding was nicer than the Venetian's.  Sad, sad moment.  I've slept on some hotel beds that I couldn't wait to get into at the end of the day.  Venetian's was not one of them.  When I'm paying that kind of $$$, the least I expect is a luxurious bed.  *sigh*

Pros:
Beautiful! The whole hotel is gorgeous.  Our rooms were very snazzy!
Bathroom: It's huge! I love the glass shower and I love the huge tub.  Add in the White Basin store downstairs and I could have lived in the bath tub. 
Check in and out was very easy and fast.  
Lots of choices for restaurants and shopping. 
I'm a pepsi girl so I was happy to find that a lot of the places served pepsi instead of coke. Unimportant to most people but it thrilled me.  
There's a remote that makes the blinds and curtains go open and closed and up and down.  So cool to play with!
Room service was fast and quite yummy!  
Taxi line was fast. 
It's close to Harrah's which is the closest monorail stop.  

Cons:
THE SMELL.  It smelled like an old lady who forgot she put on perfume about a thousand times and just kept spraying.  After unpacking, I can still smell it on all of our clothes.  Asthma or allergies or not, it's very off putting.  And unnecessary.  
It took forever to get drinks and one of the drink ladies took my MIL's coke order and then came back without a coke and when she asked again for one (just a plain little coke in a glass), the lady snapped that she had to be at a table.  We'd sat for half an hour at the slot machines and between the few of us lost quite a bundle so I found that to be pretty rude but she turned around and happily took a drink order (alcohol drink) from a skanky looking girl hanging on a guy at the black jack table. 
None of the outlets in the bathroom worked and the power went off in our room one morning. 
No prices for the mini bar any where in the room at all what so ever.  And seriously $9 for a tiny box of peanut M&Ms? 
The doors in the rooms slam.  And I guess not many people understand that you have to close the door softly so there were slams up and down the hallway all hours of the day and night.  I heard security talk to the guys beside us about slamming their door and screaming things in the hallway.

* Pro tip: Sign up for their email listing to get 33 percent off your stay (if you stay for more than three nights) * 

Although the Venetian isn't in the middle of the strip, it's still in a relatively prime location. I also thought it was nice to have easy access to the Grand Canal Shops and gondola rides if you're into that kind of thing. There's also a fabulous bar in here (The Dorsey) that I'd recommend checking out. Oh, and the food court has this super fabulous 24\/7 burger place! It reminded my boyfriend of Five Guys' burgers if you're a fan. My boyfriend and I probably got late night munchies from here two out of three times during our stay...it was *that* good.

Three words I'd use to describe the Venetian are opulent, luxurious, and elegant. It felt really special to have such a spacious hotel room with marble counters, two TVs, and a living room just for the price of your upper-average hotel on the strip. The casino staff are also generous with giving out free drinks which is definitely a plus in my book!

Ultimately, the Venetian is the best value for your money, given the size of its standard hotel room. The only downside of staying here is that now, my expectations are so much higher than they probably should be for Vegas hotels!",9,0,0

I got a great deal 2 years ago, paid $1200 for 5 nights in the Bella suite during Labor day weekend! Two double beds with a mini living room with a long sofa bed. The bathroom was spacious and nicely lit

Tao Club is nice inside with good music. Wish the ladies were in the bath when we were there. The dance floor could use a little room tho.

Swimming pool is decent size but hard to get chairs especially if your here with 5 other girls. Get there early to grab the chairs! There's always someone there to accommodate you, which was an extra plus. 

Tao Beach is very small!!! It was more of a place to sit and mingle- way too many seating area and no space. I guess it's for people to pop bottles? It felt like it was a random spot they pick to do a party. I think my backyard is bigger than that. Def go to Rehab or Wet republic instead. IMO

When you visit, make sure to walk along the canals (you can even pay for a gondola ride) and then relax at a cafe in the plaza (St Mark's Square) area surrounded by live entertainment.

Also, most of the best Vegas nightlife is within walking distance or very close via a taxi.

The rooms themselves are extremely spacious, very clean, and impressively themed.  I will warn you however; do not try and use the fridge.  For one, ANYTHING you pull out will be recorded and placed on the bill for your room, and those tiny little drinks are NOT cheap.  Besides I don't even think the fridge will run unless you pay extra.

In the bathroom... Huge glass shower and separate tub were wonderful. Toilet was in a little cubby, separate from the main bathroom. Dressing table and mirror were a nice touch!

I asked for a room on an upper floor, facing away from the strip and they were happy to accommodate me. (I was there for a conference, so needed my 40 winks!) 

My favorite club in the hotel was Tao - try the Orange Dragon martini! Mostly a 30's crowd, with lots of energetic music, attentive servers, and friendly bartenders.

Cell reception was nonexistent but that's not the hotel's fault.

The conference center is huge. You do have to walk through the (smoky) casino to get there from the tower. Huge escalators ferried people up and down. Rooms were well marked so I only got lost a few times.

My co-workers and I booked our rooms here to attend a 3-day convention. After a long day of working and rushing to catch our flight, finding our suite was a very tiring adventure!! It was a maze walking through halls just to get to the other ""lobby"" and then walk through another set of halls just to get to our suite. Tiring. 
The suite was not what I was expecting as fast as size and decor. We had the Bella suite with 2 queen beds and a living room with a sofa bed. The bathroom had a bathtub and separate shower stall. The toilet had its on enclose area which was good to have. This was the ""basic"" suite so I shouldn't have expected anything grand. The beds and linens were comfortable. 
They have an exercise room that was well equipped. My friend and I were able to find an area to do our own HIIT workout. It was a busy morning and we weren't able to use the treadmill but there were other options. Getting here was also a journey. Lol 
The hotel employees were kind and helpful. We called for extra blankets and they delivered within 30 minutes. For room service, we ordered breakfast and although it took longer than expected, the meal was delicious! We had ordered omelette and hash browns and the portions were good to share between 2 people.

The good: The entry-level room was a hulking 600 + sq. feet. There were nice electronically controlled shades, the recessed living room was kind of cool, and the marble counter-top lighting was pretty.  The bathroom could have used a jetted tub, but it was huge and nicely appointed.  Also, they gave out nice coupons for slot credit if you have their Club Grazie card, and I managed to turn my coupon into a modest profit.

EVERYTHING ELSE SUCKED.
Their service is the stuff of nightmares.  I booked three nights using Egencia, a division of Expedia that our firm uses to book all our corporate travel.  The Venetian erroneously believed I had booked only two nights.  When I called Egencia and had them fax the Venetian people a receipt clearly stating I had booked and PREPAID for THREE nights, they still didn't get the message.  I talked to at least three departments: the front desk, the reservations manager, and a group reservations department, who all seemed mystified.  If they would talk to each other or check their fax machines once in a while, maybe they wouldn't be so confused.  But after two phone calls at the hotel, one very frustrating conversation at the front desk, and yet one more phone call from home, I'm still waiting for them to do ""research.""  They promised to call me back, but after their embarrassing show of incompetence the first oh, four or five times that I explained this problem to them, I'm sort of doubtful, and I'm getting ready to just dispute the charge straight through my Chase credit card.  

Especially noteworthy:
-The front desk agents had AWFUL attitude and were condescending and impatient. They made it seem like MY fault that this problem had occurred, and were insistent that it was MY mistake.  They treated me like I didn't know what I was talking about and was there just to make trouble, even though I have already wasted hours of my life that I will never get back trying to resolve this.

- No one there seemed to know what Egencia was. Hello? Egencia is a fairly common place corporate booking service.  I've used them for a while and they are quite on the top of their game.  I am convinced that the problem is on the Venetian's end, not Egencia's end. If the Venetian wants their bread and butter, which is conventioneers, to still appear on their doorsteps every now and then, they better get it together!

- My colleague who was also there for a conference also got charged an extra night.   So clearly, they've got some sort of data input problem going on.

- What's up with the pervasive Febreeze smell that's overwhelming the air everywhere? I smell it immediately when I enter and am reminded of a public toilet. Not good for the classy image they're trying to sell.

- Finally, for the love of God, they need to play something other than sound clips from their Phantom of the Opera show in the elevator.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this musical, having seen it both in New York and in Cleveland, but if I have to hear their mediocre rendition of ""Music of the Night"" one more time, I'm going to lose it.

Bottom line: stay away! There are plenty of other similarly priced and better run options on the strip, and if you want a truly relaxing experience, try something off strip that's non-gaming, like the Trump or the Platinum.  At least there, you won't be run over by all the inebriated  slot machine zombies or be forced to inhale days-old second hand smoke.",3,1,1

The Venetian is secure, has a friendly concierge staff that's easy to work with, a convenient mini-store with water, booze, and souvenirs, and a shop where you can do office-type things like buy CD-Rs (I actually needed one during my trip, go figure).

Their food court is crap, from the Pizzeria da Enzo to the San Gennaro Grill. Roam the strip for more entertaining and less expensive dining options. Heck, even Denny's is more bang for your buck.

-Very impressive looking!
-Spacious suite (at ~1,000 sq ft, this is larger than my apartment!)
-Super comfy bed
-Beautiful bathroom
-Very responsive and accommodating staff 
-Luggage services (will hold luggage until check-in time and from check-out to airport time)

A bit out of the norm for me, I actually called the hotel to make the reservation.  The rep was very friendly and helpful!  When I let her know of a competitor deal, she did work to give me a better packaged deal.

Cons:
-Front door does not always close all the way.  We had to make sure to slam it shut!
-No ""Do Not Disturb"" sign included in the room.  This was tricky when we had four very partied out girls trying to sleep in, and one of us had to make a mad dash to the door to prevent housekeeping from barging in.

While all the rooms are suites, the views aren't fantastic.  There is one side that overlooks a lighted outdoor pool area, but my view was of concrete and garage.  Not so pretty.

Also, I was constantly subjected to the soundtrack to Phantom of the Opera.  While I'm not a Weber fan, I can deal with small doses.  What I cannot deal with is the soundtrack for anything playing on an infinite loop.  In my 5 day stay there, I heard every song FAR TOO MANY TIMES.  Even if it had been broken up with songs from other performances happening in the hotel, I could have dealt with it, but even the Weber fans in our group found it to be a bit much.

Also, in the room, there were three television sets (sitting area, across from the bed and in the bathroom), but absolutely no functional drawers.  I would have happily traded any one of the televisions for functional drawers.  Instead, they provided weird enclosed shelving and a closet.  How very strange.

For the cost of the rooms, I found the place to be lacking.  If it had been coming out of my pocket, I would be a lot more unhappy with the overall experience, but even with my company paying for it, I wasn't particularly impressed.

Also, I was dealing with a tired baby when I was checking in and forgot to grab my credit card out of the machine.

He said he remembered what my husband looked like as well, so I could send my husband down to get it if I was busy with the baby. How thoughtful!

I was a little unsure about staying at the Venetian (actually anywhere on the Strip) with a toddler. Enough internet advice will tell you not to bring your child to Vegas and if you do, make sure to stay in a non-smoking casino hotel like the Vdara (with family suites and all). And we did neither (thank you but no thank you, Internet!) I am sure in an alternate reality where we would have stayed at the Vdara, things would have been great too. But we had no problem staying at the Venetian with a child. 

- We stayed at the Venetian tower and we had rented a car (their parking is free, unlike a lot of other hotels in Vegas now). That meant, if we came up from the self-park up to our room, the walk was 5 mins from the parking elevator to our room on the 24th floor, without a step into the casino. Tada! Such a breeze.

- Suites are spacious enough - provide ample space for the child to goof around. Heck, their bathroom is big enough for that! They provided a crib (my two-year old fit just right, but anything more than that, and the crib would have been too tight) -- but the king size bed could have come to our rescue in that case. And since I wanted to stock on some supplies in a refrigerator (which wasn't all sensored-up to charge the c**p out of you), I asked for one at check in and voila, they sent one to our room. Didn't see that coming!

- We got a swimming pool view. My daughter was highly entertained just looking out from their huge window. I know from a previous trip that you can try a 20-dollar trick (google it, might be called 40-dollar trick now) to get a strip view where you can see the Mirage volcano show from your window--pretty sweet!

- There's a Walgreens that is connected to the Venetian which was a 5-6 min walk from our hotel room (mostly through the hotel and casino). That was a savior when we had to make a quick run for some supplies. The food court they have (with Chipotle, Subway, Panda Express, and a bunch of other places) is one of the best I have seen in a Vegas hotel- perfect for a toddler who can be picky more often than we can adjust to. 

- For the first time, we had the time to take a look at the Venetian pools. As their pool map will tell you, children are welcome at one of the seven Venetian pools ('Carnivale') which I read as 'children are not welcome at the other 6'. We still saw families with kids at other pools, so feel free to venture out if that's your thing. We found Carnivale to be just right-- it had a part that was 1 foot deep, just right for my daughter to waddle around in while I just sit down next to her, and also a 3 feet deep part if you want the child to swim. Enough chairs to sit around.

- Finally, when the kid was asleep, you could use one of their three TVs to sit back and watch something. We wanted to connect one of our streaming devices, which looked almost impossible to connect, given how much they had covered all the inputs. But one call to them and they helped us figure out how to do it through the menus. The hotel wi-fi worked pretty well for streaming.

- And ya, the room was always cleaned when we were out for a couple hours in the morning, so we always returned to a clean room ready for the child's nap. I have never cared for these small details before traveling with a child. But it makes a huge difference now.

And there, I rest my case!",2,0,2

What amazed me was that every employee -- I mean *every* employee --- was pleasant, helpful, and seemed to be enjoying their job. Whether they were actually happy, I'll never know. But the attitude of the employees made it a pleasure to stay,  shop, and eat at the hotel.

As a contrast, one afternoon we ended up at the Flamingo for lunch. The employees there didn't seem to care much -- they didn't care when we got seated, how long it took to get  water (it was 102F outside, so we were thirsty), or how long until our order was taken. The service wasn't bad, but the attitude of the staff was noticeably lacking.

Back to the Venetian: Breakfast at the Bouchon was fantastic. I had a simple spinach omelet. The eggs were amazingly good. No overpowering flavor, but a perfect texture.Servers were very attentive.

We also ate at Grande Lux Cafe several times. Breakfast from the menu was good, but only $5 less than the Bouchon for similar dishes. (So for a bit more, you can eat at Bouchon.) The breakfast buffet was great. Lots of fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, an omelet station, and more. Finally, dinner at the Grande Lux was the best out of several restaurants in the hotel. (Admittedly, we did not try any of the high-end restaurants. I heard good things about Carne Vino and I'll wager that Delmonico and others are simply amazing.) At Grand Lux I had the Sicilian Pasta, which had a combination of sausage and chicken with a light tomato sauce served over spaghettini. Chicken was tender, sausage was flavorful, as was the light tomato sauce. The pasta was perfectly cooked.

Oh. And we also had the fried calamari as an appetizer. I have never had calamari that was so tender -- It melted in my mouth. It was also a huge portion -- we shared it among 2, but it could have easily been shared among 3 or 4 diners.

While I had almost no experience with other hotels in Las Vegas, I can say that the Venetian was a wonderful place, with comfortable rooms, good restaurants, friendly staff, and a great conference center.",1,0,2

I have found the environment in the Venezia tower - for me - to be totally conducive to a complete brain defragmentation in a very short period of time. They also have one of the only pools I've ever enjoyed hanging out in. Each afternoon I relaxed by the pool reading. The water itself was a tolerable temperature and the jacuzzi was never too crowded. 

My only complaint about this place is the horrific, infernal buzzing sound in the room. I turned off the air and looked everywhere for the source, but it seems like it's mainly due to air running in other rooms as well as that white noise phenom all huge hotels seem to have. It was fine, I just told myself it was white noise and kept the windows open the whole time.

I've also always encountered some issue or other on checkin. this Time it was that one of the LCD TVs didn't work. Also the battery for the safe was low, and they wouldn't do anything to fix the safe unless I was in the room. Really, in Vegas that can mean being in your room when you didn't plan on it so that issue was never taken care of and I just carried my most valuable stuff with me the whole time. Lastly, I got a Club Grazie card - their casino marketing card - the last time I was here last year.

Okay...

First of all, we had two reservations at the newer Palazzo, adjoining rooms.  When we got to the Palazzo, after 15 minutes of back and forth, there was nothing available... even though we arrived around 3pm.  They put us in the holdover Venetian, which is a long walk away. 

We walked all the way over there (had to later move the car as well), our room was 5-430.  Now, where would you start your search for the room?  Probably in the tower, 1-6, right?  WRONG.  

We went up the 1-6 tower, no rooms with that number.  We asked a cleaning lady, couldn't understand her, went back down (after the huge wait for the elevator, due to the pool being right below).  We found a security guy, he told us that we need to take the 17-26 elevator... but, to floor 10...!?  Floor 10 on a 17-26 elevator while looking for floor 5.  That sure makes sense.

So, low and behold, on the elevator, there IS a secret floor 10, then floors 17-26.  We got there, then asked one of the guards where to go next.  Over the skybridge!  Woo hoo... more walking.  We go over the skybridge, then what?  THEN... there is an elevator to floor five.

I mean, come the eff on.  That's just stupid.  The rooms there are nice and there is great artwork but this is just ridiculously poorly-planned.  Having just experienced that elevator hell, I saw an equally lost Russian couple, speaking no English... I ""Charaded"" to them to follow me and I showed them the below-listed tip...

*** TIP!!!  I later discovered the ""secret"" to a slightly less dreadful sequence of elevators to get in and out, while staying in the Venezia tower.  Right next to the check-in, there is an elevator down with a hallway to the right... go up that elevator to the 2nd level (there are only two options).  Then, you walk down a super long hallway but then there's the elevator to all of the floors.  In my case, I pressed five and there it was... no secret floor 10, no skybridge, etc.

The property itself is beautiful, with painted ceilings, coffered ceiling in the casino, and a very nice smell.  The only time I ever smelled cigarette smoke was when I was sitting right next to someone who was smoking.",1,0,0

When I first glanced at the Venetian I just thought how amazing it was to see the paintings on the wall like Michaelango himself came to the Venetian Hotel and blessed it. It felt like greek roman times with the archangels Michael and Gabriel in front of the hotel looking towards Las Vegas Blvd. 

The Rooms
I would only recommend friends I know to either stay at the Palazzo or the Venetian because of their luxurious suites to be accomodated in and for such a good rate if you book ahead of time. The bed is so comfy and easy to fall asleep on. The couch in the living room is a pull out bed if you try and cram more than XX amount of people in a room. 3 Flat Screen TVs one in front of the bed; one in front of the tv, one in the living room, and one in the bathroom while you taking a soothing bath. For you ladies that wanna get dolled up and what not they have a little section with a vanity mirror so you can take hours on yourself. 

The Swimming Pool
This is the hottest item during the summer time and jaccuzi is very soothing and relaxing. Many people take advantage of the massage treatment its a good 50minutes of your life :) 

The Food
They also provide a very convienent food court on the 2nd and 1st floor if you're lazy to go out and get other food. Grand Lux Cafe is actually a good place to eat at. 

Casino
-I'm not a big gambler but they got it all, hey you never know you could get lucky :) 

Nightlife
TAO: Venetian biggest and successful nightclub which is always crackin on the weekends. Since you're a guest ask for a complimentary fast to get in free but fellas might have a hard time getting in unless you go really early like 9pm early if not make sure you have a good guy\/girl ratio 

Valet 
Tip for thought: DON'T LOST YOUR VALET TICKET
This past weekend my friend lost his valet ticket and his name wasn't the one registered to the vehicle so they had to call security and inspect the items inside the vehicle and make sure it is your vehicle before they release it to you, so embarassing! 

Nonetheless I highly recommend staying at a Venetian Suite if you have family or friends for a great getaway vacay. Peace Yelp Heads!",11,9,10

One of the best looking lobbys. The Venetian and Palazzo pools are connected. Tons of restaurants and food court. Canyon Ranch Spa. And a great 24h Walgreens right in front. A big pro for me is that it couldn't be closer to the clubs at Wynn\/Encore which I enjoy. Real easy walk to Caesars and as far as Cosmo. Trust me spend the extra $$$ to stay here and you get it back in square footage. P.S. I've had a lot of success being friendly at the front de$k for decent views.,0,0,0

I'll try and keep this review efficient...

Pros:

- Overall good value. Booked on hotels.com for 139\/night plus 10% off, so 125\/night.
- Good location. Close to the ""gut"" of the strip. 1-2 blocks from bellagio, Caesars, Mirage, Treasure Island, etc. 
- Hotel is good for tourists. It has a mall (canal shops), and plenty of places to eat and hang out.
- Good pool. Nothing gimmicky here, but a nice, large, sunbathed pool WITHOUT blaring techno music and without an influx of tribal tattooed party'ers drinking at 10am. This was esp. nice after staying at Mandalay Bay.
- Rooms are large. All rooms are semi-suites. They have a seperate sunking living area, large bathrooms, and 2 Tv's.
- Pretty fast internet
-Food court in the Canal shops, good for those times you're low on cash and need to grab a decent lunch for 10 bucks or less.
-Cool decor\/theme.

Cons:
- Beds are sub-par. Not to say I couldn't get a good nights sleep, but that was more due to fatigue then the comfort of the beds. They're about the quality of a 30 dollar a night motel spring mattress.
- Bella Venezia rooms need to be updated. Furniture was stained and had rips and holes.
- Hotel layout and navigation was initially confusing, and took a long time. This wasn't a huge issue after we learned our way around (took about a day), but it was still an annoyance. However, I understand having big hotel conveniences means, well... being in a big hotel.
- Booked 2 rooms, 2nd room was done 45 minutes AFTER check in (which is 3pm). When we finally got it, it wreaked of smoke (on a non smoking level). This is not a bash against Venetian per se, but it's still worth noting. They did rectify the situation quickly.
- Room fees. At 17 bucks a night per room, and w\/ 2 rooms, my fee came to almost 80 bucks at the end of a 2 night stay. Granted, I needed internet in 1 room, but not the other. It would be nice if this was optional, and I did not receive any newspaper as described. Something to consider if you think you're getting a great deal. After taxes, that room charge adds 20 bucks a night. In vegas, a 20\/ night deviance can really open up your options.

Overall, I would rate this place average. My expectations were somewhat high given the yelp rating and hotels.com rating. I've stayed at 6 hotels now (Bellagio,Venetian, Mirage, Caesars, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay).. and I'm not entirely sure that I would stay at Venetian again, but if I did, it would NOT be at the Bella in Venezia. Would rather pay the extra cash for an updated room. Not that it was terrible, but it wasn't up to expectations. If I want average, i could have had it for 50 bucks less a night at Mirage or TI. Unless the rate is highly discounted (normally Venetian goes for 250 \/ night), I don't think it's worth the extra cash.",0,0,0

The rooms, as everyone has mentioned, are huge and perfect for big groups. The lobby is gorgeous. 

The restaurants are great, either for lunch or a late-night snack (I think there is one place in the hotel that is open all night). 

The casino is like a maze, which is smart on their part--if I can't find my way out, I might as well gamble more! 

The canals and gondolas are amazing...just like Venice but without the smell. 

I loved the pools too, especially the smaller one that has a more Italian look to it. It also has the largest hot tub I have ever seen in my life.

The staff is very helpful and brought us everything we needed (I forgot my toothbrush--oops), plus carried our luggage (girls pack way too much for Vegas). I guess that's pretty standard hotel service, but it added to the great experience for sure.

It's a very classy place, but not so classy that you feel bad getting drunk and stumbling around. 

It's a bit expensive, but we found a good deal online, so keep your eyes peeled for those.

It appeared that they only had one small van\/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in\/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank\/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos\/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b\/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble\/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.",1,1,0

To start with, the bed, although it had the greatest comforter, had ripped sheets on it. Housekeeping changed them, still ripped, just in a different place. Every time housekeeping was in the room they left something. A rag one day, a bottle of cleaning solution another one. They didn't clean the bathroom very well either. My hair goes everywhere when I dry it and by the fifth day when we left, there was a lovely collection all over the bathroom. 
The place seems to operate on an ignore guests policy. The casino wait staff are rude and to be honest, this was the worst experience I've ever had in a hotel. There's not enough space here to list every reason. I swear thought, I'm not the complaining type, and I didn't here. I just let it suck and counted the days until I could leave this hotel.

I visit Vegas 5-6 times per year and I have stayed at most properties on the strip and the service at the Venetian may be the worst I have ever experienced. First, I was unable to add my gf's name to the reservation because I booked through a 3rd party.  They gave some bullshit excuse about billing that 3rd party but it's pretty ridiculous not being able simply to add a name to the reservation. Secondly, I called the front desk to have some Tylenol or aspirin delivered to the room and was told it would be a $20 delivery charge on top of the cost of the products. Even a low budget hotel like a holiday inn or courtyard will gladly deliver if not give you free Tylenol or aspirin. Thirdly, I called several onsite restaurants to have food brought to the room.  After upwards of a 5 min hold at each restaurant, I was told that my name ""wasn't in the system"" and they could not deliver to the room. Wtf?!? And this is all in the first day, I can't wait to see how they will mishandle the rest of my stay. This is supposed to be an upscale hotel, get your shit together.",0,0,0

It has everything you need, huge and luxury with many swimming pools & restaurants. I love having dinner facing swimming pool at Bouchon and having brunch at Grand Lux Cafe. I usually play slot machine and my partner is the one who really do gambling. 
The last time we stayed here, Valet was pretty fast but we had to wait more than two hours for our luggages to arrive at our room. We tried to call frontdesk from our room but busy all the time and my partner called from cellphone..finally spoke to someone and we found out the person who checked us in forgot to assign our luggages to be delivered.
We were also really disappointed with the hotel rules. We never used the pool before everytime we stayed here but on Memorial weekend we decided to go swimming since it was hot and perfect weather to dip in the pool but we're shocked when we were told there was a $250 fee for using one daybed (freaking $500 for both of us). It costs almost as much as we paid for staying two nights at this hotel. I totally understand if there was special event at the pool area but that day there was not. Thank God our friends stayed at Paris Las Vegas and they let us use the pool (what a shame for me and my partner cos our friends laughed at us). There was resort fee $39+tax\/night for amenities which we never use. There's no coffee maker or fridge to use in the room either.

Here's my review in list format of the positives and negatives of The Venetian.

PROPERTY
+ The interior is gorgeous, especially the ""Sistine Chapel"" replica. 
+ Very clean and well-maintained.
- The parking garage is one of the worst in town, and it becomes narrower with each floor. Do yourself a favor and valet; there's one located inside the garage.

CASINO
+ I hardly gamble, but this has to be one of the safest places to do that. Security is everywhere, and the entire casino floor is brightly lit.
+ It doesn't smell smoky.
- This place does see its fair share of hookers, and they can blend in with some of the club-going patrons. You'll know one when you overhear a ""business proposition"" while playing slots, or if you're approached by a ""lady of the night.""

LUXURY SUITES
+ All rooms are suites!
+ Bella Suites are spacious rooms with two sinks, luxurious bath and shower, comfy beds, and three television sets.
+ Blackout curtains allow you to sleep until noon without any sunlight peeking in.
- If possible, make a request for a room that's above the 12th floor. You might get an unsightly view of the parking garage.

RESTAURANTS & EATERIES
+ Grand Lux is open 24\/7. They have an awesome breakfast buffet, but the food overall is good and one of the more affordable dining options in the area.
+ The gelato counter in ""St Mark's Square"" has many tasty flavor selections. 
+ Bouchon Bakery has some good coffee, but their macarons are OK for being almost $4.00 each.
- The candied apples on display at some of the snack counters only look good. 
- TAO Asian Bistro is overrated. Chinatown is up the road if you want Asian cuisine. For fusion, I'd walk over to Sushi Samba in The Palazzo. 

CLUBS & BARS
+ The Bourbon bar plays MUSIC VIDEOS from the 80's. Fun place to chill and get your dance on without having to go to a club. 
- Tao is fine for first time clubbers, but I wouldn't say it's *the* nightclub to go to.....that was 10 or so years ago.

SHOPS
+ You won't find Gucci or Louis Vuitton here, but the canal shops offer a unique shopping experience with its faux outdoor scenery and the gondolas. 
+ Sephora!

SHOWS & SIGHTS
+ Blue Man Group is one big fun rave party!
+ Human Nature now has a resident show here. I highly recommend watching this show!

EVENTS
+ Accommodating convention halls.
-  I wouldn't suggest holding a wedding reception here. To keep it short, the wedding staff wasn't accommodating to the needs of the wedding party, which surprised me considering how The Venetian prides itself in being a five-diamond resort. 

The Venetian is one of the hotels in Vegas that I'd recommend to my friend's and family. It isn't too far from some of the main attractions on The Strip. Being a luxury hotel, the room prices can be affordable than other luxury hotels in the area (signing up for their e-mails helps, as well as their Grazie card!).",11,4,6

Yes, 5 days and we explored most of the shop, gondola rides, casino, poker room, and swimming pools.  It's great that it is connected to Palazzo, the shops and the pool, it gives you more option on shopping, dining and swimming.

The room had a view of the strip, with a little help from Andrew Jackson!  The price was great, again you have to do your own homework of finding the best rate.  The service was great too!

Again, I would recommend it to everyone, except for families with toddlers.  The snacks and drinks has a sensor that when you lift the food and drink, it will automatically charge your room!  Yes, they've found other ways to take your money with this sensor installed under each drink and snack and you can not move it!

i've stayed at hotels where they clean top to bottom each day. venetian is not one of them. we left a few bucks for the housekeeper each day and she would do the bare minimum. tuck our bedsheets\/give us new towels, throw out the garbage, and refill the toiletries. however, she failed to mop\/wipe\/dust\/sweep. i noticed my hair on the floor still there and wet stains that dried up along with crumbs. i know this is my own mess but given that this is a 5 star resort i expect more. we stayed in two king bed luxury suites and we checked in at 12AM and they only had 1 room ready. they told us to come back for the other room in about half hr. wth???

in addition, they were doing construction near the parking lot garages so it felt a little funky walking through all the mess as a guest at a 5 star hotel. also when you first check in you have to walk through SO much (the garage leads to the shops which then leads through an area in front of the TAO lounge, and then through the casino and into the lobby) unless you took a cab and came through the front. that was a pretty big hassle because we had to walk through loads of people starting their night around midnight waiting for TAO to open! and there wer alraedy a bunch of drunkards waiting to party. 

our room was so large that we never even really stepped foot into the living room area. if you had a queen luxury suite you can probably sleep 6-8 people comfortably. i am not even lying. the rooms are definiltey dark and lack lamps or light swtiches! but the bathroom is gorgeous and although i would never touch a bathtub in public places it looked super comfy! haha. i'm a standup shower type of person! loved the rooms at the venetian although my bed was a tad mushy for my liking.

i also loved the elevators but the bellagio does it better. the location is more toward the end of the strip toward freemont st. so its not exactly in the middle of all the action. i bought my whole vegas trip with RT flight package from expedia so my cost for the luxury king room came out to less than $100 a night !! i just wished my $20 sandwich worked (see note below)! owell theres always next time! 

i heard about the famous $20 sandwich so of course i had to try it. rumor has it that you slip a folded 20 dollar bill and slide it in between your credit card and id card at check in and ask them: can you please check for complimentary upgrades? the front desk agents will glady sweep that out of your hand. ours tried hard to look for us but it could have been the fact that we had two rooms that we wanted to keep together or the fact that we only gave $20 for 2 rooms which should have been $40 for two rooms OR even the fact that it was really busy because he apologized after pounding ferociously on the keyboard and said they have no upgrades available. he pushed the $20 and my ID card back toward me and said he can do this for me instead: waive the resort fee of $17 a day and provide us with free breakfast vouchers at the grand lux cafe each morning for the duration of our stay. 

well lets do some quick math: $17 x 6 days x 2 rooms is 204 dollars that he is essentially saving me! so of course i said SURE so he took the money back from the counter as swiftly as he could. and provided each of us (4 of us in total) with a breakfast voucher. SWEET. $20 cash well spent! the $17 resort fee includes internet so be sure to take advantage of that.. dont worry if the charges show up on your room charge (check the TV screen). just call front desk the night before you leave and tell them your resort fees were waived but you still see charges and they will remove it instantly. dont forget to call front desk and ask housekeeping to bring you a pair of men's and women's complimentary slippers!

casino:
i won a decent amount on slots, and playing blackjack switch. a few of the dealers are so nice and help you out with blackjack tips\/laugh along. although i stayed at the venetian i didnt gamble here as much as i should have. their casino is definitely not simple with decor. the carpet\/lights\/decor makes me blind and hurts my eye when i see this. i like the bellagio because it's easy on the eyes. since i won money i will probably be back sooner than later. the drink service was quick. the only thing is there always seemed to be drunkies lurking around at the venetian. either at the table games or the slots or even walking through the hotel\/casino.",3,0,0

I do adore you!

The first time I visited you, I was with a  bunch of girlfriends.  

The suite was grand, and we all had a fabulous time!

I played big and I lost big.

Soooooo, you sent me a bunch of comps.

I decided to take you up on your offers.

I will see you again,  very soon!",0,1,0

The Venetian did it right. It's one of the few luxurious places on the Strip that is more classy than cheesy. Attention was given to every detail and it shows.

The shops were lovely. It looks like an italian streetscape complete with canals and painted sky. One of the top three malls in Vegas. Mostly very high-end, with a few more reasonably priced places (hooray Ann Taylor!). We went into a little cafe in the middle of the afternoon for some gelato and pastries. A much better choice for ambiance and respite than the new gelato place in the Palazzo.

Be sure to walk around and see the other parts of the complex. The ceilings and floors are amazing.

Husband and I went to the Guggenheim Hermatige here, but were disappointed with the $15 entry fee when we realized it was only one room\/gallery. So skip it.

Overall a great place to spend an afternoon even if you're not gambling.",3,0,1

1.  It has its own convention center, which happened to be where my convention was.  Thus you never actually have to leave your hotel to get over to the convention hall.  Not like I really WENT to the convention...it was just an excuse to get to go to Vegas for free.  But if you DID wanna go, you can without leaving the comfort of your hotel.

2. The rooms are phenomenal.  They are suites...so the bed (or beds) is\/are right by the bathroom when you walk in...then you go down some stairs and you have your living area.  Each section has a flat screen TV and the living area has a pull out sleeper couch for any randoms you might let sleep over.  Bathroom has a standup shower and also a whirpool bathtub.  And the beds...I slept in them until 2 or 3pm every day...they are comfy!  Bonus points for the curtains that make your room completely blacked out even when it is sunny outside.

3.  Like all hotels, they have gambling and also restaurants and bars in the hotel (AquaKnox, David Burke, Tao, Grand Lux Cafe, Bouchon, V Bar) which is obviously a plus.  They also have the Grand Canal Shops where I proceeded to spend a lot of money on Christmas presents...for myself.

4.  They have the Canyon Ranch SpaClub for their gym\/spa services.  This includes a cafe with healthy food selections as well.  I actually bought a 5 day pass last time I went so that I could try and not undo all the work I had been doing at the gym in one week in Vegas.  5 days now is $150 which is about the same as I pay for a trainer per week.  At least I had the freedom to go work off all those dinners and drinks, even if it did cost.  It would be nice if they had hourly passes.

5.  The Venetian has a good location on the strip near other casinos, so it is convenient to get to other locations that you want.

The main problem I have ever had at the Venetian is that it is freakin ENORMOUS inside.  You have to memorize how you get to your room or you WILL get lost when you get back blasted from a night out clubbin'.  Then you will have to ask a staff member how to get to your room but are too blasted to tell them which side of the hotel you are on, your room number, or even your name.  So you will wander around in circles forever until you finally find your room and crash in the comfy beds.  At least, that's what I've HEARD happens.  hehe",4,3,4

All the rooms are spacious and clean.  I love how they're all suites and you can have a mini party inside.  Two huge queen beds and a couch?!  Woahhh...I feel like a baller when I come and stay.  The bathroom is fancy and I just love taking a bubble bath.  Their amenities aren't that all super great but for the price and location on the strip I think it's a wonderful place! 

Looooveee their little shopping area. The place makes me feel as though I've been transported to Venice, Italy... well not really but a smaller and cleaner version of it.  I do recommend walking around the casino and window shopping.  Protip: If you ever want an upgrade on a slow day in Venetian, slip a $20 between your driver's license and credit card as you're paying and ask if they have any upgrades available.  Most likely you'll get an upgrade on a higher floor or nicer room.  I tried it and it worked ;D.  If they're busy and can't upgrade you, they will give you back your $20.",14,2,3

When the family stayed here in the Summer of 2005, there was a $100 a night special because of the Las Vegas 100th year anniversary. The room itself was big, comfortable bed and nice robes in the closet. We got a view of the Strip, so that made the experience even more better. We ate at the Pinot Brasserie and I recall getting chicken and that was some pretty good chicken. Get the garlic french fries there! So good. The fries themselves taste exactly like McDonald's fries and the garlic gives it an extra kick. So good. With this great hotel, I would come here again and recommend to my friends.",2,0,0

My favorite is the bathroom-the vanity, the shower, and the bath tub..it's realllly niceee having a place to do my makeup and get all glammed up for a night on the town and than coming back after the club and just soaking it up in the tub. :) 

I love the whole canopy bed and the separate living room area.  The staff is super nice and I have never had a problem.  When I call for housekeeping for example-towels, toothbrush\/toothpaste they are right on it..they have greattt amenities too...

Our stay at the Venetian was five stars across the board from the moment we stepped out of our Uber, to the check in, casino, restaurants, food court and the pool. 

The lobby of the Venetian is beautifully decorated and transports you to a different country the moment you pull up. The line to check in was about a 20 minute wait. Our front desk attendant was extremely nice and offered us a higher floor at no additional cost. Our room was ready around noon and we were able to go right up the elevators to our room.

Our standard king suite made us feel like we were staying in the presidential suite! There were three separate ""rooms"" to our suite: the sleeping room, the living room and the bathroom. Our bed was luxurious and felt like we were sleeping on the clouds, the living room space had a comfy pull out sofa, two sitting chairs and a table with three chairs. There was a tv in both the living room and in front of the bed. The bathroom was luxurious and included a stand alone shower, spacious bathtub, double sinks, a T.V. and the toilet was in it's own room.

Our group of friends was spread out at all the different resorts in Vegas so we got to see the best of the best and the Venetian definitely won. 

Aside from the awesome room, the restaurants inside of the Venetian were awesome! We ate at Yardbird (best meal in Vegas), got giant margaritas from Tacos and Ritas (with a groupon), & also got Boba in the foodcourt.

This was the BEST hotel experience I have ever had and I look forward to coming back to Las Vegas, NV just to stay at the Venetian again!",2,0,1

Initially this was going to be a more glamorous trip for us because the Venetian is a little pricier than most but it had beautiful rooms so we were excited.

After our first night in Vegas, we woke up and were getting to go to breakast when we realized that every single one of us that had money in the room, in our wallets or suitcases that didn't travel out of the room with us was GONE. As each of us checked our things we discovered almost $1,000 had been stolen (including the girl who only had a dollar bill in her suitcase) and 2 sets of speaker systems. On top of that this thief decided to open our mini fridge as well and take several drinks that we would later be charged for. 

Immediately proceeding this discovery we contacted the hotels loss prevention center. They came up to our room to take a report from us. Initially they seemed like they were generally concerned and wanted to help us in any way possible, but told us we would not be contacted for 2-3 business days (after we would be leaving Vegas) with the results of our claim.

Upon hearing back from the hotel they told us that indeed our hotel had been entered during a time in the evening when we were gone. So my question to them was, how can you fix this situation? Their answer: we can do anything about it . I realize that there is a safe in the room that you can put your things into, like the hotel suggested, but no one comes to a 5 star hotel, like the Venetian and expects to be burglarized! 

I am so frustrated and let down by the way things were handled by the Venetian. After all of this was said and done and I continued to ask what the Venetian could do to better my loss of $300 worth of property, they continuously shook my calls off, left me hanging and would not help me. 

NEVER stay at this hotel if you bring nice things with you and leave them in the room apparently it is acceptable to be burglarized and have it shrugged off. I am very disappointed in the loss prevention program and safety of the rooms.  The Venetian, from my perspective is at fault for my losses incurred and I expected much better customer satisfaction.",30,7,3

The hotel, accomodations, and gambling were straight up awesome. The room had two beds and the living area two couches. There were three TVs in our room, one in the living area, bed room, and another in the bathroom. The schedule over the three day weekend was going to the pool in the morning, laying out in the sun and drinking followed by gambling afterward and bottle servicing it up at a club afterward. Vegas is just crazy. Its very warm, has good food, drinks, people to gamble with etc. The only downside with this place was the touch sensitive refreshment-bar-tray, that was just retarded. I removed all of the hotel's beverages because I wanted to chill some vodka and chasers and learn that I would be getting charged for all of these even if I didn't drink any of them....but it was taken care of really easily by inventory, my buddy actually drank one of their $8 powerades and said it was good.",0,0,0

Further more having seen how the food is prepared its absolutely awful. They over stock causing food to rot, and they tell the employees to just ""wash"" off the smell for starters, they mix in old with new which makes the product disgusting, and some of the worst pizza they offer for room service, dough comes in frozen, and sauce pre-made canned, absolutely disgusting especially for the price and the place. come on guys you're a hotel mimicking a city in italy ! little caesars taste better. Half of the dessert isnt in house made, and a lot of the food lacks flavor and creativity. seeing everything from the back house its made handled etc. absolutely awful. stay away from the grasshopper shake as all the mint ice cream they have is way past its due date, dont try the pizza its frozen dough for crying out loud dont waste your money on it please, dont order on a busy day as everything stays under a heat lamp for quite some time until the servers finally deliver. you can have much better desserts elsewhere, dont waste your time on the caesar uncreative, dont do the chop salad as boled eggs come in a container from an outside company , not fresh, dont bother with the cupcake trio or benett as they sit in the walk in for days and days often losing its moisture, and definitely do not order the seafood, they wash it to get rid of the smell and on top of that its FROZEN , they freeze it after they cook it and then thaw it completely mad !!",1,1,1

Check in was nice, lots of receptions and mine was very pleasant. All the rooms are suites or mini-suites. Bed was comfy as well as the large L shaped sofa in the living area. All the drapes are remote control so that makes it feel extra ritzy. The mini-bar has weight sensors so do not even touch or pick up an item unless you intend on buying it. Pool is very nice..lots of singles and groups of singles. Next to the pools is the Tao Beach which is basically an outdoor, daytime club by the pool with a DJ.

I stayed in the Tower and after coming out of the casino with a few bucks in my pocket after I split it with Uncle Sam I got lost. I was on the right floor just the wrong tower where you can cut through one of the floors and around and around in circles I went. However once you figure out the tower you go from one elevator and walk  what seems to be a half mile to go to another elevator. In other words if you forget something in your room it's easier to go buy it downstairs. 
I give it high rankings because it is very beautiful inside and out with great restaurants and fast food for the run but most importantly I was extremely pleased with all the money I took off their hands and the comps that followed including paying for my stay there and future trips as well.
I recommend the casino, restaurants and beauty but the room and travel to the room were terrible but very clean.",7,1,5

It was much brighter when we stayed at The Palazzo. And, after experiencing an authentic gondola ride in Venice, Italy, what fun is The Venetian gondola ride sans pigeon poop.

Loved Rock of Ages, have seen it multiple times, but will stay elsewhere. Ridiculous experience attempting to check in at same time with a friend who was also staying at hotel. Although I had ID, and had my husband John's passport AND the SAME credit card used to book, Venetian clerk said he could only check in John. I explained that John was driving back to the airport to pick up another guest. The reservation had 2 people on it but the hotel clerk would not budge.The clerk refused as I did not have copy of my booking. It was like a SNL skit.  When I finally found the phone # to Hotels.com, the Hotels.com agent was wonderful, offered to FAX The Venetian another confirmation in my name. Couldn't The Venetian simply send up security if John came to check in and I was not supposed to be in his room? We wasted at least 30 minutes at the Venetian check in counter, if not more time, as my husband was already parked back at the hotel by the time I was finally given our room key. 

My husband and I will stick with Aria, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, MGM , the M Life after Nov 10 experience for a friend. BTW, she did NOT book her Venetian stay through Hotels.com who have gone above and beyond for me after 1 bad experience which wasn't even Hotels.com fault.  As our friend attempted to leave her room at The Venetian to meet us for Rock of Ages on Nov 10, her big toe was cut by a piece of metal sticking out of the side bottom of the heavy door, and it also ripped off her entire toenail! Medics had to be called when she could not stop the bleeding from the puncture. The Venetian sent up maintenance to take pictures and to repair and replace part of the door, but never offered to reimburse her for the room or any expenses, yet she was not able to leave her room due to the injury.",2,0,0

Well, this is going to be one of those reviews and yes this place is that great.

Gorgeous and immaculate hotel located on the strip. The view of the hotel from the street is breathtaking. When you enter you see how amazing and gigantic the place is. The architectual design is fantastic and it fits the Italian theme they're going for.

Service is prompt and engaging. The price can be kinda high but you're paying for quality and this place certainly delivers on that. Getting a package deal or a individual deal on priceline\/hotwire only enhances the value you receive.

I stayed in one of the suites and it was like living a dream. The suite was huge and well appointed with several luxury items ranging from the furniture to the television and toiletries. The view was amazing. The bed was soooooo comfortable; made you want to sleep for days. 

There is also an upscale mall downstairs that also offers a gondola ride complete with a gentleman serenading passengers in Italian!  In other words, if you're with your significant other and looking for something to set the mood:  BINGO!

This hotel is my favorite one of the Vegas group (and overall for that matter) and it's really hard to go wrong with them in my humble yelping opinion",9,6,7

Be aware, there is an additional resort fee that includes the gym, slow internet and the pools that we could not use today because the 4th floor pools are way too small to accommodate the numbers and the 10th floor pool closed for a private function.
As an international speaker on customer service, I would prefer a smaller boutique hotel that has better service and cares about the customer.
In Vegas the hotels are almost at 100% occupancy, so they really don't care much about the service compared to the hotels in Asia & Dubai.

I contacted the Hotel and they informed me that the $250 was an ""upgrade"" fee on top of what we had paid for the original room.  When I explained to the Manager what the person at the front desk had told us, his response was...well that was verbal and it cannot be verified.  They were not willing to reduce the rate to $250.

Except it can be super confusing to figure out exactly where to go to actually get to your room. There are two towers. Apparently one is the new and one is the old.

We were in the old, but was able to check out the new because my parents were assigned there. While the new is brighter, a little more modern and located by the pool, I didn't mind our ""older"" suite.

The Venetian isn't the most expensive on the strip, it's not the cheapest either, so I appreciated the nice rooms. I've stayed at the Aria and Planet Hollywood (and one random awful time share property) this was probably the nicest. 

I loved having the living room set up with a large sectional, I did find a random frito in it, but I digress. It wasn't a dirty room. I loved the bathroom! Super spacious, stand up shower AND jacuzzi, which I thoroughly enjoyed one day. Plus, extra bonus points for the make-up table and mirror. Plus a separate room for the toilet. 

The good thing about staying in the ""older"" tower is you're an elevator ride away from the casino. Can I rate the casino? Eh, I'm not much of a gambler. But I did enjoy the coffee stand right outside the elevators and the gelato stand by the back entrance.

I experienced the pool only for an hour one day because we were here in November and I thought it was just too chilly to take a dip. But, the good thing is it's a heated pool! Tons of seating and room in the pool. Plus a large bar outside.

The one negative is that I found it to be on the farther end of the Strip. While I thought it was a nice place, I probably wouldn't stay here again because of that. I like to be in the middle of everything. But it wasn't as far as say, the Wynn. Which is WAY too far for me.",6,1,2

first time i stayed here, i booked the bella suite in the venetian tower...i looked up the rates a few days later and realized the rates had gone down, so i called them and asked them if they could adjust my rates for me, and they did it no problem --- they even offered to put me in a room with a view of the strip or pool (my choice), free of charge!! 

the actual suites are gorgeous and spacious. the bathroom has a tub ANd a shower...and even a lcd tv so you can watch while showering or brushing your teeth lol. my suite had 2 queen beds as well as a huge, comfy pull out couch thing. when my friend and i came back to the hotel and my friend was PISS DRUNK, an attendant brought a wheelchair out for us to make wheeling him to the suite easier lol. 

the second time i stayed here (this past labor day weekend), i stayed in the venezia tower. it's just as gorgeous and spacious as the venetian tower. i'm not sure what the difference is, though our suite did come with admittance to open bar every day from 5-8 as well as complimentary admission to tao for us and our guests. guys in for FREE on a saturday night at tao..it was amazing. and to top that, we didn't even have to wait in the looooong line. i think all venetian guests get priority though.  the housekeeping gave us boxes of free chocolates so that made me happy too. 

when i was sitting at the slots machine in the casino DRUNK out of my mind, a security approached me and asked if i knew who the boy with me was...and i don't remember telling him it was my boyfriend, but my boyfriend said i did. and he asked me what my bf's name was...and after i answered, he told my bf he was just checking to make sure because a lot of creepers prey on drunk girls. i was glad to know that security here were so attentive and look out for their guests like that. 

the venetian is breathtaking, has a lot of shops, and there's even more shops at its sister hotel, palazzo, which is connected. the tables are not ridiculously highroller status with some that are $15 minimum, the pools are a bit smaller than others, but still nice and it is the home of the club tao, which is pretty fun too....the suites are AWESOME and on top of that, the staff there really know how to treat and take care of their guests. i definitely recommend this place for your vegas trip.",2,0,0

The beds were comfy,although it had a comforter on it, that I'm sure isn't washed after every guest, (I have comforter issues). Sheets were soft, pillows were fluffy,and it was the perfect bed to pass out in at 8am when we finally got to sleep.
Service was amazing! Normally I plan way in advance for dinner reservations and such, but for once I didn't. I called the concierge, NYE and she was able to get us reservations at 8pm at Postrio, ( talking about service...wow!). I also have to give them bonus points for my 4am drunken rambling, when I decided to extend my stay. The next morning (ok afternoon) I went downstairs I extend my stay, and they kindly informed me I had already done that the night before...uhhh....(wow, go me and the blacked out reservation skills). Huge points for them for even dealing with me.
Overall, the hotel is gorgeous, the service is impeccable, and while the price is on the higher end, it is well worth it. Next time I stay here I'd probably come with a group of like 5 girls, making it way cheap.",0,1,0

You can either take the elevator or the escalator located behind the food court near the little bakery. My husband and I ate at almost every restaurant on the second floor and thats the beauty of vegas that you eat out every meal & don't need to cook meals. Plus im lazy when im on vacation. I love eating at new places. 

The second you walk in you see the decor of this hotel and it is absolutely stunning, The water fountain, the ceiling and even the hall which leads to your rooms and the casino etc. It is a beautiful spot to take pictures. 

Our room was very beautiful. The view was nice, the bed was pretty comfy I love how they give you a lot of pillows when you sleep It is almost like sleeping on a cloud. I really love how they also give you two tvs Our bedroom had a tv our bathroom had a tv our living sitting area had a tv. our bathroom had a nice glass shower and next to it had a bath tub Very fancy. we had a beautiful closet a nice dresser to put our clothes in a coffee maker. which i never use but like having the option to. The one and ONLY complaint I have of these rooms is the bathroom, Lets be real we are on vacation which means we are staying in this room for 4\/5 days? at least one of those days (realistically speaking all of those days) one of us is going to take a crap. Right? the ventilation is not the best. There is a small vent but I could not, for the life of me find the switch? So I used perfume and left it there because my man and i dont want to ruin a good vacation smelling each others waste.

the venezia tower definitely seems older and i will prefer the venetian tower over the venezia anytime.  the venezia does seem classier and quieter, perfect for the middle aged couples retreat.  the venetian is just more lively being closer to the casino floor with 3 separate towers. 
 
our room had dual sinks with a large shower and bath.  separate toilet room with a vanity mirror.  the only thing i can complain about the room is the bed and the dim lighting.  the bed for the venezia bella was a disappointment because it was nothing like the venetian bella i had last time.  after a long night of hardcore substance abuse and partying the first thing you'd want to come back to the hotel to is a nice comfy bed. 
 
venetian tip of the day:  definitely take advantage of the free slot credit that comes with the room.  we had 50 dollars worth of credits and we redeeemed it via club grazie and i got back 60 dollars!  pretty much converted the slot credits back to cash :)  BINGO!

But somehow it is so well kept that it could pass for a couple years old. 

The rooms are really big. Sunken living rooms everything tastefully done. There are so many chairs in the standard rooms you could seat a whole basket ball team.

Casino is a standard kinda strip casino. Nothing unexpected here. Hungry machines and high table limits.

The location of this place is what I personally never liked. I suppose that is because I'm not into fashion and clothing and don't care to be across the street from the Fashion Mall. If you are into shopping you might really love this place. How convenient to go across the street if the casino is  treating you poorly and shop a bit. It actually could be a way to save a few bucks... if the casinos are bad there is nothing worse than gambling.

If you have a car or don't mind taking a taxi or walking to center strip where likely you want to hang out don't hesitate coming here. The highlight is really a good value on a nice room. At Bellagio the equivalent room with all that square footage would cost double.",0,0,0

- easy access to strip, palazzo, grand canal shoppes
- obviously the entire venetian feel
- decently priced rooms - but not all have good views

Cons
- Tao is okish - compared to other clubs in towns - so if you are looking for easy entry into other clubs , don't stay here

The Venetian is still my favorite Vegas hotel. It's like having accommodations in a Doge's palace. The suite was beautifully updated,with gorgeous fabrics...truly lovely. We stayed in a Bella Suite with a paid-for view of the ""volcano"" at Mirage.

Let's check this year's scoreboard, shall we?

NoNoNo:
*We booked with the daily breakfast promotion....we only received one breakfast, because the second day, the delivery was attempted almost TWO HOURS after the request. Follow-up calls during the wait were met with an obviously fake ""Sorry, 15 more minutes."" Management adjusted our bill, but this wasn't good at all.
*Staffing issues: the staff members were very pleasant, but where were the rest of them? Everything was a quote of 15-20 min wait (bellman, etc.) 
*Let's start with more towels in the room, please. I use one towel at home; this is not my home.
*Please, donate all the pool towels for recycled fiber. Get new pool towels.

YesYesYes:
*Beyond gorgeous suite\/bathroom.
*Bed from heaven.
*Best variety of pools on one property.

The Casino itself is decked out like most other high-end casinos so you can only out-lavish one another so much before everything looks the same.

First, the hotel complex is HUGE and there are actually three separate properties: The Venetian, Venezia Towers and the Palazzo.  We stayed in a Bella View Suite in the Venezia.  The Venezia has a smaller, less busy check-in counter that is not clearly pointed out.  You can check in for either hotel at either check in.  Upon check in at the Venezia they offer an upgrade the the Venetian (rooms more recently modeled, wireless net) for $20 or the Palazzo for $40.  We chose to stick with the Venezia since none of the properties are very old and the room had ethernet internet.  There is a $17\/day mandatory fee regardless of where you stay.  

The suite was very nice and came with either one King sized bed or two Queen sized beds.  There are three flat screen TVs (bed, lounge, bathroom).  We were missing one remote and the bathroom remote was out of batteries.  Otherwise the room was in good condition at check-in.   There were also extra pillows and iron\/iron board in the closet.  The bathroom was truly spectacular, lots of towels, one terry robe, and some q-tips, cotton balls etc.  The shampoo, conditioner, and soap was deliciously scented.  

I noticed the furniture was a little worn looking, especially the couches.  Also the TP holder in the commode kept falling out and clanging on the marble floor.  I imagine that Vegas hotel rooms have a lot more activity\/use so things wear out faster.  In addition they don't include a kettle or coffeepot in the room.  Room service can send you a kettle.  Be aware that there is a $4.95 delivery charge for room service and it takes about 20 minutes for them to come, not including time taken to make the food.  The rooms have a free safe which we used and were satisfied with.

Other ammenties in the hotel are the Spa + pool, LOTS of restaurants, a casino (and the Palazzo casino is a short walk away) and LOTS AND LOTS of shopping.  The Venetian is one of the more family friendly hotels and entertainment is not so focused on just gambling.  Hence the numerous shops, restaurants, nightclubs, etc.  The indoor canal, walkways and center square are really cool - it's feels like midday no matter what time!  I also appreciated seeing security around and after a certain point they start asking to see room keys to walk through the ""residential"" parts of the hotel - no drunken randoms roaming the halls.  

Note: a lot of reviews pointed out the strong rose scent.  It is strong the first time you enter the building, but not present in the guest rooms.  I don't mind the smell and didn't notice it after the first day.  Treasure Island also does the same thing.",1,0,0

3) I left the PRIVACY PLEASE on the door only to find the staff trying to enter.
4) When I was out people entered the room with the Privacy Please on the door.  (I know because the lights were on.)
5) Outlets didn't work, had to reset the breaker.

The rooms are a plus here. Every room is a suite, which includes at least a sunken living room, a marble top bar, and a jacuzzi tub with separate shower.

Earlier trips, I had numerous problems with the cleanliness with the rooms but they have been all fixed quickly but that's why it gets only four stars.

There are other recent reviews stating that the rooms are outdated but I strongly disagree. Our room was huge, modern yet sophisticated, and so clean. The bathroom was my favorite, with double doors, a gorgeous makeup parlor, and separate tub for two.

It's a beautiful hotel and the rooms are gorgeous. I am required to be in Vegas for work twice a year and sometimes three times a year. I moved over to the Wynn hotel about 6 years ago. I decided to give the Venetian my business once again and booked my room two months in advance. Unfortunately, my trip was just cancelled and when I called the hotel they advised me that the room was non-refundable. This had been booked through Hotels.com. The interesting thing is Hotels.com said they would be happy to refund the full two day payment only if the hotel would let me cancel it. They did not. The hotel wouldn't even refund one night of the two night reservation.

With that kind of customer service and that black and white non-refundable attitude, I will NEVER stay at that hotel again. I have also advised my company and we will now stay put at the Wynn moving forward. 

I have traveled for many many years and have never experienced such a poor, strict, no nonsense attitude from a hotel. What ever happened to the bend over backwards, customer is important, attitude? Again, were talking two months out from the reservation.

This hotel is HUGE and draws conventions after conventions to the hotel.  So be prepared!

The rooms are all suites which is nice if you want additional space since you have a living room.  Two TV's as well.  Twice the space of regular hotels on the strip and usually twice and much. 

As for the bathrooms, am not really into green marble bathroom counters and gold fixtures.  I felt like Versace goes to Vegas.  A bit overdone in my opinion.

The mall is really nice, but all the stores are super pricey, ie: Jimmy Choo.  Need I say more?  If you see the Gondola, do not waste your money on this.  It travels only in the inside of the mall for 1\/8 mile.  It does not go outside.

TIP: This is a good hotel to stay in if you need to conduct business or plan to bring your laptop.  Each room has it's own printer and fax that you can connect to.  Great if you need to catch a flight on Southwest and want to check in early to secure an A boarding pass.",2,0,0

The customer service is really the problem here. This place is obviously just too massive for anyone to really give a damn. We had to call downstairs for extra sheets for the sofa, and had to call back twice because it took close to 2 hours. We called to get a fridge (they charge) and that took hours, too.

Worst of all, like SO MANY reviewers on her, my friend accidentally left her $400 Stuart Weitzman boots in the room...gone, gone, gone. (She had even left a huge tip for the cleaning crew, so oh well.) Based on the other reviews here, I seriously doubt they even HAVE a lost and found. The number of reviews where valuables are **actively stolen while people are simply out of the room**, however, is a huge red flag. I think there is a safe in the closet, but that's hardly comforting.

We were first assigned a room at the Palazzo tower, but asked if we could be in the Venezia tower.  They checked and yes, we could be in our preferred tower.  The Palazzo tower is newer though.

We were assigned suite 27-312 and it was excellent.  We had a partial view of the Mirage Volcano.  There is free wifi in the room.  You need a password from the reception desk.  The room is very comfortable with a king bed, large bathroom (shower and tub), living area (with couches), a desk and table and chairs.  The king bed was very comfortable.  I normally have a hard time sleeping on different beds, but not this one.  I slept great all three nights.  The A\/C was excellent too (a must for Vegas)!

We checked out the pools, Tao Beach, and Azure pool.  The pools are very nice and it's always fricking hot in Vegas in the summer, so you (not me) can get a nice tan laying out.  On the way to the pool, be sure to pick up your pool towels so you can lay them on the lounge chairs.

During our stay, I used the gym (on the 4th floor) once.  It's a very nice gym with everything you need to work out (free weights, cardio, weight machines, etc.).  The staff is there to assist if you have any questions and they have towels you can use.

Bathrooms are nice - separate tub, shower, and private toilet area. Most rooms come with a pretty legit view.

The one downside of the Venetian is that it's not centurally located on the strip, so if you want to go down towards Tropicana and that ish, you've got quite hike ahead of you. It's possible, though. Our group did it in under an hour with bottles of Two Buck Chuck in hand for each of us, so I have full faith in all of you.",6,7,6

Two of my friends are currently breast feeding and needed to pump when we arrived at the hotel after a long drive. Our suite was not ready when we checked in so we politely asked if there was a private room where our two friends could pump. The lady at check-in was so rude and said they could go into the bathroom to do that. My friends were directed to a private bathroom and had to pump in there. There was no chair\/couch in there, so the two options were stand or sit on the toilet. Absolutely appalling. Obviously we were furious with this so we asked to speak with a manager. Ironically, the manager was pregnant, however she didn't seem too empathetic with our situation. She offered us a late check-out for our troubles.

We were served a drink by Nikki at the pool bar, and that was a pretty cold experience.  I definitely got the impression that she was not too happy about making us a drink.  I tried leaving a great tip, but that response to it only made me wish I hadn't.  The other shocker was the cocktail waitress that questioned our room number, and almost acted as though we were trying to scam her.  I guess it was a little surprising, as everyone in my party was a 40+ working professional, and the accusation was directed at my sister in law?

I guess if we hadn't spent time at the pool, I would have probably given The Venetian a hire rating, so take that into consideration.  Aside from the pool, we did LOVE our room, and the view was awesome from the 31st floor.",3,1,1

I had the opportunity to check out their suite BUT not without a room key as there is tightened security and you are not able to get to the elevators without one unless your with someone who owns a room key. I guess this is a good thing, you dont want to WIN BIG then try to go up to your room with someone following you, then robbing you! You also dont want anyone stalking you either! 

The room was marvelous. 2 queen sized beds, a huge comfortable sofa, 2 big LCD tvs, a walk in bathroom with a separate restroom for the toilet. Damn I gave all this up to stay at The Rio because I could not stand rooming with my cousins? At least I get peace and quiet with my own room. 

Have you ever checked out floor 10 at The Venetian? Bouchon is located on the 10th floor at the Venetian! So is the 24 hr front desk for any of your VIP status needs! I swear it looks like a museum with all the art on top of the ceiling and just the way this whole place is structured. Picasso would have been proud. 

The casino was no luck for me as I ended up losing some money, but it was all fun and games. Lots of great restaurants at The Venetian such as Delmonicos Steakhouse, The Grand Lux, the list goes on! You can walk through Restaurant Row and get to The Palazzo if you want to jump casinos.

The main reason was because they offered me a free room because of the Grazie club (Player's Club card).  Even though it would be hard to give a bad review to a place that gives you a free room, that didn't matter.  Even if I paid $300 a night for one of their rooms, it would still be a bargain!

We stayed at the Venezia tower this time around.  The trek to our room was fairly long, but I didn't mind (I even had to take 2 elevators).  As I mentioned in my original review, all the rooms are ""suites.""  Aside from the beds, they have a sunken living room with more than enough space to move around.  In addition to the computer\/work table, they have an additional table there if you want to eat dinner in the room.  The computer table has a ""hidden"" outlet that with one press of a button, will reveal different power plugs.  

As for entertainment, there are 2 TV in the room, in the bedroom and living room (none in the bathroom this time).  The TVs are the perfect size for this room, however, the only thing they didn't have are easily-accessible ports for USB and HDMI.  In this day-and-age of Amazon Firesticks, Google Chromecast, or even just hooking up a hard drive full of movies, that would be perfect!

The room was immaculately clean and offered great amenities.  The bathroom was spotless and I do like the fact that it had a bathtub and shower.  Also, the shower had multiple nozzles, so you could pick what kind of stream you wanted to wash away the guilt of losing all your money!  :)

Note:  The secret $20 handshake will work here (or Palazzo), but to various results.  I've given $20 before and have gotten a 2-room suite over-looking the strip.  I've also tried to give $50, but just got a room facing the strip.  Just make sure you have the skill of hiding that bill in between the credit card and driver's license.

Trying its hardest to be a microcosm of Venice, The Venetian does do a few things well: Beautiful marble flooring, canals with singing gondoliers atop sleek black gondolas, and grand murals on the ceiling reminiscent of the ones you'd see on churches around the Piazza San Marco.   

Now, to get into a bit more detail: The Venetian has suites, not rooms. They are as spacious as a one room apartment and immaculate. Each suite has its own marble flooring, sunken living area, and large bathroom with double sinks. Furthermore, if you're lucky, it'll also has a wonderful view of the strip and the nearby mountains.  What I liked most was the hotel can also pull double duty as a superb place for shopping (Right, Ladies?). With its plethora of stores, restaurants, relaxing gondola rides located in and around their grand canal, I found it traumatizingly hard to leave at the end of my stay.  

Furthermore, the Hotel staff was fantastic - very accommodating to all our needs. Even though general housekeeping is not quite up to the level of 5 star hotels, if you request it of them, they will get the job done. Security is great as well. Also loved that they are located within walking distance of all the attractions the Strip has to offer.

We had some friends also stay at the Venetian, but they were in the Venezia tower.  It was extremely confusing to get to their room.  They got several sets of elevators, the signs were somewhat useless.

The valet parking, for hotel guests only, is located on the second floor of the garage; again, very confusing driving route.  The main valet parking is only reserved for hotel registration.  

The next day, when we returned to our room for a short break at 4:30PM, the entire hallways were lined up with laundry bags full of linens.  The door leads to the service elevators is always open!  Very unpleasant sight!

The amenities are also sold in the Apothecary shop in the Canal Shoppes. $20 for a full size bar. 

Room service was great - white table cloth and all set up on the table. Watch out for the in-room snacks and drinks as they are all sitting on sensors which get set off if you even more an item. So no taking out the beverages to use the re fridge for personal use. 

Three separate pool areas. The Venetian pool on floor 10 has a main pool and two hot tubs. Quieter, more older people and families. On the 4th floor is Tao pool and Tao beach. Younger, beautiful crowd, very loud DJ, dancing, large area.

Now that my complaint bitch fest is taken care of, The Venitian is a beautiful hotel, with beautiful and quite comfy and large standard rooms, and includes an opulent bathroom area complete with large tub and separate shower, double sinks and granite and marble with nice sconce lighting.  King size feather type bed with step down living area, plenty of televisions and all carpet, flooring, wallpaper, paint, etc., appeared to be in very good shape.

I did make use of many services, valet, bellman, room service dining in, etc.  I found all staff to be friendly and polite and far more welcoming than many other hotels on the strip.

I loved the shoppes at the Grand Canal, shopped and spent money, ate and snacked at some of your establishments and spent (lost) more money in your casino.  Tables at the Venetian are pricey and the minimum definitely goes up on Saturday nights.  If you can find a cocktail waitress who is ""servicing"" the slots areas (good luck with that), you will get a pretty decent and strong drink.  

I will say that the in-room dining service was a surprise.  A good one!  Heck, a great one!  It was far above what I expected.

Eggs cooked to order perfectly, a full ham steak, fat and juicy sausages, breakfast potatoes, broiled baby tomato with bread crumbs and cheese, thick fresh toast with soft butter, 2 different high-end preserves, freshly squeezed oj and terrific coffee, with a thermal carafe for refilling.

I would definitely stay at The Venetian again, but if I found a better offer from one of the other top hotels, I might not.  You almost had me 100% ""all in"" Venetian!",38,32,34

I stayed in the Venezia Tower for four nights 8\/5-8\/9. The hotel is beautiful inside. The room was a nice size and the bed was just ok, it was firm for me. The ease of access to the room was not easy and if you have been drinking it's that much more difficult. During my stay a fire alarm was set off at the crack of dawn. Nothing was done to acknowledge the inconvenience. Talked with a couple of other guest and they thought a comped buffet should have been given out. Hell, I would have taken n apology. Mentioned it to the front desk got nothing (blank stare). During my stay I was fortunate to win so I'm not bitter about that just bitter about the level of customer service. 

Also should have a fridge with more space. Asked to have it emptied it was going to cost me 200$ WTF. How about charge a decent price for the things you put in there and I won't have to get my own. (it's me being cheap but that's why I got money) I'd rather gamble then spend 6 dollars for a bag of ... 

The resort fee that is charged is the most ridiculous thing I have seen any Vegas hotel charge. Hotel should just put that in the rate. 209 rate is 266 with tax, hotel not that appealing at that rate.     

I would like to mention housekeeping I talked to was awesome.",4,0,0

When we first entered the room, I was impressed by the size of the suite. However, once I stepped into the living room, I noticed that the carpet was dirty and the room was messy, with little bits of trash and a bottle cap on the floor. A bit disappointed with the cleanliness of the room, I decided to unpack. To my shock and disgust, I found DIRTY laundry and UNDERWEAR in the drawers. Not mine. Not my boyfriends. Definitely old from the smell of it. 

We were eventually upgraded to a better suite and, after much complaint, given $40 in hotel credit. FYI the walls are very thin in the suites, especially in the bathroom. 

Our third day stay was no better. We order room service in the morning and they came with the wrong order. We called to have them correct it and my bf accidentally hit his head on the table lamp. Dust fell ALL OVER our food. We had to call them to make another plate for us. They took over ONE HOUR and when they finally came, they came with the WRONG order. AGAIN!! We were so fed up we cancelled the order after they took the food back for the THIRD time. The supervisor was VERY unhelpful. We were promised that we would be credited back our money but when our statement came, they charged us for it!!

Overall, not a good experience at the Venetian. Next time, I plan on staying at the Bellagio.",3,4,2

We actually found a pair of women's boots in the closet.  Freaky!

The all-suites at Venetian is great.  Not to mention all of the Chinese channels on TV.  But you can get that at Bellagio and the Wynn now too.

No buffets at the V, but that's nice too.  You don't attract the crowds as much.  The tables also don't attract the younger crowd so if you're into hardcore gambling with less rowdiness, the V is the place for you!",0,0,0

My wife and I were blown away with just how lovely the room was, but after returning from a little gambling I notice a moth in the room.  After killing it and getting over the fact that there's moth in the room to begin with, I went back to watching the game.  Now later on that same evening when we go out for dinner, I cut off the light hoping there wouldn't be any more moths.  When we returned and cut the lights on, once again there were moths in the room, but this time more moths flying in and out of the vents.  Now here I am on my vacation killing myself trying to kill moths' smdh.  Now my wife is trying to call the front desk but no one is picking up the phone.  Now the front desk manager is telling me that all of Las Vegas is infested with moths.  Which I found out not to be true at all smdh But will credit the girl at the registration desk who tried to tell me that even her house has moths.

I stayed here on a Memorial Day weekend and trust me, this place is absolutely  gorgeous!!!!!!!!!! The architecture, the art, the decor, everything! We made reservations off of Orbitz and got a good deal for the Luxury Suite. After checking in we went on our way to our room which was ridiculously nice (check out my photos). Large king size bed, little living room space and large bathroom. I loveddd their bathroom robes and the little cosmetic table and mirror. 

The shoppes are expensive and fun to walk around through. And the pizza place downstairs is a great place to eat in the middle of the night. I also ate at the Grand Lux Cafe, which is a chain off of Cheesecake Factory. I went there for a smoothie once after going to Tao beach which was so refreshing and delicious on that hot weekend. 

Oh yeah Orbitz! Since we got our hotel off of Orbitz, the Venetian gave us this $50 and $25 Club Grazie cards to gamble with. Yay.. free money! I never really gambled before, so I stuck to the slot machines. What's neat is that you get your own Club Grazie card with your name printed on it. Makes you feel VIP like almost. Just stick the card in the slot machines with the Club Grazie club and you're ready to go. I actually won $40 bucks. Okay I know that isn't' a lot, but that was to me since I never gambled before. Plus I gambled with free money! :) YAY! 

Also, I got a chance to go on those gondola rides! :) My first time ever. It's kind of pricey about $20-30 bucks. You can go on the outdoor one or indoor one. I went on the indoor one in a group (which is cheaper). I wanted a man gondolier since I heard some of them singing. (They were really good. BTW, all the gondoliers sing to you on their ride.) And I was kind of upset when I got the girl. But when it came for her time to sing, ""WOWWWWW!"" I felt like I got an opera singer from Italy. She sang beautifully. Very impressive. Oh, before I forget, they also take a picture of you before you ride on the boat. You can have it if you purchase it at the store.

My husband and I were in Vegas for the first time to attend a work party, and we decided to go a day early and treat ourselves to a night at the Venetian and tickets to Phantom. Awesome, but it spoiled us because the next hotel we went to wasn't nearly as lovely. 

What a beautiful room. We got the most inexpensive option, but I was still very impressed. I love the sunken living area, separate from the bedroom area. And oh my goodness, the comfiest bed I have ever slept on. Best sleep ever. 

The bathroom is amazing! As a girl, I can say the vanity table is an awesome addition. It was so nice to sit and put on my makeup. 

So many restaurants, a huge casino, lots of shopping, and several shows at your doorstep (I recommend Phantom).  It truly has it all. 

Taking off one star because:
*Had a problem with the shower - it must have been clogged or something, because I ended up standing in about 3 inches of water, and had to turn it off early in fear it was going to overflow and flood the bathroom
*Even though we asked for a non-smoking room, it still smelled very smoky (I know it's Vegas, but I didn't have this problem at another hotel there)
*Not very sound proof - could hear people walking by in the hall too well 
*Problems with the TV - every time we would get into watching a show, it would cut out and ""weak signal"" would come on the screen. When paying this much for a hotel, I expect the TV to work! 

All in all a great experience. I want to go back now!",2,0,1

Spent a wonderful night at The Venetian this weekend.
As we were checking in, we were offered an upgrade to a Piazza Suit so we took it.... This room was AMAZING!!! It had a beautiful marble foyer with a powder room right by the door. As you stepped further in, there was a wet bar and a full size dinning table! Walking further into the living space was an office and a large living room. The room was very large, with a vanity and walk in closet, and the master bathroom was really big, all marble with a jetted bathtub and separate shower, and a separate water room. Oh yeah! And double sinks!!!!
I honestly didn't want to leave....... So comfortable!!!
We were able to entertain our almost 20 other friends before going out that night. There was space for everyone, it was absolutely perfect.

We did have a bit of an issue with room service, which I thought I'd bring up. The Venetian is so amazing, this issue wouldn't affect the 5 star rating, but any other Hotel that pulled this, wouldn't get so lucky.
We ordered room service once we got back to the room at 2ish am. They told us it wouldn't take no longer than 45 minutes. My boyfriend wakes me up at 4:30 am, on the phone with room service because the food never made it to the room. The worst part out of this whole experience is the worker that we had to interact with. She was rude, had an attitude and had absolutely no idea how to help us, she was not willing to even figure out what happened to our food, or what 50% off 75 dollars is. We ended up without our room service, slept half of the night uncomfortable with the lights on waiting for them, and were absolutely starving which doesn't exactly help the sleeping situation.

The Sprite was bad (basically was water, mistake from the bottler).  This obviously was not the fault of the Venetian, however, I called room service twice to have another bottle brought up (it was the only one in the fridge); no one ever showed.  On the second day of our stay we ordered breakfast in our room.  After an hour, I called and was told the kitchen was backlogged. 20 minutes later, breakfast finally arrived.  

Ok - I understand that Las Vegas is struggling with the economy, however, I would think that a high end property like the Venetian would be going out of their way to please the customers that actually show up. 

In the past 2 years, we traveled to LV 3 times, once at the Mandalay Bay; and once at the Aria.  Cost of these hotels were roughly the same; Mandalay was great, and even the Aria was better (it was having some startup jitters, electric drapes didn't work in the room, etc.) than the Venetian.

We were lucky to be able to get checked in fairly quickly, despite the long line of people. They gave us a suite with a view of the strip and the pool. 

The room we stayed in is by far one of the nicest we've ever stayed in, mainly due to the size\/amenities. People were not kidding on the reviews about the size. I heard they were the biggest on the strip. We were going to be there for a week, so it was SO nice to have space to spread your belongings. Sometimes sharing a bathroom in a hotel is not so fun, but in our room, we had a large vanity area with two sinks, plus a separate vanity area for the ladies for makeup\/etc. with a little stool, makeup mirror, etc. The bathrooms had both a stand up shower and a nice tub. There is a decent sized closet, although I wish they'd had a few more hangers, since I brought enough clothes to stay a month. ;)

FYI: There is a Walgreens in front of the Palazzo where you can stock up on some snacks\/drinks or pick up any toiletries you may have forgotten without breaking the bank. This is handy if you don't feel like going downstairs to buy $15 pretzels or calling room service for a $30 salad. ;)

Pros
-Level of service overall, was very good.
-Awesome suites, really like the layout. Very spacious bathroom, as well.
-Room service food was awesome (order can take awhile, though, so be aware)
-The pool area is really nice, but be prepared to be packed in like sardines.
-Tons of great restaurants to choose from w\/out having to leave hotel.
-All the shopping a girl could ever want (if you have the $$$$). 
-Excellent fitness facilities, good selection of fitness classes.

Cons
-The Venetian is SO BIG, it could be a little overwhelming at first, until you figure it out. I was on  my own a lot and tend to get lost easily, so I had to carry a map with me at all times.
-Phantom of the Opera soundtrack is pumped into elevators. That got old after Day One and I LOVE POTO. ;) Rock of Ages will be there soon, so at least then you'll just get tired of hearing 80's hair bands, instead of opera. 
-The gym fees were initially confusing and a bit misleading. We paid a resort fee of $20 per day which gave us internet access (which worked about 90% of the time) and access to the fitness facilities. I thought this meant that the classes would be included (how it is at other places we've stayed). But that fee does NOT include the classes. The resort fee only allows you into the area with cardio machines\/weights. Each class was $20, which I only learned about after signing up for a 2nd class. I got conflicting reports on various sites and in asking staff about this. The spa staff check in seemed a little disorganized, to be honest.
-Be prepared to spend some $$$ on ""the little things"" (ex. $12 for a 0.5oz tube of Neosporin at the Apothecary)
-The pillows kinda sucked. They need to have some firmer options.
-Unless you pick your own spot, the pool attendants are going to pack you in close to others. I was within a few inches of someone else the whole time I laid out, so unless you get lucky and can find an area that isn't crowded, be prepared to get to know your neighbors. I know it's a family friendly resort, but parents aren't always attentive to their kids. The people in charge, didn't really regulate the ""kids must have chaperones at all times"" rule, so I had a couple of little a-holes cannonball me in....the hot tub. ;) There are multiple pools, but only the main one seemed to be open the most. I didn't realize that and when I went into one of the smaller pool areas to lay out\/read one day, I had someone hurry over to tell me I couldn't be there, which seems ridiculous since I had no intention of swimming (It was actually cool the week I was there!).

The next time I visit Vegas, if I am staying more than a weekend, I would definitely stay at The Venetian again. I am curious, however, to see how the the service\/amenities at The Bellagio, Aria, etc. compare.",3,0,1

I've heard that employees have a hard time finding a parking spot as well. There is only one store I like anyway- Dooney & Bourke.

The only reason that I give Venetian 4 stars is because of the price.  Granted the rooms\/suites are really really big, but it's pretty obvious that the hotels in Vegas keep upping their prices to give the impression of being high class.  But this is really a problem with Vegas in general....

Anyways, the rooms are huge.  Big enough to hold pre-parties with room spare.  I've always found the rooms to be really quiet regardless of whether I was staying in the original Venetian tower or the newer Venezia tower.  The only thing that's really bad about the rooms are that the bathroom doors do not have locks on them.  This is really annoying because it's really easy to walk in or be walked in on while you're taking a shower or using the toilet... especially during the aforementioned pre-parties.  Aside from that the rooms are good.  All of the rooms have a fold out sleeper sofa in case a friend can't make it back to their room after the night is done.

The casino is huge and the layout of the canal shoppes is a mess.  It took me 3 stays to finally get a sense of how to get from one side of the hotel to the other.  Then again, I guess keeping you trapped in is actually part of the goal.

I have mixed experiences with housekeeping.  Sometimes they bring things really fast and sometimes it takes forever.  Not a huge deal because I have better things to do in Vegas than wait around in the room, but when you're waiting on towels so you can wash off the funk from last night, waiting half an hour can be annoying.",0,0,0

We didn't really use all of the space but its nice to have if  you need it.  Extremely comfortable beds!!! Super quiet airconditioning that worked great.  Clean and beautiful rooms. Quiet.  

Now the cons:  Lighting lighting lighting!!!!! What the people at this hotel dont get is that women need good lighting to put on their makeup.  The lighting in the bathroom and in the entire suite is horrible!!! It is so dark!!  Neither one of us could tell if our makeup was good because we couldn't see it well enough.  There IS a makeup mirror with a light, but even the light on that is too dim.  Plus you can't take pics in the full length mirror in the hall because the lighting there sucks too.

The front desk demanded an authorization number of the transaction, so I was forced to call the bank to get one (even the bank was puzzled by this). Eventually a manager got involved, apologized, and mentioned that they cleared it all up with the merchant (MasterCard, not even with the bank... even after having me down at the front desk for an hour). Later our friends arrive and are given a room 10 floors below us, and are told that we would be moving down to that floor for the adjoining room (information we were never told). They had arrived shortly after the security deposit fiasco, so we went straight to our room (not knowing about the 10 floor change), only to find our key cards did not work... down to the front desk I go again were I was NOW told about this change... 1hr later we have access to our room again. I call the front desk once again to speak with a manager to clear up the room situation. Due to them ALREADY booking the room next to us, the best they could do was getting our friends 5 rooms down the hall... whatever... we accepted that... despite the fact that this was booked FIVE months in advance for what was supposed to be a fun birthday weekend.

Home to my absolute favorite restaurant in the whole wide world, Delmonico's, the Venetian is a freaking awesome place to stay in Vegas.  The gondola rides through the mall are really cool in a super cheesy way, the shops are really awesome to browse at, the painted sky is beautifully picturesque, and... the rooms are unbelievably huge and posh, especially considering the low price tag.

If I were going on a romantic 1+1 date, I probably would stay somewhere nicer.  But if you want a nice place to stay with a bunch of friends crammed into one room, the Venetian is probably the best you're going to get.  The room can comfortably accommodate about eight people and their luggage, with room left over for all the pre-partying goodies (i.e. giant bottles of Goose, cups, snacks, ice, juice, whatever).  The bathrooms are so huge and the vanities so spacious that all eight girls have maneuvering room for endless costume changes and makeup\/hair touch ups.  Lots of mirrors are ESSENTIAL for girls ready to go out in Vegas, see?  It also helps to have a tv in the restroom, too, so us chicks can enjoy our chick flicks (a la I Am Sam) while applying our clubbing masks.  Yes.  Nice.

I don't know if I like the casino so much (I've never had great luck actually playing at the Venetian), but aside from that, it's a great place to visit, and an even better place to stay.

The only other establishment I unleashed my wrath upon was the Sushi restaurant that somehow put a chewed up piece of gum in my food and then proceeded to blame me for placing it there. So what could have the Venetian done to piss me off? LOSE.OUR.LUGGAGE. Indeed... The venetian lost mine and a friend's luggage. 

It was the summer of 2012 (June 23 to be exact) and a friend and I were attending bachelorete festivities for one night only. We arrived early, changed into bathing suites en route to Tao Beach, entrusted our possessions to the bell and went about our day. Blissful oblivion. At around 2PM we went back for our bags. Still wearing that lovely bathing suit and cover up, and sticky from laying out with tanning lotions and sunblock. But Lo and Behold, our bags are nowhere to be found. I mean NOWHERE. We (including me, manager, and the other victim, fellow yelper Meredith M.) scoured their two luggage areas to make sure it was not missed SEVERAL times. Somehow, my ticket was found in the trash can. No explanation as to why it was there. Fast forward to 7:00PM and still no bags to be found and still wearing my bathing suit. By this time, also, we had missed pretty much all bachelorette activities. After what felt like pulling teeth, we received some cash to buy necessities to get us through the night. So, still wearing our bathing suits, we wen to the mall. In an hour, we had to get EVERYTHING. Even underwear. Bargain shopping in an hour was not easy. And I definitely had to bust out the plastic.

I felt we had to be following people around to find out what was going on. ""We will call you in five minutes"" would turn into never a call back and my friend and I trying to find SOMEONE that will help us.  Though I lost a lot - my favorite shoes, my favorite dress, my make up, jewelry, ETC ETC ETC. The worst part was dealing with their claim resolution department. They also don't answer phone calls or reply to emails.

The room: 

Spacious. We stayed in a suite with a sunken living room. We were only supposed to have 4 occupants, but we squeezed a fifth one on the couch. 

Plenty of mirrors for a group of girls who needed to apply makeup. There was even one of those portable magnifying mirrors. 

The bathroom had a separate door to the toilet, and there were two sinks--allowing multiple people to utilize the bathroom at once. 

The shower and tub were separate. Their water pressures were just right.

We had a wooden vanity and plush stool as well.

The service:

Every time we called housekeeping to request more supplies, they were at our room in under 20 min. Impressive considering how massive the hotel is. 

On the phone, I asked for an extra blanket, she counter-offered with two blankets, a sheet, and a pillow. The woman laughed and said ""I'm gonna give you the world."" So sweet.

The pool:

There is a pool that anyone can go to: the party pool. DONT GO THERE. There are better party pools in Vegas.

We had a private pool for our section of the hotel. It is small and lacks enough chairs for the amount of guests that want to use it. However, it sufficed.

Drinks at the pool were $17 each. We ordered frozen daquiris. BEST DRINK I HAD IN VEGAS.

You can also order food at the pool. This will seem childish...but the chicken strips are delicious. (Especially when you're drunk, and don't want to leave the pool to enter 110° weather). Also, order your fries with truffle oil.

Keep your eyes peeled for the server. She was illusive.

The decor:

When you walk in, look up. Murals cover the ceiling.

Every inch of the Venetian is stylized and chisled to European perfection. 

Picutes are worth a thousand words--refer to them for the full effect. 

The casino:

Every imaginable slot machine and card game. The kiosks to cash out your winnings were hard to find though. 

The margaritas were $10.50. SECOND BEST DRINK I HAD IN VEGAS.",1,0,1

My favorite thing about this hotel is the spa!  I always make it a point to go to every spa at any hotel I stay at and this was hands down one of the top three.  They have everything from classes, to a rock climbing wall, different treatments, etc.  The day pass alone gave you access to a bunch of different saunas, steam rooms, etc.  The only thing is that it is CROWDED.  It was difficult trying to find a place to sit or to even leave your robe.  HOWEVER,  the demographic here is a older so most of the ladies aren't too keen on the clothing optional policy.  This however works in my favor because the other patrons would leave every time a naked group of us would enter. Fine with me, have a nice day in your turtle necks ladies.  

The one major thing that I absolutely hated about staying here though was the walk to the room and how this place is like a maze.

That, coupled with the shopping of the Canal Shoppes, the suites themselves, and the Canyon Ranch Spa, makes the Venetian my go-to for hotels from here on out.

The suites are big, modern and kept immaculately clean. Each of the standard suites has a bathtub and shower in the sprawling bathrooms, and a pair of televisions in the tiered main area. It felt homey, as any place with an excellent bed and nice linens can feel.

While all those big things that I've already mentioned have strongly colored my experience, the smaller things made the Venetian such a gem of a place for me.

I also noticed our room was cleaned at a different time each day so it was hard to know if we would be coming back in the middle of our service whenever we came back to the room.

The casino is nice and huge. The restaurants and shopping options are great. The connection to the Palazzo and Grand Canal Shoppes is extremely convenient. I really liked the location too - I thought The Venetian might be too far at the end of the Strip but it wasn't bad (a quick walk to the Wynn, Fashion Show Mall, & Caesars, a longer walk to Paris, MGM, Aria, and a very long walk to Mandalay Bay).

The spa and gym (Canyon Ranch) was amazing. Access to the fitness center is no extra charge with the included resort fee if you stay at The Venetian ($28\/day). A day pass for the spa facilities alone is $25\/day (a total steal!). Treatments are obviously extra. The spa and gym were huge, clean, and more impressive than I had anticipated.

A lovely, luxurious Vegas hotel. I loved every minute of our stay.",2,0,0

First let me say that this is our second time staying at The Venetian. The first time was 15 years ago when we got married there. The first time we stayed there we paid for a room with a view which ended up being a view of a roof, hose, and air conditioner. This time when we checked in I mentioned our previous experience and we were put on the 21st floor with an amazing view. 

The room was beautiful and just as we remembered. The only thing that bothered us was the smell of smoke in our room day and night. It was so strong last night that I woke up from my sleep. I don't know why the ventilation is so bad you can smell other people smoking. The plumbing also made some noise when turning the sink on and off.  

My only other complaint is the bridge we were married on 15 years ago has been closed to the public. The current wedding bridge is not the same one we got married on. I would've loved to have gone up on the bridge to take some pics but sadly I couldn't.

We booked two rooms, one with double queen sized beds for my wife's aunt, cousin and close family friend who accompanied us, and one with a king sized bed for me and my bride. Both rooms were mini suites, with a sleeping area and a little living room\/sitting area. Both areas had flat screen TV's, although it did not seem to be HD service. Seems like they were receiving SD broadcast. But who goes to Vegas to watch TV? Not me! I went to Vegas to get married, honeymoon and gamble and drink, in that order! And I was able to do it all in first class fashion!!! The room was not super expensive, although the restaurants were a little pricey. See my Denny review.

Their ""suites"" which are the base rooms for their hotel offer a more spacious accommodation than most hotels you find on the strip and the best part is that their prices are typically better too.

I has been quite a while since I last stayed at the Venetian every since my in law's purchased a couple of time shares in Vegas. So twice a year, we go and stay for a few days and I get to stop by and have dinner at the Venetian\/Palazzo. This time, I had a seminar to attend and luckily, the seminar was at the Venetian. For the participants of the seminar, we had a special price of $149\/night. I checked in Tuesday evening and checked out Friday afternoon. Even if the hotel room was comped by my company, I still did the $20 tip during check in. The guy was pleasant and I got an upgrade with a view, view was decent, I was facing the T.I. hotel and was placed on the 24th floor.

Check in and check out was a breeze. No issues.

I got a deluxe suite and it's a very impressive room.  My one complaint for the suite is that it's not a ""real"" suite with separate rooms.  However, it didn't really affect my experience at all and I rather enjoyed all the extra space being accessible.  I love the remote controlled drapes and blinds (I know it's lazy, but in the morning... a necessity!).

I'm going to skip service since all I can say is ""the lines were short when I checked in"", but I didn't try any room service or call for any special arrangements.  However, they do have security available downstairs preventing any wandering souls from entering the suites.

One last note worthy item, ACCESSIBILITY.  With easy access to a great poker room, the Phantom of the Opera, Jersey Boys, a great casino, etc... I would definitely consider accessibility one of the Venetian's selling points.

From what everyone said about the place, I was really excited to finally stay at a 5 star resort on the strip.  The room itself was 5 stars--the bathroom had a great shower and a separate room for the toilet.  The bed was probably the comfiest I have ever slept in.  I went to bed early just so I could sleep more in the bed.

However, that was about where the good stuff ends.  We stayed in the Venezia tower and whoever designed that should no longer be designing hotels.  It was a freaking maze to get to our room!  My mom was with me, and she has pain in her legs, and the walk was way too far to get to the room from the valet.  I would not recommend this hotel to people with ambulatory issues.

Also, when I went to the Venezia pool there was no one there to serve drinks.  Someone collecting towels by the pool told me to go to Bouchon and walk up to the bar.  I started to, but two separate employees told me that I was not allowed inside because I only had shorts and my bathing suit top on.  I would have gladly not come in your restaurant if I didn't have to!  And then the bartender made the wrong drinks, and very rudely insisted that I did order what he made and reluctantly made me a new drink.  Eventually, a cocktail waitress did show up and we were able to get drinks from her (which she made by hand and were much better than the ones from Bouchon).

I couldn't believe that room service charged a delivery fee.  This may be standard at hotels and I just don't know, but it seems silly.  It's like a drive thru charging you for using their drive thru lane.

Lastly, the folks when I checked in were very firm that if we used the mini fridge and even so much as moved stuff around, we would be charged a restocking fee.  First, it is stupid to not allow folks to use the fridge in their room that they're paying for.  Second, there was stuff still leftover in the fridge from a previous guest: half a thing of milk, leftover beer and two open water bottles.  I called the maid service and they said they would be right up to get it.  When I checked out it was still there.  Ridiculous.  I will very closely be watching my credit card statement to make sure I wasn't charged for the maid service's mistake.

I would never stay here again.  For what they charge, I expected a lot more.",2,0,1

Okae, for planning a Bachelorette weekend here for a group of 12 girls - the BELLA Suite was perfect to fit us all. As we planned to order 2 cots (rolling beds), but unfortunately according to Housekeeping at the Venetian they said it would be a fire hazard.

There is s much to do in the Venetian and being connected to the palazzo was also a plus. 

The pool decks were awesome. There were several pools that were located on the 4th floor in between the two main buildings. In addition to several family friendly bars they also had two party pools - Azure and Tao Beach that were both awesome.

I've stayed at the Palazzo before, and obviously the suites are comparable (pretty much the same, except for location within the resort and room decor).  We booked a Bella suite through Jetsetter for a very reasonable price.  For me, the main appeal of staying at the Venetian & Palazzo hotels is that they offer suites with two queen beds (instead of one king) as well as a full pull-out bed.  Because of the additional bed options, I think the Venetian is one of the best-valued hotels for larger groups.

Room: We stayed in the Venezia tower, which was built later than the other tower but has a more ""classic"" decor (more in line with the hotel theme & a little less modern).  I liked the decor just fine, but I actually really liked the location of the Venezia tower.  The elevator is right by the front desk and valet \/ taxi line, which was very convenient for us (no walking a mile through the hotel in heels just to get cabs!).  It does take two elevators to get up to your room (there is a separate elevator that just takes you to the Venezia tower lobby), but I didn't really care.  The rooms are also in the same tower as Bouchon *drool* - so if I had the option again, I would definitely choose a room in the Venezia tower.  As far as the suite itself, I was very pleased with everything and have no complaints.  The room is spacious, the beds are comfortable, and the bathrooms are clean and updated.  There is a powder area inside the bathroom, which is useful; however the shower has clear doors (so depending on whom you're with, you may only be able to shower & use the bathroom one at a time).  Also, one difference I noticed between the Venetian and the Palazzo: the suite I stayed at in the Palazzo had an L-shaped couch with a pull-out bed, whereas the Venetian suite had a regular couch with a pull-out bed.  With the L-shaped couch, you still had half of the couch when the bed was pulled-out; in the Venetian suites (at least in the Venezia tower), you lose the couch once you pull out the bed.

Service & amenities: The front desk and concierge staff are great - friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  I had no problems and they were for the most part, timely and efficient.  Our room was just a short walk away from the casino and the Grand Canal shops.  Bouchon *drool, again* is located inside the Venezia tower and actually offers cocktail and food service in the summertime at the Venezia private pool!  There are also two fast food courts located within the hotel (cheapest restaurant is probably Panda Express).  Both hotel pools are nice, not too crowded and pretty quiet.  For a livelier atmosphere, you also have Tao Beach, which I'll review separately.

Location: The Venetian is in a pretty good location on the strip.  Getting in and out of the hotel from the Venezia tower isn't overly complicated, and there are also a few walkways you can take to get to the Palazzo and the Wynn\/Encore pretty easily.  It's roughly a $10-12 cab ride down to the Cosmopolitan, ~$5-6 to Encore.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Venetian and would book a room here again.  As a complete package, the Venetian\/Palazzo resort offers a lot of entertainment in one convenient location.",8,5,6

And I get that I don't go to Vegas to get so drunk that I hit a security guard in a supposed 5 Star hotel, so I might be a little on the boring side.  It's probably a great hotel if you're Snooki, or like to dress like a carbon copy of the girl trying to dress like a hooker sitting next to you.  Unfortunately, it might only catch the eye of the ""Situation"" clone sitting on the other side of you, because those are the only kinds of people my husband and I saw on our trip over Memorial Day weekend.  Before it gets really negative, there were a few good things:

1.  The rooms are a great size and the bed was crazy comfortable.
2.  The front desk help was really awesome, quick, efficient, helpful and very funny.
3.  The bathrooms are huge.
4.  The location is fairly central and you can walk anywhere (more or less)

I wish I could comment on the dining and the casino, but after spending our first hour amidst the insane crowds of loud, smoking drunk people at 2 pm, and having our feet stepped on several times with no acknowledgement from the ""steppers"", and being overcharged in the food court and then told that we couldn't have been overcharged, it must be our fault (?!?), we decided to explore other options.  I understand that it was a holiday weekend, but I didn't like the out of control feeling in the middle of a Sunday afternoon.  It felt cheap, like I could be staying at any hotel downtown and was a total turn off.

We didn't return to our room until about 8 hours later (we had dinner and show plans at another hotel) and when we did, what we saw and experienced made our afternoon in the casino and food court look tame.  We couldn't walk through doors to the hotel due to lines for Tao (at 2:00 am), and after having my foot stepped on several more times again, we were actually accused of cutting into the line for the club while we were only trying to get to the escalator to get to our room.  It shouldn't be so difficult to get into your hotel!

As we made our way to the elevators, we witnessed something that was the icing on the cake of our stay.  We walked past the security guards who were supposed to be checking room keys, and as I turned around at the elevator, there was a drunk girl shouting obscenities at two security guards and swiping at them as if she were going to hit them.  Next thing I knew, they were wrestling her to the ground, handcuffing her, etc... all while she is screaming with her dress pulled up so we could see whatever she had on underneath and exposing one of her breasts.   At this point, I should have expected this to be the ending to my day at The Venetian and I wasn't even really surprised to see it happening.  In defense of the security guards, she did look as though she was trying to hit them and threw her phone at them in their direction.  They were doing their job and that is more than fine with me, but while this was happening, about a dozen people walked by and got into the elevators, making me wonder about how enforced the ""show your room key"" policy is.  And on crowded weekends like this, that didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.  It was good entertainment, don't get me wrong, but not what I want in a hotel experience.

I really wanted to like it here, but it just didn't happen this time.  Luckily we travel to Vegas 4-5 times a year and there are plenty of options...  The external things prevented me from wanting to try the restaurants and casino that the Venetian had to offer so maybe we missed out there, but we were willing to risk it... and don't get me started on the valet parking and 45 minutes it took to get our car, at 7 in the morning!",1,2,1

The price was great (169\/night) with a package that included $40 off the Phantom of the Opera show tickets! We were definitely planning on seeing it, so it was perfect! There were other discounts in the package (to an Asian restaurant and a Mexican one at Palazzo) but we didn't use those. 

The Venetian...OMG, I loved that place! The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom\/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b\/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b\/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :) 

The pool area on the 4th floor was very nice (there's another pool with more shade and more privacy on the 10th floor too)...I didn't check out Tao Beach, because I didnt even realize that was in a different area until later. My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently. Drinks were good, and the restaurant (Riva by Wolfgang Puck) has really good lunch menu (Pizza was great, and their salads too).

The Venetian is one of the older bigger hotels in las Vegas. Built on the former Sands site and opened back in 1999 along with Paris and Bellagio. The theme here is pretty obvious it's Italian just like Bellagio.

The plus side of the Venetian is it's an all suite hotel and the standard rate is at $129 with player's card. Look at it this way, ""who spends most of their time in the room while in Vegas?"" Unless you're bringing a huge group of 8-10 people and splitting the room bill. The Venetian is just as massive as the Bellagio and the casino is designed to confuse you so you can't find your way out and instead end up spending more money in their tables or slots. 

The pluses:

-Replica of the Rialto Bridge
-Grand Canal Shops
-Venetian facade by the entrance
-All Suite hotel
-Location between the Wynn, Palazzo and across from the Mirage. 
-Great pool complex
-Walgreens outside by Sephora
-Food Court next to the Grand Canal Shops
-Wifi in the rooms 

The cons:

-Huge size
-Smokey Casino
-15 minute walk from the room to the strip.
-Resort Fee

The Venetian has similar room rates compared to Wynn. So I'll just take my pick and stick with Wynn\/Encore because they seem more upscale and private compared to the Venetian. Or if I'm looking to book a suite, I will go with the Palazzo because it's newer. I feel the rooms at the Venetian need a major overhaul. It may seem luxurious, it's just feels so outdated and I noticed a lot of dust on the furniture. 

It's a nice hotel with great perks it just doesn't compete with Wynn \/ Encore.",7,1,2

For my sisters 60th birthday we decided to upscale it a bit. I was embarrassed and so disappointed in our whole Venetian Experience. The only decent part was maybe walking through the Gondola area, but any one could do that without spending $300 plus dollars per night. I will add some photos we took of the pool, spa area...Horrendous....I have never seen such a mess at a pool area....
the next morning we came down again and found some of the same items still laying at the pool...we decided not to stay at the pool since it was hard to tell if the towels in the clean bin weren't mixed with dirty towels. Each day we went down and it was already 9:30am...so plenty of time for staff to have the area cleaned the area.
We arrived Sat. and checked in our room. Our friend had an adjoining room. It was hard sleeping that night because the AC wasn't working properly, and was making a loud rattling noise. The bathroom door hinge was missing so we could not close the door. So much for privacy. Also some of the lamps did not work...needless to say we asked to be switched to a different room. They told us they would upgrade us from the 4th floor to the 21st with a view. 
We are in Vegas so we decided to visit some of the sites. At 2pm our friend had a text that her room was ready and she needed to ck in by 2pm. so we all rushed back to the hotel to change rooms only to realize our adjoining room was not ready. We had packed all of our things and brought it up to her room anticipating that our room would be ready soon. We sat around waiting and by 5 we had to leave for the MJ show...there were 6 girls all trying to get ready in one room...needless to say, no one got to shower and really get ready for a night out. We missed our dinner resi also....at the time we were leaving 5pm, the maid was finally getting to the room for clean up...5pm!!!! Meanwhile we had called management several times in regards to getting our room and they said they were sending someone up....when we were walking out I asked the maid if she had gotten any message to rush the room and she said no. We got back to our hotel at 12pm. We had to move all of our things from one room to the other. We were upset that we really did not have a room most of Sat! They offered to give us $100 towards amenities!!! Meanwhile, it took 2 trips before keys worked...anyway I can go on and on...but think twice about booking here...we paid quite a bit for a room here, and our friend got the same room on Hotwire for 1\/2 the price, but regardless...not worth it..Management did not react or try to help out...they were full of excuses...
One manager told me we should of been around when our room was ready!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The pool complex is massive, the lobby is striking, and the casino has better lighting than most I've ever been in.

This room is incredible.. it opens to a very regal hallway which leads to the en suite bathroom area with a gorgeous huge bathtub, all glass shower stall, double vanity sinks, a sit down vanity with light up mirror to do your make up and a toilet room for some privacy on the throne.

You move into the bedroom to find a comfy king bed (a bit on the firm side) and beyond that space, you have a HUGE living room\/office area! This place was at least 900+ sq. ft of living space and it was perfect for our 3-day getaway! 

We never really had to leave the Venetian..and let me assure you others considering a stay here.. don't even BOTHER going to any other hotel\/casino, because once you are here, you are SET!

Your options go up from there.

Then, there is Bouchon, arguably Las Vegas' best restaurant.  And, as a guest, you can have breakfast there, poolside, every morning. 

If there is a group of you or if you intend to spend any amount of time at the pool, rent a cabana at the main pool complex ... don't worry you'll be able to hear Tao Beach loud and clear.  You get yet another flat screen, a sofa, a lounger, four pool deck loungers, a fridge full of soft drinks and a fruit plate, safe and DVD player.

The price was very reasonable, like $159 or something, which we didn't expect for such a grand place. We asked to be upgraded when we checked in and they put us in a 700-sq. ft suite. Luxe! 

The bathroom was gigantic. Our bathrooms at home are tiny, so this was a real treat. Especially for a bath-lover like me. The tub was huge. Ok, so you get the idea...the Venetian does things big. 

I'm sure you can tell from the pics how ornate and gorgeous the overall surroundings are, and that doesn't let up at any level of the hotel. They didn't miss a thing here. Wherever you are, look up, around, and there's more artistic beauty. Very classy. 

One thing to be aware of is this is a MASSIVE piece of real estate. It really is its own city. So if you're going on business, try to get your room located quite close to the conference room (if your business is being conducted in the hotel itself). Otherwise, you'll possibly be doing a lot of walking and it is much more daunting in high heels. That was a regret -- that we were situated so far away from where we needed to be each day.

Also, the pools are outdoor, so we didn't get to enjoy them much because we went in the winter. The desert is frickin cold at night, and we only got to use the pools once. They are beautiful and fun.

Unfortunately, during the trip, I suddenly fell ill. I don't know if it was the flu or food poisoning, but I got completely, utterly sick with very violent vomiting (no, I don't drink, so it wasn't that!). My partner contacted the hotel who sent Security up to our room to check on me.  They said it was likely ""bad Panda"" because I'd eaten at Panda Express, and that at least 50% of their emergency calls are for food poisoning -- a real problem on the Strip. Oh, great! They called the paramedics, which were incredibly awesome. I got taken to Sunrise Hospital (awesome too, I'll yelp about it too) where I stayed for several hours until my dehydration was starting to reverse. 

Throughout the whole ordeal, the Venetian was fantastic. We asked to extend our stay for an extra day so I could recover enough to travel home, and that wasn't a problem at all. They arranged a wheelchair for me to get around during the rest of my stay, and housekeeping sent me a huge bag of toiletries to take with me. 

Every aspect of service from the hotel was wonderful. I can't say enough good about them. My sudden illness scared me to death, and they were there for us.

I decided to stay at the Venetian for my birthday over labor day weekend and it was nothing short of a disaster. First, when I arrived it appeared as if my suite had not been cleaned, there were used towels, and there was a used razor in the bathroom from the previous guests. Additionally, there was a ton of food missing from the mini bar fridge.  When I called down to the front desk to get this straightened out they told me not to worry because the room had already been cleaned and I would not get charged for the items missing from the mini fridge. When I asked for new towels they told me it would be a $10 charge per towel. Is that not included in the resort fee? The whole experience with customer service was less than desirable.
 
This wasn't even the worst part. I invited some friends along for my Bday and shortly into the trip they started getting out of hand. I decided to take pre-cautious safety measures so I went downstairs to the front desk and specifically asked the front desk manager to take my friends names off my guest list and to deactivate there keys. I specifically told her my guests were making me uncomfortable at this point and I didn't want anyone to have access to my room except for me. She out this note in the system. I then locked up my room with my valuables and headed out for the night with a different group of friends. I came back to find that the Front Desk\/Hotel Staff let the guests I specifically asked to be taken off my lists AND strangers into my hotel room. They were having sex in my bed, stealing my stuff, and taking more items from the mini fridge. I was disgusted and felt threatened. When I asked them to get out of my room the guy jumped up and started threatening me. He called me a whore and I was literally frightened for my safety. They finally left and I sat in my hotel crying for the rest of the night. I immediately left Vegas.
 
Once the shock subsided I went to assess the damages. My BFF had all her clothes and money stolen. I had a lot of my valuables, clothes, and $300 stolen out of my bag. I called the hotel staff and they only credited me back for one night of my stay. When I asked for more money back Melissa and Julia told me to file a claims report and then they would tell me what the Venetian would give me back. After talking to multiple different people for hours I never heard back from them. After putting my safety at harm, ruining my birthday, and not giving me what I paid for you'd think the Venetian would be a little more helpful but apparently not.
 
If you are concerned about being safe and comfortable in Vegas DO NOT STAY AT THE VENETIAN. They will let strangers talk their way into your room and then won't take responsibility for the damages. I just hope everyone is is thinking about staying there reads this and does not have the same terrible experience in Vegas I did.",4,2,0

I got married here at the waterfall between The Venetian and the Palazzo and had such a great experience. We bought the Waterfall Serenity package with no regrets. We had a really great wedding planner named Caroline. That woman is amazing. Seriously, how she deals with all us brides is beyond me. She was so nice, and took care of everything. I'm from North Dakota, so having someone deal with everything so I just had to be there was so much less stressful. 

We had this really awesome accordion player who was so sweet, and made me laugh before the wedding when my nerves were fried. Our minister was also so nice, and funny as well! The whole thing was magical. Exactly how you would want your wedding to be. 

Then we stayed in the Prima Suite which was beyond our wildest fantasies. It had a huge living room and bar area which was perfect for the short wedding reception that we had after the ceremony, and a huge bedroom with lots of closet space. We had a dual-headed shower and a giant whirpool tub. My husband practically had to drag me home or I would have stayed there forever. 

The one time they did mess up our keys, they ended up giving us a nice discount off the resort fees for our trouble which was really nice. 

I would definitely stay here again!",2,0,0

Our suite was big- 1600 sq feet, almost like renting an apartment for the night. We were in a room with two queen beds and one bath. Loved the shower stall, Jacuzzi and dressing room.  The gold and brass fixtures mixed with warm espresso colors of the furniture gave the effect of royalty!

The restaurants at this hotel are a gourmand's delight! Loved the Taqueria Canonita. This restaurant is right next to the canal and affords a great view for outdoor diners. We went there straight after our gondola ride. I dug into one of the best lip smacking chile rellenos I have eaten so far. The queso fundido was yummmmm too, served with warm flour tortillas. We ordered a plate of wild mushroom enchilladas for our son. He has low spice tolerance and this dish was just perfect for him.  

We also got a coupon during our stay  to use at the Grill Restaurant. We tucked into some delicious Italian food at this place the next day.

The  winter celebrations at the Ventian are awesome. There is music by the Christmas tree  every evening and performances by people dressed in garb from yore.

Check out the Blue Man's Group while you are here. It is an hour and a half long and my three year old was fascinated enough to sit right through it!!

I've stayed at the Venetian multiple times over the past several years, and generally, it's been a reliable experience. Rooms are spacious, amenities are comfortable, the pool is relaxing, and the casino is exactly what you'd expect from one of the nicer resorts.

*HOWEVER, during my most recent stay there, a few weeks ago, I was pretty shocked to realize that four iPads among my seven guests were stolen from our room one night.  Someone managed to get into our room during the few hours it was empty, dug through backpacks and luggage to steal four iPads (even leaving the empty iPad sleeves). 

We've met and been in touch with Venetian security, and although we've given them time and patience, they haven't been much help. Maybe they aren't taking us seriously (it is Vegas, after all), or maybe they truly are just that busy to attend to a loyal customer. Even if I give them the benefit of the doubt, I URGE guests to lock up their valuables while staying at the Venetian. 

Or, you could just save yourself the worry, and try some of Vegas' other options.

I've stayed here with my family a couple of times and can never forget the wonder I experienced as a young teen walking into the beautiful marble lobby with the Michelangelo-type painted ceiling that I could get lost staring at. Also, the golden globe shaped fountain, and the blue sky painted ceilings one witnesses while walking through the hotel always amaze me. 
One of the pluses of Las Vegas is the fact that every hotel seems to have created an ""experience"". Having been to Venice, the Venetian does a great job in recreating that experience - just newer, more compact, and with lots of gambling, lights, and entertainment.
I am always impressed by the sheer size of the suites (every room is a suite!) and the grandeur of each room. Though the Palazzo may be ""newer and cleaner"", I'm pretty sure that it is missing some facets of that original Venetian grandeur. There is less marble in the Palazzo bathrooms, that's for sure ;)
Watching the magical Phantom of the Opera in this hotel only added to its mystique. Till this date, I have not experienced a more enthralling musical - and trust me, Vegas does it better!

We stayed at the Venetian the weekend of 12\/21\/12 and we stayed in one of their Prima suites.  I had stayed in one of these rooms previously and was looking forward to the updates they had recently done to them.  My children love using the huge jacuzzi style tub so that is one of the first things they wanted to do upon our evening arrival.  After that everything went downhill.  Upon draining the tub one of the sinks started to make a bubbling up type of sound then proceeded to back up creating a horrible sewage type smell.  We immediately called to housekeeping which informed us that they would send someone up right away (this was at 8pm and mind you we still had not received our roll away which was requested when I made the reservation a month in advance).  It was then 10pm and no one had shown up even after a couple more calls.  Finally we just gave up and closed the bathroom door and put towels underneath so the smell would not come out.  We called down and told them to just come tomorrow morning as we have children that were very tired.  At this point we still had not received the roll away so I had to share the couchbed with one of my children.  I then went down to the invited guest front desk area to let them know in person about the sink smell and they offered to take my roll away charge off the bill.  Wow!  You mean you will comp the rollaway that no one ever brought?  Gee thanks!  I was then told they were sorry and that was it.  Turns out they ended up comping a $30 food charge the next day but still that was not even close to enough.  How about comping my upgrade charge since I slept on a couch bed with my child and had to smell sewage for most of the night?  Oh and lastly when I did ask for extra blankets for the couch bed since it had none on it they brought us some that appeared to be stained with blood.

Pros:

1. The room. It was beautiful! We got a two-queen suite, and there was plenty of room for five girls, all of our crap and all of our booze. We all had a place to sleep (two queens plus a pull out couch) which was a huge plus too. The bathroom was large, and had multiple areas for getting ready! Two sinks, plus a vanity. Perfect. The shower was honestly the best shower I've ever experienced! It had nice pressure, big water droplets and the awesome addition of two nozzles on the front wall of the shower that sprayed you from the front too! After a long night out, I stood with my back facing those nozzles for a fantastic water massage. PROPS to the shower. The beds were also super comfy. 

2. Multiple pools. We stayed in the Venezia Tower, and there was an additional, European garden themed pool that we LOVED. The general pool deck was crowded and noisy, and the garden pool was quiet and relaxing. Lots of hidden places to lounge and have a break from the crowds. 

3. Easy access to the front desk\/our room. We basically walked right in the front door, right to the front desk and right up to our tower. Pretty awesome quick access.

4. Decor. The Venetian is visually beautiful. It's decorated so well, and none of it looks cheesy, just pretty!

5. Grand Lux Cafe. Open all hours of the late night\/early morning - this restaurant saved our hungry tummies past 4 a.m. both nights we were there with high quality, yummy food of all kinds. 

6. Location on the strip. Right across from Mirage\/Caesars and right next to Wynn\/Encore. Nice. 


Cons: 

1. Since we were staying the Venezia Tower, I literally never saw the Casino in this hotel. That can be both a pro and a con, but I almost felt like we were staying at a casino-free place. It was a trek to both the casino and the shops. 

2. Service at the front desk. I had to call it an early night the last night we were there, so I headed back alone, just to find that all of our keys had been de-activated. I went down to the front desk to fix the problem so I could get to bed... but had to have my name on the reservation in order to get a new card. I understand its property policy and all, but the guy was quite rude about it, and only put a smile on his ugly mug after I finally got ahold of my friend who was partying at Moon. Try some manners training.

The only word I can use to describe the bed is decadent.  I know that isn't a word normally used to describe bedding, but seriously, I felt like a Princess.  Everything was down and 750+ treadcount.  Plus there was ANOTHER flatscreen HDTV in front of the bed!  The curtains took some getting used to until I realized there is a REMOTE CONTROL for them!  So when you're in bed you don't have to get up to close them!  Fantastic.

The bathroom was amazing - separate bath\/shower, tv mounted above the sinks (which was unviewable from the bathtub, oddly), double sinks, separate vanity area.  

Some coworkers were staying at the Encore and my room blew theirs away based on sheer size (though the Encore, as a whole, is much cooler than The Venetian).  

The only reason I'm not giving the hotel 5 stars is because the cleaning staff lacked an attention to details.  Several of the lightbulbs in my room were blown out.  The printer was missing an ink cartridge (I assume a previous guest took it?), I was mischarged for minibar items I didn't use, toilet paper wasn't refilled, and the room just wasn't especially clean.

Outside the room there was (obviously) lots to do - great shops, nice pools, lots of restaurants, and the hotel is in a great location.  Convention facilities are nice (I was here for work so should probably mention something about that!), the convention food was a bit disappointing, breakfast was just fruit and muffins (carb overload!), and lunch was boxed sandwiches.",0,0,0

The desk clerk was nice and efficient, and answered all my questions. Four of us checked into two rooms, we were lucky to get them on the same floor\/wing. Our rooms were ""Queen Suites"" - very large rooms with a sunken living area near the windows, two queen beds and a large dresser. There were large flat screen TV's in both the Living and Bed areas. Our view was not good, but we weren't there for the view and we were lucky that a not great view came at the end of the hall so we had very little hall noise. The second room had a much better view, but they said they heard a bit more commotion from the hall. 

The very large bathroom had a separate WC. The bathroom also has a large walk-in shower, oval jet tub, double sink, and a vanity with bench. Lots of lighting options in the bathroom, I think there were four switches. 

Housekeeping was on target, but they do have one weird quirk that upon inquiry is a standard practice for the hotel. Even if you want to be low-water use and keep your towel hanging, they will refold it. I find this odd because you think you have fresh towels, but you don't. No way of knowing which towel is which or if they put them back in the same order. 

This hotel is huge - HUGE - and, to be honest, kind of difficult to figure out how it's laid out. My sister stayed here before and we never found the pool that had been near her room during a prior stay. 

Speaking of pools, we found a couple of them. They were all nice, I wish the quieter pool in the sun had been open the day I wanted to sit by it. Oh well.

The hotel has a full mall complete with gondola rides. Tons of restaurant options, we tried several and loved the variety. The casino is nice, we didn't really spend much time there (I know, weird for Vegas, right?!)

Checkout was odd. I tried to use the non-human options but none of them sent me my bill. I ended up going to the desk and checking out in person to make sure there were no wayward charges. 

If you like a bit of space in your rooms, this is an excellent choice! I would definitely stay here again.",0,0,0

This was my first time in Vegas, so I wanted to stay in a beautiful hotel and The Venetian did not disappoint. The interior of the hotel and your suite will have you feeling like Italian royalty. The rooms were immaculately clean, beds nice and comfortable, and staff is friendly. It is a huge place with a plethora of shops, bars, and restaurants. The button controlled drapes and three TVs in the suite were a nice touch. The bathtub was a perfect place to soak and unwind and is big enough for two. Valet parking was quick. 

very minor reasons why this isn't a full five stars from me: towels were a bit rough, some wallpaper in the toilet room was peeling at the bottom (a weird thing to not repair for a high end resort hotel such as this). one wine glass provided in suite although we had a 2 bed suite, and the directories located in the shopping area could use ""you are here"" stickers as it's very easy to get lost in this hotel, especially if you've had a few drinks. Also, the hotel touts their bar The Dorsey as a high end, quiet place where you might expect to see a man in a smoking jacket sipping on scotch, but when we got there they were literally blasting DMX and it was stuffed full.. it looked like a club. not at all the vibe they advertised it as, so we didn't go in.

again, these are nit picky things that did not negate my wonderful experience here.

How the Venetian scored this place instead of Paris Hotel is certainly a mystery, but it sure makes the Venetian a better choice!  Pool area is set up like a typical European Garden.

The good things about the hotel and they are many - 

Decor is beautiful and the theme is very nice. It is an all-suite hotel and we got a free upgrade to a strip view room. Although they called it a strip view room, it was not too much of a strip view. We could see the mirage, TI, Trump and the Pallazzo. We had a very good view of the pool of the venetian. The Canal shoppes had one of the best prices I have seen for a lot of stores. We dined at a Canal side restaurant and found the ambience to be fantastic. Valet parking is free for all hotel guests - ofcourse the tip but its luxurious :). 

Few of the bad things - 

We wanted to buy a few hotel toileteries and there was not a single place which sold them. You have to order it through housekeeping and it takes about 7 days to arrive at the hotel.

This hotel is beautiful. I must admit it got off to a rough start because I booked the room on the hotels website and when I finally got to check-in,  the room did not look the same as the Bella Suite I booked online. The room looked older and smelled like mold. I immediately called to get moved as I didn't feel I was getting what I paid for. Spoke to Louie, the hotel manager and explained the situation but I felt brushed off with the explanation that the hotel was completely full and there wasn't any other room. Well, after going back and forth for over an hour, Louie made it happen. Thank You Louie! I specifically booked the Bella Suite from the picture online and was here to celebrate a very special occasion where anything less would just ruin my plans and simply ruin my trip. The only reason for not a perfect 5 was because of the troubling and frankly 'Stressful' issue at first. Otherwise, if that did not happen it would have been a perfect 5!

It turns out to my surprise that the Venetian has two towers, the Venencia tower and the Venetian tower.  The Venencia tower has an older decor, the Venetian tower has the updated decor as pictured online. Make sure if you book to confirm in writing that you are indeed booking the Venetian tower if you want to be certain that your room will match the newer photos of their suites.

Otherwise, after that was worked out, it was smooth sailing after that. The hotel experience was terrific. Thank you again Louie. The Venetian Tower accommodations are top notch, the beds and linens are incredibly comfortable, the resort shops and restaurants are all exceptional, including the Grand Canal Shops located on the hotel property.

Theme
Venice-like.  

Perfumed?
Yes.

Good for kids?: 
Yes, but the prices are not good for people with kids.

Hotel Room
Spacious and opulent for the common, middle-class clientele.  Beds are comfortable with bathrooms to be envious of.

Amenities and service
Great service feeling more of a palace than a hotel.

Shoppes
The boardwalk is home to high-end boutiques and is more suited to window shopping.  Though not in the league of  The Forum or PH, its still worth a stroll through.

Restaurants
Our favorite is the Lux Cafe.  But aside of high-end establishments the Venetian offers two food courts.  One near the casino, cleverly camouflaged and is more plush while another near the parking garage is more for the common folk.  You can order a hamburger from at least four different places there.

Locale: At the northern end of the strip it has a grand approach.  There are bridges, arches, and staircases between the street and the front doors.  It is beautiful at night and within walking distance of malls and the Walgreen's.

Summary
It is worth a grand tour.  The skyline at night is as impressive as the gondolas below.  Inside towards the lobby you will be escorted by classical music and wonderful reproductions of ceiling art complete with a fountain in the lobby.   A place like this is a reason to be in Vegas for those of us who do not game.",1,0,0

Sorry, I had to get that out of my system.  

A very large casino with plenty of touristy, sight-seeing things here.  A Sistine-ish ceiling, opera singers, a giant mall, tons of restaurants, gondoliers.  What more could you possibly want?

Now that I'm a local, I come here more for the people-watching aspect.  I realize now I can't afford the shops at the mall, or the restaurants, or the ride in a gondola.... But it's still fun to just hang out.  And smell the roses.

In all, an architecturally beautiful building that you can wander in for hours.  Minimal smoke smell.  A couple permanent shows and a venue for rotating singers and comedians.  You can find a few restaurants that are moderately priced (about $15 per entree, Grand Lux for example) and there is a food court in the mall near the parking garage.

Located on the north side of the strip, connected to the Palazzo and near Mirage, Treasure Island, Wynn\/Encore, and Harrah's.  A bit of a walk to the other casinos.  It can get really crowded on the weekends.

Walking down the hall to our room there were several rooms that had room service left overs sitting outside their door for over two days, including our own.

- They have a Panda Express that serves beef and broccoli for breakfast.  That is money.

- They have ridiculously hot girls serving drinks at the pool.  We're talking hot tats, and tops that practically be to fall off.  I got hammered.  By the way - Friday and Saturday are the days to look at the sillies at the pool.  Sunday is family day - be prepared for a lot of pasty white bloated mini-van owners.

- They have a separate little toilet chamber in the rooms so you can pummel the porcelain while your wife or mistress brushes her teeth.  Yeeha for multitasking.

- People get in fights at the taxi stand.  This is free, and is about as entertaining as the De La Hoya fight I saw at Mandalay Bay a few years ago.

There are so many restaurants to choose from and most of them are really good. I have some favorites and some that are not my favorites. Then you can walk on over to the Palazzo side and find another casino and more restaurants. There are also a lot of great shops here too. 

The rooms are clean and huge. Mini bar, 3 TV's, a sofa that turns into a bed, a safe, bath tub and shower are some of the room amenities I enjoy. I never run out of things to do while staying here plus all the rooms are suites which I love that. They are always very nice and accommodating from the time I leave till I go.  I started staying here and I got hooked because of the rooms and I also love to gamble here too. The bathrooms are very nice and always someone in there keeping them clean. 

It is an easy airport ride too. If you take a cab and want to save $$ ask the cab driver to take the streets and not the highway. You will save about $15 one way trip. It is also easy to walk the strip from here. It may be a long walk to the Cosmo but it is about a 20 minute walk to Ceasars Palace from here. I like the location and the service. The valet is always nice and they take very good care of my belongings every time I have had to check them in. 

If you get the chance to be pampered please do go to the Canyon Ranch Spa. It is amazing! It is huge, one of the largest I have been to. Again, friendly staff and very clean too. The gym is also a good size and I really enjoy having breakfast right there when you are done. 

Do not forget to get your Grazie card when you go here for perks.

I'm spoiled by this hotel and it is the only place I want to stay when I go to Vegas! I have stayed at nearly every hotel on the strip, including Wynn and Encore and I think the rooms here are the best.This hotel is beautiful, upscale, and will wow you away with all the lovely Italian decor. I'm reminded of Venice when I come here... except it's much cleaner, lol. Venetian is the original building, while Palazzo is the new building. I've stayed at rooms at both. Rooms in the Palazzo are slighty larger, about 750 square feet, compared to 700 square feet for a standard room at The Venetian. Standard rooms include a living area and THREE TV's! One TV in the ""bedroom"", another in the ""living room"" and another in the bathroom. Living rooms also include a sofa that is actually a sofa bed. What I do not like, is that the cost of a 1 king bed and 2 queen beds are different prices, about $20 difference. If you are pleasant at check in, they may give you a complimentary room upgrade :)

Anyways, I think this hotel has it all... except for the Vegas buffet!! LOL. Anyways, I always LOVE the decor here. There is a beautiful shopping area upstairs, with a gondola outside and inside the hotel. The people on the gondolas will sing... it seems very romantic, and hopefully, one day a guy will take me on it. It's kind of pricey though, about $30 a person, but you can get discounts. The stores are a mix of affordable and higher end stores, so shopping here is quite reasonable. There are also a variety places to eat from casual cheaper food court type places to high end restaurants. The only eatery missing is a buffet!

The club Tao is also found here and it is also beautiful in there. It is located on the second floor of shopping and the club is 3 stories high including a rooftop pool area, which I like the best because I like to be out in the open at clubs. In the summer, it is also a dayclub called Tao Beach. You can also eat and Asian Fusion dinner at Tao and the first floor is actually a more lounge-like atmosphere. I would say that the club here ranks after XS at Encore however, which happens to be my favorite club in Vegas. But if you are staying at the Venetian, there is a separate entry line and you can get free entry passes from the conceirge desk. 

They also have a spa here, with fitness facility that includes rock climbing. using spa facilities will be $25 if you are staying at either the Venetian or Palazzo and about $40 if you are not. 

Lots of fun events ensue here. They have Carnivale in the fall and Winter in Venice in the winter. During both events, there are special performers, singers, and special decoration. I love the Winter in Venice decoration! It is just breathtaking beautiful!! During the winter, also if you gamble and earn enough points, you are invited to attend their Grazie Gifts Extravaganza. Trust me, compared to other hotels, they go all out for this. It is literally like shopping at a store. You check in and then go to another room to ""shop"". Write down what items you want, go check out and they will call you when they have your stuff pulled up and ready for you. While you are waiting, there is water, hot cider, hot cocoa, tea and coffee. It was my first time this year going and I can't wait for it next year!! Other hotels, it's just a computer that you order from...

The main difference between Palazzo and Venetian is that the Palazzo has a non-smoking gambling section and that the rooms are a bit bigger. Price of the rooms are the same at either one. I suggest getting a Grazie card and using it to earn points! That's how I get my rooms comped here!! Wi-fi here is included in the room resort fee... just connect to it! Very easy!

I have had many visits to Vegas but have always stayed at the MGM which is a fantastic spot to party and lay your head too... however, we switched it up this time for a bachelorette party and were not disappointed with all the amenities The Venetian has to offer. 

We booked two Luxury Suites on the 16th floor which boasted nearly 700 square feet of space per room. I especially loved the sunken in living room area complete with a comfy sectional couch, dining table and massive television. The oversized and luxurious bathroom was a nice touch for our room of 4 ladies too. Although, we didn't spend a significant time in our rooms, coming back to this was a wonderful incentive after a long day of debauchery.

The grounds of the Venetian offer up spectacular dining options: hello snazzy French Bistro Bouchon, scrumptious Italian feast at Canaletto & casual yet delish Grand Lux Cafe! We had incredible service at Tao nightclub that included being escorted to the front of the line and complimentary bottle service for our gaggle of gals. What a beautiful club! The DJ was solid and so were the dancers and geishas splashing around in the bathtubs throughout the evening. 

Gambling was fun and the shopping divine. The Grand Canal Shoppes and The Shoppes at the Palazzo both offered up reasonably priced options such as Banana Republic or Marshall Russo alongside Barneys New York, Chloe, and Armani too! I could literally spend an entire day bopping around these retailers. 

Wished I would have had more time to take a gondola ride, visit Canyon Ranch spa, and check out the wax figures at Madame Tussauds. A summertime visit to enjoy the pool parties must be in the mix too!

TIP: When taking a cab from the airport, make sure the driver avoids the freeway! Cost for the ride was $18 on our way to The Venetian but when a cabbie took us back to the airport, he took the freeway and our money too - $30.

If you truly know me, I lived in Italy for most of my adulthood life, so The Venetian is just the perfect replica of where I grew up and what I'm familiar with. There are evenings when the hotel employees would dress as Venetians in full gowns, masks, and outfits and dress up to play, just like the Carnevale of Venezia that occurs during February-March. This is an on going festival that lasts about a week, so I would think (and hope) that The Venetian follows the tradition as well. From some evenings in April, I understand they participate in the Redentore Festivale, a large fireworks festival at the heart of Piazza di San Marco.

Just like the real Venezia, you will see a cute replicated Grande Canale that serves gondola rides along with gondoliers crooning classical romantic Italian tunes to you. I'm very fond of this hotel for all its beauty and the perfect replicated ceilings of fine paintings by old masters. I swear I felt like I was in heaven just looking up at the ceilings. Just beyond the bend of the canal is their replicated and most iconic Rialto Bridge. It's cute and painted to its once original colour, and quite crowded, just like the real thing. Even in the outskirts of The Venetian is the infamous replicated Piazza di San Marco!! I just loved everything about it!

Right now, the only reason I give it 2 stars instead of one is because of the great poker room and restaurants they have.  I'm talking about the restaurants Thomas Keller, Emeril Legasse, Wolfgang Puck, and others run.  Not their room service or anything like that.

The rooms are still awesome but the service has become flat out awful.  When I checked in for a littler poker holiday (I live in Las Vegas) my upgraded room (which I'm paying $100\/night extra for) didn't have a working minibar or safe in there.  Ok normally no big deal...I call the front desk and ask for someone to come in and fix that.  I come back at 5:30 am from playing poker and nobody had been in the room.

The next day, I again leave my room and ask for housekeeping to come in and clean as well as do the installations.  I come back about 5 hours later and nothing.  What?!?!  Call the front desk and they say they will send a housekeeping supervisor.  Ok great thanks!  10 minutes later she arrives.

I can best describe her reaction to my call as ""meh.""  Listen Yelpers, I am not a complainer about service or whatever.  I don't need much.  But when I heard her excuse that a housekeeper DID TRY to come into my room but her KEY DIDN'T WORK I almost laughed out loud.  Really?  My key works but her master key didn't work?  Then why didn't she get someone else to come and use their key?  Because I specifically asked for housekeeping before I left since I needed to do some work afterwards.  Real reason no housekeeping came?  They just didn't bother.  If they key really wasn't working they would have found a way to remedy that or left a message on my phone for me in the room.  What a joke.

Also, asked the supervisor to look into the missing minibar and safe.  Her reaction.  ""meh""  Actually it was ""oh this is weird.  Sometimes things are in different places with this suite than others""  Ok...so we search the room and don't find anything.  Her reaction?  ""Meh.""  No promise to get them installed correctly.  She just says ""That's strange.""

I watched rates on Vegas hotels for months in anticipation of a romantic vacation with my boyfriend.  His stories of staying at Imperial Palace had me worried. As soon as the rates dropped to $109 a night for dates in March we booked our room immediately.   

I'm so happy we did.  The room was AMAZ-ING.  We tried the $20 sandwich trick and it got us an upgrade to a view of the strip and late check out.  The basic room was huge, almost double what you get for the same price at some of the trendier hotels on the strip.  I was in love with the the size of the bathroom.   It was so nice having all that space to get ready together.  We both need plenty of time to get ready so it was nice that we could share the bathroom instead of taking turns.

The hotel is huge.  You'll probably get lost at least once or twice  but after a day or two you'll figure it out.  The crowd is a little older,  th mahority of the guests are probably late 30's and up.   The smell is very strong but I like it.  It reminds me of my Dad or Grandpa's aftershave. For some reason it was really comforting returning to the hotel and smelling it at the end of a long night. I heard you can purchase the scent at the gift shop.  I'm going to have to look into this the next time I am in Vegas. 

I really enjoy staying at The Venetian.  It is definetly one of my favorites.  I have stayed here many times it has always been wonderful.  The staff is very friendly and the service is outstanding.

From the moment we walked in we were greeted by a very kind and courteous front desk person.  He gave us everything we needed and recommended that we try the restaurant Bouchon for breakfast or brunch.  

It was a bit of a maze to navigate to our room but the decadent decor of the hotel was worth taking in slowly.  There were oil lamp torches lining the halls, marble floors buffed to a high shine, oil paintings hung in gold frames, and well-maintained Victorian era furniture.  Our room was a double queen bed suite with a separate but attached living room area.  It was definitely large enough for our party of four girls.  The bathroom was also quite large with a clear standing shower, separate toilet area, wide double sinks, a vanity and a full-size bath tub.  Our beds were like plush little clouds of heaven.

I think the best part of this hotel was the customer service.  For such a large hotel I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and efficiently everything was done.  We requested more towels and more arrived within a few minutes.  Room service was impeccable and also arrived very quickly.

We finally got to enjoy the pool area on our last day and when we arrived an employee asked if we needed assistance finding seating.  He took our towels and came back a few minutes later to lead us to an area where he had set us up right next to each other.  From beginning to end this hotel treated us like we were the only guests staying here.  I cannot rave enough about how happy and satisfied I am with the level of service at this establishment.

We only stayed here one night, but it was the best night we had in Vegas, hands down. I got a deal on the room so I'm not used to a hotel of this calibur.

THE GOOD:
- Luxurious looking rooms.
- King sized bed was beyond comfortable.
- Completely sound proof.
- The curtains and blinds were controlled by remote. (I'm easily amused, sorry).
- Separate bath tub and shower. 
- Security preventing random people having access to the hotel floors.
- Countless food\/shopping choices on-site.
- Room service was wickedly fast\/precise.
- Customer service at the front desk was unbelievably friendly\/helpful. They allowed us to check in early free of charge.
- Held our luggage for free after check-out so we could ride the gondolas and walk around a bit before our next check-in.

THE BAD:
- They didn't tell us WiFi was included in the resort fee, so that was lost potential. 
- NO complimentary beverages. Not even water. (But the selection of in-room paid drinks was amazing - also the tap water was drinkable).
- Housekeeping woke us up at 8 am and 11 am even though we had late check out at 2 pm. That was honestly the worst thing, and it wasn't truly a big deal.

Pros, 

Always a great deal (suite price promotions or better yet, room comps) 

Rooms are well appointed and all rooms are suites. 

Larger than normal bathrooms, love love love that. 

One of the better hotel\/casinos on the strip. 

Lovely interior. 

Grand Canal Shops are in this hotel. 

Tao is here and is supposedly a hot spot. (haven't tried it personally) 

Staff are very nice and accommodating. 

When I've stayed here, the rooms always seem pretty clean (very important) 


Cons, 

Easy to get lost. (this place is huge) 

I know they have to cater to smokers but it's hard to tolerate the smoke. 

I consider this property to be more upscale but seeing the crowds after a night spent at Tao is well.... interesting, but hey.....""what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas",4,3,5

My wife could not get anyone to help her and my 5 year old with their luggage when they checked in (I was at CES and was not there to help them unfortunately). They had to drag all their luggage through the casino and up to the room. 

What was worse was the management team. When I checked in, I was required to wait in the hotel for 2 hours until my room was ready at 4:00. And then, when I asked for 1 of those hours back for a 1 hour later checkout, they kept telling me ""no"" Even when I threatened to never return or bring my business to the hotel (we had a group of 6 rooms), they became rude and did not service the request. When I checked out, I asked what was going on that so many people were coming into the city on a Sunday night after CES and the AVN was over. They had no answer, so I bet them $1000 that they did not have data to prove more people were coming in than leaving. The desk manager produced some data, but when I questioned it, he pulled the paper away and said I was misinterpreting the data and that he could not let me have it. I was willing to pay the man $1000 if he could prove it, but he became rude and pulled the paper from my hands.

You do get a few things for this higher price tag, notably: (a) a much larger room, which is nice to have but really not necessary when I'm spending 4 hours per day there, (b) the coolest indoor shopping center I've seen on the Strip and (c) Tao, an admittedly hot nightclub. On the other hand, the pools and restaurant selection are no better that the other big resorts, and the casino's tables all seem to sport higher limits (presumably given the larger wallets of those staying here).

It is simply perfect, from the rooms to the entire staff. You will never want to leave and we left only once or twice.

We decided what better way to celebrate our anniversary, than to bring our 10 year old grandson. We have been to the Venetian, but not with a child and I was concerned the hotel might not want kids. They do. I called and spoke to a wonderful man (I am so bad with names, Ciecel maybe) and asked him 10 different ways what the hotel really thought about having children there. We talked about the pools, the rooms, places he would enjoy eating and are you sure the hotel is child friendly. He convinced me it was and that our grandson would have a blast. He was right.

We checked in, and the woman taking care of us was so kind, I had my grandson standing next to me and she spent the time to look at various rooms and how far a walk it was to certain pools and certain areas. She pulled out a map and picked for us the most perfect room. It had a view of the pools, and the strip. It was magic.

The rooms are all suites and spotless. They just don't have a bad room and we have been many times. There is a place for everything and we had 3 televisions, a great desk for my lap top and the beds are so comfortable. 

I had no idea that our daughter had called ahead to tell them we were on a big anniversary. She was willing to pay for something extra to be in the room. What the hotel did was leave us, at no cost to our daughter, the most beautiful selection of strawberries dipped in chocolate and fresh fruit and a few cookies. I was in shock and our grandson was in heaven --hey kid, I think those are for the adults--he was so happy.

The Venetian has about 9 pools and kids are welcome in all but 2 of them, which I think is great. I love the idea that those that want peace and quiet can have wonderful pools without kids, leaving the families with kids many beautiful pools from which to choose. Our grandson tried them all and just did not want to leave the pool area ever. 

On one day the wind came up very fast and hard. I was alone with my grandson in the pool area and there were few people there. The wind was becoming really bad and I was a bit concerned--I do have some mobility issues. The pools all had to be closed for the day because of the wind. While I was trying to gather my things a kind young woman saw that I was having some issues and came to me to help. She got me wrapped in a towel, she helped me find my things, she stayed with me and my grandson who was attached to my leg. She helped me get to the doors to the hotel where my husband, who had looked out the window of the room and saw people moving, came out to try to find me. She was so sweet and I wish I recalled her name. The pools were reopened as soon as the winds died down enough to be safe.

Room service is great there and the food is the best, but it can be expensive if you have a child who wants room service everyday. The hotel has the best food court (it has more than one). My husband went to the food court and came back with great Johnny Rocket burgers, some Asia food and some cake. We put it all on a tray that was in the room and room service my grandson had. He loved it and so did we. We were able to relax from a long day of pool and fun.

The hotel is located on the Strip near everything you want to do. You can walk down the Strip to other hotels and eateries. We did this once and it was so much fun. The Mirage is right across the street and you can watch its volcano go off, or you can walk to White Castle for a snack or a great eatery. It is all within walking distance of the hotel. We also left to take our grandson to downtown to see the Fremont Street Experience. That was okay, but there is a lot of riff raft there, so we left.

We rarely left the hotel. They have the best restaurants and kids are welcome and I assume you all know that bringing a child to a high end restaurant means he or she needs to have proper manners. You also don't walk into some of the finer establishments dressed for a pool party. Bring a nice jacket with you and I suggest a tie.

The casino areas are the best. My husband had a great time and there is every game you can imagine. The hotel also has the best entertainment rooms. While we were there Steely Dan was playing in the main room. They were great, of course and the prices were the same as if you had gone to Ticketmaster, just without the insane fees.

Upon check out, the staff was helpful, our bags were waiting for us out front, check out was a breeze, we could have done it over the television, but I wanted to thank the staff.

The Venetian is simply the best hotel in Las Vegas. 

Have the best time. Remember, while on the strip or downtown, your wallet is in your front pocket and no, you don't want to attend a seminar or buy a Rolex.

Have fun.",4,0,0

I wasn't impressed with Tao and its murky, over-infested pool nor was I thrilled to walk through a mile long maze from my hotel room to the restaurant to get something to eat. It's a lot of money per night and I was disappointed.",1,1,0

DECO: 5 stars

Sometimes it's really easy to take for granted how much care is taken into constructing casinos. In a place like the Venetian, you can see the canals, the gondolas, the museum, the shops. Everything you expect in a luxurious hotel and casino in Las Vegas. But from expectation, we forget what those details can add up to. At the Venetian, they take care to build up on the details. You can find sprawling marble columns, well decorated floors, and frescoes on the ceiling. Even the melody of a single accordion player near the check in can ease the stress of long lines and road weariness.

CASINO: 3 stars

Because of the high quality production, it is very easy to forget that a casino is there to take your money, not to give it away. This casino definitely makes it easy to forget this simple point. But the more you linger at the casino, the more you start to realize how easy it is to lose your money. Like a hot model, you start giving qualities to this casino you assume it has because it's so shiny and pretty. But the Venetian is no different than any other casino. In fact, it might be worse because of how high the stakes are.

Yes, they have penny slots like every other casino, but it seems harder to cash out without playing higher stakes. In fact, only when you play do you realize how hard it is to win money without investing lots of money in each bet. So, unless you're baller, you got to be careful of what you choose to bet cause you're going to bet high.

ROOMS: N\/A

I haven't stayed here yet as a hotel guest. I'll update this part once I do.


CONCLUSION:

The Venetian knows what detail is and they make sure to show it, whether obviously or subtly. You get invested in how beautiful this place is, and you start seeing yourself staying here, being treated like a celebrity if you just spend a little more and get the comps. But that's the trap: the dream you desire is only created by the money you lose. That's a casino. As beautiful as the Venetian is, you need to remember they want your money, and they'll make you as comfortable as possible to take it. And boy, the Venetian is one shiny place to be.",1,1,1

The room was amazing with two king beds, then a seperate living room with a pull out bed. The bathroom has a separate room for the toilet, two sinks, a garden tub and a walk in shower. 
My only issue is that we were captive there for a conference and the prices of food were outragous. Normally not a problem because of per diem... However this was a conference for teachers and schools barely pay any per diem at all. Mine paid $50 a day but I heard of others being paid less. You can barely get a good dinner for that amount in this area of the strip.",0,0,0
