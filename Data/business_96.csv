Prior to that, he was the head chef at the world famous Masa's, in San Francisco.

Here in the Aria at City Center, the grandiose, massive and latest project of MGM Hotel Group, it adds a nice modern Euro feel to the ultra modern and art infused City Center complex, and adds a splash of mediterranean hot colors to the understated Japanese-like hotel color motif of the Aria hotel. It's like a saucy Flamenco dance hall in the middle of the hi-rise offices of corporate giants in the Shinegawa section of Tokyo. Or like the Guggenheim's museum in Bilbao, Spain amidst the rustbelt of the surrounding aging industrial factories that once were the heart of that city. 

It was later on a Thursday when we came, and it was fairly unoccupied. Sat at the bar and was professionally waited on with a lot of attention, owing to the sparse crowd. The room is large and very open; there are dozens upon dozens of bar seats, the ideal tapas location, strung along one side of the restaurant. The ambiance is a classy-festive feel and decor, but very pro in service. 

The specials were told, but they were all fairly heavy and hearty, and we were in a lighter mood, it being about 9:00pm. So we opted for 4 light dishes:

-Marinated Olive Medley ($3) about 5 different offerings including pearl onion
-White Ceviche ($10) This was light, with just a touch of onions and tomatoes, served with a wafer and garnished with cilantro and radicchio
- Escalivada ($8) - were roasted bell peppers and mushrooms in olive oil with a baguette toast slice
- Avocado Cannelloni ($10) this was a light cannelloni wrapped not in noodle, but thin avocado slices topped with chopped nuts, and sided with a dollop of guacamole topped with watercress and a side splash of aioli

With a Gin and Tonic, the bill was $43.24 before tip, and satisfaction came with the refreshing flavors with the creative and traditional dishes from Julian Serrano at Aria.",18,8,17

Service was solid but food took a long time. Had the melon salad dish, not bad. The mixed ceviche was my fav. The mixed ceviche piaia wasn't bad with lobster,  chicken and shrimp but didn't seem worth the 50 dollar ticket price. I would have rated this a 3 star spot but for this price I expected it to be better.  I doubt it will be better should I return. Firefly, Yonaka Japanese style or even, Hawaiian inspired 808 tapas was much better.",0,0,0

I don't recommend it and won't get it again.  And, baby eels look....exactly like you think they do.  I like how you order several dishes, they bring them as they are prepared, and you can then order again.  I think we had 3 or maybe 4 rounds of ordering.

Such a delicious soup!  Each time we go, in addition to the Fishermans soup, we try new tapas as well. This time we went with:
- Lobster fideua - fideo pasta topped w\/ half lobster tail.  Just OK
- baby Back ribs - nice honey BBQ sauce served with marble potatoes - Great dish
- beef tartare - Raw tenderloin - DELICIOUS!
- foie gras - Roasted apple & honey walnuts and foie gras.   Get it!

This is located in the Aria hotel downstairs and it's pretty easy to spot. The decor is very modern and trendy-- fake trees (looks like cherry blossom trees but no blossom), colorful striped wallpaper, and the walls are all made out of glass.

-  Imported Spanish ""Pata Negra"" ham (""the most delicious ham in the world""): slices of beautiful pata negra, served with toasted bread and garlic tomato sauce. WOW. Im glad I got to try this! Wayy better than any other cured meats i've tried! A bit pricey for 10 small slices but definitely worth it!

- Olives: The assortment of olives was a good choice! All super fresh and nice to nibble on while we enjoyed the other plates and drinks. 

- Cheese Platter: Cana de cabra (soft goat's milk), one year old manchego (sheep's milk), Cabrales (cow's milk), La Serena (soft sheep's milk), and some sweet pasty looking thing that tasted like dried figs. Served with toasted bread. Great selection of cheese for the platter-- there was a soft cheese, mild cheese, a more pungent cheese, and a dense cheese. The sweet fig paste paired nicely with the saltier cheeses

- Spanish Tortilla: Not your typical flat sheet of tortilla! This one is at least 2 inches thick, soft, and made out of potatoes, onions, and eggs. You can taste the soft chunks of potatos an egg-- very tasty and savory.

- Sauteed Foie Gras: I HAD to order foie gras since I wasn't in CA. A slice of foie with a sauce that tasted like balsamic vinaigrette, served on toast and chickpea mash. I wish the slice of foie was bigger, but all 2 bites were amazing! Super rich and creamy. 

- Santiago's cake: A slice of almond cake, turron ice cream. This wasn't as memorable as the other dishes but the cake was super moist and the ice cream paired well with the cake (turron is an ice cream made with almonds).

Nice place to grab some BOMB Spanish Tapas if you're staying at Aria\/Vdara!",2,0,0

They had a lot of tables at the bar empty but dirty.  My friends and I sat at a table that was dirty and waited a while before someone acknowledged us and came to clean the table.  I didn't get his name, but he was kinda rude when taking our order.  He is Hispanic and wears glasses.  Fortunately someone else brought out our food and he was super nice, an Asian young man.

Came to their happy hour and had the following:

Salmon with truffle- truffle bechamel with portobello mushroom= this dish was very tasty! I liked that their salmon didn't taste fishy.

Traditional Spanish chicken croquetas- chicken bechamel= I really enjoyed this crunchy goodness.

Pintxo de chorizos- pork chorizo and mashed potatoes= their chorizo was a bit spicy and sweet, i liked their mashed potatoes.

Albondigas- beef and pork meatballs in a tomato sherry sauce=. Omg I loved loved this one, reminded me of my moms albondigas.

Stuffed dates- medjol dates, goat cheese, pancetta, tomato marmalade= Although this has a lot of good reviews this was overly sweet for me and was more like a dessert.

Their sangria was delicious and strong.

The 3 stars are for the tasty tapas and even better prices since it was happy hour.  Minus 2 for service.",2,2,2

The ambience was alright for a big restaurant on the strip; it's not billing itself as fine dining, and the restaurant reflects exactly what it is--a place to get a quick bite before you head off and do other things.

The portions were HUGE for tapas. I guess that they've had too many tourists who don't know that tapas are meant to be small plates. I am not complaining, but I have just never seen such large portions at a tapas place. The patatas bravas were good, though I again found that they must have been bowing to an uneducated public by calling them by the Americanized ""brava potatoes."" I liked the pan tomate well enough. The dish that was a huge miss for me, however, was the vegetable paella. Not only was it just not good, but it actually tasted kind of meaty. When I asked the manager, he said that that was the saffron and that saffron just tastes meaty. I cook with saffron a lot, and that's just not true. Besides which, vegetarians don't like the taste of meat, so they really should have gone with a better flavor profile. Apart from the bites of the dish that tasted meaty, however, it was flavorless. Just not a good dish.

Still, I thought that the manager was respectful of my comments and listened to my concerns. I also saw him be particularly gracious with a crazy woman who seemed like she was just out for a free meal, so props to him on remaining courteous in a difficult situation.

Tapas restaurants are always frustrating to me because I can never seem to order the right amount of food and as a result always seem to leave hungry. To make matters worse, the food always seems to be pretty pricey so I'm not only hungry, but my wallet is significantly lighter to boot. This place is no different. The prices on some of the items border on exorbitant, which wouldn't be so upsetting to me given it's prime Strip location, except for the fact that I didn't leave full.

OK, enough about the prices. The tapas were very well prepared and came out in a timely manner. Definitely order the ahi tuna tempura and a couple of beef dishes. My strategy with tapas is always to mix vegetable dishes, meat dishes, and fish dishes and I always get some sort of cheese. Even with all that, my buddies and I were still hungry so we ordered paella to supplement. The paella takes 35-45 minutes to prepare so be ready to wait. I tasted both seafood and meat paella and really preferred the flavor of the meat. Something about the seafood didn't taste quite right to me, but, everybody I was with preferred the seafood so I think it was just me.

I understand this place is from a well known chef but myself and the 7 other people I went with thought the food was Shit. Rated anywhere between 12-20$ for ""tapas"" aka small portions for entree prices, the food was not worth the price at all. If I had to put on a price per plate, I would $7-10$ would be around the price they should be charging for the horrible food quality and bad tasting food combos. And thats being very very fair\/generous with pricing (real thoughts on price would be around 5-7$). I dont know how people eat here when it is not restaurant week or happy hour. The food is terrible and extremely overpriced. 
Heres what we had and our opinions on it- see pictures-
1) Yellow tail- a small piece of tuna X3- stuff with india Saif- a crunchy cracker topped with hella cilantro- kinda recommend 
2) Stuffed peppers- 2 red peppers stuff with goat cheese- menu states spicy but not spicy at all- Goat cheese was creamy and delicious- RECOMMEND
3) garlic shrimp- recommended- 5 little shrimp with garlic and butter- whats there not to like??
4) Tuna belly- kinda recommended- seared and served over what seemed like polenta- super bland and 2 cherry tomatoes- good but small porition
5) Spicy meatballs- SUPER SPICY- like the only thing you can taste is the pepper hot spicy taste with a hint of lamb at the end but as you bite into it all you taste is gamey meat and you mouth on fire. NOT RECOMMENDED
6) open faced empanada- oily and salt- bread on outside was mushy- not recommended
7) Chorizo with mashed potato- RECOMMENDED- Sweet sauage\/chorizo on a stick with bland lumps of mashed potatos- best thing we ordered
8) Baby back ribs- behind the Croquettes- 2nd worst thing- NOT RECOMMENDED- Who puts teriaki sauce on ribs??? 3 little ribs were drenched in sweet bad tasting teri sauce with these 5 little fingerling potatoes which added no flavor. Ribs were gamey and meat was tender but unappetizing with all that sauce. We had so much left over and our friends didnt enjoy it either, we left them uneaten.  
9) Croquettes- as someone else put it, the worst thing to get. Mushy and Idk what the hell was in the inside. NOT RECOMMENDED
10) Salmon- nothing special- a little square of salmon- dont remmeber any feeling when eating it- not recommended 
11) sangria- Red- Super sweet- didnt seem like there was any alcohol in it

AFter trying a lot of dishes- I would never come here again. The food as stated before was terrible. The only thing I would maybe eat again is the chorizo with mashed potatoes but I would never pay 16$ for it. I will just stay home and make it myself. 
I wish I could give this more stars but when 8 people total agree this place has bad food, I can not lie about our experience. 
Sad thing though cause our waiter was really nice and prompt,",8,2,2

The more people you go with the better it is as you can order varieties of tapas to try over a course of time with some Sangria and finish the meal off with one of the best Paella you will ever have. Please keep in mind that the Paella takes anywhere from 45-60min so please make sure its the first thing you order. I always go with the Mixed Paella which is my personal favorite with everything from seafood to Chicken and Spanish Chorizo in it. The minimum order is two but might be a bit much for two if you have some tapas. The staff will tell you exactly how much you will need to order according to your number of parties and amount of tapas you order.

For those who've traveled to Spain, ""tapas-style"" dining in the US is frustrating because something gets lost in translation with the taste and presentation. Not to mention that it's more expensive here.

Julian Serrano is not for the budget conscious. It is a celebrity-chef restaurant in a glitzy Vegas casino.
But, the food is good, authentic, and has several options for all palates. I've been to Jaleo (Jose Andres' restaurant in DC), and this is on par.

Had the Paella Valenciana and a couple of tapas: Croquetas de pollo and pimientos de pardon. Peppers were hotter than what you'd normally get and the croquettes were delightful. Paella was on point as well: from the rice to the saffron, on down to the pan.

Pan Manchego: bread, tomato and cheese can be so simple. I think there's something about the fresh ingredients which make this so tasty.

Yellowtail Tiradito: this was kind of surprising because I've never had such fine shredded filo dough before. The consistency of it reminds me of fried rice vermicelli or even like shredded wheat cereal. I had my hesitation before taking a bite, but it works well. Tuna was really fresh.

I didn't have a bite of this but the guys shared a Cuban sandwich. They liked it so much that they wanted to get a second order but held off. 

Service was exactly what we wanted. We were there just to pass some time and our server gave us just the right amount of attention without hovering over us. We also appreciate that they seated us near the TVs because of March Madness.",2,1,1

We love paella! We go to San Diego's Paella Festival every year and always get paella if it is on the menu. The Mixta Paella was absolutely delish! We were able to finish it between the two of us. It was the perfect flavor with the perfect balance of rice and seafood.

The tapas were a-ok and I think I would be back just for the paella and possibly try different tapas.

The sangria was not very good but I think that's just my personal opinion.

To drink, I had the Manzana Delizioso and it was so delicious!  Not too sweet, fresh apple taste.

To eat, we had:

Mixed Seafood Ceviche: really good.  Seafood was fresh and the flavors were excellent.
Meat and Cheese: piece of perfectly cooked medium rare soft tenderloin and a slice of brie cheese atop a slice of baguette.  Delish!
Mushroom Risotto:  cooked al dente.  This was good but it didn't blow me out of the water.
Fried Calamari: calamari could have been bigger.  I felt like I was mostly eating fried batter.  The roasted pepper sauce was good but not great.
Bacon Wrapped Dates: I've had this dish tons of times before and I sometimes even make it at home but this wasn't very good here.  I think it was mainly because it was fried.  I had never had this dish fried but I didn't think it added anything to it.  As the matter of fact, the fried aspect brought this dish down.
Crispy Pancetta:  pork belly with molecular mozzarella with a shot glass of pea puree.  I wasn't impressed by this dish at all.  I didn't get the whole molecular mozzarella especially because I didn't think it added much to the dish.  You can barely taste it.  The pea puree?  Eh, it wasn't great either.  I just didn't think the components of this dish came together well.
Black Rice: undercooked.  The seafood in it was good but the rice was hard.  Wouldn't order this again.
Brava Potatoes:  cubes of cooked potato with some type of sauce on it.  Underwhelming.

I give this place 3 stars because it's ok but not great but I would still go back for a pre-partying dinner.  It's nice because you can get a bunch of dishes and share and not get too stuffed.  Oh yeah, and I really appreciated their great service! :)",1,0,0

-avocado cannelloni: no salmon.. didn't the description say salmon? just a really salty seaweed salad stuffed inside avocado slices
-charcuterie: too much olive oil on top to make it super greasy and wasn't too tasty either
-albondigas: best dish out of everything.. there were about 5-6 small meatballs
-mixed paella: undercooked and wasn't that good.. my friend said nothing compares the paella in barcelona..
-santiago cake:almond cake with ice cream.. cake was dense but with a scoop a bit of ice cream with each bite and it was ok..

Seafood paella - meant for sharing! They make a certain amount depending on the number of people in your party. We had a huge plate. It tasted alright. Very flavorful but nothing too amazing. 
 
Duck confit - love the presentation. The duck itself was a little dry, not too fond of the citrusy flavor. Not my fav. 

Seared scallop - my favorite of the night. Packed full of flavor and was seared perfectly. 

Oxtail - my friend said it tasted like a Cinnabon..in a good way. I'm not sure about that.. But it was delicious. Had a hoisin flavor too it, and was wrapped in a pastry. The meat was soft. 

Mushroom risotto - tasty and flavorful. No complaints here. Probably my second favorite. 

white ceviche - fish was fresh. Thought it was interesting how they used taro chips instead of the usual. Yum.

Service was friendly and efficient.
Sangria was decent, but the real star is the great food. In general, I liked the traditional tapas more than the new tapas.
We particularly liked:
Stuffed peppers with goat cheese: Ok this is the real reason we came back again. A must try. Just perfect.
Chicken croquetas: These were excellent. Crispy on the outside and creamy inside. Melts in your mouth delicious. 
Dates with almond: Good stuff. Comes with bacon and spicy sauce. But really everything with dates is good.
Tuna Tiradito-smooth like butter
Octopus: Nice texture and flavoring. Large portion for tapas.
Wrinkled potatoes: Simple, but addictive with great spicy pepper sauce.
Beef with brie: Good, but not the best thing on menu. 
Garlic shrimp: Comes to the table sizzling. Very good, but I've been spoiled by some places in NY.
Avocado and salmon ""new"" tapas: nice texture and presentation.
Lobster\/pineapple skewer: Surprisingly good combo.
Ahi Tuna\/raspberry skewer: I like this, but the beautiful raspberries overpower the tuna.

At about $11 on average for a plate, you can definitely get a quality meal here that won't hurt your wallet as much as many other strip joints.  And the quality here is great.  

We came during restaurant week so there was a set menu to try off of, but we ended up ordering 6 different dishes to try as many as possible.  We had yellowtail, meatballs, chorizo, salmon, mushrooms, and croquettes.  The chorizo was flavorful, but I didn't think the presentation, toothpicked in mashed potatoes, was very appropriate for the restaurant.  The mushrooms were quite nice a good addition to our meat heavy tapas meal.  The meatballs were average I think, but all seafood dishes had some very high quality presentation and freshness to them.  Finally, the croquettes are a must try and truly authentic.  Especially for the croquettes, each dish had a different sauce used for dipping, but all were so fresh and so tasty that I would to bottle at least a few of them for home use.

Chicken croquettes were a bit too soft inside, lacking a bit of texture I like more shredded chicken, not from the blender.

You cannot leave without ordering the vino tinto sangria! With apples and a hint of cinnamon, this was to die for! And the almond flan was out of this world good!

That waiter NEVER came back to see if we wanted drinks or anything else from the menu.  I had to flag his sorry ass down to order a beer.  They ran out of the one I wanted to try, and he said there was one not on the menu, he hesitated because it's ""strong.""  It was not.  He must be used to drinking piss water.  But it wasn't that.  He saw an Asian woman and applied his ignorant stereotypes.
That dip shit appeared to provide service to the few other occupied tables around us, but not us.
When the paella arrived, I took a picture.  After that, there was a very marked difference in that waiter's attitude.  All of a sudden, he became friendly.  Well what do you know about that.

He never took the menus from our table.  And some other guy came to take the other two place settings from the four top we sat, right in the middle of our meal.
A waitress, she was Asian, who had started her shift as we began our meal, came over right away and removed the menus.

The flavors of the paella were good. There was no crust to speak of, though.  Also, one of the handful of mussels in it had a broken shell.  So.  The kitchen sees this broken shell on a shellfish, and decides to just send it out as is.  Wth.  You're not supposed to do that, especially not for a $50 dish.

What a joke of a restaurant.  Except for that waitress, the only person in there who knew what she was doing. The hostess was great too.",1,3,1

The food: I ordered the octopus tapas which has me a lil confused as to what the goal was for this dish. Pieces of octopus were served over potato beds and seemed to be too over seasoned. The oxtail tapas were good, but again, a little too confusing for my taste buds. However, the dessert was just a bit of heaven!!!

First off, I love tapas and everything affiliated with tapas.  So this place had a running head start and advantage as most places go.  But when the two different types of croquettes we ordered were both mushy, and the potatoes brava was also overcooked, I started to wonder where we had come to dinner.... certainly a place for old folks who had no teeth?  Nothing with some texture, much less crunch.  Mush upon mush.  Thank goodness I ordered the osso buco because that was actually really good.  But what was that out of 4 different tapas?  The biggest disappointment of the night?  We ordered a double portion of the mixed seafood paella.  And honestly I was not trying to stay on the negative hype because as i said, I enjoyed the osso buco... but the paella rice was hard.  Now mind you... I can handle al dente.. and thats what my cousin tried to tell me... but seriously what I scooped out was hard rice, not cooked properly.  Others told me theirs was ok so I thought I was insane UNTIL others took a scoop of paella from a different area and they too came across the hard uncooked rice.  For as long as the paella took and for the lackadaisical service where I sat staring at empty plates that weren't removed I have to give this place 3 starts... BARELY.  They only got the extra nudge because of the osso buco.  Desserts were good, but no matter how much I enjoyed dessert, it couldn't erase the huge disappointment of undercooked paella rice and overcooked mushy croquettes.

My friends and I were so excited to come to Julian Serrano's restaurant. We are such foodies and love exploring all famous\/celebrity chefs restaurants. We heard great things about this place.

We had reservations for dinner, came on time, and there was a line outside the entrance. We asked the couple in front of us, whether they had a reservation or not, they said yes, so we assume waiting for 15 minutes. Slowly, we were in front of the line and apparently the people with reservation were suppose to walk to the front and to the host's desk. We were displeased, so were all the people, who were in line with reservations. There should had been two separate lines or some signs showing people where to go. 

No problem. We got seated and looked around at the decor. There were a contradicting color scheme: red, orange, yellow, and pink bright colors, but there were dried brown, leafless trees, and some brown accents walls throughout the place. Festive or lifeless? Hmmmm....?

Service was slow and out straight rude....our two waiter: Michael and Juan weren't nice. Took forever to take our order and when we asked for recommendations, this is what Juan said, ""I would recommend everything, but these are....."", I only ordered two of his recommendations out of 5. He said, ""That's IT?!"" and walked away. Michael was the person, who refilled the water for all the other tables, and never refilled ours.

Here's what we got: 

Fried Calamari - it was delicious, fried to perfection, and good sauce. 

White Ceviche - it was good, but the acidity was too overbearing that it made the delicate fish bitter. The fish seems to be pre-made and soaking in the sauce for too long. 

Queso Fresco - One of the best dish here! It was so tasty and creamy, fresh and lite! Loved this dish to no end, I can eat at least three of these plates.

Beef and Cheese - Disgusting to me. Meat was overcooked and tough. The sweet element didn't compliment the meat or cheese. Hated it.

Pork Taco - Thick fried and dried piece of bacon (YUCK! and I love BACON!). The taco itself was a stroke of genius though, it was light and crispy; very good vehicle for the taco, if the ingredient inside was tastier.

Overall, I think there were some good food. Too expensive for the quantity and quality of food. Bad and inattentive service, without a care for customers. Will not return or recommend it.",1,0,0

I came recently with a date and was immediately struck by the open atmosphere.  It is simple and modern - almost like a fine cafeteria - but it works.  It doesn't feel too stuffy for its price or its setting, and yet due to the decor and the staff it still feels like it has a touch of class.

We ordered several things off the menu, with a few winning and few losing.  The lobster gazpacho was... a bowl of cold soup.  It was started with a tapioca capsule of soup on your spoon, and the overall taste was light and refreshing with a hint of cucumber.  But at the end of the day it was still cold soup.  If you're into it - you'll probably dig it.  I was not.

The winner was the creamy mushroom risotto.  Absolute simple brilliance.  It was just delicious.  I can't and won't say too much more other than it is definitely worth an order.

I love tapas places because you can order a bunch of things and come away with a decent tasting for a decent price.  Julian Serrano essentially delivers this, with a place a few steps up on the price rung than the rest.  It was too expensive, about $35 a head without drinks.  But it was enough to make you wonder whether all of those orders you'd happily picked out were worth the price after they were finished.

Most tapas dishes ranged in the prices between $10-18. And the dishes were pretty small too. The goat cheese stuffed dates, really yummy but $12.50 for three pieces. The braised short rib, one rib for $16. 

And the desserts were alright. At $8 a dish I was expecting heaven in mouth. The desserts were definitely unique - pistachio tart, almond cake with almond ice cream. But it didn't have that ""you're totally worth paying for"" quality.

We took clients to lunch.  1\/3 way through my lobster salad, a lady bug crawled out from beneath the greens.  ugh.  We sent it back.

I wasn't really impressed with the other dishes.  They weren't bad, just not memorable.

I was a bit surprised the manager didn't come by the table to apologize, and perhaps offer desert or something ... no one acknowledged the bug.  Yes, it was *only* a ladybug, but still ...  Even worse, they didn't remove the item from the bill.

Since it was a client lunch I didn't want to make an issue of it.  But, for the $ I would have expected better service.

I will give huge props to the general manager.  After reading my survey feedback on my experience, he promptly contacted me (on a weekend, no less).  He was very nice and they did adjust the bill quite a bit more than just removing the salad.  5 stars for him and his attempt to make it right.

Without the bug incident, I still would just give the place 2.5 stars.  Not really worth the cost.

We did the lunch menu for $30.12

 Lobster Gazpacho; Traditional Chilled Spanish Soup with Lobster Meat- There was a sphere in my spoon and it was a cream ""truffle"" with some broth in it. The texture of it bursting with broth was texturally exciting. The soup itself was very refreshing and bright, good and very fresh chunks of lobster.

Salmon with Truffle; Truffle B√©chamel, Portobello Mushroom - the salmon was perfectly cooked, the bechamel was aces. Salmon is a very common fish so normally I'm a bit ""meh"" about most preparations but this was pleasant. 

Santiago's Cake; Almond Cake, Turr√≥n Ice Cream, Candied almonds - I am a almond freak and this was a decent cake. I wish there was more of the burnt leche tasting turron ice cream. The crumb candied almonds mixed in with it was good. 

I of course try everything Angie is eating and all pretty good. Stuffed Piquillo had a surprising hearty flavor from the mushrooms, steak with eggplant and mushroom demi glace was tender, churros was ok, but its rich bitter dark chocolate dip was great.

Ahi Tempura - Fantastic! Perfectly red Ahi tuna with a very light tempura breading, just enough to give it a bit of a crunch. The avocado puree under the tuna, combined with the seaweed salad was amazing. 5 \/ 5

Padron Peppers - Never had these before, and they were incredible. Crispy, light, and reminded me of eating green pepper flavored string potatoes. Not spicy at all as I originally expected but still excellent. I could eat plates and plates of these. 5 \/ 5

Iberian Sliders - More like a two bite burger. Flavorful and salty because of the ham. Up until this arrived all we had were basically appetizers so this dish gave our meal some ""weight"". 4 \/ 5

Creamy Mushroom Risotto - Very good, risotto had a bit of crunch to it. Manchego cheese added saltiness to it. About as good as risotto I've had elsewhere. Next time I'll try something different instead of getting this again. 3 \/ 5

I'm a vegetarian, so I ordered off of the vegetarian section, which has a good (and good-looking) selection.

The mushroom risotto is probably the primary reason for the 5-star rating I'm giving this place, because it was fantastic and one of the more memorably delicious things I had while in Vegas (and my group travelled here with the intent of eating lots of tasty food while seeing a couple of shows, because we're not really the gambling or clubbing crowd). I could probably down a giant bowl of that stuff and want more :) The intensity of the wild mushroom flavor is amazing, and is something I may have to try to learn to replicate at home (even if I've never made risotto before, ha). The stuffed piquillo pepper was also deliciously creamy, and had I not had another meal, I think I would have ordered seconds of both dishes. Maybe thirds, even! I also had their non-alcoholic sangria, which was decent and I really appreciated that it was on the menu for those that can't or choose not to drink alcohol. My friends ordered from the seafood and meats sections (plus a chocolate cake or brownie-looking dessert), and seemed pleased with their items as well.

The bartender, Jeff, was also really personable and friendly. It was fun that he told me what he was putting in the sangria as he was doing so, which is helpful if I want to try and recreate a similar drink at home (although it had a lot of ingredients that I certainly don't normally have on hand). He admitted easily to not knowing which of the vegetarian items had egg in them off the top of his head (I have an egg allergy), and then happily fished out the allergen menu\/printout from behind the counter and handed it to me so I could look it over myself, which is something I wish more restaurants could (or chose to) do. They actually have a section of the tapas marked out as vegan, so it sounds like they'd accommodate a vegan here just fine, as well :)

Overall, it's a nice little restaurant with some really intensely flavored and delicious tapas, and I would absolutely be down for coming back if I ever travel to Vegas again :) (And I will probably order a big bowl of the wild mushroom risotto, yum!)",0,0,0

We were going to stop by the City Center restaurants to view their menus for dinner reservations. I called in advance to find out about parking and such, as this area is known for lousy parking. The newspaper has complained about the limited local parking. I called the concierge and she told me for locals, to use the NORTH VALET off HARMON. She said it avoids the tourists and all the hectic business of people trying to figure out the front of the City Center complex. She said if you want to park, try the second floor of the self park as all of the tourists fight for the first floor. The NORTH VALET PARKING IS COMPLEMENTARY. In any sense, going back to the food, I asked the concierge for a recommendation and that I was bringing along my 8 year old son. She recommended a place called Julian Serrano. She said where else could you get a great sandwich for $10 and for the kids, you can order off the tapas menu for some deep fried chicken.  I asked for her recommendation for Todd English's pub and she said to stick with Julian Serrano for lunch.  

Great recommendation. 
We each ordered a sandwich. I had the chorizo, the other two were the mixed sandwich and the vegetarian. The Chorizo ciabatta sandwich was good, with not spicy, but evenly balanced against the goat cheese spread. My mother said the vegetarian ciabatta was eggplant, mushroom & pesto, with the mushroom overpowering the rest of the ingredients.  She really liked the ciabatta bread.  My father had the mixed and I took a picture of it. He said it was good. It had a fried egg with Serrano ham and cheese on plain bread, and they cut a hole out of the bread to showcase the fried egg. The best part of the sandwich combo is the fries that accompany it. My son had the SPANISH CHICKEN CROQUETTAs, (great photos from others already posted.) He loved them as did he enjoy my french fries which came with my sandwich. The FRENCH FRIES were skinny, twice fried potatoes. They were the best. We also had an AVOCADO CANNELLONI from the tapas menu. It was thinly shaved avocado wrapping a lightly vinegar-ed salad of Japanese seaweed, sesame, and smoked salmon. The seaweed salad overpowered the avocado, but it was something that I could say ""I CAN'T MAKE THIS AT HOME"" because of the delicateness of the consistently sliced ripe avocado the rolled and wrapped the seaweed salad.  Other yelp fans have posted this picture.  It's a beautiful presentation that lacks any taste outside of vinegar & seaweed.

All in all, the concierge's recommendations for lunch were SPOT ON! Where else can you get a gourmet sandwich and fries for $10. My son's chicken was like $9 from the tapas menu. I was going to order some sherry, but the wine prices were outrageous, so we had water which seemed (table to table) like the most common lunch drink served. 

My recommendations: They have 6 or 7 sandwiches to choose from for lunch, all for $10. The food is top grade and the service is very very good.  Final bill was less than $20 a head for lunch in Las Vegas at a clean, spot on, sit down restaurant on THE STRIP without any sort of buffet or keno being pulled around you.",3,0,1

First off sheik and cool space. Very inviting. Part of the very modern and edgy hotel build out.  

Tapas can be an adventure so choose carefully.  But if you are feeling less daring you can always go for the paellas.  

Started with the lobster gazpacho.  Quite good and a touch of coconut butter was a surprising add to a traditional spanish soup,

Veered off into the grilled anges flat iron steak.  It tempted me because of the Japanese eggplant.  Good choice but it looked more flavorful then it was. 

Rounded out with the chicken croquetas. A nice and rich traditional tapas dish comprised of chicken and b√©chamel. 

It's Vegas baby and food here is good on the high end.  This is my second trip to julian serrano and I'd say it is a pretty decent adventure into spanish tapas but hardly knock your socks off. 

Cool space--interesting menu  and despite some blandness in flavors--give it a go for something different a cool setting.   

Price point is on the  high side so be prepared.

A la scott gives this one three stars.",0,0,0

I came here with a friend for dinner, and we wanted to eat, but not stuff ourselves, and have a nice mix of flavors, but he was also on a low-carb diet.  It provided some great options for us.

The egg yolk ravioli were a lovely texture, creamy and crisp at the same time. Unctuous in the best possible way.  Really, these were for me, not the low carb person. The sauteed padron peppers were wonderful.  Mild with a little snap to the skin, and great salt on them. From the world of seafood, we got the gambas, the white ceviche, and the white anchovy filets.  The white anchovy was my favorite of these...if you haven't had Spanish anchovies, you should try them at least once... this isn't the over salted fish, but a rich, creamy flavor, with a touch of pickle.

The lamb chop was good, but I think the favorite of the night was the black pig pintxo.  That was a thin slice of heaven, and I'd have that again, despite the price.

We had:

- honeydew ham:
I wish there was more prosciutto (jambon \/ ham) because the honeydew was in abundance and definitely sweet (the waiter revealed the sweetness is balanced with syrup injections)

- lobster tail salad 
Definitely the best dish of all, with perfectly pouched lobster tail and subtle dressing on a crispy bruschetta.

- shrimp ceviche 
The zestiness and heat were perfect and the shrimp was perfectly fresh.

- octopus a la Gallega
Octopus texture was incredible: not at all chewy. I wish the paprika was used more sparingly because it covered up the fish flavor. 

- yellowtail tiradito 
Yum! Fresh and creative. 

And for dessert: 
- Crema Catalana

- Almond cake

Usually the small dishes come at a high cost since most folks tend to order more dishes to feel ""full"".  Julian Serrano isn't the place to go for cheap(er) dishes, but it's certainly on top of the list for flavors.  -1 star for the prices though, especially with Jaleo right next door.

A few of us from work came here during a busy convention week.  Tables were hard to come by, but we somehow scored one right in the middle of the dining room at 8p during rush hour.  

Ordered a couple bottles of Rioja, two paellas to fill up on (they take a while to make), and a ton of small dishes to go with the wine.  There are plenty of different dishes for all different types of eaters - cured meats, cooked meats, veggie dishes galore, and a good mix of seafood.  

Few dishes stand out in my mind:

-Rabo De Toro - can't really go wrong with Iberico pork, unless they overcook it into jerky.  Not the case here.  Tender oxtail mixed in with chewy iberico pork, served on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes.  
-Cured serrano ham - the garlic tomato sauce stands out here.  Slightly pungent but not overpowering garlic flavors on the acidic tomato base makes a great companion to the salty cured meat slices.  We ordered another one not too long after we polished this one.  Pairs really well with Riojas wine.  
-Creamy mushroom risoto - what?  Risoto at a spanish restaurant?  Take my word for you, you want some.  Something about that aged manchego cheese...I'm salivating just thinking about it.  
-Japenese eggplant - never had it before.  The texture is more spongy than your average eggplant and flavors are more mild.  Still, very tasty veggie!
-Brava potatoes - slightly spicy french fry in cube form.  Awesome!
-Pintxo De Chorizos - little chorizo skewers.  Same mashed potato as the rabo dish, so I was a little disappointed there.  But the sausages themselves were really flavorful.  Spicy and savory all at once, every bite.  
-Mixed paella \/ Marinera paella - we ordered two as we weren't sure how big the servings were (menu says 'for 2').  But, they came out to be fairly decent sized.  Each paella dish probably enough to feed 3 or 4 (depending on how much carbs you want for the night).  Still, both were outstanding - though my only gripe with these is that I didn't get a whole lot of saffron flavors in the rice.  Maybe it's more traditional that way...but I like heavier saffron flavors in paella.

The restaurant itself isn't that big, there's also bar seating for those who want faster access to beverages.  Design of the place is modern, very open, and everyone sits kind of close to each other.  Service was great - even though the server was running around like crazy on this busy night, our glasses never went empty, and there was always food or bread on the table for us to munch on.

Came here for Christmas dinner with the family and ordered a variety of things. I was expecting this place to have more of their servers be more professional and polished since this restaurant seemed highly rated. From the food being served lukewarm, the server not really having recommendations, the dishes not being timed out properly (it's a tapas place, they should know better)...and the list goes on. 

seafood paella- crispy rice mixed with tiny pieces of seafood and fatty dark meat chicken pieces. Shrimp had no flavor to it, because it was probably just boiled. The lobster also seemed a little overcooked and the mussels were definitely over done. I wanted to try the paella for myself since I've been reading mixed reviews, but unfortunately I should have listened to the majority and not gone with the paella.

stuffed piquillo peppers- these were good. Nice plump piquillo peppers stuffed with a goat cheese mixture and served lukewarm in some tomato sauce. 

Grilled Japanese eggplant- a well toasted egg plant with a nice savory taste to it. 

Mediterranean chicken skewer- these fatty pieces of chicken were not my favorite. I loved the apricot mixed in this dish, but the quality of this fatty chicken was terrible.

Stuffed dates- nothing special about the stuffed dates. Plain and simple stuffed dates

shrimp empanadas- fried ball of shrimp pieces

gambas- I don't understand why they don't try grilling their shrimps to get more flavor. The shrimp is lacking flavor. 

Grilled rib eye- it was a chewy piece of meat. The sauce was a little salty for my palate. 

almond cake- nothing special again.

*fresh calamari a la plancha - the citrusy, salty evoo pairs well with the sweetness of the caramelized onions

*albondigas - tender, flavorful pork\/beef meatballs with a light tomato sauce. eat this with a spoon

*beef and cheese - another nice sweet\/salty combo. the honey really kicks this dish up a notch

It's in Aria - which I will review under separate cover.  Wow...is all I have to say.

Atmosphere - It's very open and attractive.  The only drawback are these weird black trees without leaves.  Maybe I'm missing the artistic creation of them, but I felt like they were out of place.  There were mounds of fresh veggies on the backsplash - which was really refreshing to see.  Some time was really spent on the floors here.  Tiny tiles in a variety of colors...yellows, oranges, pinks, purples, pearly white.  And it had a pattern to it that was really intricate.  Bonus points for design.  

I am a big fan of smaller tables and more intimate seating when going on a date.  Here, the tables are a bit larger, but they have to be because it is tapas style and you have tons of plates coming out, and then wine glasses...you get the drift.  

Purple napkins.  Stellar.  

Our sommelier came over and we mistakenly thought him as the waiter.  Oops.  He wasn't phased though so based off what we ordered he suggested a wine.  A half bottle in case we didn't like it.  What we didn't know, and d-bag sommelier didn't tell us, is the wine was 990 for a half bottle!!  I'm sorry, but if you expect your patrons to have 990 for a half bottle of wine without running it by them, I find it offensive.  Whether or not we could afford it, is really none of his biz, he should have been more polite to just give us the low down on that.  Fortunately for him the half bottle was amazing (it should be for almost a grand!).  Point of the story, for all those who cannot afford a grand on wine - BE SURE TO CHECK PRICE POINT when sommelier suggests a wine.  A professional one should let you know (discretely if you don't want to offend your date) and I just found that a little obnoxious.  I didn't know until the bill came, and neither did my beau...which was a bit shocking.

Anyway...have the bacon wrapped dates.  Salty, sweet, savory goodness.  Chewy without too much chewy.  I almost died.

I even tried the lobster with pinneapple.  Pretty good, and I'm not a seafood fan AT ALL.  This was something someone would like if they don't really appreciate seafood.

We also had the beet salad with what I though was lychee.  I said ""this tastes like Hawaii in my mouth"" and the waitress came over and explained it was pineapple gelatin.  Kudos for my palate being expanded.

Stuffed peppers and gosh I don't even know what to tell you because everything was soooo delightful.  It was romantic because we were both feeding each other, and so filling at the same time.  We had about 6 plates and everything was perfectly paced, our wine was superb (we had two half bottles, the second was of something different).  Fortunately the waiter showed my date the price for the second bottle.

The pan manchego...it's like that saying ""once you go manchego, you never go back"".  Crazy good.

We had churros for dessert that comes with some chocolate sauce for dipping.  The chocolate sauce had a hint of some kind of hot pepper (which was a little bit too much for me) but it was good in small quantity.  This is the best churro I have had in my life.  I was soooo full but kept eating it.  We also ordered the creme brule (because I love creme brule)...I wasn't so much a fan.  It was too eggy and not enough sugary.  The consistency was off for me.  Plus it was HUGE!  I like smaller versions of creme brule since it is sooo heavy.  Still, pretty fantastic.  I just wasn't a fan of the consistency.

It truly was an amazing experience.  Every time we put something in our mouths we just giggled and had our eyes roll back in our head how fantastic it truly was.  It blew my mind.  It blew Joe's mind and his wallet...I don't think he minded too much because it was TRULY that good.

I had to amend and give it four stars because of our sommelier.  If he didn't just ASSUME we (I am putting the Royal we in that sentence) could afford a $1,000 bottle of wine, I would be giving this place more stars.",0,0,0

The service was great, there were so many waiters, busboys, managers to ask if you were OK \/ having a good time. The food is really similar to the ones at Bazaar \/ Saam at the SLS Hotel. Very yummy and innovative.  My favorite was the mushroom risotto - next time I'm going to share this dish, I want one of my own! I think 3 tapa dishes \/ person is perfect if you are not too hungry.

Recently had a ladies weekend in Vegas and a friend made reservations at this amazing restaurant in the Aria. We were all starving after a day at the spa and begged the waiter to bring plates out as they were ready. They were bringing plates out in what felt like seconds. And everything was amazing, but the highlights for me were the coca vegetarian, the stuffed piquillo peppers, and the churros. (Good number of items for vegetarians, by the way.)

The food was fine, but there were few standouts. We sampled a lot, including the Lobster Salad, Ensalada Mixta, Creamy Rissoto, Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, Brava Potatoes, Pan de Hongo, Grilled Ribeye Steak, and beverages. Of the tapas, our favorite was the Pan de Hongo, but it's hard to screw up bread, mushrooms, and cheese. I liked the Brava Potatoes, but others thought it was heavy on the sauce. Everything else was fine, at the appropriate temperature, and served as stated on the menu. Again, adequate, but nothing that totally wowed us or justified the price.

For the most part, the wait staff was polite and attentive, and understanding when the other 2 in our party arrived later than the time on our reservation. The restaurant was clean. The huge seats at the tables in the back were comfortable. No major complaints about the service or facility. However, there was one weird thing that happened.

Strangely, when the boyfriend ordered the Lobster Salad and asked for it with no corn, he was told they couldn't do it because it was ""pre-made like that."" Thinking it was mixed in with the other ingredients we accepted it and ordered the salad ""as is."" However, when it arrived, the corn was plainly sprinkled on top of the salad. So, either the chef and staff were unwillingly to make a simple accommodation for a diner, or everything is pre-made and plated in advance and just pulled from a refrigerator. Either way, I'd expect more from a ""classy"" restaurant in a ""hip"" casino. 

My boyfriend and I agree that though everything was ""okay,"" the restaurant suffered from a major case of ""trying too hard."" We likely won't be back.",1,0,0

Oh. My. Gosh. This place is amazing.

We arrived for our reservation at 9 and were promptly greeted and seated in the beautiful dining room. The lighting was perfect, and it felt open and airy yet cozy and comfortable. And the chairs were so comfortable - I could have stayed there all night.

Anyway. Onto the food. I'm a huge fan of tapas in general. I think it's so nice to be able to order several small plates and have a taste of them all. It feels relaxed and comfortable to share food with friends and family and get to ooh and ahh over the same stuff. Plus, there's no awkward lingering jealousy when someone gets a perfectly cooked steak and you just ordered overcooked chicken. Not that anything was overcooked at Julian Serrano. Quite the contrary. Everything was cooked to perfection.

Here's what we had - complete with letter grades:

Seared Scallops and Romesco Sauce: A+
The scallops were to die for. Melted in my mouth. They were naturally sweet and paired brilliantly with the romesco sauce. Probably the best scallops I've had - and I eat a lot of scallops. I can never turn down scallops.

Pork Belly, Petit Pois Puree and Molecular Mozzarella: A
Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. The cold pea soup offered nice contrast. (I hate saying things like that.)

Duck Leg, Orange Sauce and Fresh Orange: A
I sound like a broken record, but perfectly cooked and seasoned. Delicious.

Wild Mushroom Risotto, Manchego Cheese and Natural Jus A-
Creamy and flavorful. I scraped the plate shamelessly.

Mini Spanish Pork Chorizos, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Garlic Sauce: B+
These were great and had they not been served on the same table as the pork, duck and scallops I'd probably remember them more clearly. 

I think we also had black rice, but I didn't care for it too much (FYI - it was my dad's favorite, so don't not order it on my account!)

I also had the sangria - they add brandy to theirs so it has a great depth to it. I'm no sangria expert, but I'd order theirs anytime.",0,0,0

There's a lot to choose from on the large menu, from traditional tapas to more fusiony dishes. Vegetarians and vegans have some good options as well.

The good: fried seems the way to go here. Fried crispy gambas (shrimp) each on a skewer with a pepper was a standout dish. Also enjoyed the empanada and croquetas. The sauce for the brava potatoes was delicious, but the potatoes were too soft. 

The not-so-good: Tortilla was a huge disappointment. I love this dish in Spain, but for $10, all you get here is a tiny piece of bland omelet. Definitely skip it. The gambas in garlic sauce didn't taste fresh at all. 

The restaurant was very busy, and service was okay -- sometimes very attentive and sometimes we'd have to work to flag down our server.",0,0,0

I loved how many options there were on the menu and service was excellent.  I am pregnant so I want to let you know I could not try any alcoholic beverages and I could not try any of the raw tuna\/ceviche\/seafood dishes they had.  I was pretty sad about that.  Portion sizes here are very small, but each dish is excellent so I will say it is worth the money.  An example is that the scallops come on a dish and it is two seared scallops per dish.  These scallops are average-size by the way.  I did not get to try the scallops because we had seven people and three orders of scallops so I opted to lose out on that round.  The dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with a marcona almond and cheese were excellent.  Probably the best I have had on the strip (example better then Jaleo and I do like Jaleo.)  I also tried the seafood paella, the meat paella, calamari, lobster salad, duck salad, beef short rib with mushrooms and potatos, pistachio tart, flan, some caramel dessert, a chocolate molton cake, and I drank chamomile tea.  The only item I think could have been better was the crispy calamari.  The calamari was not crispy enough or well done enough for my liking.  It lacked some flavor as well.

Lesson learned: only order 2 at a time so you can spread out the meal.  We ended up ordering another dish just so we could sit and relax for awhile, and my husband was still hungry.

The food itself was excellent, hence the 4 stars.  Highlights were the lobster gazpacho, Spanish tortilla, ahi tuna tempura, and Spanish iberico sliders. Avocado cannelloni was good but a little rich.  My husband also enjoyed the olives.

Other dishes such as salmon with truffle, garlic mussels, albondigas, and paella were also quite good. The only mildly dissapointing dish was the tuna-raspberry skewer, which had a little bit too much raspberry flavor.

The restaurant is called Julian Serrano, and the prices certainly reflect the chef's arrogance as much as the name. Everything was great, but if I had to come up with a sixth taste (besides sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami) it would be 'value,' because the value of a dish, or lack thereof, seems to make things taste different to me. When you order here you are hoping for dishes that are so unique and wonderful that the prices are justified, yet when the food comes out of the kitchen it becomes evident your expectations were too high and disappointment is inevitable. Take for example the imported Spanish 'pata negra' ham, described on the menu as 'the most delicious ham in the world' for $35. Obviously this is a ridiculously bold and definitive statement for anyone to make about a single meat, however, hopeful me fell for the marketing and ordered it anyways. While the ham was certainly lovely, and I can't say I specifically remember ever eating another that I found better, it was still a meager portion of ham for $35 and I've had comparable before (the curing of meats throughout Europe is an art form, and I've been lucky enough to experience this first hand).

The combination of small portions and hefty prices is bound to result in continued disappointment as you make your way through the menu. The scallop was done about as well as any other, but $12 for one of them is just too much to ask. The mushroom risotto ($10) was creamy but slightly underdone and the salmon with truffle ($12) was just so so. Definitely pass on the avocado canneloni ($10) which I found to be texturally amiss and void of any redeeming flavor. The almond stuffed dates ($8) were alright, but not only are the dates at Firefly a better value, they taste better as well. These dates had a panko bread coating that was unnecessary and bulky, which took focus away from the dates themselves, and the accompanying spicy sauce didn't pair well with them at all. The cheese plate ($14) included cana de cabra (soft goat milk cheese), aged manchego, and soft sheep milk extremedura, and was served with a fruit compote and soft toasty bread. Each cheese was complex, and it's hard not to love cheese, but I don't know if anyone other than the producers can really take credit for making a fine cheese plate. The piquillo peppers were delightful, with an oozy cheese center that was far more sophisitcated than that of Firefly, but was not worth the $10.

The good news is that I found the least expensive dishes to be some of the best anyway. The open-faced Pan Manchego ($8) was a revelation in grilled cheese, and the beet salad ($10) was not only an architectural gem but a well-balanced and colorful creation. The steamed mussels ($9) were plump and the broth was something special, though it was frustrating to capture in the shell spoons because of the pot used to serve them. In addition to tasting better than most of the other dishes, this was also the best value on the menu. If you order these items I think you'll be happier with your experience and your bill.

Tip: I noticed from the menu pictures taken by another blogger that prices were $3-5 less in December of last year. If you do want to go here I would suggest you hurry, before they become even more absurd.",6,4,3

The restaurant is open to the Aria so it's quite loud. The seating is tight. I would say the ambiance is left lacking because of that. 

This is a tapas restaurant (we love tapas). Basically you order several small plates and share the items around the table. They also have entrees if you don't like that, but that kind of takes the point out of going to tapas. 

What we tasted:
*White Ceviche, fresh white fish, red onion, rocoto pepper, cilantro, lime juice: I thought this was good, not super flavorful, but fresh tasting. 
*Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, goat cheese, mushrooms: We all liked these quite a bit. 
*Stuffed Dates,medjol dates, goat cheese, crispy pancetta, tomato marmalade: these little guys were delicious. 
*Beef And Cheese,prime tenderloin, cheese, honey, walnuts: this was our favorite. We actual ordered a second order of this. 
*Pan Manchego,toasted bread, fresh garlic tomato sauce, one-year-old manchego cheese: as good as it sounds. 

We enjoyed a delicious bottle of Pinot noir suggested to us by the sommelier that visited our table. I would say he was the best part of our meal. He knew the wine list and was extremely knowledgable about wine itself. We love wine and greatly appreciated his expertise. 

As a whole I would not rate this as the best tapas restaurant we have visited. The menu did not appeal to me greatly, however I was able to find items I enjoyed. The atmosphere is a wee bit too loud for me. I don't think we choose to eat here again, but am not disappointed we tried it.",3,0,1

We told her to brig the Sangria ( which tasted like pure sugar water this time) and a calamari for and app. She brought the items and we told her we would be ordering the Paella because it takes 40 minutes to cook. She said fine and walked away. 

After about 25 minutes I called her over and asked if we could order. I also just wanted to double check with her that she put the paella in for 4 people . She looked at me like I was crazy. She said no, she put it in for 2 people. WHAT??? We have a table of 4. She said we should just order an extra item off of the menu if we were still hungry. I asked for the manager right away.

The manager came over and I explained the situation. He said he would try and get a 4 person paella expedited for us. He came out 5 minutes later and said we were so lucky because someone else had ordered a 4 person and he would just give us theirs. After we had all of our small plates, which were good they brought out the paella. OMG was this a joke? You could see right away that the rice was not cooked. We asked them to serve it up and they just glared at us and left a spoon. We tried eating it and the rice was so raw it was literally sticking to our teeth. We were picking it out. I called the manager back over. We asked him to taste it, he did and said that is how they serve it. What a liar. I have had the paella here so many times and never tasted this kind of crap. 

He took it away and we just ordered the donuts for dessert. We ordered 2 orders so we could all have some. They brought out 3 and also a flan that tasted horrible and no one ate. The manager came back over and said he had removed several things off of our check. When we got the check, they charged us for half of a paella and 3 orders of donuts. WHAT??? GET THE MANAGER!! He came over again about 10 minutes later with a new check and said ""oh here is your real check"". Are you serious Mr. Manager? Nice try ripping me off. 

This was a disaster and I will never return to this restaurant. What a joke! This place is not cheap and they should have it together by now.

It's a tapas restaurant located in Aria (A plus since they perfume the air there #omgsmellssogood). For those of you who don't know what Tapas is, it's the Spanish version of Dim Sum. You just order a bunch of appetizer sized plates. Usually about 3 orders is good for one person. Here's what's good to get:

Imported spanish ""pata negra"" ham (it's pricey, but worth it)
brava potatoes (crunchy potato squares with  a spicy tomato alioli sauce)
pan manchego (toasted bread, fresh garlic tomato sauce and manchego cheese)
sauteed padron peppers (good for snacking on, like the edamame of tapas)
traditional spanish chicken croquetas (standard tapas dish, always a winner no matter where you go)
grilled lamb chop (only comes with one small chop per order)
beef and cheese (prime tenderloin, cheese, honey, pecans wow really really good)

For dessert get Santiago's cake. It's very unique (not in a crazy taste way) and is the perfect ending for such a great meal every time.

The lunch deal was fantastic! A total of $30 and you can mix and match 4 tapas from a long list of their famous tapas selections. My friend and I were able to select 8 tapas for lunch! 

Brava potatoes - one of their most famous tapas, the potatoes was fried just right, crispy outside and soft inside. On top of it was their spicy tomato and allioli sauce. The combination was wonderful taste of potatoes. It will give you a wonderful surprise in your mouth. 
Gambas - saut√©ed shrimp in garlic brava sauce with arbol chilis. This was one of my most favorite tapas here. The sauce was amazing. The garlic and chili flavors gave the dish a kick to the sauce and also elevated its flavors to the next level. One of those flavors that will wow you! 
Stuffed piquillo peppers - unfortunately this was one of my least favorite tapas because the goat cheese was way too powerful for me. For people who like cheese, you may like the dish but I was overwhelmed with the creaminess and unable to enjoy the dish.
Pintxo de chorizos - it was a really good dish. I love the flavor of chorizos and topped with lemon honey, which balanced out the saltiness of the pork chorizo. Their mashed potato also surprised me by how smooth it was. It was a wonderful combination of chorizo, mashed potato, and honey sauce. 
Octopus a la gallega - The octopus was cooked in Spanish paprika and sat on top of thin sliced potatoes. I love the flavor of the octopus but I think the dish can be even better if the octopus could be sliced thicker. 
Traditional spanish jamon croquetas - another my favorite! It was well made croquetas. I am not too familiar with croquetas but the flavor was excellent! It was a pretty heavy dish but I love the crispy crunch outside and creamy filling inside. The filling was just perfect amount cheese and serrano ham. 
Salmon with truffle - the salmon was so-so. I was quite disappointed with the dish. It was over cooked in my opinion because it was dry and hard once it arrived to our table. The seasoning was nothing special or surprising. For this level of restaurant, I expected the salmon to be cooked perfectly and seasoned appropriately. 
Rabo de toro - aka red wine braised oxtail. Amazing! Another favorite. I love the sauce and how the oxtail was prepared. Definitely showed the skills of chefs at Julian Serrano. The sauce was perfect for the oxtail. 

Overall, I loved the experience at Julian Serrano! Dining here was more than just the food. The ambiance, the waiter service, and the excellent flavors of food together made this a great restaurant. I highly recommend to try it out if you are in Vegas.",0,0,0

Julian Serrano is a tapas restaurant located in the lobby of the Aria Hotel next to the front desk.  The restaurant is decorated in vivid colors and is enclosed by a short clear divider that leaves part of the restaurant exposed to the eyes of lobby guests.  Since the divider is only a few feet tall and clear, I think that the people who dine at these tables get a more casual atmosphere since it almost feels like you are dining in the lobby itself.  However, the rest of the tables are tucked further back into the restaurant giving it a more private and cozy atmosphere.  

I have been here a few times and the people who dine here have always ranged from extremely casual (""Hi, I just came from the pool"") to dressed to impress (""I'm going to the cluuuuub!"").  I've seen families with small children here and I've also seen bachelorette parties here.  The good thing is that the ambiance can really accommodate anyone, and the restaurant is spacious enough that you can sit far away from small children if you prefer.  

The service has always been excellent - no complaints there.  As for the food, it is definitely pricey for the size of the dishes.  I believe each small plate is $8-$14 and they are tiny.  However, the dishes are great if you want a high-quality light meal.  One dish that I was impressed with based on its size is the paella.  It is HUGE.  I ordered it when I was with a party of 10 girls - 4 of us really wanted paella, and the menu said that the portions are designed for 2 people.  Based on the size of the tapas, we were thinking that the paella would also be small and fulfilling, so we asked to get a 3-person serving for $75 (expensive IMO).  The paella dish was so big that it easily fed 8 of us (in addition to the small plates), and we left happy and full.",9,5,7

Our team shared the following tapas:
Lobster Salad
Ahi tuna tempura
White ceviche
Tuna carpaccio
White anchovy fillets
Traditional Spanish chicken croquetas
Fresh calamari a la plancha
Creamy risotto

The tapas that hit me as the best have to be the ceviche, calamari, and the tuna carpaccio.  The calamari was fork tender and perfectly accented by the acid, the carmelized onions added the needed sweetness to round out the dish.

The execution of the carpacio left me wanting to order another order, but I had to sustain.  The carpaccio is sliced thin and placed over pine nuts that gave the dish a perfect, and when I say perfect I mean crunch.  The vinaigrette was refreshing while not being too overpowering of the fish.

The restaurant is beautiful, and the fun vibe of Tapas makes it a great experience.  A must check out if your in Vegas and anywhere near the Aria Hotel.  Price is on the high side, but quality, service, and most of all flavor get the high marks for me.",2,0,0

Paella Valenciana: I haven't had rabbit for a long time and the texture of the meat was cooked to perfection...

Chorizos: So savory with a kick from the red peppers. Don't forget to scoop up all the mashed potatoes. It's worth it.

I have been meaning to visit Julian Serrano for awhile. After all, for all food connoisseurs in Las Vegas, surely Julian Serrano must be somewhere on their list. Tucked away inside the alluring Aria by the front desk, yet ever so far away from parking garage is this spot of expensive tapas paradise. To be of note - it IS a tapas place, hence why I haven't been on pins and needles trying to come here. Always in the back of my mind was the voice saying, ""So expensive for just tapas! Just go to Firefly instead!""

Luckily LVRW2013 has rolled around and I enjoyed a meal here with friends on a Tuesday night at 6:30 PM. Before being seated my friend and I ordered cocktails at the bar (all $14). I tried a fruity type drink that provided a nice start to my meal. Not too sweet, not too alcoholy, but still pretty steep in price. After drinks we were seated in the dining area further back, which is nice since it is over carpet, which brings the sound of the clacking of feet down to a minimum and it also hides your table from the casino. Chairs are plush and comfortable, lighting is perfect, and the ambiance is classy. 

Service was excellent. Our server was prompt, kept our drinks filled, and in general was a very courteous gentleman. I ordered a chardonnay from the Bordeaux region of France ($16). A lovely wine indeed and of the two options (another which was from California) I am glad I splurged. Worth every drop.  

On to the food...

Chicken Croquetas - Simple yet tasty is the best way to describe these. The dish is not the most pleasant to look at, but the taste was deliciously fried on the outside and creamy on the inside.

Salmon (with mashed potatoes and baby carrots) - The main dish is what let me down and which brought down my rating. The salmon was cooked well enough, but the portion size was disappointing. My friend got the chicken and after seeing her dish I was wishing for chicken. Also, the horseradish cream served on the side of the salmon just did not go well with the fish, to me personally. I am wishing now someone else in my party had wanted to do the paella, but in order to have that option you must have more than one person ordering the dish. *womp womp*

Molten Chocolate Cake and Blood Orange Ice Cream - I do love blood orange ice cream and sorbet and this one was refreshing to have with the very decadent and very good chocolate cake. If anything, this may have been my favorite part of the dining experience, coming in second to the glass of chardonnay.

Overall - I realize I am reviewing the LVRW2013 menu, but even so, this food reflects the establishment. I think the big thing was how flat the salmon fell for me. After all, it was my main dish. While the other items were good I believe they should have been better considering the establishment. 

Would I be back? I would try happy hour. I would even go back for a birthday party I was invited to here... or some other special event. BUT, I do not believe I would come back for a full-out full-priced meal.",7,0,1

Hadn't had good luck with seviche, so we figured at this swanky place we couldn't go wrong.  Well... I know seviche is RAW, but, seriously?  I think it's marinated in some type of citrus before they serve it.  Well it arrived... RAW!  I mean see-through!  I took two bites and my husband took two ( he regularly eats sushi) and I thought to myself, wow, this texture is rather chewy.  So we let it sit for about 20 minutes while we waited for our next item, and it began to turn WHITE, like it was cooking.... when we brought this up to the waiter and asked him if they regularly brought it out raw and it was suppose to marinate at the table, he went to ask the chef.  He came back and told us the chef said ""yes, this is how they always serve it.""  I was not impressed.  He was apologetic and said he was sorry.  At this point, I was turned off as the service was slow, the waiter was aggressive ( tried to sell us an expensive Spanish wine that wasn't good, as my husband is a somm and was leaning towards another) water refill were nil, and the atmosphere was loud and crowded.

He ended up in his hotel the whole next day while the rest of us went out. We had eaten nothing else suspicious before that, and all ate the same things, except for the mussels in the seafood paella which only me and my friend ate.

We had the mushroom risotto and the mixed ceviche, and I also sampled the salmon with truffle and the sea bass. Both fish were cooked perfectly and the sea bass was the better of the two. The risotto was cooked nicely. I thought the seafood in the ceviche could have been cut into smaller bite-size pieces, and the fish could have been firmer. It had a soggy texture that didn't fare well. For the price, the portion in all dishes was pretty small. I also had a peach cocktail that was average. 

Service was shaky, which was more significant since we were a large party and paid 18% gratuity. It was not only that they were slow but also that they were absent.

This was my favorite meal from my 4 days in Vegas.  We came here for lunch on a Saturday around 1 pm because my mom has been on a tapas kick lately and we had heard this place was good. The decor was very hip and attractive, just like the Aria itself. We had a reservation so we didn't wait, bit about 30 minutes after we sat down, a line started to form outside.

The food was absolutely delicious.  There was not one dish I didn't like. The Brava potatoes were perfectly fried and crispy, and covered in a red sauce and garlic aioli.  My only complaint about the presentation is that it was served in a small bowl, so that the bottom pieces were soggy when we reached them. Serving this on a plate with the sauces on the side would be better.  The lobster gazpacho was cool and refreshing, and came with some chunks of lobster meat, minced tomatoes, cucumbers and bell peppers, and a frozen ball of the soup on a spoon (very fancy!).  Dad ordered the Pinxto de chorizos with garlic mashed potato, which were so tasty (but not healthy at all).  The chorizo was flavored perfectly, and the mashed potatoes complemented them well.  the fried calamari was not very crispy, but the squid was so tender and lightly breaded, so the flavor made up for the lack of normal calamari texture.  We also ordered the seafood ceviche and the sardines (I didn't eat them so I can't comment, but my parents enjoyed them immensely).  We had the salted Marcona Almonds, and they were good, but i wouldn't order them again ($6 for almonds is a bit much). 

We enjoyed our food with a pitcher of white sangria, which was STRONG and delicious and perfect for sipping in between bites.  It was not oversweet, and came with big, pretty chunks of green apple, lime, and orange.  Mom started skewering the apples out of the pitcher with her fork and eating them when the sangria was all gone :)

For me, the star of the meal was the dessert: churros with spicy hot chocolate!  These were not your typical Mexican-American cinnamon churros - they were only slightly sweet and dusted with powdered sugar, light, fluffy, formed into little teardrop-shaped loops, and served with a cup of melted dark chocolate with a spicy kick and a chili pepper for decoration.  If you are a chocolate lover, you MUST get this!  The chocolate was rich with a subtle spiciness that never became too strong, but complemented the sweet\/fried flavors of the churro.  Even my mom, who is super health-conscious and never eats desserts, had a bite, and then had about 4 more bites after that.  Such an innovative and unique dessert!  It's pretty big as well, so you can easily share it between two people.

The tappas offered reflect a wide range of choices and the three we shared were all unusual and excellent. I especially appreciated the time and effort the waitress put into making sure that I did not have any garlic, to which I am allergic, and that, in spite of not having any garlic in them, every dish was a taste treat.
I would mention, however, that the waitress was very helpful in ordering the dishes, but we did not see much of her during our meal, so we would have had a bit of a problem had anything needed attention.

We had two wines and 4-5 plates for $75. The plates can add up, but they are so flavorful and high quality that you don't need massive amounts to be satisfied.

The salads are fresh and light. Meat is always cooked perfectly. I love the egg dishes with french fries. I'm not a fish eater, but we've had ceviche there that was fabulous. I would like to try everything, but the menu changes and I don't visit Vegas often enough to keep up!

We began our meal with a their version of sangria made with Spumante, (usually red or white wine is used) but it I was excited as it had my favorite kind of champagne. Sweet, fruity and not overly dry. It was light and refreshing but contained very little fruit perhaps due to being served in a small champagne flutes. The tuna tar tare cones were amazing! The light and airy crunchy cones they came in provided for a wonder contrast with the tuna which melted in our mouths. The dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with goat cheese, were phenomenal as were and the breaded manchego cheese pops. Whitefish ceviche was yum but we wished there were more taro chips to go with it. Yellowtail was just eh. 

We finished up the meal with simple but delicious donut holes with butterscotch sauce and a very nice port wine. It was a perfect combination and end to a superb meal.

There was no wait for our party of five on Saturday at around 6, so I guess the trick is to come early because they were packed when we left around 8 or so.

We ordered several dishes, including the crispy artichoke, foie gras, fried chicken wings, and the valenciana and serrano paellas.  The paellas could easily feed three people per serving, but they do take up to 40 minutes to make.  They were delicious!  The rice is moist and flavorful, and they don't scrimp on the ingredients here either (as they shouldn't because one paella is easily 40+ dollars).  Between the two, it's hard for me to decide which one I liked more, although the serrano was definitely appealing given the baby back ribs and fresh kale in the rice.  

The fried chicken wings were easily my second favorite dish.  They were crispy on the outside, featured lots of meat on the bones, and were sweet and tangy in flavor.  This dish came recommended to us by our server, and it was a great pick.

The crispy artichoke was good, although not super memorable.  I remember thinking that the ""tapas"" style seemed a bit odd given that the size of the plate and portions were quite large.  Not sure I'd order this again but would probably want to try another veg.

The foie gras was quite delicate.  It's always a treat to be able to order this since you can no longer get it in California.  It came sandwiched between cooked apple slices that were a bit mushy too and a sweet sauce.  I'd probably get it again just because it's a treat!  

Service:  This was a stand out.  Our server - Pedro - was friendly, efficient, and so helpful.  He liked to chat and joke with us, and overall made the dining experience really enjoyable.

The only thing that I didn't like was the seating arrangements and the seats themselves. The chairs are not very comfortable, and seats were placed very close together and it was a hassle trying to enter\/exit the restaurant, zigzagging through the chairs. 

What we ordered:
1. White Ceviche $14 - This was my first time trying ceviche, and quite frankly, it was very tasty, but for the price, I didn't think it was worth it. The white fish went well with the lime - all ingredients tasted very fresh and served as a good appetizer. 

2. White Anchovy Fillet $12 - I don't like anchovies so I didn't personally try this, but my friend claims that this was the most amazing dish served here. 

3. Brava Potatoes $10 - I LOVED this dish. I normally don't like potatoes unless they're served in the form of french fries, but the Brava Potatoes blew me away. I'd say this dish is a must-order at Julian Serrano. 

4. ""Bomba"" $12.50 - A mixture of veal and pork tenderloin, this spicy meatball leaves your mouth burning for awhile after devouring it and I loved it! 

5. Beef & Cheese $17.50 - the tenderloin used was larger than the bread on the bottom. The beef could have been more tender, and it's a little overpriced for what you get.

Besides, without any walls, who could resist looking in and admiring the millions of colorful little mosaic pieces that tiled the floors and columns?  Absolutely stunning. 

Service was attentive.  The host at the door smiled sincerely.  The waiter greeted us with a courteous grin - serious, yet gentle. 

Sangria was sampled, and the red was chosen.  The white offered friendly flavors, sweet for those who cringe at the bitters from reds.  However, the red stood bold, while embracing the sweets of the fruits.  It was just a beautiful mixture of character and quality.

Raspberry Tuna. Amazing.  Visually, you acknowledge two cubes of the deep, dark shades of red.  One cube has four sides rolled in a mixture of toasted black and white sesame seeds.  The other cube, skewered and stacked elegantly on top, had a gentle dash of pixie dust (otherwise known as wasabi powder).  Gently lift the skewer, but careful not to let it rip through the cubes... The raspberry cube instantly melts - velvety and smooth - offering tart flavors to the subtle tuna and sesame seeds. 

Garlic shrimp - another winner.  Chorizo and mashed potatoes - perfect for a pre-going out item.  I have yet to try the paella - perhaps when I go with a party of 12.  

My advice: try everything on the menu.",0,0,0

I do not eat meat, poultry or seafood so I was happy that they had a vegetarian section, but the mushroom risotto was very bland and tasteless (and I am used to risottos) and I also got the roasted peppers which did not taste roasted at all, more like boiled baby food - no other flavors I could detect - it was actually a pretty gross cold mess.  (To be fair this place may excel at their meat and seafood selections which we did not have). The by cup wine is expensive, which is fine, but the selection is somewhat off putting - very generic.  The service was spotty.  We seemed to be completely forgotten after being initially served until bill time came, and my second glass of vinegary wine was never delivered.

I am not a super fussy person, (I am from Chicago - foodie heaven) and I had no problems with the prices but I expect something above just edible.

Julian Serrano is located in the Aria near the entrance to the Crystals Mall near the pub.  It's an open area restaurant so shouldn't be too hard to miss.  It meshes with the rest of Aria fairly well and is colorful and nice.  It also has terrific service all-around and isn't too busy in the middle of the afternoon (on a Saturday no less).  They also apparently have happy hour but seemingly only in the week.  

Serrano is a tapas restaurant with lots of small and bigger items to try.  It has much of the typical fare you expect from a tapas restaurant with their own little twists.  We just went for the small items this time around (which cost around +$10 per dish) although the bigger dishes like paella are available and do take longer to arrive.  Here's a list of what we had:
-Stuffed Dates: One of my favorite - although still not the best dates tapas dish I had - it's a strong contender with its strong flavor profile and great sauce.  
-Sweet potato pure + skewers - Not a bad dish although it did taste a little light even with the skewer (which was a pepper\/sausage - one of the spicier things on the menu).  
-Squid ink rice: Ate a little bit of this and was in love.  Great look and great taste. Another favorite dish.
-Mashed potatoes\/sausage: Delicious dish which is simple and clean.  
-Ceviche: Simply okay - don't think it's the best dish you can order.  
-Tuna belly: Delicious stuff here - fresh taste and delicious sides.

The paella was huge...it definitely could've been shared by three or four people.  there was calamari, shrimp, mussels, monk fish and vegetables  with saffron rice.

I've only been here twice and each experience has been amazing. 

Service is a little slow, but the food is worth the wait. I made reservations both times, but the place was never full when I arrived. 

My favorite dishes are the serrano tender (foie gras | prime tenderloin| white chocolate bread) and the black rice (fresh calamari | lobster meat | saffron | squid ink). 

Other good tapas:
- arroz con secreto (spanish iberico pork | mushroom rice | garlic chive)
- octopus a la gallega (potatoes | spanish paprika)
- fried calamari (allioli | lemon wheels)


The desserts here are fantastic! Get the torrija (salted caramel | vanilla bean ice cream | candied macadamia) and the crema catalana (orange blossom cr√®me br√ªl√©e | orange zest). The crema catalana is so creamy and light, and the orange blossom flavor is just incredible.",1,0,0

Beet salad, patata brava, padron peppers, gazpacho, etc. were all very good.  They have vegan mango and maybe pineapple(?) sorbet there as the only vegan desserts... but they are fantastic.

I had a reservation, made through Open Table, for a party of 4. Two people arrived early and were seated right away. When I arrived, a drink menu was promptly delivered...actually it was an iPad but same thing, and our drink were ordered. The atmosphere was loud in a Saturday night kind of way. Unfortunatley, two of our dinning companions were a bit older and hearing was an issue for them. I suspected this might be a problem, as Tapas restarants normally promote drinking and plate sharing which leads to lots of guest interaction. But I just went with it. 

We ordered the Tuna raspberry skewers, the spicy tuna cones, a serrano ham plate, truffle risotto, a salmon dish, galic chicken, and artichokes. I woudl say 50% was delicios, the other 50% was just meh. The artichokes were little grease bites, the salmon was forgettable and the raspberry tuna skewers looked better than they tasted. My favorite was the spicy tuna cone. It had great texture and the flavors worked really well. The serrano ham plate was simple and everyone gobbled it up. The risotto wasn't the best i've ever had but the truffle flavor was intense and I'm a sucker for truffle anything. 

Dessert: Churros with chocolate dipping sauce & Almond cake. The churros were hot but plain, no sugar or cinnimon sprinked on them. The chocolate sauce was thick and slightly spiced with chili, yum. I prefered the almond cake. It was simple and a nice finish to the meal but nothing I would specifically recommend to a visitor. 

Drinks- I have an obsession with Aviations and the one here was really good. Not a great as the ones made at the Vesper Bar but still very tasty. They also had a nice wine list but the waiters knowledge was not that extensive to be able to make suggestions without pouring multiple tastes.

We dined here during Las Vegas Restaurant Week 2014 and this tapas restaurant was easily one of my favorites from the many we tried. 

The ambiance sets the initial mood of a big-ticket appetite. You almost feel as if you are entering a secret Alice in Wonderland world and about to head down the rabit hole to experience an interesting turn of exhilarating dining events. Dramatic trees, colorful floor tile art, bold color scheme; Aria Las Vegas, you have effortlessly outdone yourself again.  

LOBSTER GAZPACHO
chilled Spanish tomato soup | lobster meat | cherries. This is out of control delicious. The lobster, very plump and sweet, plus the refreshing zesty chilled tomato gazpacho had a surge of exciting flavor; the slightly tart and sweet cherries just awakens all of your senses.

SALMON
Scottish salmon | creamy whipped potato | horseradish cream. The dish was plated with intense artistry. The pop of color from the edible flowers was the ultimate eating with our eyes moment. But wait until you taste it; the flavor is unbelievable! Each component alone plays a sophisticated and important role in the dish.  Enjoy them all together as the perfect bite. Incredible! The crispy skin itself just kills me. Did I scrape the plate clean? You bet I did.

FLAN DE TURRON
almond creme custard | whipped cream | turron. Entering food ecstasy in 3...2...1. Just one of those desserts where you just want to close your eyes, savor the creaminess and enjoy the moment, like in the commercials.

You can pre-select a menu and then they will scale it up to whatever group size you have.  The service and food were both top notch, definitely a place to dine at in Las Vegas.

Our meal began with a few appetizers, including Asparagus A La Plancha, Tuna Cones, Ensalada Mixta, and Brava Potatoes.  The Tuna Cones were the highlight of the appetizers, a deconstructed tartare in a rolled up tortilla chip.  The Asparagus was cooked well and the romesco sauce brought the nut and red pepper flavors to the forefront.  My only complaint is that the sauce was overly salty (and this could be nominally addressed by wiping off some sauce).  The Ensalada Mixta and Brava Potatoes were both bland, especially surprising since the potatoes were in both spicy tomato and allioli sauces.  We also received Spanish Chicken Croquettes with the main course, potentially since these too longer to prepare. They were delicious (as fried things tend to be), and I thought the b√©chamel sauce sauce was preferable to the lemon-pepper allioli.  For the main courses we had the Mixed Paella and Carne Asada.  Both were devoured in short order.  The paella has lots of flavors from the  lobster, mussels, shrimp, chicken, and spanish pork chorizo.  Each bite was a surprise since each bite had a different protein in it.  The Carne Asada was beautifully cooked, and featured an unusual piquillo confit and  mashed potatoes.  The piquillo pepper brings sweetness and a roasted notes to the dish and it combined constructively.

The ribs were plated over marble potatoes which were bland themselves. My pan manchego was tasty but I think it'd be hard to screw up bread, tomatoes, and cheese.

Fast forward to visiting Las Vegas with the idea of gorging myself on everything tasty that the city has to offer ... and I decided to visit Julian's eponymous restaurant for kicks (and to prove to myself that I was right in judging him from what I've seen on Top Chef). And you know what? I was wrong. I give this restaurant a solid 3.5 stars and appreciate what Serrano is doing to heighten Las Vegas' culinary caliber.

I think the decor is fun; trendy, whimsical and colorful. Kind of like tapas :)

If you're getting tapas, it's important to get around three things per person and share, so that you get the max out of your experience. Here are the highlights:

-- heirloom tomato salad
-- coca vegetarian
-- yellowtail tiradito
-- stuffed piquillo peppers

Why wasn't it rated higher? One of our items was ""lost"" off the check, and we waited for 20-30 minutes even after letting them know. Second, while some of the food is great, other items like the chicken croquetas were downright dogs.

Well, sad to say that we were (with very few exceptions) disappointed. 

We had: Pan tomate bread (good, tomato had a little too much garlic in it, nothing special when compared to other tapas restaurants where we have been vowed by a burst of flavor by similar dishes); Palmito Salad (very good - one of the exceptions); Creamy mushroom risotto (also very good albeit very small portion - the other exception); Saut√©ed Padron peppers (disappointing - not a lot of flavor and sloppy presentation); Octopus a la Gallega (very small portion, rubbery octopus pieces on small potato slices - nothing special); Albondigas (tasted precooked and microwaved - the fried cubes of potato were only lukewarm). The wines (Albarino, Granacha) were both very nice, but in summary our dinner still left a lot to be desired.

Aside from the food quality there were a couple of other observations that really disappointed us. One was that the food came out way too fast. Just a few minutes after ordering our first courses, three plates arrived in front of us. The pork meatballs were ordered later and again they arrived within a couple of minutes, for sure not prepared fresh! The other disappointment was the fact that we wanted to order the cheese platter, but because we both do not like blue cheese, we requested a change to a different cheese. Our server was not able to confirm this (?) and had to ask the manager. When he came back his answer was: ""Sorry, but we cannot make any changes to your order and replace a cheese because all the cheese plates have already been prepared."" WHAT? We were really surprised and wondered if we were in a cafeteria instead of a high end Spanish tapas restaurant (but at the same time, his statement confirmed what we had suspected all along about most of our other food - pre-cooked).

Order the paella first when you get there since it takes 45-60 min.  We started with a pitcher of red sangria, which was good - not to sweet, with lots of fruit.  

Things are better done family style here.

- Lobster gazpacho: with a gazpacho ball and one small piece of lobster, mini croutons, and some micro greens. The soup is poured over it, and the flavor was good.  While the gazpacho ball was interesting, the coconut butter shell wasn't very good
- Lobster salad: more like a lobster avocado crostini with 2 small pieces and some mixed greens on the side - disappointing 
- Jamon croquetta with cheese fondue: the fondue added good flavor, but the croquette fell apart when you picked it up - I think the inside was too watery?
- Octopus a la gallega: lots of paprika, with potatoes underneath. The octopus wasn't bad
- Yellowtail tiradito: lighter, more refreshing
- Chorizo with honey and whipped potatoes: the honey was really good on this to go with the spicy chorizo
- Tortilla Espanola: pretty legit in terms of the texture and ratio of eggs and potatoes
- Mixed paella: originally portioned ""for 2 people,"" but we increased it to a portion for 3. The flavor on this was good, but I thought it needed some salt. It came with half of a small obster tail, shrimp, museels, chorizo, and chicken thighs. The artichokes were a nice touch 
- Fideua paella: the more interesting noodle kind. The texture was actually really good on this one, and I liked that it had shrimp and fermented garlic, but it could have done without the aioli globs on top 

Even though it wasn't busy during our late lunch, service was spotty, and I had to ask multiple times for things like salt.  The lack of service and the large tables just made everything feel very impersonal here. The space is really large, and seats are awkwardly big, so you feel far away from the rest of your table.

We have ordered: 

1. Raspberry skewer -The raspberry was in square shape and sesame seed covered the ahi tuna. Although the presentation was kinda weird but it tasted pretty good. The raspberry went pretty well with the tuna. Very refreshing and light! 

2. Lobster-pineapple skewer - I was so excited to see this on the menu because it seemed good and unique. But it was not that good. The lobster was chewy and tasteless with the worst piece of pineapple. The pineapple was tasteless and not fresh.... 

3. Stuffed piquillo peppers - This one was recommended by the waitress. It was the peppers stuffed with goat cheese. The peppers were not spicy at all. It was an OK dish, nothing special. 

4. Pato confitado - It was duck leg with orange sauce. I did not try this one but it seemed OK...My friend did finish it but he did not say anything about it. 

5. Pintxo de chorizos - It was mini sausage with garlic mashed potatoes. Again, kind of unique combination but the sausages was a little bit salty. 

6. Ahi Tuna Salad - Nothing special and the greens were not super fresh.

Named by Esquire Magazine as one of the 20 best new restaurants of 2010, this small lobby restaurant at Aria is good, but not exceptional. 

For one thing, the restaurant is located in a cavernous casino lobby where you get a fair amount of noise, and it doesn't feel like a traditional tapas restaurant. The ambiance is more like a Johnny Rockets with its bright, flashy design instead of the small, crowded, gritty tapas places you'd experience in Spain. 

They seem to be going for a Spanish-Asian vibe with several items on the menu that incorporate Japanese and Chinese influences. I thought the Tortilla Espanola was so-so; something I make better at home. Prices are predictably high for a celebrity chef restaurant in Vegas, and especially once you start ordering several small dishes, but not outrageous.

The food was pretty much horrible, with the exception of one item we ordered (the stuffed Piquillo peppers being the only thing I'd recommend). 

The Ahi Tuna w\/ Molecular Raspberry was a good concept just poorly executed: our Ahi was cooked and tough, and the raspberry element was nothing more then a piece of opaque jello (gross). 

The Gambas was a complete waste... first of all any restaurant that is suppose to be of this quality should never use pre-cooked bay shrimp with anything! These gross little shrimp were just sitting in an olive oil\/butter mix with a few pieces of garlic - the dish was just appalling. 

The Croquettas weren't even croquettas in my opinion. There was hardly any meat to them... they should of just called them fried cheese sticks.

THE ONLY GOOD FOOD ITEM WE HAD WAS THE STUFFED PIQUILLO PEPPERS. Stuffed with a goat cheese blend and an excellent tomato sauce on top, these were just the right balance of creaminess and spice with a sauce to pull it all together.

If you are use to quality food, I would definitely  not recommend this place... or if you do go definitely don't get the three items I mentioned above. It should be a 1 star rating, but the pitcher of Sangria (which is like 12 glasses worth) was pretty good :P",0,1,0

The decor of this restaurant is really pretty.  Very modern and hip and I felt one of the cool kids on the block.  When I first viewed the menu, I had counted for dishes that I really wanted to eat.  ""I'm not hungry!""  I told my stomach so I cut it down to two.  I chose the shrimp ceviche and the tuna tirado.  Both were DEE-LISH-OUS!  Some other bites I ate off of friend's plates were the seared scallops and the grilled iron flat iron steak.  Very yummy!  

I know.  I hear you.  So why not the 5 stars?  Service sucked.  I don't know if it was a busy night or what but they forgot about us and it took a while for our server to come back and ask if we wanted anything else.

Arrived, they walked us through to the back of the restaurant near a huge wall display.  Told the waiter it was our first time here and he guided us through the tapas and made suggestions.  We settled on about 5-6 various tapas with a bottle of Champagne.  Wonderfully done.  Service was prompt, as soon as one plate was empty it was cleared and the next tapas brought to the table.  Glasses were kept filled as they should have been and we didnt have to do a thing.  Wonderful.

Main course came, we ordered two variations of paella, one traditional and one with lobster.  Along with this a lovely Rioja that just fit together very well with the food.  One thing that amazed me, either time passed very slowly with the appetizers or we went into time warp but the paella came out quickly.   Couldnt have been more than 15 minutes, and the restaurant was full.

One thing I do remember was the bathroom.  Nice music inside, clean and as it should be.  I was impressed, and if I'm impressed with the bathroom, imagine how the restaurant is.

I'm so not a Las Vegas fan! (Yeah, I'm that boring!) If I want to ""live it up"" South Beach has  never dissapointed.  BUT, I love road trips! So much so that I would go anywhere even when I don't care for the destination. ""Hey you wanna take a road trip to hell?"" Me: "" Oh! Hell yeah!...you are driving, right?"" 

WHY I HATE VEGAS, WELL IF YOU CARE...

THE CHEESY DAY CLUB SCENE:
Don't get  me wrong, I love pool parties but the whole Vegas day club culture with cheesy Z list ""celebrity"" hosts from mind numbing reality shows-BARF! 
This scene can be entertaining for about 20 min ...well unless you are slizzered! The scene as in dudes with huge biceps,  meaningless ""tribal tatoos""  and chicken legs walking around like they're about to fly! Oh! And their counterparts, Pamela Anderson wannabees looking like they came to audition for America's Next Top Pornstar.  Meanwhile, the evil twin in me is itching to stick a pin in those thingies, something about inflated balloons...


NIGHT CLUBS:
Even worse; populated with the same roid heads from the pool trying to be all ""big pimpin""  because they just paid $500 for $20 bottle of Grey Goose Vodka for the privilege of being sorrounded by 20  ""hot"" girls.  
And the sad thing is  that, these ladies  are not even interested in these ""ballers"". They would play the part for a free drink and a place to park their asses and rest their 6"" heels wearing feet! As you know, In Vegas, no bottle service, no seating! So if you don't want to get bottle service yourself, you'd better  find someone who could...

SENSORY OVERLOAD
 1. 2000 ladies of all shapes and sizes(not a compliment) wearing the Vegas Saturday Night Uniform-the ""Freak Em Dress""... with 6 inch heels! Yap! That super short, super tight dress that used to be a favourite of prostitutes all over the world but now... Hey!  I don't even know what  Vegas ""working girls"" wear to gain a competitive edge over that girl from Kansas who just want to  ""let the freak out"" for the weekend! That is some conundrum!  

2. The Wayne Newton's face everywhere- taxis, buidings, mugs...DISTURBING!

3. The annoying slots machine ringers that I keep hearing even in my sleep!  The fake foreign cities,  waterfalls and beaches...

4.  Millions of Elvis impersonators...I mean seriously, who goes to Vegas to watch a fake Elvis?

OTHER ANNOYING FACTORS:
1) The fact that you have to walk many carpeted miles in your highest heels to get to the main door?

 2)  LET ME NOT START WITH THE VEILED SLOBBERING DRUNK BACHELORETTES! 

WHY I GO TO VEGAS.

Besides the road trip, I go to Vegas because of one thing and one thing only-THE RESTAURANTS!

THE VEGAS DINING EXPERIENCE:
I can comfortably say that  with all the fake glitz and cheesy glamour, Las Vegas  is home to the best restaurants in the country...well, in close third to NYC and San Francisco!  

We turned up at Julian Serrano by chance after an award show at MGM. A night before, we had a late dinner at Comme Ca at the Cosmopolitan, so for the next dinner, we wanted to try out restaurants at Aria. We first headed down to Bar Masa because of its New York connection. 
We get to Bar Masa "" Bla! Bla! Bla! You have no reservation, you'll have to wait for the late sitting"" (an hour later).  Moi, I am in no shape to wait-I am hungry, cranky, I am in so much pain, my hooker heels are killing me from all that walking through the Casino to get to the MGM main entrance!

So I  told the Maitre d' I can't wait but needed a recommendation. This guy  personally walked us to Juliano Serrano. And of course, I am not that excited to be at JS because I was looking forward to eat at Bar Masa-my mind was already made up! And I am also thinking, I have had the best tapas already, what can this chef do that is different form all other tapas restaurants? 

The restaurant when you look at it ,is so unassuming-bright color modern decor-nothing special.

THE FOOD:
We had:
- Lobster Salad 
- Red Beet Salad 
-Ahi Tuna Tempura  
-Avocado Cannelloni 
-Huevos Estrellado 
-Saut√©ed Padron Peppers 
-White Ceviche (EASILY THE BEST CEVICHE I HAVE EVER HAD!)

-Steamed Mussels 
-Gambas a la Plancha 
-White Anchovy Fillets 
-Grilled Lamb Chop 
-Stuffed Dates 

Yeah and we definitely stuffed our faces too ;-). 

We paired the tapas with a great bottle of wine as recommended by the sommelier. 

I was so happy that I ended up here instead of Bar Masa; what a great surprise that was! I had no expectations coming in and ended up with the best tapas I ever had (as far as I can recall!)  

I highly recommend Julian Serrano as the restaurant to dine at when you are in Las Vegas. I have dined at some of the ""best restaurants in Las Vegas"" but this one is high on that list!

Compliments to Chef Serrano!

The restaurant is actually in the lobby of the aria Hotel and it's really kind of just an open area with no walls in closing the restaurant. So anyone walking through the lobby of the hotel can see you and depending on how many guests are checking in or out, it can get loud. It didn't feel like a restaurant at all, but rather a cafeteria.

We have had two excellent meals at nearby Jaleo, and decided to give JS a try for a comparison. How often can you have the choice of two paella places within walking distance? So, why not. Plus, JS has several types of paella available at all times, while Jaleo makes only two, different ones each night, at the whim of the chef. In retrospect, that allows Jaleo to make perfection vs what seemed like ""fast food version"" at JS. 
We ordered paella marinera right away, and three tapas to hold us the 45-60 minutes the menu stated it would take for the paella to be prepared, got a bottle of wine with the able and amiable assistance of Robert the sommelier, and prepared to have a relaxing evening. Instead, the tapas all three came out within minutes of each other, followed closely by the paella. It felt like food was piled on the table all at once, too much to even fit! The paella was the worst we have ever had. Obviously rushed, the grains undercooked inside and mushy outside. Paella should be soft inside and almost toasted outside. That's why it's so hard to make properly. Kitchen fail. 
The manager explained that it was a very slow week (indeed was only 1\/4 full)and the kitchen was still going full speed. 
They did apologize profusely, and gave us chocolate churros as a dessert apology. Guess who is allergic to chocolate and wasn't asked about food allergies? This guy. No big deal, however, most good restaurants will ask before suggesting menu items, which didn't happen (again, something Jaleo did on each of our visits there).

I think my favorite was the pan manchego. The new york grilled steak had a tasty sauce and the meat was tender. The sauteed baby spinach didn't wow me but I enjoyed it. The traditional spanish chicken croquetas were a little too mushy on the inside and a little too overcooked on the outside.  The inside reminded me of baby food because it seemed to be pureed.

We left still wanting more food and thought it was over priced for what it was.  Most of the food is pre-made.  We ordered 3 items and they all came out in around 5 minutes.  I asked how they got all of it done so quickly and they said they had the food pre-made for what we got.  Nice decor and great service.  We were in and out in about 30 minutes so it was quicker than we were wanting.  I will probably not come back.,0,0,0

Surprised, you see, because they are not readily avaiable even in Spain. I once had to check into about 10 bars before I found one with this delicacy.

Since we were there we tried other tapas including the cannelloni which were delish, some meat on toast which was one of our aves, the mussels which were meaty, and the meatballs which were certainly not our favorite amongst others. They seem to have been fried in old oil. Nothing like the frying oil used in In n Out Burger where we spent our last dinner in Vegas!

While we were in the restaurant the 2012 Grammy Awards were going on and the server was nice enough to change the basketball game (yawn) to the Grammys.

I come at it from a foodie point of view. I've been disappointed with other restaurants with 4.5* over 3000 reviews. But Julian Serrano is a real foodie's delight in a city of thousands of restaurants. 
To start, we got the Huevos Estrelladas, fried chorizo, fries and 2 fried eggs. Simple things but amazing when put together. A forkful of egg, chorizo and potato dipped in creamy yolk is divine. Next we got the Yellowtail ""traditio"", Yellowtail sashimi wrapped around shredded crunchy fillo fillings, topped with cilantro. The rich fish is balanced with a citrus dressing. 
We also got chicken croquettas which is as it says, but the filling  is creamy with tender chicken chunks and although not in the menu, a slight hint of gaminess, I'm wondering if there's chicken liver in mixed in too. It was absolutely delicious and one of our favorites! It was second only to.....the Valenciana paella. 
The paella orders take 45 minutes so we made sure to order once we sat down even before getting drinks. The arborio rice was so perfectly cooked and so so so flavorful!! There were chunks of chicken, chorizo and (supposedly) rabbit but I couldn't tell. I'm not complaining, the whole dish was amazing! Out favorite! The paella is meant for two as it says on the menu but with 3 smaller tapas, the paella really could feed 3 or even 4. We were so full we couldn't for in dessert. 
Yes the paella costs a bit more, but it's at a reasonable price point for Vegas and the other items are all reasonably priced too.

We had the stuffed dates (again, the portions were so small , three dates and were nothing special , paling to the same dishes we ate at the Tapas Bar the previous night.  We did have one more dish, black rice risotto and this was palatable but nothing special. Food was cold and the water tasted like dish water so we had to order bottle water.  It gets better!  The waitress asked us if we enjoyed our meal so we  told her our opinion and mentioned thatnwe have never been in a restaurant where they didn't put bread or something on the table.  Her response was that they do OFFER bread and stuffed olives but you have to ASK for it.

Service 5\/5.  Prompt, knowledgeable, and friendly, definitely trained and proficient.  Among the best I have encountered in Las Vegas.

Personality 4\/5 .  The decor was a little sterile though some of the walls were covered with interesting glass works that are neat to look at but don't add to the experience.  The music was the same soundtrack playing throughout the hotel, so I can't really fault the locale for this because it is in the Aria wich is full of artlstic and decorative incongruities.  It is just a shame that an effort wasn't made to capture some of the color palate of Spain somewhere other than the floors.  (see my Cafe Sevilla review).

Quality 5\/5.  We only had Tapas, and they were all seasoned and cooked flawlessly, universally delicious.  The list includes Papas Bravas, Calamari, Empanada Mallorquina, Tuna Cones, Gambas, Mixed Ceviche (best I have eaten in 25 years), Scallop, and Lagosta.  The flavors were delicate and subtle, the main ingredients always the star, and the portion sizes were perfect.  

Recommendation 5\/5.  Definitely an excellent spot for luxurious and delicious Tapas.  Highly recommended for food lovers. The only real detractors were not really in the restaurant's control.  The qualities they can control are executed perfectly.",0,0,0

The Aria is an outstandingly beautiful place, and the restaurant shares that beauty.  It is a great place to watch people, and the bathrooms are even better...  don't miss them!  You can sit in the restaurant and watch people checking in or walking by in-between the Crystals mall and the Aria casino floor, which provides some of the best people watching on the strip.  You can also enjoy the fantastic display of kites on the ceiling in the Aria lobby.  A great spot to grab a happy hour cocktail for sure...  But, pass on the meal.

We tried one of everything on the Happy Hour menu, and the only solid dishes were the Spicy Meatballs, and the Raspberry Tuna. All the other dishes were below average in taste.  The Serrano ham plate and Charcutere plate were also enjoyed, but the portions of these full priced dishes were small, and the meat quality mediocre.  The only good part were the toasted bread served with them.  The Calamari was extremely greasy, and did not impress.  The Tomato Bread was soggy and gross.  The Sangria was not good at all either.  Skip it.  Really.

Beyond the bathrooms, the highlight of the meal was the Carahillo after dinner drink, which is fantastic if you like an ice coffee.  Yum.  Get one.

I also recommend you pass on dessert...  we had the Flan, and Orange Creme Brule√©.  The Flan was more like a fluffy, bubbly omlet, Bad.  And Brule√© just okay.

The service was also poor.  Ordered peppermint schnapps and got peach.  Ordered one decaf coffee and got 4 orders of regular.  Nearly all the dishes came at the same time, so there was not room on the table. Had to do a happy dance to get the attention of the manager, and once he saw the generally unattentive server headed over, he turned around and never visited...  basically, for a high end place like this, lousy service and obviously poor training.

Churro 3\/5 - I think I was hoping it would taste like the Disneyland churros but it's just lightly sugared fried dough you dip in chocolate sauce, much more authentic I'm sure

The sliders looked good but I didn't get to try it. The sangria was good.

The menu is separated by different tapas category, such as hot, cold, meats, and vegetarian.

We tried the grilled rib eye steak, bang-bang shrimp, sauteed gambas, and pork taco. These and a $5 lunch hour white Sangria special, it came to $50 with tip.

But totally worth it!

The grilled rib eye steak were so succulent, they sat atop of pureed potatoes and was glazed with a mushroom demi. 

The bang-bang shrimp was really fun to eat, they were fried and battered, fiery shrimp on two tine heads of iceberg sections, drizzled with rosemary ranch sauce. These packed a bit of heat, which was a nice surprise.

You can get the gambas fried or sauteed. Our server recommended the sauteed and she was right. Three perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp were served in a ceramic flan dish, and swimming in brava garlic sauce, it reminded me a little bit of creole shrimp. 

The pork taco is indeed singular. But being glass half-full, it just made you slow down to appreciate each bite of this gorgeous, dressed up simple street food. Served on a white flour tortilla, generous strips of glazed, marinated pork belly danced with pineapple pico de gallo and avocado chunks.

The white Sangria was was amazing, refreshing, and beautifully garnished with fresh fruits.

This might sound weird, but go check out their bathrooms, they are covered floor to wall in beautiful, mini iridescent tiles. Only in Vegas! So pretty!",11,9,10

Since it is tapas, there are tons of things on the menu. We were a bit overwhelmed and didn't know what to pick. Thanks to our waiter. He gave us some really good suggestion. 

Here are the things that we ordered: 
1. TUNA-RASPBERRY SKEWER - beautiful presentation, refreshing. The sesame crust gave the tuna some really good texture. Unique dish. 

2. AVOCADO CANNELLONI - OH MY!!!! This was our favorite dish! When you look at it, it doesn't have the ""wow"" effect. But wait until you taste it! It is amazing! Who knew seaweed would have that much flavors! I wish I can eat this all day. 

3. White ceviche - Good, but not mind-blowing. It is a ceviche after all. Like the taro chips though.

4. FRESH CALAMARI A LA PLANCHA - 2nd favorite of the night! Tender calamari with tons of flavors. Great pair with the sweet caramelized onions. Very satisfying! Almost need a 2nd order!

5. Monkfish and pisto - Fish was seared crispy on the outside and cooked perfect. Really like the eggplant, zucchini and tomatoes. Good dish. 

6. Traditional spanish chicken croquetas - Crispy crust with creamy chicken bechamel filling. Pretty good, but not incredible. 

7. BEEF AND CHEESE - Interesting flavors. Beef was juicy and tender. Went so well with the sweet honey, creamy cheese and crunchy walnuts. 

8. Iberico black pig ribs - Thought we would love it. Flavors were good. But we ended up thinking the dish was on the heavy side. 

9. Churros - Not impressed. They ran out bu√±uelos, so we got churros. We have no idea what real churros taste like. Maybe Disney's churros have turned into the standard of churros. Anyhow, we didn't like it. I felt that the churros were too thin and over-fried. The chocolate dipping was nice. 

We were hungry, so we ordered that many things. Our bill was about $140 without taxes and tips. But I think 7 - 8 dishes would be fine for 2. Overall, service was great and fast. Food was tasty. We look forward to come back one day when we are in town.",3,1,2

I haven't always heard great things about the restaurant, so admittedly, I'd written it off as a place that wasn't worth my time or money. I'm glad to say that I was impressed with the selections and enjoyed my meal.

First impressions: Gorgeous space! I like how open the restaurant is and what a great decision with the beautiful Aria lobby next to it. The decor is has a touch of elegance and great colors and patterns. The large, heavy armchairs were comfortable and a nice change from the simple dining chairs.

Lobster Gazpacho: Chilled Spanish tomato soup, lobster meat, and cherries. The soup had a light and rounded flavor, however, I couldn't necessarily taste the lobster. If this wasn't a gazpacho, it would be really delicious served warm\/hot.

Wild Mushroom Soup: Shiitake, crimini, and oyster mushrooms; mushroom foie gras crouton. This was another first course option. The soup had a surprising depth of flavor that I wasn't expecting from mushrooms (not sure if the broth was just mushrooms). Delicious. Also, the mushroom foie gras crouton was really nice.

Salmon: Scottish Salmon, creamy whipped potato, and horseradish cream. The salmon was well-prepared and all of its accompaniments worked nicely with it. Solid salmon dish.

Rib Eye Steak: Roasted Chinese eggplant, french fries, and mushroom demi sauce. I ordered my ribeye ""rare plus"" and they delivered! It was absolutely beautiful. I wanted to sing a symphony. Besides the steak being perfect, the demi sauce was delicious and I loved the eggplant as well. The fries were great.

Flan de Turron: Almond creme custard, whipped cream, and turron. Okay, this dessert was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever eaten. I love custard, however, I don't always find flans always pleasant because the texture needs to be just right. This flan was perfection. The custard held its shape, but was extremely creamy and the flavors of the turron and the flan created this explosion! What a great way to end a meal!

I would like to come back and try some of their tapas, but the prices are a deterrent. For now, I would definitely recommend a meal here during RW.",6,1,3

For drinks, we wanted a pitcher of sangria but wasn't sure which one so they provided us samples of each. After sampling them, we decided getting a Pitcher of Muscat Sangria, which consisted muscat wine, apples, peaches, grapes, and golden raisins. It was light, sweet, and refreshing but strong at the bottom.

Since we wanted to eat light, we shared four tapas and a large paella. The Fried Calamari consisted of lightly breaded calamari rings and tentacles topped with jalapeno and bell peppers and served with spicy tomato sauce and herb garnished garlic aioli. The Pan Manchego consisted of country baguette topped with diced fresh tomato and a slice of aged manchego cheese. The Spanish Chicken Croquettes consisted of panko breaded croquettes filled with shredded chicken and b√©chamel and served with lemon-pepper alioli. The Lobster Salad consisted of country baguette topped with avocado, tomatoes, corn, and lobster and served with baby greens salad. The Mixta Paella consisted of saffron flavored long grain rice cooked with lobster, mussels, shrimp, chicken, spanish pork chorizo, and vegetables.

I think they should have been more consistent. after eating a few which were good but not too spicy, a few of us has one that was tongue-burning hot so we stopped eating them. the spice level should be the same for each. it shouldn't be a crap shoot to see if you're getting a normal one or habanero level heat  

service seemed okay, but not very personal. no explanations given to any of the dishes that came out, they were just placed on the table. the music (you're basically in the lobby of the Aria) is so loud it's hard to have a normal conversation.

Lobster Gazpacho,  a chilled Spanish tomato soup with chunks of lobster meat. It was so refreshing and delicious. I wanted the bowl to never end. One of my favorite dish of the night.  (Rating: 5\/5)

Calamari A La Plancha, perfectly cooked calamari drizzled with a lemon parsley extra virgin olive oil. The addition of  sweet caramelized onions was a nice balance. (Rating: 4\/5)

Next, we had the Porto belly, a cute play on words. It was one huge portobello mushroom topped with generous amount of spinach, bits of bacon and potbelly. A delicious mix of mushrooms and fatty pork. (Rating: 5\/5)

Mediterranean Bass, two nice size pieces grilled perfectly moist with a crispy skin drizzled with a Donostiarra sauce and garnished. (Rating: 4\/5)

Creamy Risotto was very good, with bits of wild mushroom and melted aged manchego cheese mixed throughout. (4\/5)

Yellow tail ""teridito"" was a smaller size dish, nevertheless fresh. Three pieces of  thinly sliced crudo yellowtail topped with thinly crispy sweet potatoes horseradish cream and ponzu sauce. (Rating: 4\/5)

Braised short ribs was to die for, soft, tender and flavorful and came with a size of stringy crispy sweet potatoes and was cooked into a cipolinni glac√©.  (Rating: 5\/5)

We ended the night with dessert. We couldn't decide on one so I got the Molten Chocolate Cake which was warm with chocolate oozing out of the center dusted with a generous portion of powdered sugar. The orange jelly, blood orange sorbet was the perfect cooling contrast to the piping warm dessert.  (Rating: 5\/5)

We also had the pistachio tart- almond cake with almond ice cream. This may have been m least favorite dish of the evening given that it tasted like a regular cookie to me, nothing too special. (Rating: 3\/5)

Next, I had the seared scallops which were cooked perfectly.  Well executed, although not particularly innovative.

I had the short ribs which were a little bit undercooked this time around (the last time I ate here, it was perfectly cooked and tender).  The flavors still were great and the mashed sweet potatoes matched the short ribs well.

I tried the molten chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet.  I like the contrast in temperatures and the presentation was nice as well with the chocolate cake in one corner, while the sorbet occupied the diametric opposite corner, bridged by a stripe of chocolate.

I came here with my husband and two friends last weekend. Despite the fact that my husband and I always stay at Aria, this was somehow the first time we have had the pleasure of dining here. I am vegetarian (technically pescetarian, as I will eat fish sometimes, but generally no other seafoods) At first glance of this menu, I went crazy. I could eat nearly everything and it all sounded amazing. 

I wanted to get all the breads, but my friend rightfully said that would be far too many carbs :) So we went with the olive bread focaccia and the tomato manchego. Both were delish, but I preferred the flavor of the tomato manchego. Simple, but the perfect bite.

The potato bravas was superb. Probably the best I've ever had. Definitely don't think like I almost did, that this dish is too simple\/boring to get here. 

On that note, DO NOT skimp out on the tortilla. It's the best I've ever had. So so tasty. The only negative is the amount of aoili on top of the bread that comes with the tortilla. I pay very close attention to the ingredients on the dishes I order, so I knew it was aoili and approached it as such. My dinner guests did not - they thought it was cheese, so they ate it all up and made some faces. Understandably so.

I had a few bites of some other dishes such as the Branzino and scallops skewer, both were good, but the others listed above were superb, totally worth the price tag.

The restaurant itself has a really nice set up and we had no trouble getting a reservation on a Saturday night. They sat us at these little 4 tops around the bar, very cute and nice set up.

If I had a money tree, this place would be one of my fancy-pants favorites.

We ate here back in December, right after it opened, so please forgive the tardiness - I hope nothing has changed.  

Utterly fabulous food.  Highlights were the flat iron steak, pintxo de chorizos, stuffed dates, gambas, pan manchego, and the valenciana paella - our waiter's recommendation, and he was right on.  We also had the padron peppers, which I could have done without, but my mom loved them, and the chicken skewer and flat calamari, which were favorites of my dad.  Desserts were awesome too, and together with a bottle of wine and some other drinks, we clocked in just under $300 (plus tip) for a party of three.  

I love this place.  If I'm on a budget (which I usually am), I'll stick with Firefly for tapas, but if we're celebrating - or someone else is footing the bill - then we're definitely coming back to Julian Serrano.

One silly note - there are apparently multiple valet drop-off points at Aria, and we chose the wrong one in proximity to the restaurant.

We spent $97.44 on a partial lunch, and it only sated me for a couple hours before I had to buy a real lunch elsewhere.  Two of our $16-or-so plates turned out to be three small bites.  They should at least make them four so parties of 2 can split them more easily.  If the portions had been larger or the prices lower, I would rate this place more highly.

Julian Serrano has a lovely, spacious restaurant located inside of the Aria hotel. The restaurant is very open and the colors are vibrant. I came here ok a Wednesday for dinner and the place was only half full. We were seated right away since we did have a reservation time. Once seated we glanced over the menu and quickly ordered a couple red sangrias before we ordered our food. 

\/\/ SERVICE \/\/ 
Our waiter had an extensive knowledge of the menu which was great. He helped us decide on a couple different items to choose from since the menu can be overwhelming at first. 

\/\/ FOOD \/\/ 
Black rice: Fresh calamari, lobster, saffron, squid ink. This was my most favorite dish of the night. The seafood was fresh, the black rice had great flavor and the aioli that they put on the rice was delicious with a strong garlic flavor to it. 3.5\/5

Atun de hijada: Tuna belly, lemon, tomato. I thought the tuna belly was very flavorful, but unfortunately the lemon mashed potatoes on the bottom did not compliment the fish at all. The potatoes were really sweet, and had almost like a custard texture. 2\/5

Pepito de ternera: Beef ribeye cap, pretzel bread. I thought this was a unique dish. The bread was burnt on the outside so all you taste is burnt bread which was unpleasant. The beef however was extremely tender and cooked perfectly. I wish they just added a little more seasoning to the beef. 2.5\/5

Rabo de toro: Oxtail, Iberian pork, mashed potatoes. I liked the presentation of this dish, but the flavors did not go well together. 2.5\/5

Overall, I was pretty disappointed with the food at Julian Serrano. From my perspective, many of the dishes had flavorful components to it, but when you combine all of the different components, the flavors did not compliment each other. I will most likely not come back to Julian Serrano to dine again.",3,2,2

The atmosphere was entertaining all by itself and the staff consistently helpful. After being told the mushroom soup could be prepared vegetarian, we proceeded to eat the most cozy mushroom soup ever. If you need Thanksgiving without Thanksgiving, go for the mushroom soup.  The marinated olives are probably the best olives I've ever eaten, and I snacked on them throughout the rest of the meal (also, I've never had a pickled garlic clove but those were delicious to eat whole, what's the secret?) The sauteed baby spinach was a bit mushy and wet for my taste and the asparagus nothing to write home about. The stuffed peppers were great.

For dessert we got churros and Santiago's cake. I wish I could have had four scoops of the ice cream they put on that cake. The churros were just a pretty-good vehicle for the AMAZING spicy chocolate. Could have taken home a vat of that chocolate.

The virgin sangria was refreshing as heck.",0,0,0

I love food, with a passion. I consider myself well versed in most countries offerings,  but Spanish tapas are still an unknown territory for me. I'll eat anything delicious and left the ordering to my more experienced dinner date.

Baby eels, yes, baby eels. I love baby eels now. Tender, juicy, full of flavor. Wish I could get some baby eels right now. 

Yes the plates are small, but that's the beauty of tapas. You order several plates and share. The chefs did a great good of bringing out the natural flavors in all our choices and the champagne pairing we chose with the help of our knowledgeable waiter made it a perfect meal to start out our stay at Aria.

We had ordered 5 items to share and were satisfied with each one. I then took my husband back here last night and had a totally different experience. The food was still great. We had the ribeye, stuffed peppers, mushroom risotto, and charcuterie plate.  We were still hungry and wanted to order more but had gotten impatient with the slow service that we decided to just leave. I am a huge tapas fan so know what to expect and have to say - the portions were tiny. We had some laughs over this. If we had been a group of 4, each person would have gotten about one bite of each thing. At the high on-the-strip prices, that means you would be ordering (and spending) a lot. 

I think we either got a bad server or she was having a bad night, because she was nice enough but hard to come by. We almost reached the point of asking the hostess if someone could get us our check to pay since the food and wine were long gone and we couldn't seem to even make eye contact with our server the few times she walked by. A different guy had taken our wine order and served the bottle for us, but we weren't sure if he was the sommelier or just another server helping her out. He didn't really say. Odd experience in that sense. Given my first experience had great service, I'm left with a really hit or miss feeling. Maybe try it a third time as the tie breaker?",2,0,1

Usually with tapas you want to order a bunch for the table to share but when they're $11-$18 each, that's a little difficult unless you want to break the bank. This place is definitely good if you're looking for a small bite before dinner or if you need something to hold you over. The tapas come with free bread and an oil\/vinegar mixture, which is nice.

Edited: I saw a couple review talking about great prices. Give me a break! Check the menu price. We went to a Korean BBQ place with high rating the next day. We spent about 2 tapas amount to have a good meal for 5 of us. My sons love the BBQ place and laughed at me wasting my money here.",0,0,0

We weren't too hungry, so we ordered 5, and only one alcoholic beverage. He wasn't happy. He said, ""Well, that's a start,"" and left us with a menu in case we needed to order anything else, which we would have if he had come back to our table to acknowledge our presence. Not once while we were eating did he come back to check how we were doing, if the food was okay, if we wanted more drinks, or if we wanted to order more food - which we did. He didn't even remove the dirty plates. I understand that he wasn't going to make a large tip off of our table, but this service and his attitude were really beyond the pale. We were going to order dessert, but my nephew, who wanted to leave a $1 tip, didn't feel like we should spend any more money after being treated so rudely. I normally tip 18-25%.

He also helped in making recommendations and narrowing down our food choices from the extensive menu. In all we ordered: Pan Serrano, Lobster Fideua, Goat Cheese Salad, Roasted Sweet Apple and Foie Gras, imported Spanish Serrano Ham, Queso Fresco and Santiago's Cake. The Pan Serrano was so good that I wished it was full size and subsequently ordered the Seranno Ham. The only dish that fell a bit short was the Salad. There was only one small medallion of Goat Cheese. I wished there has been more. Beside that, everything else was amazing. Our daughter said the Lobster was the best she has had. My husband gave the same rave review for the Foie Gras.

The manager passed us twice without noticing that we had not yet been attended to, and the three hostesses engrossed in conversation did not notice that no one had been to our table yet.

This place would be getting less than 3 stars if I actually paid to eat here.  Servings are really small for some of the dishes and price is not cheap.  But since I didn't have to foot the bill, I could just enjoy the food without worrying about cost.

Everything we had was pretty decent.  Some standouts though included:

Black pig pintxo
Tuna cones
Huevos estrellados - this was amazing. Huge serving of fries + chorizo + egg on top - it's the perfect drunk food!
Salmon with truffle

The service was spotty.  Our party ordered risotto and an order of tuna cones that never arrived.  Our server also recommended 2-3 dishes per person, but I think we ended up needing around 4 dishes\/person to get full.

Dining ambiance:  pretty terrible.  It was later in the evening (around 8pm), and the place was packed.  Noise level was out of control.  It was hard to even hear the person sitting next to you.  Shouting at your dining companions never makes for a fun time.

The food was actually really good. The mushroom risotto was creamy and delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce that was drizzled on the plate. The bomba was like a meatball and had a nice spicy kick to it and was delicious as well. 

For an upscale-ish place, service was only so-so. The waitress wasn't very attentive and I think she judged us because we didn't order 10+ dishes like the couple seated next to us.

I'll start out with positive words by saying the restaurant is beautiful, clean and a well thought out menu. Some of our dishes were yummy, inventive & creative - oxtail and the stuffed dates. The portion sizes are awesome and for strip prices it's suit to fit. 

The pitfalls of this establishment was the service. When I walked up to the hostess stand, a man in a suit (assuming a manager or a higher up) was stuck in his phone and the two hostesses were chatting. I had to interrupt them to let them know I was there. For the amount of money that you are paying, you can at least expect the server will inform you about the menu, what tapas are like (we had a newbie in the group) but it seemed to me the servers couldn't get out fast enough. I was eaves dropping on the table right beside me and heard they expressed the same concerns as their waiter was dull and uninterested. The food runners just dropped off the food, not a word, not what the dish was, an explanation how to eat it, not even eye contact. We asked a question and before we could get it out, their back was already turned walking away from us. I ordered a blah glass of sparkling wine and asked for a dash of elderflower (seriously like a bitters dash) and they said it would be a $3 up charge. On an already overpriced, not so tasty sparkling wine. No other restaurant I have ever been on the strip even bats an eye to that request because that's like asking for extra mint in your mojito. The vegetarian dishes were not good. The asparagus was bland, over priced and they shared the same sauce as the eggplant. The worst dish of the night was definitely the rice dessert. They burned sugar on top and stuffed in with sliced strawberries just to give it flavor because if it didn't have that, it'd be like eating hospital food. 

The worst part is as we were leaving, another gentleman in a suit behind the hostess stand and the hostess kept talking without thanking us, inviting us back or asking our feedback when we were exiting.

They're both classic spanish tapas, both trendy, both have won James Beard and Chef of the Year awards.  But whereas The Bazaar has a contemporary tapas menu, Julian Serrano does not.

Julian Serrano however, is just straight forward food.  It's like going to the zoo.

Lobster gazpacho - very flavorful soup with a great tomato taste. Yes, there's actually lobster meat in it!

Brava potatoes - omg I don't know what the spicy sauce was, but it was delicious! I wanted to drink it. The little cubed potatoes were crispy on the outside and were just perfect with the sauce. Of course, some got soggy at the end, but they were still good.

Salmon - Sourced from the same proprietor as the fish for Bar Masa next door. Two of my friends got this dish and it was THE best salmon they have ever had in their lives. These are girls that always order the fish option on any menu.

Pork chop - Delicious! It's a very large chop. It's very thick so you would think the outside would be dry, but it's not. Juicy all around.

Rice Pudding - This was probably the most disappointing dish. I wouldn't get it again.

Molten chocolate cake - YES! They make it well here.

I knew tapas were small plates and meant for sharing...but um, what is there to share?  Unless you're here for a snack or on a really strict diet, it may not be a good choice if you're hungry.  The 3 Stars is not just for SMALLER than normal portions, but the lack in flavor of some of the Tapas.

1.  Bacon wrapped stuffed dates:  1 star.  Isn't the bacon supposed to be salty to contrast the sweet date?  The whole thing was just too sweet and bacon was burnt and had no saltiness. 

2.  Pork Belly:  1 Star.  Not really pork belly, just a piece of roast pork.  One bite and it was all gone.  Nothing spectacular.

3.  Lobster skewers: 1 Star.  Just skip it. trust me.

Fortunately, there was a light at the end of the Tapas tunnel.  We decided to order the Mixed Paella and it turned out to be delicious!  It was one of the best paellas I've ever had.  For $50, enough to share...or feed one hungry person.

This is tapas, so the food is coming to you in small portions.  I love to eat, so while I'll like stuffing my face I exercised the compulsion to devour the plate in one bite.  Yes, you'll be nibbling a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  

As for the food, we tried a bunch but here are a few that stood out to me:

1) Ahi Tuna - Good dish, very fresh and tasty.
2) Lamb Chop - On the small side for sure, even for tapas in my opinion, but very tasty.
3) Eggplant - OK, I have a few words about the vegetarian Eggplant dish.  This one tasted like the chef dumped one of my great grandmother's mason jars of cold veggies out onto a plate and garnished it a bit.  This was the last dish we were served, and sadly, by far the most disappointing food of my whole trip.  The menu would be far better off without offering this one.

This restaurant lived up to the reputation of Julian Serrano and we didn't even have to travel to Spain.

The squid-ink paella topped with basil leaves that we ordered to accompany our tapas was outstanding. 

We had a host of tapas which were all good, some which I never had before: the croquettes, short ribs, sardines, and more. I love being surprised at the different preparations and tastes. Unfortunately, I was so eager to try some of the tapas that I forgot to take a picture.

We asked the waiter to pace our tapas so we wouldn't be overwhelmed. Besides, the small table wouldn't have been able to handle our orders. Although lacking the professionalism of what you'd expect from a restaurant as highly-touted as Serrano, she was friendly and accommodating. 

We ordered an excellent bottle of wine from Spain to help down the tapas and two hours later, all in all, a really good dining experience.

A Friday night, on the strip, and a quick dinner?  Sounds like Mission: Impossible!

Well, I had done some yelp-homework driving over and read a few reviews from yelpers I trust, and figured we might get into Julian Serrano fast and have a decent meal.  Everyone on yelp said potatoes bravas but my weird fiance dislikes potatoes so we did not go for that.

We got in fast (they said 15 minute wait, it was 5), and our server was really quick and friendly.  The two friends ordered entrees (lamb chops and chicken breast) but Eric R. and I opted for tapas.  We shared the calamari a la plancha with caramelized onions (definitely one of my faves), the frisee-smoked salmon-anchovy salad (was okay), the ahi tuna cones (too mayo-y and nothing special), and the duck confit with orange (also a fave).  Eric ordered the pizza special and the lobster-pineapple skewers for himself.  He seemed surprised that I didn't want ceviche, but I ordered to share and he doesn't like ceviche.  Plus he ate more than me anyway with his own 2 tapas.

We also split a pitcher of Sangria ($44, much higher than off the strip of course) but it was about 1.5 glasses per person for $11 each rather than 1 for $9 each, so it seemed to be a good deal.  Overall, it was pricey and okay, the service was good, but we don't plan to return.",3,1,3

The Mister and I came for a Valentine's Day brunch since we had $75 credit from the Aria Hotel, if it weren't for that reason I doubt we would have eaten here. 

Service that day was kind of off; we didn't know who our server was since we had over five different people helping us. And when we needed to order more drinks and tapas no one was around to take our order; so we had to ask the Host to help us out and of course he apologized for the rest of the staff that wasn't around.

Stuffed Dates - $8
Marinated Garlic Chicken and Mushroom Skewers - $9 
Coca Chorizo - $10

For two people, we split an order of paella (takes 40 mins to make, enough for 2 according to their menu, enough for 4 if you are ordering some tapas). We started off the meal with the sliders, ceviche, and chicken croquetas. We might have ordered a dish too many as we were waiting for our paella, but oh well! I loved their croquetas. Crispy outer layer with a creamy, juicy chicken filling. It's like a bite sized pot pie! Although the dish is quite petite, it can be quite heavy. The ceviche I ordered contained white fish, octopus, scallops served with these chips reminded me of some root (I'm guessing its a lotus chip. ) it's a good light and appetizing small dish. The chips balances out the not too overwhelming lime juice. The tentacles weren't tough to chew, not overdone. 

We had the mixed paella with Spanish chorizo, lobster,  mussels, chicken, artichokes, peas. Some of the other paella sounded tastier but I couldn't decide between chorizo and lobster so why not both? It's a fragrant dish served fresh on its hot plate, with the steam with juicy chicken and fresh seafood seeping out of the saffron rice. The dish isn't extremely dry, overlooked, or salty. It has been way too long since I've had paella like this.

I couldn't finish half my paella since I do want to make some room for desserts. We split the molten chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet. After tasting some crappy fake blood orange flavored sugary ice with food coloring, I'm glad to have some real blood orange sorbet that is on point! It's a must for me to have some tarty flavors in case the chocolate gets too sweet and overwhelming. The chocolate cake itself is actually semisweet. Good on its own, great with the sorbet. That warm and cold mixture just gets you when you're indoors at somewhere with super high AC but you're still in the desert. The cake is not dense at all, very airy textured, just enough to hold the warm chocolate filing in the center.

Definitely worth my dollars. Can't wait to come back and try more tapas!",1,1,1

Place was beautiful and didn't seem crowded when we got there around 7pm. At first our waiter was very nice and attentive but soon seemed extremely agitated. I get it, there was a lot of us and I can give people benefit of the doubt and I know he had other tables to attend to but I thought we were all pleasant toward him. Everyone ordered their food and received it except 3 of us. I waited patiently and then finally said something wondering where my steak plate was. They brought it out and I was shocked, it was small but surprisingly very good. Small strips of steak was placed on small rounds of pur√©ed mashed potatoes and it was really good. Just as I had finished ANOTHER steak plate arrived that no one had ordered. Apparently the waiter asked for me to be served as soon as possible but somehow another order was put in for the same thing. I'm guessing they never even started mine and gave me someone else's order. They asked if I wanted it and I declined and then the waiter said ""looks like you liked it, couldn't hurt to have another one"". So I accepted it, assuming it would be free, with all the mistakes and me waiting much longer than anyone else. After two plates of $20 steak and potatoes I was full and satisfied. Price wise each dish should've been $10 for the amount of Food you get. I also got a cheese platter I think for $17 ish and for that price and what you get it is absolutely NOT worth it. I can't believe they overcharge so much for this. It should be $10 and even that is still too much. 

Now my girlfriends actually had still never gotten one of the plates they ordered. I think it was lobster or crab or something. They asked multiple times when it was coming and they kept saying ""it was coming"". An hour and a half later this dish still had not arrived. Then finally our waiter says that they didn't have any lobster or crab left. Hm, what were they apparently making then? Finally, they asked for it to be taken off the bill. A few minutes later the same waiter we've had all night returns with the bill with my ""extra"" steak and their never arrived food on it. Oh and another girl thought hers was too spicy and needed that taken off the bill as well, which they failed to do as well. Oh did I mention a glass of wine is $16 at the lowest and a glass of Figi water WHICH WE NEVER ASKED FOR was $10 each??!!!! I'm appalled honestly at the prices. Also, since it's customary on parties over 8 (or is it 10 people?) you HAVE to tip 18%. Ridiculous and not worth it. I'm only giving it 3 stars because my steak dish was very yummy. Service was beyond slow as well. If we have to pay 18% tip they should have one waiter to only our table because he seemed way too distracted and upset with us. Oh and 15 mins before I knew we had to leave I said ""we have to leave by 9 so we need the bill. It didn't come til 25 mins later and was wrong. We didn't leave there til 9:40 because of the mistakes on our bill. Seriously, you need money, patience and a lot of time on your hands to deal with just getting food here.",0,0,0

Mostly hits and few misses, but something for everyone. Eat a little, eat a lot. Eat quickly, eat slowly. Watch the kitchen, watch the people in the casino. The staff could not be nicer. They have a gluten free menu, which I'm grateful for, but it's probably an 8th the size of their regular menu, and it's not up to date. It would be REALLY helpful if they were more specific or more adaptable. Because I asked a lot of questions (I'm a huge pain in the neck being gluten and dairy free) and although I said I don't need to worry about cross contamination or tiny amounts of gluten, my crab black rice came out with bread crumbs on top. Obviously, that would have been super easy to leave off. Maybe it would change the balance of the dish, but I would understand that and be happy and healthier!

We started the evening with a pitcher of Sangria.  It was definitely the strongest Sangria I've ever had, but it made the Cirque du Soleil show after dinner much more entertaining =)  Between two people, five tapas were enough.  

First, we ordered the rabo de toro, which was oxtail and pork served over mashed potatoes.  This was SOOOOO good, and already got us excited for what was coming.

Next, we had the black rice consisting of squid and lobster meat in a nice squid ink\/saffron sauce that left the most amazing taste in our mouths.  Needless to say, this was our favorite dish of the night, and makes me incredibly hungry just thinking about it! 

The next three items were very good, but hard to compare with the black rice.  We had the grilled rib eye steak, which was actually pretty dry even though we ordered it medium rare.  It was a very thin piece of meat, so I understand that it is easy to overcook.  I would've given Julian Serrano 5 stars but for this overly dry meat.  We also ordered the steamed mussels and mixed seafood ceviche.  Both were very good, but again, hard to satisfy us after the amazing black rice.

All in all, I would DEFINITELY come back and try their other dishes.  We didn't order the paella last time because it takes 45-60 minutes to prepare.  Just give yourself extra time if you're planning to watch a show after.",5,1,3

My date and I had a reservation before seeing a show.  We were seated promptly and greeted by our server Juan who was very friendly.  I asked if there were any good ""must have"" orders for cocktails or food and he made recommendations.  The cocktail that I ordered was spicy and had a pepper on the edge of the glass...I'm Mexican and can take the ""heat"" but it wasn't only ""hot"" but also an infusion of tastes...no, not boozy (who wants that?!) just many fruity tastes mixed with spice.

I'm not a big fan of raw fish, but Juan recommended the yellowtail.  I was feeling adventurous so I ordered and tried it and OMG it was delicious!!  Those little sweet potato shreds and horseradish sauce just took it to a level of DELICIOUS.

We also ordered the steak tartar, ahi tuna cones and stuffed piquillo peppers (stuffed with goat cheese...perfectly done!)

If we'd had more time before going to see the Eagles concert, I'm sure we would've explored and ordered more.

The happy hour runs Sunday - Thursday from 4-5:30 pm. Yes it's a bit early, but completely worth it. We went on Sunday and got there slightly after 4 pm. The restaurant was pretty empty, so it was no problem getting two seats at the bar.

We enjoyed the white sangria for $4.50 per glass (red and sparkling sangria will run you $5) as well as a ton of food that cost between $3.50 - $7.00. We enjoyed the spanish tortilla, brava potatoes, pan tomate, fried calamari, and the stuffed dates from the happy hour menu. We also ordered the scallops from the regular menu. Just like my last visit to Julian Serrano, our scallops were cooked to absolute perfection and melted in my mouth. It was truly the highlight of our meal.

In my case, the server (Victor H) was not very engaged in the customers, another staff guy ( a cook) noticed that I needed a sharp knife for the lamb dish and provided one (which Victor should have recognized).

People who enjoy being ripped off and know nothing of food quality will be pleased with Julian Serrano, but the rest us, who have standards and work hard for our money, will be incredibly disappointed. 

It's hard not be attracted to this restaurant, with it's dazzling modern decor, and long line of people of waiting, you'd think it's a sure thing ... only it's not. My epic fail of a meal started with a $16 lamb chop tapa, which came with 1 lamb chop, ONE, which translates to about 3 bites of food. I get that tapas are small, but for $16, that's roughly $5 a bite! In Spain tapas are either free or extremely cheap, so this is just ridiculous. I also saw a stuffed pepper appetizer come across my table that featured 2 teeny tiny red peppers (about the size of half a crayon each). The tapas I sampled were good, but for those prices, they should have had gold nuggets or loose diamonds in them. 

Next up was paella, at $22 per person, this was literally the most offensively bland dish I have ever had in my life. EVER. And we waited 40 minutes for it! The Chef might as well have come out and openly laughed in my face at that point, because that's how I felt, like a damned fool. Rice-a-roni from a box is exponentially better that this crap.

Every single tapas was made with perfect care and tenderness, we ordered about 4-5 dishes... ceviche, scallops, something beefy on a skewer. The only thing I would've reselected would be the paella--the combination of rabbit, chicken and sausage didn't feel or taste right. Rabbit- what a weird mental picture, I only nibbled on what I thought was rabbit, tasted like chicken with less flavor, it felt so wrong yet still so wrong.

Next time, I would order their seafood paella instead. Their strong expresso shot with their hardened sugar pop made exclusively for coffee skinny dipping was a nice finishing touch, for this is what got me from here to our next destination- Haze, one level down.

Since we weren't super hungry our plan was to just get a bunch of the small plates for our group of four. We ordered five plates (the grilled eggplant,  white ceviche, bacon wrapped date, risotto and chicken skewers), thinking this should be plenty. Then we waited, waited, waited some more, all the while having to practically shout at each other across the table since the place was so loud- even after the place emptied out a bit, the volume of their music drowned us out. Finally our sangria came, it was alright, nothing great. 

When the food arrived we were not impressed, the bacon wrapped date and the ceviche were both decent, but nothing amazing. The risotto however was undercooked, the chicken skewer (actually ended up being a SINGLE chicken skewer) was overcooked and dry, the eggplant so-so.

Server was lukewarm, clearly not thrilled to be there.

But this review is more about the food than the staff.  We went here two or three years ago and were blown away by every dish.  This year, not so much.

It seemed like some great Julian Serrano ideas that weren't really clicking.  The Jamon Iberico Croquettes were just kind of mushy.  The flatbread was good but not crazy good.  The Black Rice with calamari was nice.  Yellowtail Tiradito, excellent.

It's crazy how quickly the food comes out... make you feel comfortable not ordering everything at once... easing into the meal and not guessing at how much to order.  But this was at the pre-christmas lull.

We stumbled upon Julian Serrano after previous dinner plans had fallen through.  They were able to squeeze in our table of 7 without a reservation.

At the bar, they have three types of Sangria, red, white and blush.  Of course, I tried the red sangria which was probably one of the best I've tried.  It was not too sweet which means less of a headache later in the night or in the morning.

Here's what we went with:
      -Octupus:  Octopus on top of potato in a butter paprika sauce
      - Black Rice: Calamari, lobster, sofrito and squid ink
      -Mixed Paella: lobster, chicken, mussels, chorizo, veggies

The tapas where some of the best I've ever had and the Black Rice was the star of the show.  It was so different and so good, I can't think of anything I could compare it to.  The Paella was good, but not great.  I would recommend spending your money on the extensive tapa selection that is available.",0,0,0

It's kind of open dining where you can see Aria from the interior.  A new concept I think that is happening with new restaurants at new hotels.

I did make an open table reservation and I was the one who was late (but I called). The table was ready right away.

Things I tried based on reviews:
- Brava Potatoes:  Pretty good.. I loved the tomato sauce that it was served with.  I wasn't that fond of the aioli but the tomato was really good.
- Tuna Tartare cones:  Comes with 3 cones.  It was okay.  I didn't think it tasted anything more than tuna in cones.  
- White Ceviche:  Mostly fish.  It was okay.. served with some sort of fried chips
- Paella:  Got the seafood one with lobster.. expensive.. about 40 but it was DELICIOUS.  Probably the best paella I've had in a long time... or maybe it was good because I hadn't eaten in a while.

I would go back just for the paella.  I would try some other things on the list if we had more people.. but it was overall the right amount for two people.",1,2,1

We had to order them when a friend we ran into raved that these were exactly like the ones she tried in Spain.... and she had just come back from Spain a week before. SLURP. I could eat them all day long!! 

Oh, don't get me wrong. The Sangria (red, for sure... the white was OK but the red blew the white one out of the water!) was fantastic, as were the White Tiradito; the Octopus; and the White Anchovy Fillets (very balanced -- I'm not a huge anchovy fan but these anchovies were really fantastic and not too fishy). 

Decent but not fantastic options: the golden and red beet salad (the citrus was a bit tart for my taste); mixed seafood ceviche (while this version is very good, the sampler trio at Lolita's Cantina is better -- see my previous review); and the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (too much goat cheese and not enough peppers).

Between four hungry gentlemen we got away with 8 small plate tapas and one paella and everyone was quite full afterwards.  It's a nicely decorated restaurant in Aria. Here are some thoughts on the food:

- Meatballs - these had an excellent texture and the meat sauce was perfectly sweetened.  A very enjoyable dish
- Sliders - don't get this - only came with two sliders and the bread was a bit dry and overall not very original or inspired
- Black rice - this is an actual dish and I found very delectable.  The price soaked in squid ink (?) was well seasoned and the octopus and seafood added some interesting texture to the bite
- Tuna sashimi on seaweed salad - I would not order this, just get it at an actual japanese restaurant and you'll be much happier
- Paella - definitely order this when you sit down as it takes 40 mins to cook.  We ordered the mix paella and it was very enjoyable.  The mix of chicken and seafood was nice and it wasn't overly salty.
- Garlic Chicken - this was a surprisingly tasty dish.  It was simple but the flavor was excellent and the texture of the chicken was moist and soft on the inside with a thin but noticeable flour based covering.

The cocktails were OK but nothing to write home about.  

Why did it only get three stars?  Well our waiter who was a nice chap throughout the meal offered us an appetizer, a feta cheese, tomato, and bread type of dish.  When he offered this to us, he said ""i'll bring you out this appetizer"".  At the end of the meal, when we ordered 4 espressos, he said ""i'm going to bring you out coffee with liquer"".  In both cases, his tone gestures insinuated that we would be comped these small ""extras"" but when we saw the final bill, he had charged us.  The coffee drinks alone were $14 each.  Anyways, just an annoying thing for people to have to deal with and presumptuous that we'd want to pay for the extras.  

So all in all, the food was above average but the incident with the waiter brought down the otherwise delightful experience to two stars.",1,0,0

I wanted to check out the new City Center, so on our way out of Vegas we head over- holy moly, this place is huge!  As we're walking around and trying desperately to find a place to eat, I spot Julian Serrano.  Tapas?  Yum!  So we try it out... (one of my many bad decisions in Vegas...)

It was around 12-1ish (lunchtime), and there weren't too many people seated, but they gave us a table front and center of the entrance.  Not a problem, but that table was rockier than a mountainside!  I told the hostess about the problem, and she quickly alerted the manager, and he came to fix it... with paper... while we were just sitting there.  After a minute or so to no avail, I exasperatingly asked if we could just be moved.  Geez, no brainer, people!!!!!!  NEXT PROBLEM!  Our waitress was slower than molasses.  Took forever to order, forever to get our drinks, her attention, etc... it was a nightmare (maybe her first stint at waitressing? Her shaky hands couldn't even fill our waters without spillage all over the table)!  

Since the area was open space, and it's right next to the entrance\/exit to the mall (or maybe the A\/C was on waaay too high), but it was FREEZING, which quickly rendered our food cold.  I was a Marisa-sicle and just wanted to get the heck out of there.  Only brightside was that the food was good, but def not worth all of the issues.  By the time I finally found our waitress and asked for our bill (and waited foreverrrrrrr for her to get it to us), we find that she billed us incorrectly.  FOREVER minutes later, her manager finally hands us our corrected bill.  By the end of our lunch I was completely unhappy and cold.  SADFACE.",8,5,4

Oh Julian, your tapas on the strip is over-priced but its worth every penny.

PRICE: Tapas adds up after a while. At Firefly, most of my orders are in the $4-8 price range. At Serrano, my usual orders are in the $10-16. That's nearly double what I normally spend but on occasion, I like to splurge and enjoy a more upscale meal in a setting 100% more luxurious than local favorite Firefly.

FOOD: You get what you pay for. My favorites at Firefly are stuffed dates, shrimp ceviche, and lamb skewers. I've tried each of their counterparts at Serrano. And I have to admit that they do each one better. The flavors are more complex and refined. The dates are melt-in-your-mouth good. The quality of meat (in this case lamb) at Serrano is more tender and less game-y. I've tried all of the ceviches here and each and every one is extremely fresh and flavorful. Firefly's ceviche tends to be a little heavy on the lemon and on occasion I'll get a fishy one. I tend to order more seafood at Serrano as well. I feel like all the hot seafood tapas I've ordered here are spot on. Some of the best seafood dishes I've eaten in Vegas--period.

SANGRIA: I'm sorry Serrano, but I have to say Firefly does this one better. I don't doubt for a second that there's a lot involved in making the sangria here. But there's something so familiar and delicious about the red wine sangria at Fireflys. The delicate balance of fruit and wine flavor has been perfected. And hey, you can't beat the 50% off pitchers of Sangria during Firefly Happy Hour.

SERVICE: In a fine dining setting, I'm very particular about my service. If I'm paying a fine dining price & tip, I expect to be waited on appropriately. Every time I've been here my server has been quite attentive and friendly. I've only once been dissatisfied with my service; but it was a holiday and the place was ridiculously crowded.

If your wondering if its worth the money, then YES! Don't hesitate because you think you get a better value at Firefly. Firefly will always be a favorite close to my heart but when I want to eat a little finer and I want to pay for it--Julian Serrano is my upscale tapas of choice.

I like this place, but I don't love it, and I really wanted to be wow'd by the food here.  They're in Aria, so I expected fabulous flavors and textures, but this place didn't deliver on either except for dessert [I'll get to that in a second].

I made reservations online for 4pm before a happy hour and Viva Elvis event that we had to get to.  We walked in and immediately loved the open feel of the restaurant; however, the decor looked almost tacky with those black, glossy leafless trees around part of the dining area.  Other than that, the layout was pretty nice and we were seated away from the crowd as i requested.

We started off with tapas and stuck with it rather than ordering a sandwich or paella.  From beef and cheese to an avocado cannoli, the tapas aren't even worth getting into very much.  I wanted that incredible flavor profile and excellent textures on the plates; however, the beef tapas, for example, was all soft with no counterpart, and the avocado cannoli was all creamy.  In terms of flavor, everything was seasoned as a restaurant of that caliber should do, but in terms of exciting my palette and making me say ""mmm"", it didn't even come close to a small smolder.

For us, the only great part of the evening involved their Santiago cake dessert served with turron ice cream was outstanding.  Talk about textures and flavors!  The cake was thick, moist, and had just the right sweetness to it.  The ice cream was incredible.  i wanted a huge gallon of that to take home with a side of almond cake [as in one whole cake, please!]  I loved every bite and would've bought another order of it had it not been for my distended tummy.

Overall, a nice experience and one I will go back to, but not for the food.  I'm going back for the dessert.",3,0,2

The ahi tuna tempura was also very good, but it didn't go very far...probably too small of a portion if you ask me.

 We dined on Saturday, 2\/9, at 9:15.  I originally had made a reservation for 12, but 2 people did not make it. The hostess and server adjusted our table no problem.  Once my whole party arrived we were seated. After that, service declined until I spoke with the manager, Carlos.  

Our server was Janice and it appeared from the beginning as if she had checked-out for the evening.  Once we were seated we were handed ONE drink menu by our unknown server at the time.  Everyone was getting a little impatient while they waited for the drink menu to reach them.  It would have been helpful if water was at our table before we were seated.  I asked Janice for another drink menu then she brought over a couple more in ipad form.  Thank you. 

I also had to ask about the specials and the prix fix menu I read on the website.  Janice did not opening offer this information to us and did not communicate it to the whole table.  One of the girls in my party communicated our options to rest of the group.  Everyone except one person in our party opted for the Chef's Special Selection Menu, but Janice did not know that because she didn't bother going around to ask each person what they would like to order -  she assumed everyone was opting for the chef's menu. Someone  had to tell Janice that one person wanted to order off the regular menu.  

Janice is not all to blame for the lousy service.  The bussers and food runners were not on top of things and appeared not to communicate with one another.  A food runner brought our paella and Janice had to take it back to the kitchen.  After I spoke with the manager he informed me Janice would try to be more attentive.  Janice was great at refilling our waters and sangria, but she was still not very friendly towards us.

I appreciate Carlos for sending out dessert at the end of our meal to make up for the poor service, but unfortunately the poor service really did break our special group dinner.

(Well, he had some help from his talented kitchen of course!)

I really didn't think the prices were that outrageous. It is more expensive than some off the Strip tapas, but not all. Most of the things I ordered were $8-$10 because I stuck to the vegetables, and honestly, I was like a herbivore in heaven. I had the brava potatoes, beet salad and sauteed spinach, and every single bite made me drool and smile. The brava potatoes were a grown girl's answer to her childhood french fry obsession. Yes, they were cubes, but they delivered the same happiness as a golden FF. The spicy tomato and alioli stood in for ketchup and mayo. The beet salad hit all the right notes of citrus and sweet, and the spinach was magically savory. I would order every one of those dishes again in a minute. 

My husband was in pescatarian heaven. I think he may have depleted a small sea somewhere with all of the ocean life he was served. He looked like a boy in a candy shop when the waitress dropped off his Mariscada, which is more of a dinner entree (lobster tail, head-on shrimp, scallop, mussels, clams on a savory meringue $35). It was a lot of creatures for $35, and he devoured them with a smile. 

The environment is open, airy and hip. Nothing to complain about, unless you are planning a break-up dinner. This is not the spot as everyone will know your business. Our service was fine, perhaps a little slow given the empty restaurant.   

Perhaps 5-stars should be going to M-Life because since the rolling out of this new program we have been living the M-Life in a large way, and once again, we decided to try a spot that under normal circumstance we may have thought a not so tasty value. However, with some M-Life credit, we were thrilled! Yes, this was a comped dinner thanks to the husband's M-Life. So taking that into consideration, I deduct a star for fairness, as comped things sometimes taste a bit sweeter.

My advice is to stick to the least expensive items, as the talent of the chefs and quality of ingredients ensures that these items will be as delicious as the more spendy fare. I was impressed.",15,10,11

Been wanting to try Julian Serrano since that MEGAopolis City Center opened and today was the day.  First glance at the outdoor menu they offer daily lunch specials ranging from salads to Spanish influenced sandwiches.  Cheaply priced but not what guided me there, I wanted tapas damnit! The dining area is clean & pristine with a bright color scheme.  I sat at the bar and service was attentive.  Tried 3 items : 
*Pan manchego - toasted bread, tomato sauce, aged manchego 
Terrific flavor.  Simple but encompasses the flavors, temperatures & textures I was looking for

*Spanish chicken croquetas ( aka tentadora )
Chicken & bechamel 
I hoped and prayed this would be the star of show.  I pretended to continue reading my paper but I obsessed about these little nuggets of heaven once I saw them on the menu.  Damn it if it wasn't just my luck.... Disappointment! The crunch and outer texture was heavenly. The bechamel and chicken filling though left me wondering what I had done in a past life to deserve such a tease.   From now on I will refer to these croquetas as the temptress or since it's a Spanish restaurant -  Tentadora

Serrano Rice
Chorizo, chicken, rabbit, Frito, saffron
Final dish ordered and it ended on a high note.  All proteins were full of flavor and the sofrito was bold but not overwhelming.  

Mid-meal I decided to order a glass of red sangria ( maybe to drown my sorrows from the above listed temptress ).  One of the best red sangria I've had in some time.  If it wasn't the middle of the day and lunch time i could have easily enjoyed two-rty or so.  Not too sweet, great fresh fruit flavor and a nice kick of brandy at the end.  I surprised myself by not finishing it but it was the middle of the day and my work at Julian Serrano was complete.  Very good dining experience for $45 and I would come back for future visits.  Hopefully by that time I will have forgiven that EVIL tentadora.......",1,4,1

The $30 lunch menu was very satisfying. For starters we had the Wild mushroom soup and Lobster gazpacho. The latter is good for those who like sour flavors and can enjoy cold soup like me. We also got their Calamari which was perfect with the aioli sauce. For the main course we had Rib-eye steak and Garlic chicken.

Just wasn't what I expected from a name like Julian Serrano.  Against my wife's wishes, I kinda insisted that we try this place.  And I felt bad for dragging her there.  

Black rice (squid ink, hence the name) was the best of the bunch, but even with that nothing to write home about.  Everything else was - it pains me to say this - very average.  Considering the restaurant's name and the location, I have to say I was fairly disappointed.

Once we finally got our check, there was lots of confusion with splitting it and the waiter made it very clear that it would be a huge inconvenience for him and that it would take even longer because he had to go run our cards at the restaurant next door. Then as he was leaving, another served brought the risotto that was canceled and our server turned to him and told him to take it away because we had canceled it.

We finally decided on the pre-fixe menu and the GM came over with his own recommendation. He said he'd do something special for us similar to the pre-fixe menu...he just said ""Trust me"".

Holy eff.

We gave the go ahead and it wasn't long before our heads were whirling with a flurry of arms and dishes swarming around the table.

The steamed mussels with brandy were fresh and meaty and the pinxto de chorizos (mini pork chorizo with garlic mashed potatos) really hit the spot.  Tasted like comfort food.

It was 55 degrees outside and since the restaurant is near the door leading outside, a ton of cold air gets to the restaurant with really very little heating. This ruined the overall experience. I also wish the customer service was better. For being a relatively expensive restaurant, I expected better service.

Overall: the food is great but our overall experience wasn't as  great given poor service and cold temperature.

Recommendation: avoid this restaurant as there are a ton of better places in the area.",0,0,0

Atmosphere was like eating in a hotel lobby\/lounge (which you are).

Food was so so.  In order of preference:

Stuffed piquillo peppers - bright acidity of tomato sauce well grounded by goat cheese
White ceviche - tons of lime (almost soupy) but with great texture and flavor (suprising amount of spice)
Albondigas - light fine crumbly texture but short on flavor
Brava potatoes - soft on inside and light crisp on outside; go well with garlic aoili and creamy tomato sauce
Grilled calamari - meh...  it's just a miniature grilled (not even sliced) squid wih some lime and garlic and garnishing
Pintxo de chorizos - little smokies on a bed of mashed potatoes
Ahi tuna tempura - too much going on in this dish.. it was just weird..  go to a sushi place instead",1,1,0

We started out grand , quaint table for two and we are already ordering our drinks. Gin & tonic came out and it tasted off by the 3rd try the drink was brought out with just the gin and a closed bottle of tonic water. The tonic was spoiled at the bar. 
We loved the tapas we ordered very tasty, perfect for two. The fig tapas were just lovely! Now we are excited about the paella we ordered. When it arrived we noticed immediately it was small not really for two. Only two shrimps and maybe a scoop of rice each - oh! It smelled so fishy I was hesitant to eat it but took a bite and wish I hadn't! The rice was under cooked and the shrimp tasted bad. Really could not continue, we ask the server to take it away and I've lost my appetite. 
My water is refilled and I notice large particles floating in my glass! Ugh. I ask for bottled water and tell our server why. She does apologize and we know this is not her fault. The manager comes over and starts to explain why the paella taste so off and this is just how they make it here, he does not apologize or offer anything to us. I am beyond ready to leave. But our server lets us know because it is my birthday she will bring me dessert and she is convinced I will be delighted. She brings out a lava cake, where am I, Applebee's?!!

He had been raving about this place known for there tapas. I was not expecting much going into Julian surranos. Blew my expectations. This place is a hidden gem of Spanish style food. The chef does a great job with the infusion of flavors that Can be very simple or very complex. The tapas are amazing. The Decore is stunning. Bright and vibrant Spanish style decore very modern. The food is amazing. I would recommend eating here to anyone. 

Julian surranos is located inside the aria hotel. I always stay at the cosmopolitan. So there is a bridge that goes right over to aria. The trip is very quick and convenient. My uncle was telling me every year he comes to Serranos with his college buddies and they get the tapas. During a certain time of day for 1 hr they have half price tapas!  It's not a special known to the public. They don't put it on there website. Or promote it. The group found out because they buy bottles and spend a lot of money on here. 

We called to make reservations. The girl on the line dident know about the half price tapas. So we walked over to serranos. The manager gave us the time they were having the half price tapas (apparently it changes). We made the reservations for the next day. The next day open arrival they had a table all set for us. We changed it to bar seating. 

The tapas are amazing and full of flavor. We ordered over 10 plates. The food was amazing. I would have 100% paid full price for the tapas. The fact we got them half price was amazing. We ordered some drinks and had a good time. 

Overall. Julian surranos in the aria. Could possibly be my fav Spanish restaurant in Vegas. The food is amazing. The decore is bright and vibrant. I will defiantly be back here. I recommend Julian surranos to anyone visiting Vegas.

I have always enjoys Spanish tapas and was lured by the extensive menu at Julian Serrano. We had been spending some time walking along the strip and went to the restaurant around 8 PM on a Friday night without a reservation. Luckily they were able to seat us right away at a ""high-top"" bar table, which was in a cool spot near the kitchen so we could see all the plates coming out. Our server was prompt and polite, and the wine and drink list is nicely organized on an i-pad for easy browsing.

We shared a bunch of small plates for the table, all of which were nicely presented and very tasty:

mixed seafood ceviche
| shrimp | white fish | octopus | cilantro | lime juice: 4.5\/5 - very bright flavors with nice acidity and a bit of heat. Seafood was perfectly tender

gambas
| saut√©ed shrimp | garlic | arbol chilis - 5\/5 - amazingly succulent, tomato-garlic broth was addictive

fresh calamari a la plancha
| lemon parsley e.v.o.o. | caramelized onions - 5\/5 - star of the night - grilled calamari was so tender and flavorful - we ordered a second plate!

monkfish and pisto
| seared monkfish | eggplant | zucchini | tomato - 4\/5 - very moist with a good crsip sear - lots of fresh paprika flavor - wish it were bigger

saut√©ed baby spinach
| pine nuts | raisins | apple | shallots - 3\/5 - well prepared but not overly interesting - though we ordered it without the nuts and raisins because of allergy. the crunch of pine nuts would likely have made it more well rounded.

cheese lollipop
| herb bread crumb | manchego cheese | red wine poached pear - 4.5\/5 - little bite of crispy cheesy goodness - crunch on outside and fluffy creaminess inside. A touch of mint leaf added a nice pop.

spanish iberico sliders
| prime beef | iberian pork | caramelized onions - 5\/5 - super moist, salty goodness. One of the best burger bites I have ever had

creamy risotto
| wild mushroom | aged manchego cheese - 4\/5 - very good mushroom risotto


Everything was really good. Would not get the spinach again. There are a ton of other veggie options that looked good though, so there is plenty for non-meat eaters.

This really wasn't detracting, but be prepared for a few flash bulbs in your general direction. It really isn't all that noisy, though, considering its location. 

Our waiter was great and made our experience perfect. I highly recommend the shrimp cheviche. It's well balanced and the fattiness of the avocado is perfect with the citrus-y shrimp. The plain sounded ""Beef and Cheese"" was a favorite of ours- tender as butter beef tenderloin slathered in beef demi glaise and walnuts with melted brie over toast. Wow. It was perfection. Each dish we sampled was beautiful to the eye and delicious. Our waiter recommended 3-4 dishes a piece which was just right. We had 6 tapas plates and 3 drinks which set us back $102 before tip.

I came here last year with some girlfriends and we had a delicious dinner of a variety of tapas. Because of my past dining experience, I made another reservation for my birthday dinner this past weekend. 

As I remembered, the tapas were delicious. We had the albondigas, ahi tempura, and the yellowtail with jalapeno. All were super flavorful and tasty. We also ordered the seafood paella and added shrimp. For a $60 dish, I expect to be blown away. But, the paella was really al dente - almost crunchy. The seafood was good, but not great. About half the mussels didn't open up either, so I was sure to discard them.

We ordered twelve different tapas and four desserts and barely a crumb was left when we were done.  Here's a descripton of some of the tapas we tried:

--Calamari--Light and delicious!  The breading was light and the calamari was fresh and not chewy.

--Cheese plate--Everyone enjoyed trying the different cheeses-- the manchego and goat cheese were table favorites.

--Egg ravioli--This was unreal!  I have no idea how they put a poached egg wrapped in bacon inside of a fried phyllo shell, but it was fantastic.   Very mild taste.

--Spanish pizza (with sobrasada)--The crust was buttery and delicious and the toppings were a big hit.

--Mushroom risotto--This risotto was the tastiest I have ever had in the U.S.  

--Lobster and pineapple skewers--beautiful presentation and the lobster was very fresh

--Wilted baby spinach--I am not a big lover of spinach but this was delicious!

Our favorite dessert was the Spanish donuts with caramel dipping sauce.  We enjoyed the almond cake was well.

Our entire party enjoyed the dining experience.  We had great service, too.  I can't wait to go again!",2,1,1

What a delicious meal. A group of 3 of us shared a white sangria, mixed ceviche, fried calamari, and mixed paella. Everything was amazing. 

The sangria was so light and fruity. An excellent compliment to the meal. 

The ceviche looks small, but it sure packs a punch of flavor. I believe it included octopus, shrimp, and white fish...I can't be sure. Either way, it was amazing. The textures were great, and the combination of citrus with a touch of red pepper felt like fireworks on my palette. So good. 

When the waiter suggested calamari, I wasn't expecting anything too exciting, since you can get it just about anywhere. What a pleasant surprise this was. It was so very lightly breaded, so you could really taste the meat. Also, squirting lemon and then a hint of the aioli dipping sauce really created amazing flavors. It was a really delightful treat. 

Finally, the pi√®ce de r√©sistance, the mixed paella. It includes lobster (both claws and the tail), chicken, chorizo, vegetables, and saffron rice. Wow. It was hard not to stuff ourselves silly with this. Everything about it was amazing. It was pricey, but I would order it again in a heartbeat...I would actually say that about the other items as well. It will be hard to return and try new things, when I know how fantastic the other items are. 

So, with such great food, why 4 stars? I took off a star for the service. Or server wasn't that great...he kept approaching at inappropriate times, and then when we were clearly ready to make our order, he was nowhere to be found. He did suggest the calamari though. Also, when we ordered the paella, he asked if the 3 of us would be eating it...and I believe he thought we wanted a larger order of it...not sure, it was a bit of a miscommunication that led to the paella costing $20 more than the listed price. It wasn't a huge problem, however, I wish it would have been made clear when we ordered it that we were getting a larger order that would be more pricey. 

All-in-all it was a delicious experience and I will definitely return.",0,0,0

Still amazing ceviche. Very heavy lime flavor, which I love, tender seafood, and a little heat.

""Tuna cones"" are very tasty, tuna sashimi stuffed in to a wonton cone. The wonton was a little on the crisp side...a little towards an eggshell shattering consistency, if you know what I mean? Might be a bit off putting.

Amazing beef sliders, with tomato and some cured ham. Tender...delicious...seriously like eating butter.

And the lobster paella (I went there) was also pretty good. Rice at the perfect consistency, delicious chorizo and chicken, lots of green peas for a little sweet - but not much in the way of lobster. Maybe two good bites per person. This serving is for two, which is fine - good way to have a larger dish and try some smaller things.

The menu is very versatile, there is a well assembled tapa for every taste bud. 
From what i ordered:
The tuna tacos (my favorite) were a mix between a seared ahi tuna and a tuna tartare. The pieces of tuna were very well seasoned and topped creamed avocado, all inside a crispy cone. It was a little bit spicy yet still pleasant. 
The beef and cheese tapa was out of the ordinary. The sirloin was extremely soft and perfectly medium(although they did not ask how we wanted it cooked, which i believe they should do). It had cheese, walnuts and a sweet and sour sauce all topping a piece of crusty bread. 
Then the mushroom risotto. Buttery, al dente and with a strong mushroom flavor. To my opinion It was heavy on the sprinkled parsley( you cannot take it off once it is cooked so if anyone is not a lover ask for it without it). 
The mediterranean chicken skewer with hummus and apricot had obviously a touch of mediterranean spices that could be easily distinguished from its fresh flavors. The apricot addition was a refreshing note. The skewer was beautifully plated on top of pureed beets that although it did not do much for the flavor it added to the presentation. 
My boyfriend ordered the short ribs( his favorite). Very flavorful and definitely tender. I wish the plate had been a little hotter though. It had some mushrooms, which I believe were pickled. That would not be my first choice but with the richness of the short ribs they worked as kind of a palate cleanser. 
Bf also ordered the gambas. These may have been my least favorite i think, nevertheless still good. I believe they could have been a little bit more seasoned or at least the broth in which they came. 
The service was good, not outstanding. The empty plates were at the table for a little longer than a couple of minutes but still they did not get to cover the whole table. The server was here and there and at times seemed like he was rushing ,yet he was still passing by our table to check that everything was on point. 
I give it a 4 overall. Id definitely go back. Only it doesn't get a 5 for 5 means completely flawless to me.",0,0,0

I'm all about the hotel hopping and restaurant at this hotel and this other hotel. 

With that said, Julian Serrano was one of the reasons I never left the property. I simply did not need to. 

I came here for the lunch three-course menu, which I concluded was an AMAZING deal and steal. If you want to try this place out, but are wary about the heavy price tag, come for lunch. It was $19 for a three course meal. 

My three courses was the Wild Mushroom Soup, Rib Eye Steak w\/ fries and the Santiago's Cake. I really enjoyed the rich and earthy soup and the rib eye was cooked very nicely and served with thinly cut and crispy fries. The cake was surprisingly delightful and I preferred it over the flan that they offer. 

Our waiter was very friendly and checked up on us several times. He also gave us some sangria mini samples and informed us of the happy hour they have daily 4-5:30 which includes sangria and app specials!

We finished our dishes and waited.  Desert menus were delivered but no waiter.  Finally asked for a check due to the time, not the waiter, I was inform we could speed things up by just taking my card and running it.  And we waited... I suggested my guest make the walk to the theater and I would meet them there after I paid the check.  I was informed they were having trouble with their credit card machines and they were running them manually.  Another 5 minutes and  I asked a bus boy where my credit card was and I followed him to a location near the kitchen, out of sight of most of the other guests.

We ordered the $50 Mixed Paella ahead of time - NOTE:  it takes about 40 minutes to prepare the paella, so it's best to order ahead by either charging it to your room or going there to pay ahead, if that is possible.

Had a couple of tapas at the beginning, highly recommend the Gambas in a delicious sauce.  The tuna cones were also good and unique, but the winner was the Paella.  The paella is huge portion easily enough for 3 people, freshly cooked and still hot in a large skillet\/pan, and perfect if you are a paella aficionado - in between the 'wet, Cuban style' and the 'dry Spanish style' I've experienced in the past.

Wonderful ambience at the restaurant 'open-aired' in the Main Lobby allowing you to people watch if that is what you want to do.

The server then said, ""You know that's cold, don't you?""  Do I look that much like a rube? (that's rhetorical!)  The gazpacho was excellent.  Great tomato flavor and there were several pieces of tasty lobster.

Course two was the creamy risotto with wild mushrooms and manchego cheese.  The risotto was very flavorful and very enjoyable!

For the third course, I chose the Crispy chicken breast roulada with saut√©ed potatoes, pork chorizo, and roasted red pepper.  Very tasty!

Finally, I was allowed to order anything off their dessert menu rather than choose from the two choices on the tasting menu.  I chose the molten chocolate cake, with orange jelly and blood orange sorbet.  I didn't taste any orange jelly.  The sorbet was sitting on top of some chopped mango.  The cake and the sorbet were very tasty.  It's nice they allow you to choose any dessert because they're all the same price.

As for the service, aside from the question about gazpacho mentioned above, I was enjoying the risotto and was not yet finished with it when the server brought the chicken roulada and placed it along side the risotto.  It's not like the place was crowded and they were moving the guests out quickly.  Shouldn't a server check before they bring out a dish like this?  My iced tea was not refilled until it was time to order dessert.  It should have been much sooner.  I wonder why a tapas place like this bothers with a tasting menu. 

The dinner was good but it wasn't something that caused me to think that I had to return to this restaurant.  There are too many other places.",3,0,1

That means that comparing this to Chili's would not be fare to either, I compare to what is advertised and expected. I also rate according to three variables: food, environment and service. However, the perfect food on a non-perfect environment could still deserve perfect ratings going inline with my  'expectations' guideline above. I do not rate pricing, the price influences the expectation. 

What you would expect: High end, gourmet tapas, smaller portions and priced accordingly, in a contemporary informal setup but at a Vegas prime resort. 

Service: I sat at the bar by myself on a business trip. The bar tender was super friendly, fare and sincere in his suggestions. Service was right on time. No complaints. Above Vegas service standards in my opinion.

Enviro: Its an open space facing the registration deck at the Aria casino, which has a beautiful architecture. Decoration is modern, and table setup is not too formal. Its a little loud when crowded and tables are set close to each other, so it is romantic but may be not ""first date"" romantic. I was wearing jeans and a jacket and felt perfectly fine. I saw people in slacks and sports jackets and people in dress shorts. All inline with the nice-but-not-so-formal.

Food: Here's where it wins. Yes. Portions are not big, but that does not matter. Flavors are artistic and sophisticated, perfectly made for my taste. I would lie to myself with anything less than 5 stars.

He greeted us there and told us about his restaurant at Aria and that we should stop by for a bite...and we were not going to give up that offer for a second.

After recovering from a long night (much to no one's surprise) we decided it was a must-go to this tapas place during my last day here. I was not expecting such a fantastic meal. Being a tapas lover, this was definitely the best, authentic Spanish tapas I've ever had. So unique, flavorful, and scrumptious dishes! The art behind some of these plates is pretty impeccable.

The first afternoon we decided to order three tapas each.

stuffed dates: fried and stuffed with bacon and almond.  The pepper sauce was smokey with a small kick.  These little nuggets were polished off in probably 30 seconds, they were just that good!

calamari a la plancha: baby squid.  Extremely tender with a great lemon bite.  Probably the best calamari I have ever had.  Not one single piece was chewy.

ahi tuna tempura: Two pieces of ahi tempura battered and fried. The ahi was still rare which was nice. Probably my least favorite dish if only because I have had different versions of this dish at Japanese restaurants.  However, I really dug the wasabi foam.

molecular tuna raspberry skewer:  We had to order one of the ""molecular"" tapas just because off all the talk on yelp.  I kind of liked it but then again it was  nothing too special.  Sort of weird to eat a somewhat fishy\/fruity jello.  Still not that bad.

huevos estrellados:  This dish was crazy insane good.  Perfectly cooked eggs on top of amazingly tasty potatoes and bite size pieces of chorizo.  The best cooked eggs that I have ever had besides my Noni's.  The flavor in this dish is beyond good.  Perfect seasoning. Not runny or oily, just amazing.
 
golden and red beet salad: Great beet salad.  Nothing overpowering about this dish which made it a perfect.  Love the citrus squares.

Lastly we had to order dessert.  We settled on a arroz con leche and it was one of the tastiest versions of rice pudding that I have had.  Great citrus flavor.  Loved it.

The next day we basically decided on ordering a paella and two tapas.

Stuffed dates: Had them the day before and still amazing on the second day.

Sauteed Padron peppers: A nice big plate of salty, crucnchy, and downright yummy peppers.  Loved these and they , along with the dates, are on the to order again list.

For Paella we decided on the Valenciana which had rabbit, chicken, and veggies.  So glad that we came back a second day for the paella.  The rabbit was tender as well as the chicken and there was a perfect balance of saltiness. The rice around the edge of the pan was crunchy and very tasty.

No dessert on this visit as we forced ourselves to finish the whole paella which was definitely pushing it.  We were stuffed.

Whilst walking toward it I saw this gleaming beautiful restaurant at Aria, looked at the menu and decided to try it.  I should have checked yelp first, though.

The waitstaff was very nice and the service was prompt.  So I guess the design, decor and waitstaff are about the best things about this place.  I mean ... I know Serrano's reputation ... so ... what the hell.

The ""marinated"" olives were ... what ... marinated in friggin' olive oil?  I think anyone could do that.  They were bland.  The chicken croquetas were ... equally bland.  I started to wonder if the chefs were opposed to using any seasoning.  Then the albondigas came out and ... well ... equally as bland.

About three quarters of the way through one of the waitstaff asked if everything was good and I asked if the chef had salt or pepper in the pantry.  With one bite left -- yes, I ate everything as it was my first meal of the day -- they begrudgingly brought salt and pepper to my table.

The server told the manager what I'd said and he came over and in essence said ""Everyone loves this place; there's no way it could be bland.""  Since I had my macbook pro open -- as I was editing photos from an assignment -- I showed him his yelp rating and the fact at least half of the people felt the same way I did.  He still stuck to his guns.

I was like, ""Cool, bro, I'm not the only one who feels this way.""

Unless this chef gets chewed out by Serrano and is told\/taught how to season food I wouldn't be charmed into this place by decor alone.

Not only ... I'm totally checking yelp next time before venturing in somewhere shiny and pretty.

This place is a total pass for me.

Perhaps they should put salt and pepper on the tables?",3,1,2

So we no longer ordered the pata negra since it was incredibly pricey and was now skeptical of the quality. However service is very fast which was great. I just wish they had better quality Jamon, as that is what is sought out for when in Spain or in Spanish restaurants. 3 stars because there's no 3 1\/2. Will still return, but will avoid the Jamon.

Papas Brava - potatoes with what seemed like a tomato coulis; another standard dish.
~Mixed Seafood Paella *note: there's a wait for this. The lobster was PERFECTAMUNDO. Not dry at all! They even omitted the sausage for me. The paella texture was great, but honestly, it was really, REALLY salty and the portion was huge (meant for two, but if it WAS less salty, I'm pretty sure I would have pounded the whole thing myself.) 
-The birthday girl had the Blood orange and raspberry sorbet with cake for dessert. It was a great palate cleanser. 

I think one time is enough for me. I would be interested to find another option for tapas my next time through!",6,4,5

It's a fusion tapas restaurant with a happy contemporary theme, professional host service and  McDonald's waiter service.   

The service is slow and weird. 

""How big is the serving?""
She looked a few seconds on my semi Asian face and told me:
""It's like Dim sum"" 
Well, why don't you tell me it's like Banchan or sashimi?  
Maybe I'm over- sensitive, maybe she will tell anybody it's in a Dim Sum size. I don't know, it's informative I guess, but it's weird.

The menu looks boring 

--+SPANISH CHICKEN CROQUETTES: Croquets were nothing special, but it's edible, until we dip it into the sauce. Lemon pepper sauce was a nightmare. It's sour and overly salty. The sauce makes the croquettes inedible. 

--+ Black rice: The calamari was tiny and fried. All the black rice pictures on Yelp, calamari looks big and seared, except ours. It looks like fried baby squid, it too tiny to taste the calamari, I can only taste the breadcrumbs, And as to lobster? I assumed they used the tails of the crayfish. I had a tail and Mr.Q had a tail, so where was the body? Or maybe that was a baby crayfish just like the baby squid. They melt down when you cook it. Black rice on the other hand? it was al dente, tasty and bold.  but then there is a pile of overly salted Sriracha mayo top the already salted black rice? Really? Sriracha Mayo is creative? I know they used that on a Wendy's burger(Never had it), but here? It made the dish inedible. We try to use the utensils to remove that layer of nastiness. And as to the saffron...Where is it? Maybe the saffron flavor was covered by the Sriracha mayo, it's unlikely, but saffron wasn't there. 

---HUEVOS ESTRELLADOS: Over and easy egg on fried chorizo and fries. They were using the same overly salted chorizo again. There is nothing special about this dish, it looks like a 5  dollar dish. 

---PINTXO DE CHORIZOS: Chorizos are way too salty, inedible salty, what's wrong with this restaurant? Did the chef stay too long in Germany? Everything is so salty. It's so salty, until I couldn't feel my tongue, the mashed potato is nice, but it didn't balance the saltiness of chorizo, because the potato is so little. Wish saltiness like this? You needs to service at least 1 pound of mashed potato on that plate. 

---PINXTO MORUNO: Lamb meat is over cooked, it's chewy, luckily this dish wasn't overly salted, but there is nothing special about the flavor. 

-++CREMA CATALANA: It looks like a big thin ravioli. The presentation looks funnier than it's taste. It was nothing special, but this is the best dish during the entire evening. At least, it wasn't overly salted. 

There isn't much cooking technic involved with this restaurant or taste. 
I'm not so sure the manager\/the chef\/owner thinks people come to vegas to party and they are dumb any way, they don't know how to enjoy their food, just make this place looks fancy and triple charge them, they don't know any better?

we had:
-croquettas (probably the best thing we had. just delicious sweetness. They have a happy hour where you can buy them for $4 instead of $10)
-gambas (basically shrimp in a spicy sauce....the one dish i could have gone without. The shrimp seemed overcooked and dry....and that's even with the sauce)
-calamari (my wife had this and loved it. I'm not a huge calamari guy so i passed. She's very picky about calamari and thought it was a solid dish)
-bombas (pork and beef meatball. Be aware these are SPICY. Delicious though. And the sauces? please. I still have dreams about it)
-pistachio tart dessert (omg....this was so much better than we expected it to be. you MUST try it. it's not even like a tart. It's more like a very thin cake. Just incredible. I could have eaten 4 more.

We didn't have reservations either time but found quick and easy seating, with friendly and attentive service, at the bar. 

Night 1 we stopped in for tapas and drinks. We ordered the mixed seafood ceviche (I could have eaten a bucket full of that stuff), the tuna-raspberry skewer (beautiful, tender, melt-in-your-mouth tuna), and the seared scallops (perfectly cooked). Everything was very fresh, very flavorful, and absolutely delicious. I also enjoyed the tasty red sangria. 

Night 2 we were tired of paying Vegas food prices and decided that $45 paella for 2 sounded perfect. We started with a lovely Mediterranean bass. I almost licked the remaining tomato confit off the plate. Then came our ""marinera"" paella and, unfortunately, it was quite underwhelming. All of the individual ingredients were certainly fresh-tasting but the dish itself was under-seasoned and bland. Very disappointing.

Grilled Angus Flat Iron Steak w\/ Eggplant and mushroom demi: MM.  Possibly my favorite.  Super tender and the eggplant was bomb!

Salmon with Truffle:  Okay, wait, this one was my favorite.  The truffle sauce was a revelation... HAHA.

Tuna Cones: Hm, not bad...but I preferred the tuna tempura.

Chicken Chilindron: Pretty good, I didn't really like the combo of tomatoes, chicken and ham initially but after a few bites really warmed up to it.

Pan Manchego: Oh man, I may have to change my mind yet again because this was so freaking good.  Evolved bruschetta.

I found this thread that mentioned Estiatorio Milos and they also said Julian Serrano had an equally delicious menu for only $19. I thought it was too good to be true so I called to confirm since the thread was from last year. They said that they had this special menu from Sunday-Thursday at 11:30am-4pm so I had to get there on Sunday. It was weird because I checked the menu and it didnt mention the $19 so I thought it was a secret menu. When we got there, they gave us a regular lunch menu and I asked for the prix fixe but it was for $49 so I asked about the $19 one. He said it was only for Monday- Thursday but I told him that the person on the phone yesterday said it was for Sunday. He spoke with the manager and checked if they had the ingredients and they were able to provide this menu. I thought it was very nice of them to keep their word. So extra plus for them. The place is in Aria and it is quite festive. They have a bar and the game was playing so that was cool. 

First
1) Lobster Gazpacho- chilled spinach tomato soup with lobster meat- I didnt see the chilled part so I was quite shocked by the taste of it. I never had purposeful cold soup so it took some getting used to. Not my cup of tea but I am glad I tasted a legit spanish appetizer. 
2) Wild mushroom soup- I preferred this one since it was salty. It was good and I would choose this over the lobster.

Second
1) Salmon- It comes with mashed potatoes and I liked that the salmon skin was crispy. I dont know how salmon is a spanish dish so it wasnt anything crazy special but it was good nonetheless.
2) Rib eye steak- It came with eggplant and french fries and again I dont know how this is spanish but it was good. 

Third
1) Santiago's cake- LOVEEE this!!! it is a traditional spanish almond cake with turron ice cream and candied almonds. It comes in a nice display and was deliciosss. The cake was tender and the ice cream went perfectly with it. I gobbled that thing right up. This was by far my favorite of the meal.
2) Flan de turon- almond mcreme custard flan. I am not much of a flan person so I thought it was ok. 

I think Vegas will now be known for prix fixe rather than buffets for me. I am addicted haha. And for so cheap! You cant beat $19 for all this good food. I am surprised that the appetixer and dessert were more traditional than the entrees.

**TIPS**
1) The $19 prix fixe is Monday-Thursday, 11:30am-4pm.
2) The ideal menu is wild mushroom soup, salmon or steak (depends on what you prefer), and Santiago's cake.
3) Enjoy!",1,0,1

Like any other tapas place the food portions are small and I would estimate most dishes were meant for two diners to sample..however my party of four easily managed even thou most dishes were just enough for one or two bites per person.. Prices range from about $12 - $ 16.00 per plate and Also had the option of large  plates that were upwards of $30.00.. 

We visited this spot on a Wednesday night and there was a 30 min wait so you might want to make reservations if you are not the patient type. Tables in this restaurant are not setup for intimacy in fact they were just too close to other tables making us stop our dining experience to allow new diners to squeeze into there tables.. This can be definitely annoying.. 

Expect to find a nice selection of sea food options while here, like one of my new favorites, black rice.. Which is squid ink coated rice, topped with a few charred baby octopus. Other seafood options included fried calamari which is always good, just wish there was more on the plate .We were also fortunate to sample the chicken croquettes , which is a small fried ball stuffed with chicken. 
 At the end of the night we ended up doing about 5 plates rounding up over a hundred dollars and everyone walking out happy.. 

Service here is basic and could use some more fine tuning. Food coming out also took awhile so be ready to spend some time here.. Jullian Serrano has it down as far as location and food .. Comfort of tables and service needs work,, but do check this place out if looking for tapas.",2,1,1

I usually do not give many negative reviews and I've come to expect great things from most Las Vegas restaurant experiences. Our experience at Julian Serrano fell a bit short.

When we arrived for a Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation for 2, we were promptly seated in the back among other 2-person tables. The restaurant was energized, and full of big groups, which made it pretty loud inside. I was seated across from my husband and we had to shout a lot to hear each other...not a big deal, but a little awkward. 

We didn't receive our drink menus right away, which made it difficult when we were asked by one of the waiters what we would like to drink. I asked for the drink menu and was told it was coming (in a slightly rude manner). Luckily, we were able to order some delicious cocktails and they came quickly. Our waiter made an appearance and right away I was not impressed with the service...he barely even made it known that he was our server for the night and was bent down near my husband's ear trying to pick out some things that we should try on the menu. I felt an odd disconnect... My husband asked how ordering usually works (since it's a tapas place), and the waiter said that we could order everything at once, and he ""would take care of it."" We ordered a few fish items, a cheese plate, the Spanish tortilla, chicken croquettes, the beef short rib plate, and a few veggies. 

Here's where things got annoying. The Spanish tortilla was brought out first. It was tasty but slightly cold (not sure if that's traditionally how it's served?). Before we could even dig into the tortilla dish the waiters brought out the beef short rib. That was a WTF moment to me. Within minutes of receiving the beef dish they brought us the warm monkfish dish and the cheese plate. Our tiny table was filled with foods all getting cold because we hadn't even made a dent in the tortilla. We weren't even half way through our cocktails and half of our meal was in front of us. We had to tell them to slow down (luckily they did). I felt like I was at an Applebees. 
 
If I were in a hurry, this would be good. But at 8 pm on a Saturday night in Vegas, we were not in a hurry. We like to slow down and enjoy our meal. I was irritated by the order of the dishes that were brought out as well as with the pace. Who wants beef short ribs as the second dish?? Typically you would want salads, fish, vegetable dishes brought first. They didn't even see if we wanted a bottle of wine to pair with the bigger meat dishes. I found the order of everything all very strange and felt rushed. 

On the plus side, the food was all very good. Everything was beautifully presented and cooked well. We LOVED the cheese plate. It ended up being glorious to eat cheeses between small plates (while our beef and fish dishes got cold, haha). I would go there again for the cheese alone! 

So maybe it was just a bad night...I never thought I would complain about too fast of service, but I am. There are times where it's appropriate to rush through dinner (like before a show, etc), but there are other times where you want to relax and enjoy good food and conversation. Unfortunately, this was not the place for that experience. I guess I just expected more for the price. We got an Applebees experience for great food worthy of better service.",2,0,1

The cocktail program is also robust and our pre-dinner drinks were all happily enjoyed.  

Our selections of tapas were all very good and portioned out so that there was enough for all 9 of us to have a taste (or more).  The foie gras was delicious as was the pata negra (the pinnacle of jamon Iberico).  Other highlights included the sauteed padron peppers, lamb chops, beef filet.

A very sweet and dear couple we've known for a long time finally ventured to Vegas to visit us. Sadly their experience here wasn't the best between the constant barrage of timeshare folks accosting them each time they walked through their hotel to the coldness of the staffing. 
So we wanted them to have a great meal on their final night in a beautiful setting that was relaxed but also something they couldn't get back home. 

Julian Serrano was perfect. 
We started with cocktails - several in the lobby bar at the Aria then proceeded to dinner. 
Tapas:  
The bacon wrapped dates were delicious morsels of happiness in a wine reduction sauce.
Brava potatoes were small cubes of golden brown goodness with a spicy alioi for dipping. 
Empanadas were puffed to perfection and filled with a creamy cheese
Tiny cuban sandwiches - were like mini-grilled cheese and ham. 

We shared a paella - one with chicken, rabbit & chorizo. - and a small seafood one as a side dish as 2 of us are allergic to the seafood. 

Sangia & Cerveza flowed - and we topped the delicious meal off with cafe and dessert - a selection of cheese and bread. 

Total bill was just over 300.00 for dinner and drinks for 4. 

Seating:  Great tables and the chairs were very comfortable - wide enough for ample bums to sit for an extended period and leg room for the 2 tall guys with us. The atmosphere is open, bright and airy. The tables are just far apart enough so that you don't feel like you are rubbing elbows with your neighbor.  This is worth noting because of the cost of the square footage in high end hotels on the strip is pricey and most of the better establishments still have very close seating. 

Service: impeccable. Our waiter - at our request for a small paella for the seafood, was more than accommodating. it came out filled with what looked like more seafood than rice. at the end of the meal, he bought out complimentary churros still piping hot.  

Pricing: Ok I admit it, i had some $$ on my M-life that took care of a large portion of the meal..one of the advantages of actually living in Vegas. Still the actual $300 it cost us out of pocket wasn't a lot for the amount of food \/ drinks we consumed. 

If you want something different with great service coupled with delicious food, this is a great spot to go. 

Side note: We ended up back in the bar - and closed it down. Our waiter from the restaurant had the bartender send us over drinks - I mean who am i to refuse???",0,0,0

This place is always crowded and it's always crowded for a reason. Dear god, the food blew my taste buds out of this world. 

On my last business trip to Vegas, a colleague and I wined and dined a client here and everyone at the table was unanimously impressed. Each dish topped the previous one with bursting flavors, creative mingling of a variety of ingredients and incredibly well-cooked, juicy and fatty meat pieces. We ordered two bottles of wine (a Pinot Noir and a Cab) and both paired impeccably with our tapas of choice. 

We ordered A LOT of tapas but here were the highlights: 
1. Foie gras 
2. Wild mushroom creamy risotto 
2. Grilled lamb chops
3. Short ribs 
4. Serrano paella 

The ambiance is fun-eclectic and a bit on the louder side as it's usually fully packed and opens into the hotel lobby area. I'd recommend coming here with a larger party so you can try a variety of tapas (the menu is extremely extensive). It makes for a great socializing business dinner or a classic Vegas group dinner. 

Definitely stop by Julian Serrano for some out of this world tapas when you're in the Aria.

Sadly, like most Vegas eateries in Strip casinos this place suffers from non-attentive service and overpriced fare that is pedestrian at best. We had the raspberry tuna skewers (ok), the sliders (bland), the NY steak (couldn't cut thorough 2 pieces because they were 90% gristle), the monk fish (decent smoky flavor but the least tasty monk fish i've had), the ceviche (for some reason no one in the states can get this right - not authentic, served with only 4 taro chips, decent but not at all as flavorful as that in the Yucatan), and the only tapas we enjoyed - the stuffed dates - which we've had many times at other tapas joints, and these were just as good. ALL our second round of tapas were served cold after a long wait (must have been left at the pass too long), and we had to send them back - upon doing so the manager came out to reassure us, but at no point did he or the server offer to take something off the bill or do something extra for the miscue - not that we expected that, but most places i've had to do this at will extend some sort of peace offering. Not here.

$150 later we left very disappointed and agreed to avoid Strip restaurants like the plague from now on, unless they are downtown - like Hugo's Cellar, which is a gem with great service and reasonable prices. It seems that these strip places think they're only catering to tourists and will never see you again, at least that's how it feels to dine there. They were right this time, they won't see us again.

Boy, wasn't THAT a good call.  It was PACKED, but were seated quickly.  I loved the layout of the place, and wish we'd have read the review before we were seated.  The long bar had a lot of action and even had a couple of ""jets"" which could seat 4.  We got beverages and started looking through the menu.  We were impressed at the selections! 

 

We talked with our waiter about what we were thinking and he voiced his agreement with a couple of our dishes.  We went across the menu best we could.  We got the Lobster salad and Gaspacho (both had good chunks of lobster in it and were very good), Steak tartare and NY strip for meats, and then did an order of the fried Gambas (more later), and Mushroom Risotto.  It was PLENTY for two very hungry individuals. 

 

We looked at the desert menu and couldn't say ""no"" to the Pistachio tart and chocolate cake (think ""melty cake"" you got on your last cruise). 

 

We were impressed with all.  I'd say the item I wish I hadn't gotten was the risotto.  It was good, but for two, I wish we'd have selected something else.  If you have a larger group where you can do the ""tapas"" and go through a LOT of dishes, then go get it.

 

Our favorite was the fried gambas.  WOW!  With shrimp, a touch of garlic, chilis, and the sauce, it had a TON of tastes that complimented each other perfectly, and you could get a taste of every one of them.  The grilled NY steak was also tasty, with a good mushroom sauce covering it.  Very well prepared (medium rare), and so tender you could cut it with your fork.

 

My wife had a post-dinner coffee, and we were stuffed when we were done.  Our bill for food (no liquor) was still under $100.  We could've left with a small box of leftovers if we'd have stayed another day.

 

Good call stopping in.  Service good, manager was doing work and not just glad-handing (bussing tables, getting the occasional order, checking on beverages, and he even filled my water glass once).   While Jose R. was listed on our receipt as our waiter, Antonio was also around a lot.  The crew did an excellent job of keeping us happy.

We even half way picked out what we were going to have before arriving (yup, I'm food obsessed). I was beyond psyched to try the lobster\/pineapple and ahi tuna\/raspberry. 

Drink orders were taken after 20 minutes. Drink orders were forgotten. Service was pretty damn bad in general. Also I did experience the issue the other person faced where they kept asking about dessert after 10 minutes with our first course (WTF)? These things I can forgive them for, given it's a new place. 

The guy finally takes our food order, and after taking the order says ""well we're out of lobster, tuna, and scallops"". WTF. It's 5:30, we're literally one of the first diners of the evening. He doesn't offer an explanation (mb the supplier flaked?), or an apology. Just ""we're out of half the menu"" essentially. I'm more than a little irritated, as these were the items I was most excited about. 

Why 3 stars? The food we did try was really good. 

*Risotto with mushrooms and manchego: Tiny (it's tapas), but DAMN Good. I was scraping the plate. 
*Beef with brie: Note, this has honey and nuts all over it. I found it scrumptious, but mb the idea of a honey covered steak doesn't appeal to everyone!
*Mini Chorizo over garlic potatoes: yup as good as it sounds
*Garlic shrimp: Boring. This was a sad substitute for my lobster I wanted.. grrr
*Spanish creme brulee - HUGE and quite good
*White Sangria - packs a punch.. there might be 2 hours of NYE that I can't remember and I blame this sangria!

Overall it has major potential, but my first dinner here was a bit of a disappointment. I'm excited we have a high-end tapas place finally, so I'll definitely be back to give it another shot but I'll probably give them a few months to get the kinks worked out.",9,2,4

I was quite impressed. It's my favorite place to eat. The ambiance is interesting since it's somewhat open to the lobby at Aria.

Our server didn't seem too happy when he was taking our order and when we asked him questions about the menu or if we needed anything, his answers were all very curt.

However, the food is delicious. Since it's all small portions, it's easy to try different things from the menu and also portion things out depending on how hungry you are. I had the traditional spanish chicken croquetas which were so good. Perfectly breaded and crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. The Spanish Iberico Sliders were also amazing. The combination of iberian pork with the ground beef was perfect and complimented each other really well. Too bad there were only two in an order because I wanted more. My friends ordered the lobster salad, grilled flat iron steak, and the fried calamari which they all enjoyed.

Despite the service not being so great and a little slow, I'm still gonna give Julian Serrano five stars. The server was probably just having an off day.

When the food did begin to arrive, however, we figured out why there was a delay - instead of batching our dozen dishes into waves, they were about to be served all at once.  With plate after plate after plate arriving and filling the table I asked Adrian why this was happening and suggested slowing things down to which he responded ""this is a tapas restaurant, sir, it is how things are served.""  Having already assured himself a lousy tip by this point I explained to him that although I've never been to Spain I have been to a multitude of Andres and Garces spots, plus other ""tapas"" style restaurants and have never seen anything like this.  Without apology I watched him amble off to the kitchen where he actually stopped two servers carrying plates (they would have been numbers 8 and 9 on the table at once) and after this service did improve, mildly.

Plate six was Mediterranean stew in deconstruction | prawns | bronzinni | sofrito, the first of the more ""modern"" tapas.  Familiar with European seabass I think the cut we received was a bit close to the tail and the fish's generally sweet taste was much brinier than expected.  With the prawn slightly overcooked and rubbery the seafood on the plate was fortunately brought up a notch by pur√©ed sweet potato and ""sofrito"" of garlic, olive oil, tomato, and onion.  Taking bites of everything mixed did indeed harken to a seafood stew, but not an exceptional one in any way.

The final plate in the first (self limited) wave was the best ""modern"" tapas of the meal - tuna-raspberry skewer | ahi tuna | ""molecular"" raspberry | wasabi | sesame seed.  At $14 the portion\/price ratio was poor, but the flavors and quality more than made up for it.  With the ""molecular"" aspect a similar texture to a gelee, the sweetness of the raspberry was nicely tempered by the heat of the wasabi while the pan seared tuna coated in sesame seeds lent heft and crunch to the dish.  At the same time visually appealing, texturally intriguing, and tasty this was the sort of dish I had expected when walking into Julian Serrano, though I'd have personally preferred sashimi style from the fish.

The second dish, Wild mushroom soup | shiitake | crimini | oyster | foie gras cream would prove to be another excellent classic dish spruced up with modern technique.  Similar to my favorite mushroom soup of all time (Canoe's creamless Mushroom soup) but topped off with foam featuring the unctuous sapor of foie gras.  Taken on its own the soup itself was hearty, earthy, and minimally sweet - the cream simply added a whole extra layer of flavor.  This, along with the subsequent dish would prove my favorite of the meal.

Overlooked by myself but ordered by my mother, Creamy risotto | wild mushroom | manchego cheese | natural jus was the steal of the menu at a mere $10.  With a base of flawless rice cooked in mushroom broth the dish found heft in the addition of creamy mushroom broth (quite similar in flavor to that on the salmon) while slices of fibrous mushroom added textural variety.  Topped with a slice of slowly melting year-old manchego that added its characteristic aged salinity the entirety of the dish was flawless - I was especially thankful to receive this in the second wave of dishes as I imagine it would not have been as successful in the cooled state.

Where the tuna skewers succeeded, Lobster-pineapple skewer | lobster tail | ""molecular"" pineapple | sesame oil failed.  Whether it was the small portions of overcooked lobster or the over sweetened and disconcertingly fibrous pineapple gelee I cannot be certain, but the dish was simply unbalanced and any nuance that may have been intended was lost in the sweetness.  As the final fish dish of the night I'll simply say that aside from the octopus the kitchen at Serrano really needs to pay attention to the textures coming out of the kitchen as nearly every fish was overcooked.

Tax and moderate tip included the total cost of the meal turned out to be ~$55\/person - not a bad deal considering the fact that we ordered four dishes per person and did not pick based on price.  With that said, when a chef like Serrano attaches his name to something there is an expectation that follows and that expectation was not met.  Overcooked fishes, muddled flavor profiles, and service gaffs (especially the sort where the server tells the diner he\/she is wrong) have no place in such restaurants and considering the superstar competition that just arrived in town with two restaurants at The Cosmopolitan these are the sorts of mistakes that could send diners looking for better.",5,4,3

Sangria was great and 2 pitchers seemed to cover our table nicely. Just an FYI, the pitchers are around $20+. I don't necessarily like tapas because I have always gone with a small group and trying everything just doesn't work and tapas is all about trying everything. Since we were a group of 10 we had a wide range to choose from and it was a much better time and food came out promptly. We had the scallops, stuff dates, mussels, lobster with molecular pineapple skewers, risotto with manchego, spanish croquettas, spanish toast, Ahi tuna tempura, spanish tortilla, avocado canelonne, and probably a few other that I'm missing. I would have checked in here but for some weird reason on iphone app it says 10 miles away and not close enough to check in, oh well.

The food was good - definitely on the small side in terms of proportions but they had a nice variety of spanish food including a version of something I've never seen outside of Spain called Huevos Estrellados.  In Madrid they have Huevos Rotos which is over-easy eggs on top of potato chips with serrano jamon in the mix.  This used french fries instead but it was a tasty throw-back.  I'm not a seafood eater but enjoyed sampling some of the seafood dishes including the calamari and the scallops.  Pork chop was a tad on the rare side but had great flavor and the stuffed dates with piquilllo pepper sauce and the piquillo peppers themselves were both delicious (hard to go wrong when stuffed with cheese).  This is definitely not tapas from Spain but the food was good.

All in all a fun, social meal with good presentation.  City Center itself is stunning.  Not the best value for the money (we spent $209 after tax\/tip on four with just one glass of wine and one cocktail) but it does slot in between casual casino dining and really high end restaurants.

We ordered four tapas\/pinxtos and paella for our family of five.  The patatas bravas (not sure what they were called on the menu) were well done, quite like we were used to from traveling in Spain.  The dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with goat cheese were absolutely to die for and are a must order.  We had the chicken croquettas which the children loved along with the Padron Peppers (or normally called Shisito).  They were prepared with salt and orange zest and quite tasty, maybe a little on the sweeter side than we're used to, but certainly an interesting and delightful preparation.  The chorizo pinxto prepared on mashed potatoes was another winner and something I'd highly recommend.  Our last tapas was bread with serrano ham and a spread (forget exactly) which was ok, but nothing memorable.  

Finally, we had the mixta paella which included shrimp, chicken, mussels, lobster and chorizo.  It was prepared nicely and the rice was perfectly cooked.  The one major issue was the lobster was absolutely terrible.  It was over-cooked so very tough and did not taste fresh at all.  My wife and I each had the red wine sangria and they were reminiscent of what we enjoyed during the summer in Spain.  Finally, we shared the churros for dessert -- not bad, but have had quite a bit better in Spain.  I ordered coffee and was brought a pot of luke warm tea.  We let the waiter know and he was apologetic and returned with a pot of coffee, although once again it was luke warm so I returned it and finally got a nice hot pot of coffee on the third try.

Overall, the meal was solid not spectacular, generally something you can expect with tapas, although I somewhat expected more in Las Vegas and given the prices.  Given that we traveled the whole summer in Spain two years ago and had some amazing tapas there, my points of comparison might be a bit tough to compare.

Items I enjoyed in no particular order: codfish fritters, scallop ceviche, and huevas estrellados (greasy goodness, perfect hangover food!). 

A few I did not: wrinkled potatoes (various pieces were undercooked), stuffed dates, and sangria that was severely watered down and therefore seemed like a poor value.

Also had the pata negra.  At $30 for a serving size less than a ghetto Carl Buddig pack (mmm Carl Buddig), I expected to have some sort of culinary revelation.  Instead it was tasty but I have to say I was underwhelmed.  But maybe I just don't know how to enjoy pata negra. I'm not going to pass judgment though on this particular pata negra until I have the chance to try it elswhere.  

Overall, a good meal with some highs and lows. Reasonably priced by vegas standards.  They haven't even been open a month and it's likely they will improve.  I'd consider it a 3.5* with potential.  I'm eager  to come back and give it another shot down the road.",3,1,1

Now for the drinks!  I ordered the first cocktail on the menu: ague de serrano = delicious.  My friends split two pitchers of the white sangria. They said it was good but it tasted like punch. They felt a little of the alcohol afterward, but they said the drinks could have been stronger.  

For the food, we ordered the mushroom risotto (so yummy!), the asparagus a la plancha, and the goat cheese salad.  A couple of my friends got the octopus, but they said it was very smokey and the octopus was not baby octopus, so expect big tentacles (TMI I know but it was important for flavor based on what my friends said).  Everything else was delicious from the rest of my friends.

Our waiter was gruff and unfriendly.  He did not come back and check on us during our meal as well.  The rest of the wait staff was great and kept our water glasses full.

I came here to celebrate my birthday lunch. Which in retrospect was a bad idea.  Our initial plans was to eat at jasmine at the bellagio and my husband was trying to secure a reservation a month ago but to his dismay they said they could not hold a reservation for a small party. So when we showed up, they regretfully told us they were unable to accommodate us and that we should have made a reservation. What? Anyway to make a long story short we headed to Julian Serrano hoping to salvage what was left of our time in Vegas to enjoy a birthday lunch. 

When we were first greeted, things were great, got seated right away, and I asked the hostess who seated us if we could get a high chair. She obliged but 15 minutes later no high chair came so I went up to her to inquire. This is where things got a bit interesting. I kid you not she looked at me and scoffed and rudely remarked ""you should ask your server that"" and went back to looking at her screen or whatever she was doing. I'm not the type to meet rudeness with more rudeness so I met her dismissive remark with a smile and said ""okay, no prob, thank you."" And walked away. Perhaps I was mistaken to ask her, but she could have answered nicely and honestly ""oh I'm sorry, I forgot..."" Etc. I just found her rude dismissive behavior to be pretty astonishing for this establishment. 

When the food arrived, the salad we ordered had a raspberry that was black and moldy. At first I thought it might be pepper. But upon closer observation- it was indeed mold. I didn't want to tell the server nor alert the kitchen. I'm usually just complacent about that sort of thing and just removed the raspberry and set it aside. However, my husband has other ideas and alerted our waiter right away. Truthfully I never like to tell waiters or waitresses the ""truth"" about the food because even if it was their mistake I'm always fearful of ""complaining because I'm certain that they could take that as an insult and unbeknownst to me, could potentially spit or do unspeakable things to my food. Hence- why I never complain and remark any regard to my food other than ""it's great!""  Perhaps it's passive aggressive of me to wait til the end of my dining experience and just place up a review- but well, that's how I am at restaurants.",2,0,0

The food:

Papas Bravas: right spice and a phenomenal aioli. I wanted to order again.
Cheese Coca: came last and was a scrumptious little bite. Salty goat cheese with warm spinach and crunch of a pine nut.
Atun de conos: a little cone of tuna tartare with lemony zap of ponzu. Most popular dish in restaurant. I see why.
Saut√©ed padron peppers: super orangey. I ate most of them. Not best dish, but a good palate cleanser.
Creamy risotto: earthy and texturally creamy.
Melon con jamon: what a contrast of salt sweet cold and warm. The melon ice cream was delicious with a sprig of mint.
Extra (you have to ask, not on menu): scoop of melon ice cream over graham crumble. Ended the meal refreshed, pleasantly full.

Service: great. Jeff was bartender. Took time to learn our names. A little busy, but handled it beautifully.

Tried the flat iron steak, lobster\/pineapple appetizer and marinera paella. The steak was amazing, the lobster dish was interesting (pineapple to lobster ratio was too much) and the paella was okay. The menu says that the paella takes 30-35 minutes to make and ours took way longer than that.. I was thinking that this had to be the bombest paella ever, but it wasn't. It was good, but not great.

Had a night out planned with the wife, and ended up deciding to go to the Aria. We had eaten at Julian Serrano before and figured we wanted a place that would be decent and not try to go and explore. The first time I was there I thought that the tapas were average, but that I should try it again just to see if it was an off night. Well, I discovered that the first time was an off night, and that the food is actually a lot worse than I had ever imagined.
It was a Saturday night, regular prime time for dinner so no excuses for them there. I made it very simple by ordering things that should be staple things for them to make. I even asked the server for suggestions. I ordered olives, gambas(shrimp), a scallop, new York strip, and short rib. My wife had a glass of red sangria, and I had a beer. 
Olives: tasted just like olives, and I wasn't impressed by that statement at first until I found out how bad everything else was.
Shrimp: pretty plain, drowning in a red sauce that could of been made by chef boy ar dee himself.
Scallop: Let me guess the recipe. Throw a scallop in a pan throw on plate, cover with some sprouts.
New York strip: A nice underwhelming flavor to help put your tastebuds to sleep.

Short rib: This was the one! The one that made me say WTF. This was the worst thing that I had. I was shocked especially because the server talked about it in detail. Supposedly this is slow cooked for like 48 hours or something. More like 48 days on high. It was a nice brown brick. My wife and I were sharing and so she went to cut it so that we would each have some. It was almost like she needed a jar opened...she sort of nudged the plate in my direction and asked if I could cut it. There is no way that a person who knows what they are doing prepared this. I don't even know how you could accidentally make it like this. I can go on and on, but I think you get the picture. 

Unbelievably bad.

The sangria that my wife had tasted like it was made with a bottle of wine that had been opened 3 days ago and left open. My beer was good...I guess you cant go wrong with a bottle of beer?

Seriously this place is a joke. I ate what I could and then 2 hours later hit up another restaurant so that I could eat dinner. This place probably offends me more than any place that I have ever eaten. It was so bad.

They also offer items from the regular menu, but since paella takes 45 to 60 mins, we didn't end up trying. A few stand out dishes:

Black rice - this is the best dish of the house. Black rice is creamy, with that distinct mild sweet seafood taste that you only get from squid ink. The calamari on top is grilled to perfection. Even my husband who doesn't usually like squid ink loved this dish! We ordered it both times we were here.
Spanish chicken croquettes - crunch on the outside, savory and creamy on the inside. Good pick for hangover.
Gambas - it's hard to go wrong with saut√©ed garlic shrimp.
Tuna cones - tuna tartare in a cute little cone. I do wish they mixed the avocado dip with the tuna a little bit more. The dip was all at the bottom of the cone so it made the last bite a bit lacking (in tuna).
Pintxo de chorizos - I didn't expect much from this dish but was really pleasantly surprised by how light the chorizos' texture was

Other dishes we tried:
Brava potatoes - a bit too tomato saucy for my taste. It was practically drowning in sauce.
Yellowtail ""tiradito"" - the filo dough provided an interesting contrast in texture, flavor was a bit lacking though.
Beets salad - the mix of cooked and fresh beet in the salad was rather refreshing. It's a pretty big plate for tapas size.
Saut√©ed padron peppers - the orange zest and glaze in this dish kinda ruined it for me. It was meant to brighten the dish but just didn't compliment the dish at all. Would it been perfect if it was just grilled and salted. Sometimes less is more.

I'm very happy to report that our most recent experience was just as fantastic as a few years back.  Just like the last time, we had Pedro as our waiter.  He is the absolute perfect curator for the food journey we took once again.  Not only is he attentive to all needs, he explains every dish as it's brought to the table.  He even remembered us from a few years ago which was very impressive considering the amount of people I'm sure he serves on a regular basis.  The food continues to be phenomenal with various textures and tastes all playing off of each other nicely.  We will definitely be retuning next year.  Do yourself a favor, if you find yourself in Las Vegas, go to Julian Serrano, ask for Pedro to be your host for the evening and enjoy the ride!!",1,0,0

Julian Serrano's Picasso is one of our favorite Las Vegas dining treats, and we expected his signature tapas restaurant to live up to his reputation.  Unfortunately, we didn't have that same experience. First off, let me say that in a way comparing Julian Serrano to Picasso is like comparing apples and oranges . . . two totally different types of food, different dining styles, etc., but one would expect that the quality and service for each respective restaurant would be of the same caliber. This was certainly not the case.

Fortunately, we had a lovely couple seated at the table next to us who were very familiar with the tapas style. The own a Mexican restaurant in Texas. They were almost finished with their meal when we were seated, so we were able to ask them about their choices. According to them, they ordered half the menu just to taste everything!  We started with the Yellowtail ""Tiradito"" (sliced yellowtail with sweet potato haystacks, horseradish cream and ponzu sauce. It was a hit . . . We followed that with the Black Pig Pintxo (Iberian pork shoulder meat with caramelized onion). It was divine! As our main course we ordered the Mixed Paella which serves at least two -- mistake!  Our waiter had emphasized to ""order the paella with your appetizers because it takes 40 minutes to prepare"".  Imagine our surprise wWhen he brought it to the table BEFORE our appetizers; his excuse was that they had a large party and had already prepared enough in advance. I asked them to take it back so that we could eat our food in the order in which it was intended. When the paella did arrive, it must have been the same one he brought out 30 minutes prior. The rice was dry, the lobster chewy, the mussels over cooked . . . the only tasty thing among the ingredients was the Spanish pork chorizo that brought a little flavor to the dish. Seriously a miss!

Hubby ordered the pistachio dessert and said it was heavenly . . . so maybe consider coming her for dessert and coffee instead.  One five star element was the Drunken Cherry cocktail I ordered. It was one of the best cocktails I have ever had -- Effen Cherry vodka, acai, pomegranite and lime with a garnish of Spanish cherries soaked in brandy. Our waiter redeemed himself when he asked if he could bring me dessert, and I said, I'd love a few more of those cherries . . . and he brought a plateful! 

I wouldn't say we had a bad experience here, just not as good as we expected.  Funny how the last two restaurants I've reviewed are sister restaurants of two of our Bellagio faves, and the Bellagio outlets are far superior!",0,0,0

Portions small, prices gargantuan.   So when you bend over to pick up the soap, you're really reviewing how far you have to bend over and if the soap smells nice.

Many resorts sport interior restaurants.  By interior I wish to stress that they lack windows to the outside.  I've got news for the Caesars\/Harrah and MGM\/Mirage groups:  more and more I'm less and less inclined to eat in a cave.  Unless you have a space as ginormous as the TAO in the Venetian, my business may move elsewhere.

Julian Serrano's Tapas sits in the lobby of the Aria.  A lobby big enough to fit the Casino Royale inside of it.  The designers smartly made it wall-less on one side.  So despite any nearby windows, there's a definite feeling of space and... wait for it... aria.   The decor is casual but stark, modern but warm somehow.  Not the best in Vegas but definitely different and frankly refreshing.

Onto the food.  Hmm.   Tapas is a fancy way of saying a menu of appetizers with a re-occuring Spanish theme.   Since my partner in crime is a vegetarian, she was in paradise, since the menu sports 14 or so choices for her.  This rare circumstance ensures her return engagement.

Since I eat meat, I have to ask myself if it was really so special.  I made a mistake and ordered the ahi-tuna.  It was deep fried, very small, and dry.  I should have returned it but I was engaged in a business meeting of sorts and since I wasn't picking up the tab I stayed quiet and fed myself.   

Samples of other dishes were all pretty good -- but nothing blew me away.  What I would say is that portions should grow a little and prices should drop a little.  Or a more fun version of this idea would be 'buy three and the cheapest is free'.  That sounds silly, but trust me, that would make this fun -- which is what tapas should be.

I've tried FIREFLY off the strip and didn't think that was really much better.  Tapas is too easy a way to rip people off and instead should be too easy a way to delight customers.  I dream of Italian tapas and will keep searching for such.

Until then, not a bad Vegas resort dining experience.  But there are so many better.  MESA, TAO, RAO'S, OLIVES, BLT -- just for starters.",2,1,1

The quality of food in comparison to the price, combined with atmosphere, make this a great Strip restaurant. 

While Julian Serrrano lacks the great location (not a high floor, no views or windows) of other highly-touted celebrity chef restaurants in the Strip, it certainly does not suffer from subpar decor or ambience. Tables are spaced nicely apart, chairs are large and comfy, and the tables are big enough to promote tapas-style dining of multiple small plates shared amongst a group of people. 

Having had the real deal in Spain, I found that Julian Serrano stayed close enough to the real deal to pay proper homage to the tapas' heritage while still playing up to the level and diversity of palates you'll find on the strip. 

The pan tomate didn't shy away from liberal use of garlic, as most Americanized Spanish restaurants would. And the mixed olive plate was done in a decidedly citrusy brine with young, powerful green olives that offered great character and in-your-face brightness. 

The mushroom risotto was spot on, the arborio rice cooked to leave the perfect amount of tooth still on the grains (the pasta equivalent of al dente). We also very much enjoyed the truffled salmon, cheese plate and Spanish 'pizetttas'. 

Service throughout the evening was pretty impeccable: well-spaced, attentive, but not intrusive. What I also liked is that with the restaurant not garnering some of the popularity as other A-list chefs on the strip, Julian Serrano is neither too crowded or loud. It's all just right, and makes for a great experience.",2,0,0

The foie gras was excellent and came in a very nice wine reduction sauce.  The tortilla, egg and potato specialty was very unique.  Never tried it before but loved it.  Surprisingly savory.

We are still in Vegas and for dinner tonight we decided to come to Julian Serrano.  We have been here before and wanted to bring the family back with us. 

FOOD

This is a Tapas restaurant and everything comes out in small portions. We had four small plates and then one Paella. 

The first plate was the Queso Fresco which is a small sandwich with olives and cheese.  It was flavored perfectly. Everyone at the table loved the olive flavor with the cheese. 

Second we had the Brava Potatoes. We order this in every Spanish restaurant we ever visit because it is a staple on their menus. This one was good but definitely not the best we have ever had. It needed a little more kick that's how we prefer it. 

Third plate was the Shrimp Ceviche. The shrimp was a little too raw for some of the family's taste but we loved it.  The citrus sauce the plate is marinated in was amazing. It was the great flavor and mixed perfectly with the chips it came with. 

Fourth up was the Carne Asada. The steak wasn't very flavorful.  It felt like the plate was trying to rely on the peppers and mashed potatoes which were flavorful.  We would probably not order this plate again. 

Finally we had the Valenciana Paella and it was amazing.  No one could stop eating it once it hit the table. The flavor was great and the various elements perfectly came together. There was both chicken and sausage in the Paella and it was amazing. This plate takes a while to prepare so order it first thing when you arrive. 

The food was great. There was a few misses as far as flavor but I feel that is more a preference thing than bad preparation. Regardless this food deserves one star. 

ALCOHOL

I am not a huge fan of Spanish cocktails so I stuck to straight bourbon with my meal. They have a good selection. 

My fianc√© had a Gin and Tonic and it was amazing. They use a tonic I have never seen before called Spectacular Tonic Water and it really was spectacular. 

Overall the alcohol deserves 3\/4 of a star.  This is only because they lacked a little in the selection area as far as cocktails. 

CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE 

The Ambiance was fun and energetic which was great. It's a great place to come in a group.  Not necessarily a spot for a romantic dinner for two. 

The restaurant and restrooms were clean and well maintained. 

Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets a star. 

SERVICE

The service was excellent Richard was our waiter and he really took great care of us. He made excellent suggestions regarding quantities and how much we should order for a group of 10.  It was the perfect advice because we ended up leaving full but not stuffed.  

I also want to mention Pedro who noticed one of the people with us was trying to take a picture so he came over and offered to take a group picture for us. That was not necessary and unexpected but it is those little things that make the experience that much better. 

Overall the service was perfect and deserves one star.  

VALUE\/PRICE

The overall value is really good.  It is Tapas so the small plates are sometimes considered pricey. The total bill was $620 for 10 people and it included 13 Plates and  10 Drinks.  This appears completely reasonable to me. 

Overall the value\/price receives one star especially because this is a restaurant in Las Vegas so the value is great. 

In conclusion Julian Serrano Tapas is a 4.75 star restaurant which will round up to 5 stars. This isn't our favorite Tapas spot in Las Vegas but it is a great choice and we will be back.",0,0,0

While my coke never got a refill, the waitress was happy enough to refill my water. 2 stars = one for the nice presentation, one for the reduced portions tasting good.

Went here on a weekend awhile ago and it was busy(as expected) and not to mention we had a party of 9 so we were bound to wait. Finally got seated and were given the menu. It was really fun looking at the menu because a lot of things actually sounded really good but I ordered the salmon and the seabass and had a sample of some other stuff like ceviche and mushroom risotto. I thought the mushroom risotto was pretty good but the ceviche was kinda bland. It was refreshing but it fell short. Out of the two fishes I got, I really like the seabass. The salmon wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special. Both the dishes looked really nice though but the seabass was cooked to perfection and it had a really nice crispy skin layer to it which made it mmmm. Get a fork and slice through the fish and get some skin = mmmm goodness. 

I think the things were a bit overprice for how much you're getting and the taste is only decent. I wouldn't really come back as I have had better tapas places. I understand you're suppose to get small quantity but it kinda fell short for me. Service was nice. Maybe its just my opinion of course so if you haven't tried it, you are welcome to.

There had to be at least 70 items on the menu. And this was for LUNCH! It's a massive selection of dishes. Everything looked so good, it was hard to narrow down. But our server was helpful in making suggestions.

I recommend coming here in a large group so you can share and taste as many tapas as possible. We were a party of 4 and we had 12 dishes with a pitcher of red sangria:

Brava Potatoes - A tapas staple, and it's done right here.

Oxtail - One of my favorites of the day.

Pan Serrano - Mini baguettes with slices of serrano. Solid.

Huevo Estrellados- Skinny fries with a fried egg and Spanish pork chorizo that tasted to me like Chinese sausage. Overall, an ok dish.

White Ceviche - This was a generous portion. It was too spicy for me, but the group liked this dish a lot.

Fresh Calamari a la Plancha - I love calamari served whole like this, and this was a group favorite. Very flavorful and perfectly cooked.

Octopus - This was everyone's least favorite; it didn't have much flavor.

Foie Gras - I hoarded all this for myself, haha. Seared foie with roasted apple. Perfection.

Stuffed Dates - Medjol dates stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in crispy pancetta sounded a bit heavy to me at the time, but one bite and I was sold. These are seriously good.

Albondigas - Another tapas staple, again, superbly done. Who doesn't like Spanish meatballs?

Beef and cheese - Good, not great.

Cobia - We ordered this fish dish as an afterthought, and it was one of the surprising highlights of our meal.

Overall, very much a 5-star lunch experience.",1,0,1

I just want to let everyone know that my experience wasn't terrible. The ambiance was stunning with beautifully designed decor all around. I wish I remembered my waiter's name because he was SUPER sweet and fun (he had red hair). This review goes for the food.

When I researched a place to take my bride and the crew I came across this place. It seemed promising based on the reviews, so I booked a reservation.

I was greeted by the host who seemed slightly snooty, but I didn't let his aura bother me. 

The menu has plenty of items for tapas style and everything sounded delicious! Everyone requested their favorites for the first round and we waited patiently.

The food came out rather quickly. Let me tell you; for it to be tapas style, the portions for the price SUCKED. It's more like paying $20-$30 for a side dish and claiming that you can ""share"" it.

Problem two was the taste. I had marbled potatoes that I couldn't stick my fork through because they were so burnt. The ribs that I tried tasted like they were soaked in a cheap ass broth for 2 days and then cooked. The calamari was completely TASTELESS and I actually used a salt shaker for the first time in years.


The only reason I gave this place two stars is because our waiter was SO pleasant. If it weren't for him, I would leave just one star. I'm sure some of you were thinking ""why didn't you send it back?"" Because I don't trust restaurants when you send food back for ANY reason. I was embarrassed that my bride wasn't happy.

I don't mind paying premium for good food; Dallasites like myself eat for a living, but this was a disappointment. We went to Taco Bell after and that tasted much better than the shit at this place. 

There are better places at Aria let alone the strip.",2,0,0

It is expensive, and, as a recent graduate, I am not the richest gal. However, this is my FAVORITE restaurant in Las Vegas. Tapas are a great way to spend a couple hours over dinner. I really could not pick a favorite, but if I had to, I would say the stuffed peppers and the chorizo plate. I also absolutely love the size of their Sangria pitchers. A lot of places will charge way too much for a small amount of wine. The pitcher comes out to about 7-8 glasses. It's somewhere around $40, and it's absolutely worth it. 
The best thing about a restaurant like this is that it is suitable for ALL occasions. My boyfriend and I go for romantic dinners, I have been with my friends for my birthday twice now, and I have also been there with 12 of my extended family members! There is no wrong or inappropriate time for a restaurant like this.

Love the decor & ambiance too. 

Below are a few comments on the dishes I will be crawling back for :) And please note: I did not try all of the below in one sitting. The list includes dishes tried on 3 different sittings :) 

MUST HAVES! 
- Tuna Cones - this was my favorite dish! I wanted another order! But btw, i think it's only available at dinner. I didn't see it available on their lunch menu :( 
- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers - so delish! especially if you like goat cheese & mushrooms. Was my second favorite dish! 
- Ahi Tuna Tempura - maybe because I love both Ahi Tuna & Tempura, but I thought this was just scrumptious
- Tuna Raspberry Skewers - a nice twist of flavors. 
- White Ceviche - this ceviche was divine! My only complaint was it was a bit heavy on the lime, but then again I'm just not a lime fan ;) 
- Spanish Chicken Croquetas - kinda like fried mozzarella stick, but with chicken & creamy bechamel sauce! I really liked this. Note: I luv creamy\/cheesy stuff.  
- Grilled Lamp Chops - very tasty & tender

GOOD!, but nothing to scream about: 
- Wild Mushroom Soup - again, it was really GOOD! but I would prefer getting a second order of something above if given a choice :) 
- Lobster Salad 
- Lobster Saffron
- Beef & Cheese
- Padron Peppers - i felt like it was a bit too salty (this coming from someone who LOVES salt!) Also, it's probably more ideal as a sampler dish for a large party. For my table of 2, I felt like I had enough after a few bites, and felt padron pepper'd out by the time we finished the plate :op
- Brava Potatoes - don't get me wrong, it was delicious. but as it's a pretty filling dish, i just felt that these were not out of this world, and I'd rather fill up on one of the many other tapas choices they have to offer

Overall, it was so delicious. Can't wait to head back here soon!! :oD",5,0,3

Staff is friendly, but does not come around too often. If you order quite a few tapas, they just drop them off at your table and leave you hanging on what it might be. Also if you order too many and you're on a small table... prepare to have them just shove the plates around until they fit. :( 

But despite this, the flavors are there. The pricing isn't too bad for how much food you get in return. The plates came out super fast (within 15 minutes, we had 5 plates on the table). But since it's small and fast, it's a quick dinner and there isn't much of an experience to be had.

But solid meal. OK drinks. Didn't cost us too much, so enjoyed it for the most part! :)",3,3,4

We came here earlier this week for dinner and were lucky to get a table with a view of the TV so we could watch the end of our team's NBA playoff game. It was great that we were able to get amazing food and still catch the game! 

Our server seemed irritated that we were so into the game (a bit pretentious even) but given the casual atmosphere I didn't think it was a problem. 

Dinner was quite delicious- we started with Wagyu Beef Tartare and the Yellowtail Tapas with a half bottle of wine and enjoyed those while we waited for the Seafood Paella (the menu cautions a 40 minute wait, but I think it was less than that).

All of the food was delicious, but if I were to return I would skip the Paella and stick to tapas. 

All in all, 4 stars - due to the weirdly pretentious service in a casual fine dining establishment.",1,0,1

Ranked most favorite to least:
1. Iberico Sliders- one of the best sliders I've ever had. Caramelized onions were a nice addition.
2. Seared scallop- perfectly seared, but you only get 1.5 scallop for the price and it's not on the happy hour menu.
3. Black rice-Very rich squid ink garlicky flavor. This is a good small option if you don't want to order the paella.
4. Albondigas- really nice flavors. One if my favorites.
5. Mixed Ceviche- this was good, but nothing special. It is a great balance for the richer plates.
6. Tuna-rasberry Skewer- nice presentation, but the tuna lacked flavor. They also hide wasabi inside the raspberry which gave an unexpected kick. Sorry to ruin the surprise, but my boyfriend choked on it. I'm glad I paid the happy hour price on this one.

Prior to coming, we studied the menu and got a few ideas about what we wanted to order. Our first visit was for dinner one evening, and we decided to try their $39 prix fixe menu with the $19 wine pairing.

Everything about the meal and service was outstanding! We had a few questions about the food and possible substitutions for dessert, and what our waiter couldn't answer immediately, he quickly found out and was very helpful.

For the appetizer round, my partner and I shared the Brava Potatoes and the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers. Such simple items, but oh so delicious. The potatoes are topped with a mildly spicy bravas sauce and an alioli; when combined with the crispy potatoes, it's a perfect bite! The piquillo peppers were equally delicious. Although they're a bit small, they pack a huge punch in each bite. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but they were blended so well with the goat cheese that it made for a delicious two or three bite dish. The waiter paired a refreshing Riesling with this course and it was the perfect accompaniment. 

The entree round brought me the Organic Pork Chop with pisto serrano and a dijon mustard sauce, which was topped with thin, crispy-fried wonton crisps. My partner had the seasonal fish, which was a perfectly cooked salmon, with a side of sauteed spinach with raisins, apples, and pine nuts all topped with a buttery garlic sauce. Both dishes were cooked perfectly, but the pork chop was the standout. The dijon sauce was drool-worthy and each bite of the chop with the pisto serrano and the wonton crisps was moan-inducing. I don't usually enjoy fish, but the bite of salmon I had was very good (perfect for fish-lovers, I'm sure). We had a delicious Cava paired with this course and it complemented the dishes well.

There were three great options for dessert on the $39 menu, but we spotted the churros with a spicy chocolate dipping sauce on the $59 menu and thought we'd ask if we could substitute. Our waiter made it possible, and we could not have been more pleased. Who doesn't love a good, crispy fried churro and a spicy chocolate sauce?! He paired a sweet Sherry (Hidalgo - Pedro Jiminez) with this course and it was the perfect pairing. With each dip of the churro in the sauce, you could pick up a faint hint of the spice in the chocolate, but when you took a sip of the sherry - WOW! The sherry was so good. The hint of raisin and almond with a buttery sweet finish was the perfect coupling with the spicy-sweet fried goodness. 

The atmosphere here was great as well. You're still close enough to the casino to people-watch (if that's what you like), but it's also private enough to have a quiet meal. We were seated at one of the tables connected to the bar, which was right next to two of the kitchens where we could watch all the delicious tapas coming out. The setting is casual enough where you can come in from a day walking the strip and sit down for a great meal.

Overall, this was the best place we ate at while in Vegas. So much so, that we decided to have it for lunch the day we left (see below for details). Do yourself a favor and go to Julian Serrano now. You won't be disappointed.

********

UPDATE: Our experience the night before at another Aria restaurant was awful, so we decided to return to Julian Serrano for lunch before leaving Vegas. This time, we opted to select a few different tapas to share. Again, the service was great and we got another table near the kitchen so we could see all the delicious food coming out. Since this visit was more about trying the different tapas, here's what we had:

- Golden and Red Beet Salad: Delightfully delicious, earthy and refreshing. I never had beets before, but this was a great introduction to that earthy root. The beets were paired with frisee, citrus fruits (lime, orange and grapefruit) and molecular pineapple. There's a perfectly sweet beet syrup on the bottom that marries well with the whole salad.

- Warm Goat Cheese Salad: This was light and refreshing as well - a good dish to prep your palate for the more heartier dishes to come. 

- Traditional Spanish Chicken Croquetas: Yum! Yum! Yum! Delicately fried and filled with chicken and a scrumptious bechamel sauce, these bites are not to be missed. Four come to an order.

- Stuffed Dates: Having made these at home, we could appreciate the time-consuming effort these little meat candies take to prepare. The dates are stuffed with goat cheese (I think) and an almond, then wrapped in bacon for a perfectly sweet and savory bite. The piquillo pepper sauce on the side was a nice surprise. Mildly spicy, which was a great addition to the sweetness of the dates. Four of these come to an order as well. 

- Huevos Estrellados: We were on the brunch side of lunch, so this was a great dish. Crispy french fries topped with eggs and chorizo - a nice and hearty finish to a perfect meal.",5,0,0

The salad was really unique- there was a side salad that was dressed in basalmic dressing and the main lobster was served with avocado, corn and a delicious sauce over two small pieces of French bread. You need at least two small plates per person! I've heard the paella is delicious, but I didn't want to go that heavy. The Pinot by the glass is delicious but will set you back $17.

 I was looking forward to the vegan paella dish, that was what got my attention on their website menu. For $40, I expected it to be fantastic, and it didn't let me down. Hubby and I shared it and we polished it off. It came in a large pan with some spoons to serve ourselves onto our plates. It made for a lovely presentation, i have to say, and it was plenty of food for the two of us. We also had just one tapas to start our meal, the spinach with apple, pine nuts and garlic? It was tasty. I would have liked to try some of the other tapas too, but with the paella coming, we wanted to not stuff ourselves till we burst. 

       The decor is contemporary, the black trees in front were interesting, and I had a view of the back where they have lots of crystal vases and such on shelves. I don't know why they chose to go with that theme of glass decor, but it was classy. Our waiter was a nice guy who answered my questions patiently. The paella didn't take more than maybe 20 - 25 minutes to come out of the kitchen, which he told us would be less time than the other types, which the menu says take 45 minutes, I think. 
We didn't have sangria or any other liquor, since i can not currently. 

       I hesitate to say.that we did have an issue with a hostess whom greeted us. 
She came off as rude when she couldn't find out reservation, and asked if we booked for that night, and then said to me rather snobbily, ""this is SPANISH TAPAS"". 
I wish I had replied with ""Yes, and I was aware of that when I booked dinner here"". 
Instead, she then seemed to find it and nodded to the other hostess, without any apology for her attitude. The second hostess then walked us to a table, and cheerfully chatted me up about our vacation so far. She was very sweet but was clearly also overcompensating for #1's rudeness. Sigh. After we finished with the paella, my hubby decided to tell the waiter about her, and asked to speak with the manager. He came over and listened then said he will take some things off the bill...so he came back and hubby tells me that he took the PAELLA off, as well as my ice tea. I was shocked, that was pretty cool of him to give us our $40 entree. 
 So then hubby was very happy, and I won't comment on my emotional state at the time. Maybe we will go  back in the future for lunch, not sure right now.


    After thought:  I was going to order the spanish donuts for dessert, but there was a long pause after I was given the menu for that, so I decided to forget it. I went to the patisserie instead, and had a fun cupcake, thus ruining my vegan diet.",0,0,0

Don't  be intimidated by the almost 100 selection menu.  

Don't order more than one plate at a time (this isn't dim sum).

Do take your time.  Savor the flavor of simply prepared, quality ingredients.

While the kitchen excels at traditional tapas, do not pass the  tuna-raspberry skewer.  A multi sensory dish opening with the aroma of sesame and essence of raspberry, textural contrast of the silky cube of ahi against the seeds, the contrasting temperature of ingredients.  It just works.

To the traditional.  Top props to the monkfish and pisto.  Beautifully pan seared, moist monkfish paired with a mix of eggplant, zucchini and tomato.  Vinegar adds a good acidic zing that brightens the flavor of the fish.  Excellent mixed seafood ceviche with perfectly ""cooked"" shrimp, white fish and octopus bathed in lime and cilantro.  Other standouts, gambas a la plancha (prepared head on; oh the head fat..), tender octopus whose oceanic flavor is heightened by the earthy paprika, calamari a la plancha simply dressed in olive oil, and a very simple plate o anchovy fillets.  

Not into seafood?  Excellent rabo de toro (braised oxtail), falling off the bone, served with Iberian pork atop a very creamy, mashed potato, an excellent Iberian pork shoulder with it's deep, porky flavor, and a sublime plate of imported pata negra (ham from the black footed pig).  The hazelnuts of the pig's diet is very prominent in the complex flavor of the ham.

All to often restaurants use ""tapas' as an excuse to serve up small portions at high prices.

Couple of items I definitely think are worth checking out: goat cheese lollipops, Spanish sliders, brava potatoes and of course churros for dessert. However beware, the ribs here nothing but flavored fat. The food was delicious without a doubt, I could probably eat most of those dishes again without hesitation. 

Julian Serrano like the other restaurants at City Center looks great. Nice open spot, very hip and service was nothing to complain about. Hit up OpenTable to get a reservation unless you like waiting.

JS is definitely more expensive than some of the other tapas restaurants around the Strip, but hey... you are eating at Aria after all. Around $10-$20 for most plates but the portions are small. I couldn't help but be disappointed at how small the plates were. Each tapa usually translates to only 2-3 bites when sharing with the table.

I certainly don't, so that's why I made a beeline to Julian Serrano for my first night's dinner on the Strip.

First of all, Chef Julian Serrano's eponymous restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  It overflows with bold, colorful tile that's a feast for the eyes.  It's also *very* loud in there, since it's directly adjacent to the Aria resort lobby, a mere feet from hordes of tired hotel guests checking in and out.  And, no, there are no walls to keep out the hubbub.

After taking a seat at the long, comfortably, and classy bar, I was quickly helped by one of the friendly and efficiently bartenders.  After ordering a glass of Sauvignon blanc to whet the palate, I browsed the mouthwatering -- and **long** -- menu of tapas options.  The menu is nicely organized into fish\/ceviche, veggie, and meat\/poultry tapas, making it easy to navigate.  There's also a catch-all ""new style"" tapas category, as well as paellas and ""platos grandes"" for those of you with larger appetites.

Four items were just enough to fill the belly without making me uncomfortably full.  Here's the rundown of what I tried:

1.  White ceviche.  Everyone knows I love a good ceviche, and this one was a knockout.  The white fish was tender and flaky, with just the right amount of heat and tang from the lime and cilantro.

2.  Brava potatoes.  This dish was a little less exciting than I thought it would be -- it's essentially just fries with aioli.  That said, the flavors were excellent.  There's a *lot* of aioli provided, so I ended up taking the excess off to prevent the potatoes from getting soft.  I did enjoy eating the potatoes with the little skewers provided.

3.  Tuna cones.  This dish was the weirdest and also my least favorite.  It consisted of 3 wantons (rolled into ice cream cones), which were filled with avocado, and then ahi tartare and aioli on top.  Again, my issue was the overabundance of aioli, which overwhelmed everything else.  I couldn't taste the tuna at all.

4.  Santiago's cake.  This was an almond cake dusted with powdered sugar, with a side of almond ice cream.  Simple but very well done.  My only gripe was that the cake was a little dry, but this was remedied by letting the ice cream melt all over it.  

All in all, Julian Serrano was a great dinner, although the little hiccups along the way make me hesitant about rushing back.  After all, you're paying Vegas Strip prices here (most tapas are in the $10-15 range, but some are more), so you tend to expect perfection for your buck.

That said, with all the amazing options on Julian Serrano's menu, it'd be hard to resist the temptation to try them all.  =)",8,4,6

The great reviews on Yelp along with recommendations from friends made us very excited to come here and boy were we shocked. Every item we ordered off the menu was poorly executed (read over\/undercooked and a total lack of seasoning). This was only further exacerbated when I asked our server how an item on the menu was prepared to which he stated he wasn't sure but he would go ask the chef. We didn't hear anything from him for about 15 minutes so I finally flagged him down to follow up, only to have him state with a dumbfounded look that he did not have an answer because he ""could not find the chef."" We ordered two more entrees after this, 1 fish (the one which I had the unanswered question about) and 1 chicken. Suffice it to say, the fish came out horribly overlooked and chicken undercooked (YIKES I KNOW), and again both were completely under seasoned.  To top it all off, for a $300 meal the service was completely piss poor, the waiter never came by to ask how things were nor did anyone ever follow up.

So in summary, considering the server could not find a chef in the entire restaurant, our experience is far from surprising albeit inexcusable. That being said I can't help but feel robbed in 2 ways, one of the over $300 we spent on this terrible meal, and two of the amazing culinary experience we were promised and went to enjoy on a very special occasion.",0,2,0

When I stayed in Vegas about 2-1\/2 years ago, my hotel reservations were changed last minute and I ended up staying at the Aria.  I had no time to research food options ahead of time so I asked at the concierge desk for a recommendation.  The girl who helped me said her favorite was Julian Serrano.  I had never tried a Spanish restaurant and was a little apprehensive about doing so but I had a feeling I should eat there.  And I was 100% right!  

We went around 4 PM on a weekday before the flight home so it was less busy than at other peak times.  We started by ordering three tapas, which are small plates, all very different but all delicious.  Servers do not rush you through your food as we had ordered only two tapas at first and later added the third.  My favorite was the piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese.  I could literally eat a giant plate filled with just those but I wanted to try so many different things.  Even though I am a picky eater who was vegetarian at the time, I found lots to choose from.  I also came away with a love for manchego cheese, which I had never tasted before.  We then ordered the veggie paella which I recommend ordering right away since it's cooked fresh and takes about 45 minutes to prepare (trust me, it's so worth it!).  The paella is served in a hot pan and meant to be eaten by two people.  And the taste is simply amazing!!  The portion, even for two people, is very generous and I couldn't help going back for more.  The wine I ordered was a French white wine (I don't remember the name) based on the recommendation of our server and it beautifully complemented the meal.  We ordered desserts too which were so decadent and the perfect way to wrap up our dinner.  All in all, the food was delicious, the service was excellent, the ambiance was perfect and Julian Serrano is a must-try if you're ever in Vegas!",2,0,1

One is that the chicken croquettes are excellent, and not at all what I was expecting.  It's crispy and firm, but when you bite into it's like you just had a spoonful of soup.  It's was surprising for the first bite, as it is creamy and does not have the solid consistency you expect when you bit into it, but once you accept the oddity of it, it's really good.  

Two is that the sangria is really, really good.  Get the one with champagne in it.",1,0,0

The colours were bright and cheerful -it's an open air type place. It seemed friendly and we were looking forward to a fun time. 

I love tapas, and yes while I know it means ""small plates"" I seriously wasn't expecting the portions to be SO small ! 

We asked the server what she liked, and she recommended the bread with cheese.
Which was exactly that - 

We also ordered 2 other items - I can't recall exactly what they were, but it was something that was no more then 2 bites, and the other was some paper thin meat that cost almost 30$

Went here for dinner just before Christmas and had an excellent meal. 

We ordered chicken croquettas, mini chorizo on mash and patatas bravas to start. All really good. We then had the Valencian paella which has chicken, chorizo and rabbit. This was excellent and the best paella I've had outside of Spain. We shared a creme catalan for dessert which is more than big enough for 2.

There is plenty of choice on the menu and the wine list has a good selection of reasonably priced wines too, Its not too expensive (only spent around $120 for 2 with wine) and had a great time.

x BLACK RICE squid ink good upon first bite. Calamari was fresh and not chewy at all. The squid ink mouse was lovely and flavoursome. But after a few bites, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the cream and flavour. 
x LOBSTER FIDEUA lobster and angel hair pasta. This was super creamy too. And super overpowering in flavour.
x LOBSTER SALAD. This was just bland pieces of lobster chunks with a boring garden salad on the side. It should be called Lobster and Garden Salad.

At the end of our meal, my partner had a stomach ache, and I just felt gross from all the cream. We also couldn't stop downing water through the night due to all the MSG they added in the dishes.

If a restaurant description highlights tapas, I will most likely run in the other direction, okay that's a little dramatic, I'll be off to the side, sippin on some sangria. Small portions, high price tag, hitting the mark ~maybe~ 3 out of 6 dishes, what is there to like? I have no idea why I decided to make reservations at a tapas place for a bachelorette party, but I'm really happy I did because Julian Serrano did good work with our group of 9 people. 

Ordering tapas is really tricky for such a large group. You have to make sure portions are large enough so everyone can try a bit of everything and at the same time, satisfy what everyone wants to order. One look at the menu and my face was definitely showing some stress and anguish, regretting my restaurant selection: ""oh my god how many meat and seafood dishes do we need? do we even look at the vegetables section? what about paella?"" Thankfully, a brief consultation with our server helped us out significantly. For about $40 pp, she selected what she thought our group would enjoy the most. She even asked us if there was anything we definitely wanted to get (yes, we specified a couple) and she made sure it got to our table as part of our meal. After 8 dishes and a paella, we were happy and full, ready to start our night out!

+ Mixed Seafood Ceviche: shrimp, white fish, octopus, cilantro. Taro chips were the bomb diggity and went with the seafood perfectly.
+ Fried Calamari: exactly what it sounds like. It comes with 2 sauces, 1 creamy, 1 tomato based. 
+ Pan Serrano: faluta bread, tomato, serrano ham, manchego cheese. This seemed like a filler dish, but honestly, with all the other dishes to come, I was happy to have some bread.
+ Yellowtail Tiradito: sweet potato haystacks, horseradish cream, ponzu. I would definitely get this again. Ponzu me all day~
+ Gambas: sauteed shrimp, garlic, brava sauce, arbol chilis
+ Mediterranean Chicken Skewer: apricot, beet hummus, onion, spices. The apricot was a pleasant surprise here. The sweetness highlighted the spices on the chicken very nicely.
+ Grilled Rib Eye Steak: piquillo confit, mushroom demi
+ Pinxto Moruno: colorado lamb, fulful bhar, onion, mushroom
+ Mixed Paella: lobster, mussels, shrimp, chicken, spanish pork chorizo. Yum, best paella I've ever had. Perfectly cooked rice, flavorful, fulllllllly loaded with all the good stuff. 

We got 2 dishes of each item listed above, one for each side of the table. Our server was incredibly nice and also split up the massive paella pan into 2 separate large plates for us as well.

My husband, was hesitant as he's not really into fine dining, but I really wanted to give it a chance for a date night with no kids as I was lazy to leave the strip.

We had 8PM dinner reservations. The place was packed. We had immediate service however, so no complaint there. It is also very loud in the restaurant, so be prepared to talk over one another.

We ordered the lobster salad, stuffed dates, mushroom risotto, mussels, tuna cones, and the rice pudding for dessert. 

Lobster Salad-big disappointment. Very small piece of lobster on mixed greens on their house bread.

Stuffed Dates- I love me some bacon wrapped dates, probably my favorite tapas we tried.

Mushroom Risotto-This dish was actually very tasty. The risotto wasn't soggy nor was the rice undercooked.

Mussels-My husband loved this dish. The broth was very flavorful, and went well with the house bread.

Tuna Cones- I was not really feeling these. They kinda tasted like spicy tuna rolls gone bad wrapped in a fried wonton with spicy guacamole. I get the whole deconstruction thing, but it wasnt for me.

Rice Pudding-Everyone around was ordering churros, but we were so stuffed we opted for the rice pudding instead. It was a light sweet way to end dessert.

The biggest problem of the night, was that our credit card got charged twice for dinner. I only found out after my bank called to alert me of a fraudulent charge. Of course the restaurant was closed by the time I found out. I called back the next day at opening and spoke to Min the assistant manager who said he would call me back after investigating what happened. Turns out the waitress did run our card twice.  The waitress claims she did it on accident and refunded the second charge. She could've at least told us this when she brought the receipt for us to sign. I get she doesn't wanna be embarassed for making a mistake, but common you dont mess with people's money. Min guaranteed it would be refunded.

Dishes were dropped at the table without the runner announcing what the dish was, the table wasn't crumbed or resilvered between tapas & paella, server was brusque, etc.

The real issue came about when the paella was delivered to the table with just a tiny bit of crust around the outside.  It was too soft throughout the dish even though I had ordered it to have a crispy bottom (socorrat).  I reported this to my server as he checked on the table and he interrupted me, saying he'd send the manager.

The server returned to the table after a few minutes and abruptly said the paella is as crispy as it gets.  I informed him that this isn't true as I'd had crispier paella Valencianas in this very dining room before.  I requested that he send the manager as he had said he would earlier.

The manager was argumentative, rude, and not at all genuine.  He left the table and then returned with the check laughing.  I asked to speak to his manager.

After that, the GM came to the table.  He introduced himself, shook my hand, and then immediately began talking.  He wasn't interested in listening to me or my concerns.

I miss foie gras. Therefore, you can imagine how thrilled I was when I perused the menu at Julian Serrano and found that it was offered as a tapas dish for $20!

I received a generously thick slice, seared to perfection, and beautifully presented atop a toasted brioche. Delicious!

I was so delighted that I returned the next day with 4 of my girls who were also excited about the foie gras. When we received our plates, everyone was happy...except me. Where everyone else had gotten a repeat of the lovely foie gras dish I had received the day prior, mine looked like a burnt, shriveled up piece of unrecognizable offal placed on a piece of bread. I hemmed and hawed about whether or not I should suck it up and eat the damn thing, or speak to management about the difference between my dish and everyone else's. In the end, I opted to speak up because I was paying the same amount as everyone else and felt I deserved the same quality.

The staff was very sweet and the manager was quick to have my dish taken back and replaced with something that more closely resembled what I had in mind. I felt that they handled the situation very graciously and professionally which really enhanced our dining experience.

The foie gras was obviously the star of the show, but we also enjoyed the oxtail, salmon with truffle, garlic chicken, ahi tuna tartar cones, and poached lobster...among the many dishes we ordered.

I simply do not agree with all the folks who rave about this restaurant.  While I share the minority opinion, the reviews from people who have lived in Spain are on par with my rating.

We made a reservation two weeks in advance on Open Table.  We were not walk-ins.  Let me start with the few positives.  The sommelier was extremely helpful in the wine selection process.  The black rice with squid ink was a winner.  And here ends the positives.

What didn't I like?  I was looking forward to sampling white anchovies.  They came on toasted bread with piquillo peppers.  I was underwhelmed.  As an anchovy lover, this dish was a huge disappointment.  The salty, creamy but sharp bite of the anchovies was lost in the bread and peppers.   Jaleo knows how to do white anchovies, hands down.  Let the anchovies speak for themselves.  Don't hide them in other ingredients.

The octopus was rubbery and tough and had obviously been overcooked.  The clove seasoning in the oxtails was completely overpowering, and the pork ""wrapper"", touted as Iberico pork, was ghoulishly transparent and unpleasantly chewy.

We observed dishes of paella being taken to other tables.  They looked mouth-watering.  Perhaps we would have been more impressed with the paella versus the tapas we ordered.

Now for my commentary on the service.  With the exception of the sommelier, I have little I can say that is complimentary.  Our server seemed clueless about the menu.  Unlike other tapas restaurants we have dined at, he explained nothing to us about any of the dishes.  When we asked about any particular dish, his response was always, ""Oh, that's a wonderful choice.""   Dishes would arrive to our table within two minutes of ordering.  What was this?  A production\/assembly line?  I had to wonder.  The rapidity with which the dishes were conjured up makes me feel sure that they were not made to order.  

I realize that most Americans revel in choking down a meal in under 45 minutes and feel they are receiving horrible service if food doesn't appear on their table within five minutes.  To the European visitors who understand what dining is, I apologize for this gauche and crass behavior.  Not all of us are like this.  But perhaps the American penchant for scarfing down food and failing to enjoy the dining experience explains the service at Julian Serrano.  This is not okay with us.  This is a high-end restaurant.  This isn't Chili's or Applebees.  We felt rushed by our server, and we did not want to be rushed.  We told him that.  It went in one ear and out the other.  We no sooner finished one tapas, and the server was back at our table within seconds, wanting us to order another dish as quickly as possible.  

When I'm at a high-end restaurant such as this, my expectation is that the staff are highly trained.  They should know better than clearing away a plate before all the diners at the table have finished eating.   I was about to eat one of the stuffed dates -- the last one.  I had the date on my fork.  Before I could dip it in the tomato jam on the serving plate, a staff member came by and whisked away the serving plate.  What the hell?  Poof.  It was gone.  The tomato jam was gone.  So was the person who picked up the plate without even asking me if I was finished with it.  The unspoken message was ""hurry up and eat and get out of here so we can turn the table.""  Guess what, Julian Serrano?  Choking down tapas and getting out quickly isn't what the tapas experience is about.  

I'm still not done.  We had made our way through four small tapas plates.  Our server came back and handed us a dessert menu.  He never asked if we were ready for it or wanted it.  He never asked if we would like more tapas.  We wanted more tapas and told him so.  He seemed miffed.  This reinforced our perception that the restaurant wants you to eat quickly and get the hell out so they can turn the tables.  We ordered more tapas. 

When we were finished with our meal, I asked for a coffee.  Upon adding the cream, the coffee resembled dirty dish water.  I poured some ""cream"" onto the coffee spoon to taste it.  It was not cream.  It was not half and half.  It was not even full fat milk.  It was 2 percent milk at best.  Unacceptable.

We've had a number of tapas meals at Jaleo in The Cosmopolitan as well as other tapas restaurants in Southern California and Utah (a special shout out to Finca). They are all so much better than Julian Serrano.  The tapas are better; the service is better; the servers are knowledgeable about the menu; the vibe and atmospheres are better.

We won't be back to Julian Serrano.",4,0,1

And I have to tell everyone who have only been to those places to branch out and try some of the fine dining vegas has to offer.

I was staying in Aria and it was my friend's birthday so we decided to splurge a little bit on a celebration dinner. We had 8 people with us and we were able to get seated right away with our reservation. The first thing our waiter recommended to us was the sangria. That definitely did not disappoint - it was strong enough to get me buzzed with just two glasses.

We got a variety of dishes:

1. Raspberry Tuna - SO GOOD. it wasn't overwhelmingly fishy and the raspberry added a nice texture. The presentation was nice too. (comes in 4)

2. Creamy Risotto - this was probably the best dish of the night. Everyone on yelp raves about this dish, and it was my favorite. Super filling and enough for 4 people to share (unless you're a manly man that eats whole cows for dinner, then you may need 4 plates).

3. Lobster noodle dish - not sure what it was called, but I didn't particularly like this one. Reminds me of chow mein done wrong.

4. Seafood ceviche - Delicious! recommended for anyone who likes ceviche, can't really say too much about it other than it was good.

5. Ox Tail - i was pleasantly surprised about this one! so good and rich, a good meat dish since we ordered mostly seafood.

A thing to note is that these are tapas and the portions are small. We paid about 40 dollars a person which I felt was really affordable with the quality of food and presentation.

- lobster gazpacho | traditional chilled spanish soup with lobster meat

- stuffed piquillo peppers | goat cheese | mushrooms 
(one of my favorite tapas menu item to order. Nice spice and the goat cheese was cooked to perfection)


ENTR√âE 
- fish | fresh seasonal selection
(fish for the day was a salmon. I usually rarely order something I can make myself at home but the fish was cooked perfectly. nice slice and seasoned well. paired with baby carrots and seasonal vegetables. I would opt for the other items available if possible but still a nice entree)

- pork chop | sous vide pork chop | baby carrots | dry fruit | px demi
(entree is HUGE! might take 3 people to finish this course. the dates and prunes were a great addition to the dish. sauce was amazingly flavorful. a definite try)

DESSERT 
- molten chocolate cake | baked meringue | blood orange sorbet
(best dessert available. blood orange sorbet was beautifully crafted. chocolate cake was so gorgeous)

- santiago's cake | almond cake | turr√≥n ice cream | caramelized nuts 
(server recommended this cake over the the other option. Can't get Turron ice cream like this anywhere.


OVERALL
Julian Serrano is known for his work over at Picasso at the Bellagio. His tapas inspired restaurant at the Aria is bit more casual than his offering at the other hotel.

But, really. JS is one of our favorite lunch options in Vegas and for good reason! We have been here twice and both times have cemented themselves into my mind, directly wiring themselves in my brain to the drooling mechanism....
Okay, enough with the gushing, let's get down to business: 

Ambiance\/Appearance:

This is one heck of a dazzling restaurant inside of Aria. JS is delightfully colorful and has a welcoming yet upscale ambiance mood in the air. The hostess\/seating staff is friendly and we've never had to wait to be seated, even on a weekend. The seating is comfy and, if in view of the bar area, you can catch up on your favorite sporting game\/ESPN. I usually don't mention bathrooms in my reviews..but they have nifty Spanish lessons on the speakers while you do your business. 
...Soooo multicultural. 

Service:
Service has always been 4.5 stars. Only complaint is that water refills can be a bit delayed..and I drink a lot of water. No worries, though! This minor drawback is overshadowed by the knowledgeable waitstaff and accommodating manager (later on). 

FOOOOOD:

Julian Serrano has such a wide array of Spanish tapas, it can almost be a bit daunting when you first open the menu. The prices are extremely reasonable for Las Vegas, no less for such a fabulous restaurant. We have had our fair share of tapas, and I seem to remember the following (** designating favorites): 

**--Ahi Tuna Tempura: Fresh Ahi with just the slightest tempura crusting..not this thick coating that other places are enamored with that overpowers the tuna flavor. I want to say there are approximately 3 or 4 decently sized pieces. Great for a table of four! 

--Bunuelos de Bacalao: Essentially fried cod, but this fried cod was pretty tasty. It came with a nice potato puree that complimented the Atlantic cod quite nicely. If I had to pick between this and the tuna, though, I pick the Ahi Tuna every time. 

--Papas Bravas: Good potatoes, but I actually found this dish very boring. I wouldn't order it again. 

--Huevos Estrellados: Uses the above potatoes, but has Spanish chorizo and fried, runny egg mixed throughout to create an interesting, homogeneous mixture of egg, salty chorizo, and the potatoes. My dad LOVES this dish, but I found it semi-average, mostly because I don't like runny eggs! If you're a fan of that, then this dish is right up your alley. 

**--Stuffed Piquillo Peppers: OMG. I don't like pulling out the ""OMG"" card very often...but... OMG. These are so amazing. Maybe because I'm such a sucker for good goat cheese...and this has excellent goat cheese stuffed within the sliced peppers. I had never had a piquillo pepper before, and I'm kicking myself for wasting so many years not stuffing my face with these lovely red peppers. So delicious! 

**--Creamy Risotto: Consisting of wild mushrooms and aged manchego, mmmm. My mom orders this each time and I make sure to get my fair share. The manchego makes this item as good as it is. 

--Chicken Croquetas: Fried in the same way as a lightly breaded cheese stick (the only analogy I can think of). The base inside is a creamy Bechamel sauce. I can't remember too much about these otherwise. Still good! Give these a shot. 

**--Beef & Cheese: GETTT THISSSS. This may sound like the most unappetizing, boring name for a dish EVER; however, this is perhaps my favorite item we get each time. This was some of the most tender steak I've had in my years (and I've eaten at my fair share of steakhouses-- take a look at my review for SW Steakhouse at Wynn for my feelings about that!). 

--Pintxo de Chorizos: The pork was too tough for our liking...maybe we just caught them on a bad day. Skip this one unless you're a huge fan of marinated pork chorizo. We let our waiter know that we weren't big fans of this, and he took it away, and the manager came over and took it off the bill and apologized profusely. No worries, Neil Patrick Harris twin! (Seriously. This guy is a carbon copy of NPH). 


DESSERTS:
(~View my picture uploads for a peek at these desserts)

**--Churros: Served with a spicy chocolate sauce. Delicious churros. Being from the Southwest, I was a bit skeptical to try these...but my family loves Julian's take on churros! Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Give these teardrop-shaped, fried pastries a try. 

--Flan: Creamy and over too liquid-y like some can be. Had a delicious fruit ensemble atop the flan with most berries. 

--Bunuelos: Pretty much like beignet donuts. We also enjoy these. Served with a butterscotch type of sauce...mm. I still prefer the churros, though! 

TIP: This place can get packed on weekend dinners. Call during the day for reservations. 

Bottom line: I can't wait to go back to get my tapas fix.",0,2,0

6 of us had dinner here last night, with 2 pitchers of sangria and dessert, and the bill was about $435 with tip. We were comfortably fed, but frankly I could have continued eating. I would come again, but probably not for full dinner.

We had reservations and were seated right away, near the front open area, which was fine with us. There were open tables in back, we probably could have requested to be seated in a more private area if we wanted. Servers were attentive, made good recommendations when requested, explained each dish well, and kept our glasses full of both water and sangria. 

We had (multiples of many for a table of 6):

1 pitcher each, red and white sangria (both delicious! best I've ever had)
*White Ceviche (great texture, lots of lime flavor, good portion size)
*Seared Scallop (again, great texture, like butter, perfectly cooked, smallish portion, 1 scallop)
*Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (a favorite of the night! ordered a second round, 2 peppers per plate)
*Creamy Risotto (another best of the night! perfect texture and flavor, moderate portion size)
Beef & Cheese (simple name for a tasty dish, good quality, cooked and seasoned well, not super spectacular though, moderate portion size)
Tuna Sashimi Cones (great quality, well balanced flavors, but not something I'll crave on its own, 3 cones per plate)
Fried Calamari (very good but pretty basic recipe, nothing I can't get elsewhere, moderate portion size)
Brava Potatoes (crunchy outside, soft inside, tasty sauce, but still just potatoes, good portion size)
Spanish Tortilla (misnomer - this is not a tortilla, more like a potato layered quiche. tasty but nothing special - needed more salt, moderate portion size)

And for dessert we had the Churros and Spicy Chocolate sauce. I was a little disappointed with this dish after the rave reviews on Yelp. It was good, but I would have preferred more cinnamon on the churro, and it was a little too crunchy, in my opinion. 

Overall, it was a very good meal. I probably won't go back for dinner due to ""price to fullness"" ratio, but I would go for a splurge on drinks with appetizers. I would highly recommend the Sangria, and I marked the dishes with a * that I would definitely order again.

Many reviews have compared this to Firefly, and I would absolutely rate Julian's higher on quality and class, but maybe not quite worth the price jump for smaller portions. That's just my opinion and I'm sure others will disagree.",0,0,0

The good- takes reservations, helpful waiter, pretty fast service, decent food, and splits the bill 5 ways with 5 credit cards.  The bad- it ate my wallet, inside and out.  serving size is ok to share, and ok to not share.

What we ordered: 
lobster salad- decent.  not too special
crispy pancetta iberica- pork was excellent (nice and fatty), but pee puree on the side was nasty.
white ceviche- excellent job with this.  the only thing at the end was that it got super sour. 
mediterranean bass- nice and moist.  nothing too special about it, but they did a good job of it.
tuna cones- aesthetically pleasing to look at.  i don't really like avocado, but it was good to eat.  towards the end though, it got a little too rich and creamy. 
seared scallop- i've had better.  came out rubbery since it was a little overcooked.  don't order this.  only two pieces too!
pato confitado- my dish of the night.  duck was SUPER tender, SUPER moist.  the sauce was excellent.  a MUST-TRY.  
grilled angus flat-iron steak- just the regular.  don't bother wasting your time since you can get it practically anywhere.  
bacalao a la gabardina- battered fried fish.  nothing too special but the dipping sauce was good.
red sangria- couldn't really taste the fruit in there, but it was good.
virgin sangria- tasted like a dole fruit juice, but better.  had fresh strawberry puree in it.  

We ordered double of three dishes, but all this was enough to get us pretty full.  The desserts looked appetizing, but since we were in a happy place and out wallets already emptied out, we called it a meal.

Julian Serrano is a tapas spot that is near the front lobby of the Aria Hotel.  The decor reminds me a little bit of the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in MGM Grand in how the restaurant is very much open to the casino and the hotel.  There are no big and thick walls separating the dining area from the nearby bustling activity of the casino.

The decor is very upscale cafe-like and hotel restaurant-like.  Nice and contemporary but pretty standard stuff (not unique or memorable).

We had a few things here and I felt the food looked better than it tasted.  Several of the dishes were average.  I was not a big fan of Fleur by Hubert Keller (a tapas spot in Mandalay Bay), but I felt Fleur was noticeably better than Julian Serrano.

Here is a rundown on what we had.

(Ahi Tuna Tempura) This was ahi tuna two ways.  There was a standard ahi tuna tower on the plate that had an avocado base (fresh and a good flavor but something you will find at a lot of other restaurants).

There was also ahi tuna that was flash fried in a light tempura batter (crispy on the outside but still rare on the inside).  This was okay and I liked the contrast of the cool center with the crisp outside.  Still, I've had a much better version of that dish at Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica.

(Mediterranean Bass)  This was a bass with the skin-on that was served over some veggies with a light sauce.  It was a light dish and had a mild flavor.  The fish was pretty moist (the skin could have been crisper).

(Cheese Platter) The cheese selection at Fleur was much better.  The cheese here was a little dry (not great flavors either).  The garnishes were also disappointing.  The fruit paste was too thick and lacked sweetness.

(Chicken Skewers) The chicken skewers here were juicy enough, but they lacked flavor.

(Prime Tenderloin Topped With Cheese, Honey And Pecans) The quality of beef was really poor (at least when compared to the other dishes we had here). The beef was a thin piece.  They overcooked it  (it came out well) and it was dry and chewy.  The cheese, honey and pecans were all fine, but the centerpiece of the dish (beef) was a real disappointment.

(Stuffed Dates) The dates here were wrapped in bacon and then deep-fried.  This is a pretty popular combination and their version of it was pretty tasty (though kind of a given with this flavor combination).

Service was okay.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive enough, but I felt the wait staff was not as strong as what I experienced at other Vegas spots recently (including Fleur, Mesa Grill, Comme Ca, Bouchon, and Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill).

I've been fortunate enough to have a lot of service where it felt the wait staff was really putting in the extra effort to make every aspect of the dining experience enjoyable and memorable.  While the wait staff was pleasant enough, I did not get that same feeling here.

Julian Serrano sounds like it would be a nice place.  The menu reads nice as well.  There were mostly misses here though and the food was just not as good as other Vegas spots I've tried in the same price range.  I will give a lot of places a second try, but since we had so many dishes and so many were average, I doubt I would return here.

Aria features complimentary valet parking.  I am not sure if they feature complimentary self-parking as well.",18,16,16

Julian Serrano tries to go upscale with attractively presented tapas served in the contemporary atmosphere of the Aria.

While the menu gradually evolves over time, when I stopped by, items like the grilled eggplant and the lobster tail were perfectly decent. Not mindblowing, but by no means bad. The same went for the cocktails; all reasonably good stuff, but like the food and like much of Vegas on this part of the continuum, just a tad spendy given the portions. Service was commendably on point.

If you're looking to see and be seen in an atmospheric setting where expense isn't a concern, then this isn't a bad choice. If you're looking for excellent value, there might be better choices out there, especially if you're willing to if you're willing to search for good places on Yelp that might be a short drive or inexpensive cab ride away from the Strip.",1,0,0

* Empanada mallorquina - NOT GOOD. TOO SALTY of a sandwich.

This meal usually sets the tone for the rest of the trip, and Julian Serrano Tapas met the challenge, which I now present the review of Julian Serrano Tapas.

We tried to get a table at the two Asian-inspired restaurants just outside the Sky Suites entrance to the Casino floor, but each had over an hour wait without reservations. Discouraged, we decided to walk to the lobby area and try Sage or Julian Serrano.¬† Unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately,) Sage was holding a private event, so we ventured into Julian Serrano Tapas. We were sat right away and the fun began!

Decor
The ambiance, decor, and atmosphere of Julian Serrano Tapas is vibrant, energetic, and filled with loud voices and music. It felt like the back floor of a Vegas club like Hakkasan or Omnia. (I'd plug Jewel as the Aria on-property club, but not¬†having never been, I can't say. The restaurant floor felt like we were now in Vegas!

Food
Julian Serrano Tapas is billed as a Classic Spanish Tapas restaurant with timeless classics such as paella and whole suckling pig- with a huge assortment of tapas to follow. In that it was only two of us, we decided to stick to tapas and drinks. For libations, we decided on sangria (of course) and a glass of Spanish red wine.

Our dinner consisted of six tapas: Yellowtail Tiradito, Pan Manchego, Calamari A La Plancha, Serrano Tender with Foie Gras, Seared Scallop Skewers, and Spanish Chicken Croquettes.¬† Each dish was relatively small, as tapas are, but after sharing six between two of us, we were both stuffed.

There were some hits and near-misses (not terrible, just not amazing),¬†but¬†I'll share our three favorites - which just happened to be the three seafood tapas!

The Yellowtail Tiradito was by far our favorite dish of the evening. It was a different take on yellowtail than I've ever had - a genius combination of flavors and textures presented by the crispy filo threads, offset by the fresh micro greens, the¬†bite of horseradish, and the¬†tang of ponzu. I thought my taste buds would be confused, but it just worked!

The Seared Scallop Skewers were the next in line for our favorite. Each perfectly grilled scallop was accompanied by the mild but flavorful piquillo pepper, apricot, and romesco. Yet another inventive, near-crazy combination that just worked so well.

Our final favorite of the evening was the Calamari A La Plancha, or Grilled Squid by translation. The calamari was tender and when you mixed the dish up in the citrus allioli and carmelized onion, it tasted even better.

Every dish was a creative blend of competing flavors that provided balance and excitement to the taste buds. I need to come again and have the paella!

Service
Not much can be said about the service other than it was spot on, attentive, and both the front and back of the house worked in perfect union. Dishes were spaced out perfectly, which was a necessity as our two-top probably wouldn't have held more than two dishes at one time. Overall great service made for a great experience!",0,0,4

From the moment we sat down, everyone was super accommodating and friendly. The waitress obliged our many questions about the dishes. Even when we asked probably dumb questions to the sommelier, he seemed just genuinely excited to talk about wine. Definitely not the usual smug a*hole you find at most expensive restaurants.

From the rather dark and cave like ambiance of the Aria Hotel's casino floor, Julian Serrano (JS) is a pop of very bright colors and trendy styles. There are decorative sound barriers between the casino floor and the restaurant, so you are sheltered from all the noise and smoke of the casino.

The tapas dishes were the second best tapas I'd ever had, second only to Jose Andres. The traditional Spanish dishes are tasty, but you can generally get them at most Spanish tapas restaurants. Branch out, and try the dishes from the ""Modern"" section of the menu. These are the hallmarks of Julian Serrano's creativity, not just a mastery of traditional Spanish dishes.

Best Dishes:
The molecular mozzarella with pork belly was fantastic. 
The rabbit and garlic mash dish was very garlicy and delicious.
Huevos Estrellados: This dish was a heart attack we had no chance of finishing, but it was delicious. French fries, fried eggs, and chorizo. Wrap your head around that one.

Not so great dishes:
While I love lobster, and I love pineapple, the lobster-pineapple skewer was too salty\/rubbery, and not my favorite.
The gambas\/shrimp dish was just cooked shrimp in a bowl of garlic-flavored butter. Really nothing to write home about.

Dishes run about 10-15 dollars each.  Total bill at the end of the night was under $200 for two of us after a bottle of wine (average price, not vintage, not the cheapest on the menu), enough tapas dishes to really fill us up, and a split dessert.",4,2,3

Entrees: 
Steamed Mussels, steamed in shallot and garlic, brandy, natural jus. Broth was full of flavor, just wished we had bread to soak it all up (wasn't offered). 

Brava Potatoes, covered with spicy tomatoes and aioli sauce. Spicy with a kick! 

Mixed Paella with lobster, mussels, chicken, Spanish pork chorizo, vegetables and saffron rice. The rice was a little under cooked. Lots of ingredients but lack the saffron flavor, which makes a good paella dish. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Not your norm tapas place. I'm used to tapas places with the Spanish flare, fun d√©cor and loud (the louder the better!). A bit pricey, but that's what you pay to get the Vegas feel. Portions were small.  I guess my search continues to find the best tapas place in Vegas.",0,0,0

We got our usuals-Calamari a la plancha, mixed seafood ceviche, risotto, stuffed dates, red sangria,etc. meanwhile, we placed an order for paella valenciana, knowing it takes 35 minutes to prepare...our waiter tries to persuade us to order a paella for four, but we kindly decline, so it'll allow us to order more tapas.

Round two, we get the raspberry tuna skewers, flat iron steak , pan con manchego, and chorizo con huevos y papa which were all tasty. Finishing up round two, Our waiter busts out the DESSERT MENUS!?

We remind him of our Paella Valenciana and homeboy FORGOT TO PLACE THE ORDER! Luckily for him, we were all in a good mood, so his mistake didn't ruin our evening, and it was chef Nathan to the rescue again, sending out an order of croquettas and tuna tiradito to hold us over.
The Paella was tasty as usual, and gone in a matter of minutes...

The best part of the night was when we didn't order desserts because we had Rudy's cake coming...Complete with a firework candle, that cake was the center of attention in the dining room. All you could see was a big smile from ear to ear, and Rudy repeatedly saying ""That's frickin' bad-ass!""

That cake looked and tasted great...most of all, it made Rudy's night a memorable one as well. After soaking it all in, and beginning to get teary-eyed, He leans over to Lorena and says,
""I'm 29 years old, and I've never gotten a birthday cake.""

Well, there's always a first for everything, and I'm glad I got to give him that moment he'll remember forever.....ALOHA!!!",3,3,3

We had a¬†very brief encounter with the Chef Serrano during the Vegas Uncork'd event last month, one of hundreds of encounters I'm sure the chef had.

Didn't someone say, ""big things come in small packages?"" :) Well, Julian Serrano might have, because he definitely took that phrase to heart and drove it home with his menu at his tapas (snacks, appetizers, finger foods) joint at the ARIA hotel.

I had been itching to check out the new City Center on the strip for quite some time.  I finally got a chance to make it out there and found myself ready for lunch.  To my dismay the majority of the restaurants I was interested in  weren't open until dinner.  So, after walking around and round I stumbled across Julian Serrano on my way out towards the shops.  Jackpot! It was open, there wasn't a line and it looked pretty :) 

I didn't actually realize it was a tapas joint until we were seated.  The overall feel of the place already gets you excited! From the overly helpful staff equipped with various accents from different countries, to the beautiful artistic layout  and decor of the entire room.  Even though the restaurant is inside the actual Aria they used the space perfectly with almost no walls utilizing the high ceilings to give you that open airy feeling that just makes you look up and exhale with a smile.  The furniture is very modern and the lighting was shining perfectly dim (you know that lighting that let's you still see your food and makes your face look flawless...so FYI perfect date spot: quaint portions of really high quality good food, in a expensive looking place with great lighting that makes you look good...girls will love it, trust me)!

Now for the food...everything I tasted was pretty well...tasty and the plating was simple and clean.  I was fourtnate enough to order a lot and got a pretty good tasting of the menu.

My ORDER:

WILD MUSHROOM SOUP!!! WAS TO DIE FOR! I mean if I could I'd have it everyday...carry it in a camelbak I wear everywhere.

TUNA - RASPBERRY SKEWER...a must try just because the combination and presentation was pretty intriguing and the tuna was good quality.

WHITE CEVICHE...yummy with a good spicy kick.

STEAMED MUSSELS...just okay.  I love mussels so I've had my fair share but good amount for the price.

GRILLED ANGUS FLAT IRON STEAK...just okay too because I love steak so I'm picky when it comes to steak.

BEEF & CHEESE!!! MY TIE WITH 1ST FAVORITE (MUSHROOM SOUP)! So simple but packed with great flavor and texture.

I can't wait to go back and try some more great bites!

My only gripe was that I tried to order a seafood dish and pan manchego but they were all out.  I thought this was definitely poor management and a bad oversight to under order ingredients for a busy weekend.

But other than that...AWESOME!",2,1,2

Atmosphere: Great. I ate at the bar because I was flying solo (damn business conferences), but most of the restaurant is tables. The place is very colorful, open-air and pleasant. Not terribly quiet, but definitely not too loud either. You could definitely have a nice conversation. Service, like all of the service in Aria, was impeccable.

Drinks:
I got a red sangria, and it was one of, if not the, best sangria I've ever had (I ended up ordering a second one).

Julian Serrano is a tapas restaurant, so the menu items (of which there are about a million) are small plates, but are pretty large portions for tapas. I got two plates and was full.
Plate #1 was the spanish tortilla. This is an egg and potato dish baked into a cake shape and cut into a wedge. Sounds boring, but no... this thing was delicious (by the way, the portion was big enough that someone could probably be satisfied with this alone).
Plate #2 was the pork taco. When the waiter brought it out I was surprised that the portion is actually two full-sized tacos (most tapas places I've been a taco plate is a single taco). The tacos were filled with sliced marinated pork tenderloin, diced tomatoes & onions, a variety of other stuff and what I believe (although I could be mistaken... my wife always makes fun of me for not being able to remember these things) was cilantro. Whatever it was, it gave it a spicy, fresh zing that was freaking amazing.

The one dish I had that I wouldn't rave about (and the one reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5) was the torrija I ordered for dessert on the waiter's recommendation. The menu describes this dish as vanilla bean ice cream with salted caramel and candied macadamia nuts. If that was all the dish was it would have been awesome. Unfortunately though the ice cream was served on top of some sort of custard thing that was not good, in my opinion. 

Anyway, the dessert aside, the meal and the whole experience were awesome. I'll be going back tonight (and ordering a different dessert!).",0,0,0

This is one of the best restaurants I have ever visited in my life. It blew my expectations on tapas and every dish was impeccably seasoned, as if I could feel the effort placed in the design of each dish.

Ambience\/Service:
Being inside the trendy Aria, the restaurant feels hip. The service was impeccable, probably because we were one of the first customers in an early lunch time.

Food:
I have never been a fan of Spanish Tapas in America, because my general view is that they are very overpriced for only a small amount of food. This restaurant changed my opinion of this cuisine.

It was a very memorable experience. The best dish, in my opinion, was the seasoned Black Rice, which was a party in my mouth. I still can't fathom what kind of seasoning went into the dish, but it was just amazing and each bite oozed with umami. The Raspberry Tuna skewers were a pleasant surprise, especially when I found out they dabbed a bit of wasabi paste inside the raspberries. The wasabi really cuts the sourness of the raspberry - it is now my favorite way to eat these berries! I also tried the Spanish Tortilla: creamy potatoes, melt-in-your-mouth onions, all blended in so well with the soft omelette. It's exactly as homey as how my Spanish co-workers made it. I also tried the White Fish Ceviche, which was extremely flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick. Overall, this place is simply amazing and I would visit it every time I come to Las Vegas.",1,0,1

There was no Malbec by the glass available.  The chicken croquetas..my husband found a bone in his and had to spit it out.  We should have said something.  That turned his off for the remainder of the meal.  I thought some of the flavor combinations for the ribs and steak tapas were alright, but the temperatures were disappointing as well as the amount of fat chunks included.
Paella isn't our thing, but we saw a bunch of tables nearby ordering it, maybe that would have been better.  Out of all of the amazing restaurants on the strip, we like to switch it up each night, and considering we were there for only 3 nights and this disappointment occurred, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

When making reservations, I requested a table away from the entrance (it opens up to the hotel floor, and I wanted to have a little more privacy and intimacy). We were seated at the very back of the restaurant, and our waiter was very good. As soon as we were seated, I ordered two paella dishes (Mixed and Valenciana)--I am allergic to shrimp so we opted out of the Marinera), since they take 45 minutes or so from the time you place the order. I asked that as we ordered the tapas, they come out slowly. I did not want to feel rushed. There were nine of us, and I also asked that as we order dishes, they are set up so that enough of us could sample each dish (meaning that if I order sliders, perhaps bring out two or three of the dishes--not just one dish with two sliders). Looking back, I realize this wasn't communicated very well. We ordered twelve tapas (vegetarian, meats, seafood, new style), and everyone was pleased with all of them. My only wish was that they weren't coming out so fast and that there were more on the plate to try, but the red sangria was fabulous and that kept coming! The paella was served tableside to us since the dishes were so large for the table. The lobster and mussels were excellent, but again, not enough to go around or it was that half the table was served the lobster, and the other half had none. We ended up cutting things up and redistributing plates so all could try things, but again, I wish there had been more seafood in the dish. Also, the paella seemed very wet to me. It wasn't one of my favorite paellas that I have tried (others at the table raved about it though).
The cost of the tapas and paella along with the rush of serving them is what gives this restaurant a ""very good"" rating. It is expensive, but so is all of Las Vegas!

For those of you that have never been to a tapas restaurant, tapas are ""small dishes"" so you can order as many as you want so that you are not focused on eating one big main dish. 

Here is what we ended up ordering:

Goat Cheese Salad ( I love goat cheese and I really liked the hint of mint that accompanied the salad)

Ahi Tuna Tempura ( The wasabi foam that they served was good, not over powering but just wished it was a little more than just a dab)

Stuffed Piquillo Peppers ( with goat cheese and mushrooms....YUM!)

I was excited to try all the different tapas. While some of them were delicious, they were not as amazing as I would of liked them to be! The drinks were creative and delicious though.

We got the: Spanish Iberico Sliders, Traditional Spanish Chicken Croquetas, Coca Vegetarian, Atlantic Salmon, and Flan! All were delicious, but not out of this world! I wish all the dishes had better flavors.

I need to stop falling for the chicken croquettes! They are NOT the same as what you get in Spain.  Bland and not cheezy.  They were identical to the ones I had at Bazaar in LA.

The best dish was their risotto with mushrooms and manchego.  The calamari dish (small whole squid) was juicy and tender.

The deconstructed seafood stew, lobster skewers with pinapple and the coco chorizo were all severely disappointing - really unmemorable, boring items.",5,4,4

While it may not have been the culinary apogee (that distinction actually goes to Picasso which is of course Julian Serrano's other restaurant located in the Bellagio), the food here was nevertheless absolutely amazing and the service was absolutely the best I've had in Las Vegas.   While it was my Birthday lunch which might cloud my vision a little, our waiter and the whole staff truly made my meal here one I shall remember fondly until the end of my days.

My wife and I walked in last Friday at around noon.   While we had no reservation, the staff greeted us kindly nevertheless and sat us near a TV, as I was following the Villanova - George Mason NCAA basketball game.  Our waiter approached us immediately and suggested we try the sangria.  It being my Birthday, I happily obliged him and I had in fact 3 of them by the time the meal was done.   Let me tell you right now the drink was crisp and very tasty and left absolutely no headache later on (something Sangria is typically notorious for in that regard)

As far as food is concerned, we started out with the Spanish Charcuterie Platter, Fried Calamari, White Ceviche and Crispy Pancetta Iberica.   Of those 4 dishes, the Fried Calamari came out on top, followed by the White Ceviche.   The Charcuterie platter was delightful too, while I must say we were not blown away by the Pork Belly (Pancetta) dish.

We followed up these dishes with 3 more tapas:  Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, the spanish chicken croquetas, and the Flat Iron Steak.   The first 2 were absolutely divine.   The third one was just so-so.

By that point, both my wife and I were absolutely stuffed.   Still, the waiter would not relent on us getting dessert, especially after he heard my wife was a Pastry Chef and it was my Birthday.   We nevertheless declined dessert, being completely full at that point.   Still, the waiter brought us a Crema Catalana on the house.   Since the dish was there, we had to eat it and indeed it was one of the best Creme Brulees (my wife's expected, of course) that I've ever had.   The dessert is served with a pineapple sorbet which is so clean and beautiful that it tastes like you are biting into an icy wedge of Hawaiian Pineapple.

Simply amazing dining experience.   The moment we were out of the restaurant, I tweeted to all the people who were attending the same conference I was that if they had no dinner plans, they should absolutely check out Julian Serrano.   I don't know if they took my advice, but this is a great restaurant and I plan on coming back here many times!",1,0,0

Next i had the risotto, this was a bit aldente in texture. It was not as creamy as a risotto should be. My husband ordered the fish soup and it was semi ok. I know it may sound crazy, but it was too fishy. It needed a balance like maybe a bit of cream. The only thing we ordered that might have saved the food was the choripan.

This restaurant fulfills that requirement in a great way.  There are so many to choose from.  We had trouble deciding what to get but here are the ones we chose and if we liked them or not.  (note: their menu changes from time to time)  
Coca Foie Gras - LOVED this dish.  ""coca"" is a flat Spanish bread that is delicious, it is crunchy and softens with the sauce on top.  This bread was topped with beets and foie gras.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavors melded together like a perfect bite.

Spanish Tortilla - Think of this like a frittata with potatoes in it.  This was delicious and it was the first thing to disappear off of our table.  This is worthy of ordering as a side dish to your other tapas.

Serrano Tender - Prime tenderloin on top of the coca bread and then topped with foie gras.  This missed the mark for us.  The meat wasn't that tender and there was not a lot of flavor to it.  I would pass on this next time.

Octopus a la Gallega - These were coin sized pieces of tender octopus served on top of a half dollar sized formed potato, the sauce is heavy on the Spanish paprika and I found it a little bitter at the end.  Not one of our favorites, would probably not order this again.

Brava Potatoes - spicy potatoes - this is one of my go to tapas whenever I visit a Spanish restaurant.  I can usually gauge the level of excellence by this simple dish.  These were some of the best I have ever had.  The potatoes were perfectly prepared and the sauce was divine.  This is a must have.  Even if you are just sitting at the bar for some Sangria, you have to order this.  

Mixed Paella - NOTE, if you want Paella or any of the larger entrees you MUST order them immediately.  They can take up to one hour to be ready.  So do not delay.  Having said that, the wait is worth it.  This Paella was delicious, with smoky undertones and the best rice I've had in a restaurant.  By the way, I am not a fan of rice, that's my husband's go to dish and yet I ate this too, it was that good.

This restaurant is in the main lobby of the Aria, it is loud, there is a lot of activity around you and it's worth coming in for a bite.  The staff went above and beyond and the drinks were good.  You can eat as little or as much as you want here, but this is not a quick place to eat.  Make sure you have time and sit down and RELAX.",3,2,2

Hands down one of the best restaurants I have been to in Vegas!

Lobstar salad left me speechless and wanting more. Heirloom baby tomatoes were AHHHHMAZING. The lobster was sooo fresh and succulent. It really can't get better.

The steak was in a mix of 2 different types of sauces, green and yellow I recall. Another homerun. Moist and tender on par with a 5 star steakhouse.

Seafood soup I could potenitally see myself enjoying this concotion everyday.They are a little stingy with the seafood though.

Rabbit with mashed potatoes. So this was my first time trying rabbit so maybe I shouldn't give my opinion on this. Tastes like chicken?

Sangria (white and red) were both delicious, I could easily say the best I have ever had. Even better than the ones I make at home. 

I don't think you can possibly have anything mediocre at this place. Fun atmosphere in Aria close to the casino. Young vibe. Great Bar and even better food that has some quality and substance to back it up.

If I remember correctly I had the seared ahi with some raspberry paste, lobster with micro pineapple, shrimp and fish ceviche, some steak, some ridiculous black forest ham that was double the price of the regular ham and a pitcher of Sangria.

I then had the spicy bomb which was delicious. Portion size was excellent and rocoto flavors and presentation was superb and not too hot.
I capped off my meal with the gambas which were amazing. The brava sauce was so good I had to consume it all and gambas were large and tasted very fresh, by far my favorite dish.

Our waiter was extremely rude to us as well, and stood on the far end of our long table (we had a big party) to take our orders. When he couldn't hear what we said, instead of coming closer, he made us shout across the table as he impatiently made us repeat ourselves.

The restaurant can be somewhat inconsistent when it comes to service and the quality of the dishes. Last time we went, to our dismay none of the dishes could be amended. We are not talking about changing the recipes but simply just leaving off the extra cheese usually generously sprinkled over e.g. the Creamy Risotto. In my opinion, this stinks. 

There were a few new items on the menu we really enjoyed! 
Sangria Cubes -- absolutely refreshing and delicious 
Ajo Blano -- a chilled almond based soup that was simply divine 
Spanish Chicken Croquettes -- albeit not new still a favorite of ours

Pan Manchego - bread, tomatoes, and manchego, its so simple and I can't figure out why its so amazing!

Spanish Iberico Sliders - pretty good, but nothing amazing. It tasted all beef, no pork?

Apple and Manchego Salad - I'm a sucker for apples and manchego and this was a great salad.

Marcona Almonds - I love marcona almonds although they were a bit oily. They were very good and a huge portion ... I wondered if it would be awkward if I snuck out my leftovers in a ziploc bag!

I got a glass of red sangria ($4.50 - bargain!), which is my favorite sangria in all of Las Vegas.  Perfect spice to it.  Doesn't just taste like watered down red wine.  My husband got a glass of white wine, the Albarino ($9) which was good but a little sweet for my tastes.  I like dry white wine.

We went a little nuts and got three tapas!  I was really intrigued by the salmon truffle ($12) which is a piece of salmon with bechamel truffle sauce atop a portabello mushroom.  This was actually disappointingly ok.  Maybe I was all truffled out from the truffle fritters at Jean Georges but this dish just didn't do much for me.

We also got the oysters ($10) which the server said could be served with a mango foam or traditional.  This was confusing because the menu said gazpacho foam.  We went for the mango foam, but when we got them, it was definitely gazpacho foam.  Either way, they were very good and fresh.  The oysters come in servings of 4.

Finally we got the pata negra ($35), which we always get here.  Now it is ham, some bread, and a tomato sauce, which may be a little offputting given the price.  But this is famous blackhoofed pig and only comes from Spain.  The ham is cured for 3 years and it is just so yummy.  The tomato sauce, which appears to be fresh tomatoes and olive oil, goes perfectly with the ham.

A good experience but I was disappointed by the salmon so I'll drop off a star.  Plus, they got slammed towards the end of our meal (our server actually exclaimed out loud about being slammed, so it must have been bad) and it took a while to get the check.  No biggie.  Nice atmosphere and it's open to the casino so great people watching.

Check out the bathrooms for sure here.  They are left of the bar towards the back.  Ladies to the left, mens to the right.  They pipe in some Spanish language tapes which are pretty hilarious.  Great restaurant!",3,0,2

Just think ""Firefly"" but, $EXPEN$IVE$ ... did I mention that it's expensive? lol

In general, I think when it comes to tapas, the best thing to do is go with a group of people so, you can sample (SAMPS) a lot of different things. It's a good thing we came here for a business meeting.

My faves were:
-the lamb: we all know how much I love that!
-Estrealladose: I think that's how you spell it? It's basically fries with a fried egg on top. And lemme tell you: AMAZING!!! So simple, so rich, and soooo heart attack city (but, let's not think about that) I'd think this would be the greatest hangover food. ever. in. life.
-lava cake: super rich...you can never go wrong with chocolate!
-the donut pieces with caramel and choco dipping sauce: mmmMMmm, the sauces were kinda spicy...not hot (temperature), hot (spicy!)


Oh, I almost forgot, the bathrooms teach you phrases in various foreign languages...lol I'm not kidding. It's kinda funny to be washing your hands and learn to say ""I love you"" in Spanish...",4,2,3

Famished after my Korean spa experience, I decided to treat myself to lunch at one of the most beautiful hotels now on the Strip, the Aria Hotel.  After browsing the lobby, I encounter Julian Serrano opposite my previous night's splendor at Sage.  The ambiance is vibrant and bold colors of red, purple, orange and yellow.  Even cooler was the fact that they were participating in Restaurant Week.  Perfect I thought, this is where I'm having lunch!  Ambiance:  4.5 stars.

I sat at the bar and started off with their white sangria with pears.  Sounded refreshing enough and it was!  At some point I asked the recipe and was given an unending amalgamation of ingredients that I could never recite, let alone list here.  In summary, it was a crisp alternative to your usual red sangria and a perfect quencher from the overbearing Vegas heat.  5 stars.

A Spanish couple next to me at the bar received their first dish. I over heard them say, ""ah, muy peque√±o (small)"".  They turn to me and the guy says, 'like a glorified English muffin pizza, no?'  I nearly aspirated whatever I was eating and had to restrain myself from hitting the floor in tears.  I understand tapas, but the plates were rather, peque√±o.  

Along with my glass of Spanish Tempranillo, I ordered off the 3-course prix fixe Restaurant Week menu for $30.11 :

First Course:
Stuffed dates of almond and applewood bacon with a spicy piquillo pepper sauce.  Nice flavor, but somewhat overwhelmingly simplistic.  Not horrible, but just okay:  3 stars.

Second Course:
Grilled Angus Flat Iron Steak with layered Japanese eggplant in a  Mushroom Demi.  The serving size was very small, however what was offered packed a punch and I wish I had more.  Perfect doneness and everything complimented well:  4.5 stars.

Third Course:
Fried Spanish Churros with a spicy dipping hot chocolate.  Recommended by the bartender and now I know why.  Nice crunchy Spanish pastry without any greasiness, powdered sugar and a heavenly dipping dark chocolate with just the right amount of fire.  Amazing:  5 stars!

Tally:
Ambiance:  4.5 stars
Cocktail:  5 stars!
First Course:  3 stars
Second Course:  4.5 stars
Third Course:  5 stars!
4.5+5+3+4.5+5= 22\/5= 4.4 stars.

Quite an enjoyable lunch to add to a relaxing spa day.  What more could I ask for?  I left feeling on top of the world and headed to the nearest video poker machine to try my luck once again.  Oh Lost Wages, you relentless bitch!

Red sangria - Strong but well-balanced, not too sweet. 

Sauteed padron peppers - This is a big plate, better suited for four; between the two of us, we each had over a dozen peppers. Beware: the heat is cumulative, so you may be a few peppers in before your boca goes en fuego. 

Tuna cones - Least successful; Spago kills it with their tuna cones, though the tuna itself was good.

Octopus - As noted, the softest octopus out there, tastes great.

Black rice w\/fresh calamari, lobster tail, sofrito, squid ink - Definitely the best dish, just orgasmically good and a must-order if you go. Also, since it's a rice dish, it has some nice, anchoring heft for your tapas meal.

Bunelos - We are not ashamed to say that we fully dipped each doughnut in the caramel sauce before consuming, and then we finished off what was left of the sauce on its own with our spoons. Gluttontastic!

Okay, so the service. Our reservation got us the worst table in an otherwise beautiful restaurant: right next to the service station, where servers zipped behind each of our chairs, even kicking the chairs a few times, with no apologies. Rather than attempt to guide us toward a complementary tapas offering, the servers (we had a couple) were more intent on getting the order and getting out. I really would have appreciated them noting, for instance, that the peppers were a pretty big order for two, or that there were three tuna cones for the two of us. There's nothing wrong with being efficient, and I can't knock them for being inattentive, but I felt set aside enough between the poor seating and curt service to pull the four-star meal into a three-star rating for the experience. I liked the food enough to want to return and hope for better service next time, though I'll probably give Jaleo a shot first.",0,0,0

* White Fish Ceviche: different types of white fish, red onions, a little pepper, cilantro, and lime juice...very refreshing
* Salmon with Truffle B√©chamel Sauce: served on a portabella mushroom...so good that it is my favorite tapas here
* Manchego Cheese Lollipop: fried in herb bread crumbs and paired with a red wine poached pear...kind of like a deconstructed fancy salad
* Bomba: veal and pork spicy meat ball...just the right amount of spice
* Iberico Black Pig Ribs: served on a bed of garlic white beans...a little different than the traditional American pork ribs

The place was extremely crowded, and it was very hard to get a table without any reservation. Bar seats are available on first-come first-serve basis. We were lucky to get our seats at the bar within 20 minutes. 

After we got the seats, it took us another 15 minutes before a waiter came to approach us. Slow service, but it could be because the place was so totally new and disorganized.

We order 4 dishes and sangrias. Grilled baby squids, charcutterie platter, spanish omellete (or pizza?), and mushroom risotto.
Grilled baby squids tastes fresh and well seasoned. The portion is a bit small. (B+)
Spanish omellete is very good. Tasty and the portion is decent. (A-)
Charcutterie is overrated and overpriced for the price that is charged. The meat is sliced so paper thin and the ham is dry that I barely can taste what it is supposed to be like. The chorizo is the only salvation in this dish. (B-)
Mushroom risotto is quite good, but again, the portion is pretty small. (B)
Sangria is good, but a bit on the pricier side. (B)

Service is B because although it is slow, our waiter is quite friendly and attentive after he notices us.

Since we had a group of 5, we ordered the regular sized Mixed Paella to start since it was going to take awhile, and just ordered a bunch of tapas to share.  Even though on the menu it shows the paella's portion is for two, with all the tapas we ordered, turned out to be a smart choice.  

The paella came loaded with seafood.  Paella's tasty and it definitely hit the spot for us.  Can't really compare to ""authentic"" paella, but for what it is, pretty good!  One of my friend mentioned that the seafood wasn't as fresh as it could be, which is understandable since Vegas is in the middle of the desert haha.  My only knock on it would probably be the super small lobster tail.

As for the tapas, there were a few standouts.  The Black Rice is my favorite: squid Ink rice\/risotto with calamari and lobster, with a heavy touch on garlic, which I liked.  Others that stood out were the White Ceviche, which was refreshing, and the Apple Foie, which is a mini apple roasted with a chunk of foie in the middle.  C'mon.

The Fresh Calamari a la Plancha was a surprise.  Essentially grilled calamari, but done perfectly.  The Beef Tartare here has an interesting presentation.  Tasty too to match the good looks. 

Pan Tomate was a disappointment and didn't care much for the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers.  

We ordered a pitcher of red sangria to share, which was good for about 8-9 glasses.  Solid solid sangria.

Seating was a bit awkward when I was checking in for my reservation.  There was a group of Chinese tourists in front of us and the host must've thought we were together so didn't pay any attention until I grabbed her attention.  Besides that, service was fantastic.

Five stars for Jeff, the bartender, who introduced himself, asked my name, learned where I was from (turned out we have some connections in common in my current city) and allowed me to sample both the red & white sangria.  Both are terrific, not as aggressively sweet and alcoholic as some sangrias can be, and the cinnamon in the red sangria made it perfect for an overcast January day.  The cocktail that followed was also very well-made.

I'm less enthusiastic about the food.  I ordered two plates, the albondigas (beef & pork meatballs) and the stuffed dates with goat cheese & pancetta.  Each dish was $12, which gets you 4 meatballs and 3 dates.  The dates were insanely good, and the tomato marmalade on the side was a nice touch.  However, 3 of my 4 meatballs were a touch cold in the center, which sends all kinds of bad signals.  I was in a rush so didn't return the food (or even complain), but it was a disappointment.

We went for my friend's birthday.  We had a party of 6.  We decided we'd start with 4 dishes, hold on to a menu, and order more.  After all, it IS a TAPAS restaurant.

We had the mushroom risotto, which was served without a spoon.  We waited for our waiter (Anthony) to return...but he didn't.  We all used our own forks to spoon a little on each of our plates.  We got the brava potatoes.  These at least had one wooden stick so we could each take one tiny potato cube.  We had the octopus which was served without any utensils.  We ordered the cheese plate, without any utensils.  There was no way for us to divy out the food.  We waited and waited and Anthony didn't return for THIRTY MINUTES.

We ordered another plate of the brava potatoes and another 4 plates.

The portions are tiny and the prices are enormous.  Let me describe the cheese plate:
We decided to get the $17 cheese plate which sounded great: a bunch of interested cheeses.  It arrived: five pieces of cheese.  One flavor each.  I thought it was a joke.  Cana de cabra (goat), manchego (sheep), and two others.  I'll say it again: one slice each.  How big?  Four were the size of an Andy's mint.  One was the size of a half-dollar.  $17 for ONE THIN SLICE each.  We cut each piece in 6 portions so we could try it: we each ate smaller than a dime-size portion of each one.  

Being from Chicago, I've had tapas before and I've had cheese plates at nice restaurants.  I've had food from other nice places in Las Vegas.

The foot tasted fine but for that price and Anthony's terrible service (the entire process took over 2 hours and they were NOT busy...) I won't ever return again.

We spent over $300 total on the bill and we ALL immediately went elsewhere to eat.

If you have too much money in your pocket and want to throw an enormous amount away on a meal that will leave you hungry, this is the place for you.

(Note: They did throw a decent amount of attitude towards my husband and me when we said we'd prefer a beer to wine.  Also, all of the beer is bottled, yet served in a glass not meant for beer.)",0,0,0

After my 2nd visit there, I can say this is a place I can take someone to without getting an urge to overstuff myself to get my money's worth. A bit pricier than other tapas places I've been, but hey, it's Vegas; nothing comes cheap.

The restaurant looks kinda like a transparent enclave of the Aria, which can make this spot a perfect place to people-watch as you eat, if you get a good spot. We had a wonderful waiter who made suggestions that were spot-on and made sure that we had a good dining experience. I got to try both the red and white sangria before I picked a glass of red as my drink. A good sangria has a taste of spiked punch that doesn't taste like it has been spiked. The dash of cinnamon was the perfect touch. Mom had one too, but started feeling lightheaded halfway and asked me to finish it. At one point she forgot what room we were staying in.

Here were the tapas we had that day. We tried to go for a balance between meat and vegetables. At the end of it, our party of 3 felt quite satiated without feeling stuffed.

Ahi Tuna Tartare - the tuna was a bit tough, but went well with the wasabi foam. Suprisingly, the avocado and mango ensaladilla was tasty by itself.
Avocado Cannelloni - SOFT salmon mixed with mayo and paired with this bread. Yum.
Brava Potatoes - spicy potato and alioli sauce. One of the most popular tapas according to the waiter. This is an example of a GOOD mix of alioli and brava sauce WITHOUT the excess grease that goes in frying the potatoes in said sauces. They were bite-sized that makes it easy to just gorge on the bowl. 
Stuffed Piquillo Peppers - got as part of the waiter's suggestion. The goat cheese just melted in your mouth and the pepper had a good spicy ""bite"".
Fried Calamari - a little bit too salty, but still crispy. Liked it with the alioli sauce
Grilled Lamb Chop - at least this was a better rendition of a lamb chop than a certain buffet we went the other day...

The meal ended with Molten Chocolate Cake. The cake, though small, contained quite a bit of molten chocolate with just enough amount of cake. Paired with the blood orange ice cream, it was like a chocolate orange explosion in my mouth. One of the best renditions I've had in a while, especially since molten chocolate cake is one of my favorite type of desserts. 

I thought I would pass up this restaurant as it was too ""Vegas-y"" and not enough Spanish, but the food was just too good this time. There's already Paris in Vegas, I guess there's enough room for one more culture to be represented.",2,1,2

Tapas are usually expensive, so I didn't see this place being that much more expensive than others, but for a few extra dollars you get a lot of flavor. They have a lot of ""new"" kinds of tapas that are a fusion of other ethnic foods but you also have the traditional spanish tapas such as mussels, gazpacho, and the like. 

What did we get?
Asparagus
Spinach
Chicken croquetas (Don't get this. not worth the money) 
Spanish tortilla
Mussels
White ceviche
Yellow tail dish (it was 3 raw slices of yellow tail that was wrapped around this sauce filled with what they said was ""sweet potato haystack""...JUST GET IT.) 
Gazpacho w\/ lobster (MY absolute favorite, had this ball that broke open in your mouth that had this super savory broth in it) 
Paella valenciana (for 2)

Oh, and a glass or red wine sangria and a pitcher of sparkling white sangria

Man oh man. Bill turned out to be 212 dollars or so. Not too terrible for a tapas place.

What dishes were the stars in my opinion? 

1. Gazpacho- it was one of the BEST i've ever had. Lobster pieces were BIG too, and that weird sphere thing was tasty! Hard to share, since it's soup, though. BTW it's kinda cute that the waiter warns you that it's a cold soup. I guess people have made that mistake before, but don't get put off by it- it's SUPER refreshing! 

2. White ceviche- ohh...so orgasmically delicious. I wish they would put more taro chips on there with the ceviche...and I wish they would have a separate plating of the chips and ceviche so the chips won't get soggy. 

3. YELLOWTAIL ...it's pricy.. 3 pieces for 16 bucks so it was basically almost a 6 dollar bite you're paying for (plus tax and tip)  ...but it was so worth it. We didn't know it was only 3 pieces or else we wouldn't have gotten it, but if you're a baller...get this dish. it's extravagant, delicious and PERFECT. The best 6 dollars you'll put in yo mouth. 

4. I personally loved the spinach. It might not be worth it to some, but it was cooked great with pine nuts, raisins and apple pieces all lightly sauteed. it was perfect. 

Things that weren't so great: 

1. Mussels: I've had better mussels at other places. These mussels were small, and kind of sad. They all came out luke warm, too. Not that much broth in there either. My favorite mussels are from Cha Cha Cha's in San Francisco. These...just didn't keep up.

2. Croquetas. bleh. I was expecting something else. some other girls in my table liked it but I wasn't impressed especially with the price.

3. Worst was the tortilla. I really, REALLY wanted to like this. They gave you one small slice of an already made portion- I get that part. But I've had and had made spanish tortilla before and I get why it wasn't made to order.  The reason why I didn't say it was that good was because it was way too salty. Across the table, every single person in our party said it was salty...and it was. The texture, the flavor was all really, really nice... it was just the excess salt in the dish that made it not quite as tasty.

Overall, a really nice experience. The paella was good and the portion for 2 people is enough for tapas for 4 or 5 or even more. For 4 girls, we got 2 tapas each and a paella to share and I think that's more than enough. We were stuffed beyond belief. (The waiter said 2-3 tapas per person..but i think you can get away with 1-2..and share a paella) 

The sparkling sangria and the red sangria were both excellent. I'd love to come here again..but I'm ballin' on a budget so if I go to another expensive restaurant it's gonna be at a new one so I can try 'em all.",4,1,1

We picked Julian Serrano out of all the restaurants Aria had to offer.  We were definitely not disappointed with our choice.    

We came an hour prior to closing and were seated next to a huge bachelor's party.  Needless to say, they were very loud, and very drunk.  After what seemed like a very long time, our server finally approached us.  He was very apologetic though, stating that he was also taking care of the big party, and that they would leave shortly.  

We decided on ordering the spanish tortilla, chicken croquetas, and the vegetable paella.  The spanish tortilla was unlike anything I have ever tasted.  It looked so simple, but tasted so delicious.  The croquetas were very satisfying.  It tasted like everything you would expect.  

One the menu, there is a warning that the paella takes upwards of 30 minutes to cook.  This was no joke, because it really did take a long time to come out.  Everyone around us had already left except for one or two tables who were probably in the same boat as us.  The menu also states that it feeds two people.  That part is incorrect because we had so much leftover.  The dish was full of flavor, and worth trying.  There were a lot of ingredients that made the entree come together.  

The only reason why not 5 stars is because the food is quite expensive.  The paella alone was $40.  The other reason was the slow service in the beginning.

My only qualm is that It is on the Strip and you are paying for that fact with your wallet whenever you come here...still if not for the Strip we would not have the vast culinary options that we do in Vegas, so I can't really hate on that.

The ambiance is on par with other eateries in the Aria, and what you would expect from that type of property.

As tapas go, It's hard to go wrong with the options here...lots of traditional selections as well as a great number of modern offerings.  Like many, I love sharing multiple items and tasting as many dishes as possible.  The seafood tapas have generally impressed me at JS.  One thing to keep in mind is that several options may throw the casual diner for a loop (ie chilled Lobster Gazpacho.)  Fortunately the staff doe a nice job with recommendations, but don't be that guy that that wants to impress people and order whatever they think looks good without actually knowing the words used in the menu...yes that actually happened once while I was here...and of course the tool tried to play it off like it wasn't his fault.

I also love their selection of Sherry.  Not much more traditional to drink with Spanish food that a Spanish Sherry.  ...and so many options are affordable and are incredibly food friendly!  I'm not recommending that you experiment with Sherry as it's a bit of an acquired taste, but if you want a nice selection of Sherry, Julian's is your place.",5,2,3

**Spanish Tortilla: A wedge of rich potato and egg heaven with onions and aioli bread. Delicious tasting and filling torta. 

**Arroz Valenciana: A rectangular shaped rice plate with vegetables, Spanish chorizo pork, chicken, and saffron. Also a rich and filling dish. This reminds me of my grandma's arroz Valenciana with modern presentation. 

**YellowTail Tiradito: This tapa  is delicious if you like fresh fish. The yellowtail is presented in a filo-dough with horseradish cream, and then sprinkled with sweet\/sour Japanese ponzu sauce. Exquisite and complex tapa. 

**Tuna Carpaccio: Another fresh tasting fish tapa with basil, sundried tomatoes, and toasted  pine nuts. The dish is brought together beautifully with a balsamic glaze. 


At happy hour, the Spanish Rioja  wine & Red Sangria are  a treat at $7 and $5 respectively.  Again, I could not decide on which drink to call up..I enjoyed both.

Having all day to myself I decided to go exploring in the new Aria City center and after consulting my handheld pocket guide for eats, I decided to do the Julian Serrano tapas bar for lunch. 

I liked the friendly, open air decor and bright colors thats easily visible from the lobby of the Aria and after a quick scan of the menu at the door, decide to pull up a seat at the counter and order lunch.

The menu is created by chef Jose Picazo and many of the dishes remind me of the creations of a similarly named chef, Jose Andres, of Bazaar fame in Los Angeles, of which I've tried many times.  However unlike the borderline molecular deconstructionist gastronomy of the Bazaar, the items of JS are a little more conventional and accessible, but no less delicious.

I started off with the avocado cannelloni which was salmon tartare wrapped with sliced avocado with japanese seaweed salad.  I enjoyed this from the first bite as flavours of the salmon, avocado were mixed with a pleasant amount of saltiness. I could have ordered another one of these to finish off my meal.  Next I tried the salmon & truffle dish which was a good but a little dissapointing as the wonderful truffle sauce seemed to clash with otherwise bland and familiar salmon taste, not really infusing into the meat of the fish.  Perhaps pairing the truffle flavour with a different fish would work better.  Rounding out the meal was the Valenciana paella rice with chicken, rabbit, chorizo and saffron rice, very nice indeed.  Luckily I ordered off the lunch menu which was smaller portions but also only half the price of the dinner menu item.

Prices are a bit up there to be honest, but not surprising given small plates usually tend to be pricy and given the premium real estate, but for those who are comfortable spending the extra dime on some quality cooking and intriguing flavours, JS is a nice place to check out.",0,0,0

This restaurant is in the Aria hotel and has a half glass perimeter so you don't feel like you're going to a restaurant like other places where there is an entrance and a full restaurant. This didn't help the acoustics either, super loud in here! I thought the servers were attentive and helpful but found it a but strange they wore name tags. Didn't feel that's a high class touch but at least it made me remember our servers name.

We had two different type of croquettes and they were light and crispy and fluffy on the inside. The salad mixta was dissapointing like salad out of a bag, but with no real flavor. The osso bucco had a good depth of flavor. We also had the seafood paella. I thought it was tasty but others at the table found the rice undercooked and crunchy. The sangria was excellent and when I asked for a glass of red wine, the server recommended an excellent choice. 

For dessert, there was a salted caramel
cake and a delicious chocolate lava cake. If I were to go back, I'd go for the sangria and the desserts. I",4,0,5

The portions are small plate style, so assume 2 per person if one is meat and 3 per person if choosing from any of the other categories. The kale salad is good, a bit oily. Beef short ribs we tender and the glaze was awesome. The highlight and must have was the chorizo- the perfect amount of warm hear, crispy outside, juicy inside, and topped with a mini roasted potato.

Spanish Charcuterie
Spanish Cheese
Spanish Tortilla - was perfectly cooked - almost melts in your mouth
Albondigas - juicy and fluffy meatballs
Anchovy Filetes - was probably my favorite of all the dishes.  Just the right amount of tang and oiliness, it was served over roasted peppers and bread.

The paella may be on the expensive side, but you end up saving money in the long run because it is delicious and a very large portion.

The restaurant was recommended by the Bachelorette who had eaten here during her last visit to Vegas. 

My cousin called Friday morning and we had no trouble making reservations for a Friday evening for 8 ladies. Once we arrived, they asked us to wait a couple minutes to get our table ready but were seated shortly after. 

Our waiter was friendly and explained the menu to us and how 2-3 plates per person should suffice. We each ordered 2 plates each and a pitcher of Sangria which was delicious and refreshing (it's also what knocked me out early for the evening!). Since some of the girls wanted the same thing, we ended up getting doubles of some. At the end of our meal we still had 2-3 plates of food so I'd definitely recommend only 2 plates per person. 

All in all, among the 8 of us we had:

Huevos Estrellados*
White Ceviche
Mixed Seafood Ceviche*
Gambas
Black Rice
Pinxto de Chorizos*
Coca Vegetarian 
Spanish Tortilla 

There might have been a few other plates but I forget now. Everything I tried was delicious and I love the idea of small plates because everyone is able to try. You also don't get sick of eating a big dish of something. 

I put stars next to my favorite dishes of the night. The Huevos Estrellados consisted of Fried Potatoes, Eggs, and Chorizo. The best part of this was breaking the yolk and it oozing over the whole dish. SO GOOD! The Mixed Seafood Ceviche contained Shrimp, Octopus, White Fish, Cilantro, and Lime Juice. This was a great dish to offset the fatty, savory dishes. The lime juice brightened up the flavors of the fresh seafood. Pinxto de Chorizos was Mini Pork Chorizo, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Garlic Sauce. Do I still need to elaborate on this dish? It's pork, garlic, pot, and more garlic! DELISH!

My hubby was so looking forward to this dinner as he remembered a dish we had the first time.  We arrived a little early for our reservation and were seated right away.  Unfortunately, we were seated at the front of the restaurant which is basically like being seated in the lobby of the Aria as the restaurant is open to the actual lobby.   It was exceedingly loud and made even louder by a couple right next to us who were basically yelling at each other to be heard over the noise from the lobby and the loud music.  I wish I had said something or requested to be moved but I didn't so it's on me.  Our server brought the wine list which was still extensive, with lots of California options and some Spanish as well.  He said his name about 10 times during the first 15 minutes we were there.  Funny the third time, not so funny the rest of the time.  He was pleasant and tried to be helpful.  Our wine came and he started to open it but poof, the Ninja sommelier came by and took over.  She was the best part of the night, to be quite honest.  Witty and always there to pour the wine when needed.  The food was honestly not as great as I remembered it but it was still good.  We had the ahi tuna cones which were great, nice light start to the meal.  Our server added and extra cone so we could each have two.  We then had the ensalada mix ya which was a fantastic salad to share.  Then on to chicken croquettas which were perfectly crispy on the outside and yummy on the inside.  Amy favorite dish of the night was the arroz con secreto which was a fantastic pork dish, rich and full of flavor.  My least favorite dish of the night, which is the dish we came back for, was the black rice.  It came to the table lukewarm and there was something just off with the dish.  Too much aioli maybe?  Dessert was the Torrija which was amazing.  Highly recommend this place, just make sure you sit in the back of the restaurant!!!",0,0,0

The hotel boasts six restaurants & this is one of them. Tapas have been really trendy the last five years & so many tapas restaurants fall short of executing really good Tapas dishes. But this is Julian Serrano! I couldn't help myself so we bee-lined there Saturday night.  The decor is bright &  there are lots of mirrors. I don't really like watching myself eat & it seemed every time I looked around I caught a glimpse of either myself or someone else stuffing their face!!  So this isn't the most intimate place in terms of being romantic. Tables are pretty close together!! In fact we felt like the people next to us were with us!! LOL! Drink menu is impressive & the sangria is refreshing & delicious. They have some nice beers, tequilas & spanish wines too. In fact the wine list is very impressive. Now the food which I was very impressed with. We shared everything & we started out with the mixed seafood ceviche which had octopus, shrimp & whitefish. This was so fresh & the simplicity of the lime & cilantro really highlighted the fish. Next the gambas, saut√©ed shrimp, garlic & arbol chilis. This was fantastic too.We decided to try the ""new"" tapas so we went with the lobster-pineapple skewer w\/ ""molecular"" pineapple & sesame oil. This was not one of my favorites. molecular food can be tricky & I am kind of sick of the foam or gelatin type textures when chefs introduce this food. The lobster was delicious but the molecular part  which was the pineapple had a weird texture. Not my fave but still good.
The cheese platter is fantastic and it has cabrales, goat, la serena & manchego to name a few. The stuffed dates, olives & gazpacho were all fantastic. One of my faves was the escalivada which has roasted eggplant, red pepper, onion & tomato.  The service was just okay but the place was really busy so I will cut them some slack.

Ambiance: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars

I thought the pineapple was a little mushy not what I was expecting and I didn't really taste the lobster. I really hate having lobster in a dish and not taste it. The third plate was the Creamy risotto and that was decent. The flavor was on par with what I've had, but I don't think the risotto was cooked all the way through. Our final dish was the Conejo AK ajillo( rabbit w\/ mash potatoes). It was dry for some of the pieces, but other pieces were good ( I hate to say it but it tasted like chicken).

The bartender was very friendly and attentive.  He was very knowledgeable about tequila. The white sangria was delicious and fruity without being overly sweet.

The pan con manchego was absolutely perfect - great country bread, just the right amount of garlic and tomato, and very high quality manchego and olive oil. It was very satisfying.  

The bartender recommended the wrinkled potatoes, which were deliciously salty boiled new potatoes with a delightful spicy dipping sauce.  The sauce was very flavourful and had the right amount of kick.

Prices were very reasonable and portions were adequate, given that its a tapas place.  Please run around $6-$8 for the lighter fare, and paella closer to $15 (I think) . Tons of great veggie options, which is rare in Vegas.

We usually share dessert but Pedro assured us that we'll probably want our own dessert plate. He was right!  The Torrija was phenomenal. I'm not a fan of bread pudding but this .... changed my mind.

First dish was a spanish tortilla - basically an omelette with potatoes and onions. Tasty start.

2nd - calamari. Nice big pieces, served with a tasty aioli.

3rd - fried potatos in a spicy tomato sauce, with the same aioli as above. Pretty good.

4th - ahi tuna with a thin tempura coating, deep fried. I thought this was okay, a little bland.

5th - chicken croquettes with a bechamel sauce on the inside. There was nothing really wrong with this dish, except it was pretty unimpressive flavor wise. Basically a chicken nugget with the sauce on the inside.

6th -Meatballs. Really? These tasted like frozen meatballs you'd get at a grocery store, and served in a tomato sauce with potatoes...the exact same tomato sauce and potatoes as in #3.

7th - prawns in olive oil. Really disappointing. When I think Spanish gambas, I think nice big head on shrimp. These were peeled, boiled, shrimp cocktail style in some unmemorable olive oil. Pass.

8th - chorizo with mashed potatos - looked like lil' smokies in a pile of unmemorable mashed potatos. The sausage had this weird sour taste to it. eww.

9th - deep fried figs wrapped in ham. Served with the same tomato sauce as in #3 and #6. It tasted like a fried fig. Nothing special here.

10th - grilled steak slices with japanese eggplant. this was actually an alright dish, but not spectacular by any means.

This restaurant seems like tapas that are dumbed down to be more accessible to the general public. Which I guess is what you want for a place like Vegas. If you're a real foodie though, avoid.

The Good: The decor is shiny and bright, servers are attentive and helpful and there's a fair amount of tapas to appease just about any palate. In particular, the calamari, stuffed dates, risotto were standouts. Portions were mostly averaged sized, some much more generous than others. 

The Meh: Like many tapas places, Julian Serrano can get really pricey if you're on the hungry side. I wasn't blown away by the sangria...it was fine but nothing I haven't experienced before. And a handful of the dishes we ordered were good, but not great (pork, ceviche). And while I did like the decor, the location of the restaurant definitely doesn't lend itself to any intimate date.

I didn't know you could be seduced by food but, baby, let me tell you.. This sushi was an ahi tuna tempura but not tempura in the sense that it was fried and had a whole mess of dressing and fancy toppings that take away from the fish. No, this sushi was warm, the tuna melted right in my mouth and it was a full amount, not all toppings with a little tuna. It was slightly fried on the outside, warm, fresh (no fishy taste at all), and it was topped with roasted slices of garlic that really made the flavors of the sushi set a warm fire from my toes to the tip of my tongue to my head. It was bedded on a delicious seaweed salad and creamy avocado sauce. The food was amazing and it was partnered with a sparkling glass of sangria that is kept untouched for three days so that the wine really takes in the flavors of the fruit.

I have been to Spain, and you Sir are no Tapas cook. 

Took two seats at the bar thinking...busy night, should be good and quick...bzzzz..wrong!  Took forever to get the waiter\/bartender's attention...and that was the best of the evening's service.  Food finally got rolling and it was quite forgettable, in fact I have already forgotten what I ordered.
Hotel restaurants have high overhead, but paying full entree prices for small plates is wrong...lesson is don't put a restaurant like this in a high overhead location.  You are setting your customers up for disappointment when they see the prices.

Overall Suggestion : Avoid!

If you enjoy eating beef I would recommend the porterhouse as an entree. If you like lamb there is also an excellent lamb chop entree. As for seafood, Chilean Seabass is great! It has a nice flaky texture and rich in flavor. 

Their sparkling sangria is also on point. 
If you have a big appetite, I would recommend ordering the seafood paella! It takes 40 mins to cook so prepare to order early. Here is a list of what I ordered (group of 9) and what I think of each dish:

1 large seafood paella - great for sharing, deep hearty flavor, the rice has a nice bite, they are able to accommodate for large groups and can make one big paella if needed 
2 duck forgras -excellent whole duck liver saut√©ed to perfection and sandwiched between two baked apples, the sauce was a little too sweet for me, however the walnuts helped tone it down  
2 beef and cheese - cooked medium rare 
2 calamari - crispy, not too chewy, fresh 
2 salmon cakes- hearty pieces if salmon
2 lamb chop entrees - the white sauce has hints of truffle, great fat to meat ratio, fresh meat 
2 Atlantic cod- rich, fatty fish, chive oil was a nice combo 
1 Porterhouse - new to the menu, very tender, cooked medium rare 
1 beef tartar- excellent! Fresh raw beef with taro chips
2 chicken skewers - has a nice char to it, meaty chunks of chicken",0,0,0

The ambiance is airy and open, and the bar setup (fruit instead of fake tapas) is witty and hip for a tapas-style spot. 

Tapas: I begin each meal with a cheese plate(highly recommended) or the pan manchego? So far, I most enjoy the salmon with truffle(I often order two) and some other seafood dish I cannot presently recall. Lobster gazpacho is a must for those who(like moi) generally hate gazpacho or cold blends. Other notables, thus far: raspberry tuna dish(it actually works!), lobster salad, huevos estrellados, bass(Oprah-aaaaammazing, lol!), chorizo. The flan here is intricate and delicious.

One dish I hate here is the steak featured on the tapas menu. It tasted like mediocre sirloin... I admittedly--owing to its horrible texture--consider sirloin essentially dog food. I've never tried the paella but was informed that it tastes just like Spain's, which is not a good thing. To explain: paella(with or without saffron) is a stupid idea. Simply read the ingredients\/preparation and you will sigh with comprehension... I call paella culinary meth, lol. If you insist on an entree the filet mignon(or I imagine any seafood or pork dish here) is a pleaser.

Impeccable texture and taste overcome (merely above average) presentation at this spot--one of my faves for lunch or silly dinners. On my last visit, I enjoyed a quick bite\/wine at the bar with friends. I have yet to try the early eve special but it sounds like a killer deal.    

4 stars rather than 5 because some of the flavors repeat (a few dishes beg for drizzles; others for acidity to combat the olive oil and make things more spanish and less greek); however, I wish I could give 4.5 stars b\/c they serve tender octopus And delicious fried calamari that doesn't even need the sauce or lemons.",1,0,2

This is definitely the best tapas restaurant in Las Vegas.  The location in the Aria is very near the registration desk.

Food:
Very good choices for small stomachs or big ones like mine!  They cater to all types, including vegetarians.  I am Spanish so I know true Spanish tapas, and they deliver with creativity and style.  This is almost hipster but very authentic.

Atmosphere:
It is lively but seems to clear out a bit around 9PMish.  It is modern with some abstract\/contemporary styling, not hint of traditional 'spanish' culture that I noticed.  It reflects a more modern interpretation of Spain.  It is loud at times and the tables can be a bit close to each other so ask for a private spot if you need.

Bathrooms: 
If you want to learn how to say a funny pickup line ... go to the bathroom... nuff said.

Corkage:
$50 is, I guess, the norm.  I would be there very very often if it were dropped a bit... maybe $25.  I bring wine with me to every dinner and $50 can sting a bit.  I always reward restaurants who make it easier to bring the wines.

   What not to love about chef Julian Serrano. He's a James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef: Pacific and James Beard Award for Best Chef: Southwest, and many more awards. My parents are a fan of his 2 Michelin Star Picasso at the Bellagio. This trip to CES 2015, I got to dine here a few more times, our group tried about everything on the menu on the 4 days we stayed at the Aria. 

    The warm orange and red accents adorning the walls, crystal ball lighting dropping down from the ceiling, a beautiful bar, with brighter counter top, easily seat 20-30 people at the bar, make it a perfect place to eat, if you were traveling alone on a business trip.  

- Chicharrones, pork belly, caramel, black pepper 

- Lobster gazpacho, chilled Spanish tomato soup, lobster meat, cherry - interesting soup. 

- Steamed mussels, shallots and garlic, brandy, natural jus - delicious 

- Saut√©ed padron peppers, orange zest, orange sea salt 

- Yellowtail ""tiradito"", sweet potato haystacks, horseradish cream, ponzu

- Octopus, potatoes, Spanish paprika 

- Seared scallop, romesco sauce

- Ribeye, mashed potatoes, garlic saut√©ed kale, caramelized onions - a bit over cooked than what we requested. 

- Chilean seabass, Mediterranean quinoa - generous portion, very tasty.

- Lobster fideua, angel hair pasta, half lobster tail, roasted red pepper - I would skip this dish, the pasta was prepared as Chinese egg noodle, sauteed in style, didn't do it for us.

- Gambas a la plancha, head-on prawns, lemon garlic oil dressing - 1 of my favorite dishes here. 

- Paella Valenciana, chicken, rabbit, Spanish pork chorizo,  vegetables, saffron - a MUST ORDER when you come here. 

   Even it was CES 2015, the restaurant was over booked. Service was very good and the new GM was very attentive to us. The cocktails were a hit for our group, check out their happy hour menu $5-$7 sangria, wines, and small dishes from SUNDAY - THURSDAY 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM.

   Julian Serrano also offers a vegetarian and vegan menu range from $6-$40. A $59 Signature Tasting Menu for 4 course, optional wine pairing available for $29 per person, is a good option if you are a couple.

    All the dishes were fairly price for Vegas strip, if anything, this restaurant is a bargain on the strip.     All the dishes were good, a few didn't cut it for me, but my team enjoyed a few times we were here. Even though it's a tapas place, but the portion is fairly large. So come here hungry, with a group of 4-5 friends will be a good way to try all the dishes.",4,2,3

The ambiance is very open and colorful matching Aria's theme. You aren't locked up in a restaurant, and you hear everything that is going on within Aria. While away from the casino floor itself, you feel like you are in a mild busy cityscape.

We had a early dinner reservation at 4:15PM on a Saturday and the place was not packed at all. We sat down, and pretty much knew what we wanted to order and how we wanted to order it since we did our research on Yelp before coming, so here's the breakdown of how everything was. The order going down is how we ordered with the category that it is in. We went in 3's as the tapas come out very quickly!

1. Tuna Raspberry Skewers - Unique twist on sushi. Square in shape, and eaten like a lollipop, I never thought tuna and raspberries would work, but they do! The tuna was soft, the raspberries sweet, but still tart. The crazy thing is that the raspberry is on the side, and they are filled with wasabi. So you eat the tuna skewer + the raspberry with wasibi, and wala ~ tasty tuna sushi. Rating: 4\/5

2. Creamy Risotto - The risotto was cooked perfectly, and the wild mushrooms stood out. The manchego cheese was pungent, but tasty tasty because of it's different texture. Rating: 4\/5

3. Stuffed Dates - So good! SOOOOO SOOOOO GOOD! This one stood out for us. The date covered in crispy pancetta with the tomato marmalade stuffed with goat cheese. Melt in your mouth FOODGASM. Rating: 5\/5

4. White Ceviche - This was a really zesty and fresh ceviche. The white fish was soft, and the mixture of peppers, red onions, and cilantro gave a good bite. Served with crackers, I felt that there may have been too much lime juice. Rating: 3.5\/5

5. Spanish Tortilla - This I felt was a take on breakfast & hashbrowns. While many will say it is nothing special, I am a hashbrown feen, so I found it delicious lol. Rating: 3.5\/5

6. Octopus - I've NEVER -- EVER -- EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR had octopus this soft before. It was ridiculous how soft it was. I don't know how they got it like this, but some parts just tasted like bone marrow consistency. With potato & Spanish paprika, it was a simple delight. Rating: 4\/5

7. Yellowtail with Yam - The crispy yam made this tapa stand out. For if there was none, it would of just been sashimi, and I wouldn't have paid for it. Fresh fish, crispy sweet yam. A sweet and savory combo that worked. Rating: 3.5\/5

8. Lobster Saffron - Half lobster tail, saffron oil, iberian pork, creamy potatoes, asparagus. The lobster was wrapped with the iberian pork. The tail was juicy, the potatoes as well. This felt more like a little entree. While delicious, I'm not sure if it was worth getting. Rating: 3\/5

9. Albondigas - Oh fluffy fluffy meatballs. So simple, yet so good. Great light sweet tomato sauce. Succulent juicy meatballs that just melt in your mouth. Potatoes in squares lightly crispy. Can I get a side order of rice to fill my Asian needs, and pasta to fill my love for Italian please? Rating: 4\/5

So that was the meal, and as you can see, we ordered a good amount for two people. It filled us, but it didn't overfill us, and that's what we enjoyed. There was nothing bad about the meal, and everything was prepared well. For the price, some may question it, but it's Vegas. I would complain if the food was horrible, but it simply wasn't. You can go ahead and spend $60-80 on a piece of steak medium rare, or come here and experience more for your money! Julian Serrano gets 4.5\/5 from me! I may get adventurous next time around and eat things that Yelp has yet to see from here.",5,0,0

It is an upscale fine dining restaurant that features Spanish tapas (or sharing plates). Simone and I arrived in our finest t-shirts, shorts and sneakers. Although not exactly dressed for a formal dinner, I let the hostess know I had made a reservation and we were quickly escorted past the rich and almost famous to the corner table at the far end of the dining room. Reservations are an absolute necessity if you plan to get a table at this restaurant (especially when dressed like a tourist from Maine).After being seated, our very formal waiter quickly offered us a very expensive wine menu and so we decided to get a diet soda and water ( from the tap). We looked over the menu and decided that we wanted to try the Paella as our entree that we would share. The Paella takes at least 35 minutes to prepare so we placed our order before deciding on our smaller tapas plates. First up we decided on a plate of marinated olives. When they arrived we realized that they were not pitted, so we had fun seeing who could make the biggest mess while trying to get the pits out. The waiter seemed amused by this. The olives were very good and were marinated in roasted garlic and baby onions. For our second tapas we decided to get more adventurous and ordered the Albondigas, which were mini Meatballs cooked in a Tomato and Sherry Sauce. They were some of the most tender meatballs I have ever eaten and they just melted in the mouth. The sauce was mild and light with a nice hint of sherry and also included some roasted baby potatoes.  Our last tapas choice was the new age Egg Potato & Morcilla dish. The dish was a combination of sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Blood Sausage with a soft poached egg, atop a pool of Potato Foam topped with Manchego Cheese Air. This dish was truly memorable and one of the most unique things I have ever eaten. The richness of the sausage and egg combined magicaly with the smokey earthiness of the mushrooms and the potato foam and Manchego air melted away to create a creamy sauce for it all. This dish was a real culinary adventure.  Our Valencia Paella was ready and came to the table piping hot and served in the cast iron pan it was cooked in. It was a delicious combination of baked Saffron laced Spanish rice with house made Chorizo sausage, sauteed Rabbit and tender grilled Chicken topped of with roasted Haricot Verde Green Beans.  We managed to finish off the rather large Paella meal, and then wrapped things up with a dessert tapas of Almond Sponge Cake with Homemade Almond Ice Cream. It was super dense, super moist and super good.  Our entire meal and experience at Julian Serrano was one that I will not soon forget. It was creative, unique and prepared perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind shelling out a few extra bucks to have the perfect culinary adventure. And next time I'll even wear pants...maybe.",0,1,0

We ate here a few weeks ago during a tour of the grand loop. We opted for the early theater menu with wine pairing. Definitely a great experience.

Started with lobster gazpacho (awesome!), and chicken croquettes for the other half. Then salmon for one, pork chop sous vide for the other (both fabulous, pork with dried fruit and some amazing sauce concoction).

Molten chocolate cake was only topped by the santiago cake, both are, like, to die for, so to speak. A well paired glass of wine with each course, the red being the best of the three.

All in all, $39 pre-fixe + $19 wine pairing, you're talking like $150 tax and tip. For a fabulous three course meal and wine in Vegas, I'd say it's not too bad. Friendly service to boot. Definitely a treat.

I've never been a big fan of Spanish food, but Julian Serrano has swayed me to the other side. The service is good and I really enjoyed dining here. Everything at this restaurant is more than satisfactory!

The food was fantastic:

SANGRIA: I had a non-alcoholic, pineapple\/strawberry sangria. It was heavenly. It was refreshing and flavorful. I personally enjoy my drinks on the sour side, so this sangria was perfect for me.

FOIE GRAS PARFAIT: I'm a sucker for Foie Gras, but I prefer the real deal as opposed to the mousse used in the parfait. It didn't stay true to the flavor of Foie Gras, although it's richness remained. I didn't enjoy the parfait as much as I did the Serrano Tender, which used the actual meat.

PAELLA: I've never had Paella before, so I don't know what makes it good or bad. However, Serrano's Paella was infused with mouth-watering flavor! The rice was soft and the vegetables melted in my mouth. The flavors all mended together as I chewed. It was delicious! I was a bit reluctant to try it because it usually takes 45-60 minutes, but it arrived in 25 minutes. I was surprised that the Paella, being prepared about 20 minutes before it usually is, exceeded my expectations. 

SERRANO TENDER: I love this. The Foie Gras was a perfect way to end my meal. It was very rich and tasty. I wanted more, but.. $35!

* If you've never tried Foie Gras.. I strongly recommend you do. What better place to try it than Julian Serrano?

The service here is excellent. Our waiter, Ernest, was very eager to help us and didn't hesitate when we inquired about an item on the menu. The other employees were very friendly and attentive as well. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very calming.. I love their color scheme which reminds me of the fall season. It's a beautiful restaurant with subtle decorations that don't disrupt your dining. I noticed how there are two areas; the open one near the front and the more private, secluded area in the back. It would be nice if they asked which area we'd prefer to be seated in.

I've yet to try their desserts, but I hope to in the future. I know I'll be coming back because of the high-quality food and service. The restaurant is very clean and is a gracious sight. I will be coming here again.",0,0,0

The waiter was great at suggesting what to order (Patatas bravas is of note. My boyfriend's father was doubtful; ""It's just potatoes, what's the big deal?"" It was a big deal). We chatted and took his advice, which turned out to be excellent. Drinks here are also GREAT (pricey, but great)--you can browse it on their very cool iPad app. My boyfriend's mother and I each had one, and we both loved our drinks.

As for the food...I'm not sure you can go wrong. As mentioned previously, the patatas bravas was great. We had a bunch of meat dishes (the chorizo on a stick was cute and tasty!), but oddly enough, the standout dish was the poached salmon. It had to be the best dish of the night, and probably the best salmon I've ever had. I had to question myself for a second because we were, after all, in the middle of a desert.

Probably the weakest part of the meal was the desserts. While they were still good (churros in a spicy chocolate sauce that we were practically drinking out of the cup, flan), a round of drinks might have been a nicer ending. At this point, however, I'm grasping at straws.

Very picky, because well.. You get what you pay for, right? Wrong

Not all fine dining establishments are created equally, so I always compare to the best. Julian Serrano has a very elegant vibe and a gorgeous establishment. But the service and food just wasn't a complete hit on the marker though.

The chicken and seafood paella is very rich in flavor but can come off as too rich, it's definitely something you should share for its size. But you can grow sick of the flavor pretty quickly because of how thick and heavy it is. And for a rice dish is a bit pricy at $60 each.

The tuna tar tar was good, fresh, and flavorful, but portions were extremely small for what you're paying for. 

But all that is forgivable, what makes the most of a fine dining experience worthy is the service, and it also fell just slightly short. I just didn't feel the welcome from our host nor did it seem that they were very informative about the menu. Their description for the paella was very simple: ""it can be shared, it's good, and idk..""

My water cup was filled half of the time, and other times I felt a little neglected like our host forgot to check back on us. Service did start to pick up a little when we were about to leave, but that's just a little too late for me..

Hubby and I stopped by their first weekend open and in what I hope are just growing pains (and they better grow fast), we had a pretty unimpressive experience.

We wanted a snack so we dropped in during their ""snack"" hour (2pm to 5pm?).  From the distance, we noted a few people get a table but we also saw that it wasn't busy at all so we excitedly rushed over.  Little did we know frustration and disappointment would ensue.  

First thing we were told was that there was to be no seating at the tables.  Only bar and that's first come first serve.  The hostess was a non-nonsense (read: not nice) Eastern European lady who couldn't give a rat's ass if we ate there or not. Well, as luck would have it, there was no available bar seating.  Mean Hostess went away and thankfully a nicer (but no less helpful one) came by.  

She ran to the other side of the restaurant and came back saying that they were ""cleaning off a table for us"" and would be ready momentarily.  Really?  Because Mean Hostess just told us there's no table seating, I thought.  Flash forward 10 minutes - there was no cleaning activity of any kind.  Lies!!  Nice Hostess had disappeared and Mean Hostess was back.

After waiting about 10 more minutes, some people finally got up and left so we ran over to the bar.  Nice Hostess was standing by to direct us to the seats that WE FOUND OURSELVES.  Yeah, where's our ""table""? lady?  

We were sorely mistaken that service would pick up as soon as we were seated.  Silly us.  We finally got our drink orders in but shame on us for not putting in our food order along with it because...well, we should have.  It took a while longer.  Hubby went with a diet coke and I went with their white sangria which could have been fresher.

One look at the menu and I could see that the experience would be (should be) similar to that of eating at The Bazaar in Los Angeles.  Except...they were ""out"" of the first three things I tried to order.  The deconstructed seafood stew was just basically seafood spread out on a fancy plate.  The most memorable dish I would have to say was the cheese platter, three Spanish cheeses served with quince paste and some over-charred bread.

I have to say that usually I could get over a long wait or frustrating seating experience if the food is worth it.  It wasn't...and hubby and I left Julian Serrano $80 poorer for a not-great snack.  Maybe we'll go back when the Yelp rating is at least 4 stars.

Caviar, truffles, etc) AND you get a giant pitcher of sangria. The plates may be small but they are generous because they are meant to be SHARED. For example, the tomato bread usually is served with 4-5 good-sized slices easily.

This place's prices are just outrageous and the portions are in no way a justification. I mean, just look at that tomato bread! $9 for one baguette slice made to look like three? 

And $50 for a paella?! WHY? Did the rabbits and chickens in our paella range on golden grass along Andalusian fields or something?! Was the rice hand milled and grown in organic water?? Is that why it's so expensive? 

Do not let the photographs deceive you. The Paella may look large but it's actually not a lot as the pan is thin, no more than half an inch of rice at best. The circumference makes it appear like you are getting a lot but you are not. 

Service: the waitstaff here are courteous, professional, and very nice for Vegas standards. We did notice however that our server often came back to our table, constantly asking us if we wanted to order more drinks. 

Ambiance: it's prettily decorated and has an open space with loud music so it's hard to have a conversation but it's still a nice area to sit down with friends and relax.",2,2,0

It's visually stunning - the colors are beautiful and happy and vibrant... but why the televisions?  And why were they playing a program showing people being decapitated?  And why was our waiter so... laissez fair and slow?

Anyway.  The raw tuna dish was amazing, as was a dish with egg, french fries and pancetta (my dream breakfast).  The pork on skewers dish we had wasn't good at all - it was tough, chewy and flavored in a way that did not make my mouth happy.  The cured meat platter didn't ""wow"" me.

I ended up coming here during a recent stay at Aria. I met someone at the pool who mentioned that the tapas here were amazing and a must try while we were at Aria. Of course that means i had to try it out.

I went with 3 friends on a Sunday evening. The service was great except it did feel like they were trying to get us out as soon as possible. Some people say it is just being attentive. I found it annoying because sometimes I like to pick over my food and take the time to talk to my friends. 

On to the food: shrimp gambas (a okay)l mixed ceviche (left too long in lemon and fish cooked too through); traditional spanish chicken croquetas (GOOOOD); and the seafood Paella (Yum Yum Yum but could have been cooked longer for that crispy rice rim). 

Overall the food was okay. The prices are up there but generally Spanish food isn't that cheap so that was expected. I expected the quality to be better but it wasn't terrible.

It was a bit of a hike from the self-parking garage but we eventually found it. It's an odd space near the check-in desk, close to the doors leading to Crystals and is completely dwarfed by the imposing entrance to Sage. Plus, it's open to the check-in desk and casino so it looks like more of a casual eatery than a fine dining establishment. It wasn't more than 75% full and we were seated right away at a table for two.

\/\/FOOD (from best to worst)\/\/
- Creamy risotto ($10.00): Cooked to a perfect al dente texture, wasn't mushy at all, wonderful flavors. I was craving more before we were even finished with the plate. Possibly the best risotto we've ever had.

- Gambas ($12.00): It looked like a very simple dish. 4 shrimps in a broth that resembled clarified butter with garlic chips and peppers. It may not have been complex, but it was executed perfectly.

- Piquillo peppers ($10.00): One pepper cut in half and stuffed with cheese and surrounded by a tomato based sauce. Loved it!

- Tuna tiradito ($12.00): The tuna looked fabulous and tasted even better. It was accompanied by a terrific seaweed salad.

- Steamed mussels ($9.00): Approximately a dozen large mussels in a medium sized black pot. Yes, the pot was deep so we had to really get in there to get some of that broth.  Delicious.

- Beef with Brie ($17.00): Not the best cut of beef I've had but the flavors with the sauce, brie and toast were pretty good. If they timed the dishes better I would probably give this dish higher marks. But they brought out the tuna and risotto at the same time and by the time we tried the beef it was luke warm and the toast  wasn't crispy.

- Lobster & pineapple ($14.00): Others rave about this dish, but I was underwhelmed. Too much pineapple, not enough lobster. It was too sweet and I could barely distinguish any other flavors other than the pineapple. More style than substance, in my opinion. 

One thing that really bothered me was the seating. Her seat was on a bench. Mine was a poorly designed modern chair that was about 4 inches lower than the bench and the back support only went half way up my back making it tough to get comfortable. It's just a weird choice of seating in combination with everything else.

The service was good but not spectacular. Our server seemed to have way too many tables so we didn't see him too often.

Everything was well executed and so meticulously and artfully prepared. In comparison to other tapas places around town (namely Firefly) JS beats Firefly on taste and creativity but the portions at Firefly are bigger. And, of course the prices are much higher at JS since it's on the strip and a celeb chef restaurant. But, the prices aren't outrageous by Vegas standards. In total we got 7 dishes, a cocktail, a glass of wine, and a half bottle of wine for just under $200 (including tip). That's actually below what we normally spend at fine dining spots on the strip and we definitely left full and happy. If $100 per person for dinner is too much for you and if you're expecting the same amount of food you would get at a national chain restaurant (Cheesecake Factory, Red Lobster) don't come here. But, if you want quality tapas with wonderful flavors, then I recommend you give this place a try.

Sorry people this place is 3 star food at best with 2 star service.

Start off with service just to get that out of the way. I watched my server take 2 additional orders on my table over a period of 20 mins and didn't bother to refill my water until I asked him to.  Server wasn't very helpful with explaining the menu at all. He seemed preoccupied with something else that was going on in his head. This isn't what you would expect from one of Aria's ""famed"" restaurants. 

Food: SALTY, LACKED PRESENTATION, and NOT MADE TO ORDER??

We wanted to order the Bang Bang Shrimp salad but the dressing on the side... Well to our surprised the server said that the salad is actually premixed and therefore they can't put the dressing on the side... That's a bit weird I though?

We ordered the mixed Paella which had the lobster, muscles, shrimp, Sausage, and chicken and it was very average.  The sausage tasted a bit funny and no one touched the chicken because it was such a poor cut of chicken with brown and white meat mixed in one cut rather than separated. I also thought the Paella needed to be coffee for an extra 5 mins - it was a little too soggy at the bottom.

The calamari was so sub average it wasn't even funny. You can have better Calamari almost anywhere try Cheesecake Factory. Lol

Tuna comes were the best thing we had. Tuna was fresh, but presentation was poor. If you have a plate that holds 6 cones don't only provide 3 and leave the other 3 holes empty...do something with the presentation that utilizes the other 3 holes with garnishing or something - no brainer??

It got to the point where we just didn't want to order anything anymore even though we still had an appetite because we were being let down with every dish.

Go to Javier's- if you're gonna spend the money do it somewhere with a track record that actually matches what you get.   I'd never come back here, definitely not worth the $$$",4,1,3

We had a rather large group of 15 girls but the service was still very quick. The food however was absolutely horrible. The waiter brought the chicken and mushroom skewers I had ordered, but unfortunately they weren't edible. I cut into one piece of chicken and saw that it wasn't even cooked through but was still raw meat. I showed the waiter who quickly removed my plate and looked rather embarrassed. I asked him to just throw it out and did not want to try anything else. My friends had ordered various other appetizers and entrees but no one was satisfied with the food that was served. Apparently the potatoes were pretty good though.
I returned to the table after visiting the restroom and attempted to sit back down. Just as I almost sat down one of the legs fell off the chair. I weigh 115lbs and I'm confidant this amount of weight should not be enough to break a dining chair. The waiters ran over and pulled the chair into the back room before I could get any words out. Our waiter came over and told me the floor tile is slippery and sometimes the chairs slide out especially if the legs are loose. I tried to ask him about it further but he walked away and sent his manager to our table.
The manager advised me that they've been having issues with many of their dining chairs and already filed a complaint with the supplier. Yet they still continue to use these chairs!!! I asked what would happen if an elderly person had sat in this chair instead of me? What if they fell and were seriously hurt? The manager kept saying sorry but didn't really seem to care about resolving this for future guests.
I laughed about it later with my group. The dining experience here was a joke. The restaurant looked very pretty from the entrance but looks were deceiving.

I'd go again (went twice this trip) for certain dishes... long story follows:

I actually ate at Julian Serrano twice on my last visit to Vegas in May. It was an easy choice to go to again because of the very, very large menu that meant I could have a completely different meal the second time around, as well as have my favorite dishes again. Obviously dining there twice means I'd recommend it. Definitely make reservations, though - especially on the weekend. There were TONS of large parties both nights I went - a Saturday and a Monday.

This is a packed house, loud, high-energy restaurant that offers a selection of tapas, regular entrees, and family-sized platters to suit absolutely any taste. There is hot seafood, cold seafood, egg tapas, pork, beef, bread tapas, vegetarian tapas, multiple paellas, family sized pigs on a platter... This is truly a restaurant where the biggest issue is deciding, but having small plates makes this so much easier to do.

My personal favorite was the tuna cones - I had them both nights. The stuffed dates are also incredible. I'd wanted them both nights, but the first time, our paella came sooner than expected and I didn't get to order the dates. I'd eat them every day. My only beef is that our waiter the second night made a show of saying how since there were only 3 cones on the plate (and we were two people), he'd bring an extra, only for me to find out when the bill came that I was charged $5 for it. I'm not complaining about the cost, just the fact that it came across as a good deed but was an upsell.

Speaking of the paella...unfortunately this was my low point. I expected something amazing from a Spanish chef. There was zero socarret on the bottom of the pan (MAJOR disappointment), and the lobster tail in the center wasn't cleaned. I was also expecting the chorizo to be more of a softer, spicier sausage-style instead of firm slices, but maybe that's because I'm used to the Mexican kind. The second time around, I didn't bother with the paella. My only other letdown was what was supposed to be Julian Serrano's favorite - the Huevos Estrellados. They were really bland. When I mentioned to a floor manager that I'd have used some Tabasco on them, he said they had some available I could ask for next time. 

The service was really great both nights. The floor managers really work hard here, even cleaning tables, and the servers are all super friendly. This service staff REALLY hustles.",0,0,0

With every glass of beer or wine came a small single serving of some delectable tidbit. So I was happy to eat at a gormet tapas bar\/restaurant in hopes of bringing back memories of my summer of 1978. Unfortunately, the tapas were only OK. I think the chef over-thought the concept of tapas. It's a simple food. The tapas served by Julian Serrano are complex. It's hit and miss. Some great-some not so great. (I won't bore your with the details of every tapa we ordered-quite a few.) Here's a basic report card for the restaurant.

1. Food - B-.
2. Wait Staff - A. The service was excellent and the waiter recommended an excellent wine for dinner.
3. Ambiance - B+. The owners spent lavishly for the decor. One drawback was that this restaurant is essentially in the lobby of the Arias. There was a chilly draft at our table.
4. Price - Reasonable for a quality restaurant on the Strip. (Strip restaurants are notoriously expensive, but I don't mind. It keeps out all the trailer trash riff-raff that is everywhere on the Strip!

Yes, this place had been open for a mere week before we choose it as our dining destination, but if your gonna open up in Vegas, you better have your shit together. There are tons of casinos\/hotels\/restaurants doing things the right way, just copy and paste. JS failed to do that.
Three hungry dudes and tapas should have been a perfect match right? Wrong. The food was extremely forgettable, with the worst item being the one recommended to us by our server, the overcooked lobster with canned pineapple skewer.
As unmemorable as the food was, the service is not something I will forget. I am convinced we either never saw our waiter or he wasnt working that night, as the gentleman who we kept having to flag down was gracious enough to take our orders but had to keep reminding us that he was not our waiter. 
20 minutes after being presented with dessert menus someone returned to ask us what we would like. ""20 minutes ago we wanted dessert, now we just want the check.""

The risotto was full of flavor, but a bit too al dente and firm. It should have been a little soupy but the sauce was thick. 

The black rice was prepared the same. Full of flavor with lots of color and contrast and the squid was cooked perfect. But again, I found the rice a bit too firm for my liking. 

Lastly I ordered the monkfish. Cooked crispy, but a touch over seasoned with salt. The veggies underneath and the flavored oils were delicious.

My friend's flight into Vegas got delayed so I found myself waltzing into this place for some food and drink to help pass the time.  I'm so glad I did, because it was great.

Firstly, the server was amazing!  Before my butt hit the bar stool, I had a both a food and drink menu in front of me.  After mulling over the drink menu and being stuck on the plethora of options available, I asked for a recommendation.  He offered samples of both the red and white sangrias (little shooter glasses), without me even having to ask.  I tried both and the red was head and shoulders above the white.  I think what made it so good was the cinnamon in it, which really added something a little extra.  I ended up ordering a glass of the red, which was easily the best $10 I've ever spent in Vegas.  Beware though, that thing packs a punch and I was feeling it by the time I left.

For my meal, I had the ahi salad which was delicious.  The price was really fair too (especially for Vegas), $13.  The fish was fresh and seared perfectly, not to mention, there were also chunks of avocado and tomato amongst the greens which were dressed just the right amount.

Upon perusing the remainder of the menu, it looks like the tapas are similar in price but would probably be smaller dishes and therefore require more quantity-wise, so I can see where it might get expensive.  Regardless, if the quality of food is consistent with what I experienced during lunch, I definitely need to come back for dinner service.",1,1,1

The menu isn't as extensive as other Tapas restaurants, but the quality is exceptional.  We ordered:

- Brava Potatoes (Spicy Tomato, Alioli Sauce, $8)
- Creamy Risotto (Wild Mushroom, Manchego Cheese, Natural Jus, $10)
- Pan Tomate (Toasted Bread, Fresh Garlic, Tomato Sauce, $6)
- Spanish Tortilla (Potatoes, Eggs, Onions, $8)
- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (Goat Cheese, Mushrooms, $10)
- Stuffed Dates (Almond, Applewood Bacon, Spicy Piquillo Pepper Sauce, $8)
- Bu√±uelos (Spanish Doughnuts, Butterscotch, Caramel, $8)

The Brava Potatoes were OK.  They had good flavor, but were very filling.  I don't recommend having this if you want to try more than a couple of items....this is a gut-buster.

The Creamy Risotto was awesome!  I finished it off in no time.

The Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were my favorite...yum!  They cooked just right and the sweet and savory flavor of the Peppers went perfectly with the Goat Cheese and Mushrooms.  I could eat a large plate of those, easily.

My friend had the Stuffed Dates and the Spanish Tortilla.  He enjoyed both of them.

The other highlight of my evening was the Bu√±uelos.....damn, these were good!  The Caramel Butterscotch dipping sauce went perfectly with the Spanish Doughnuts.  I love how they have the toothpicks for easy dipping\/eating.  They are addicting too because I can't get my mind off of them.

The staff is very nice and whether you have a table or end up at the bar it's a great experience.  Food always comes out fast but it should. .. it's tapas!

Serrano Ham is always a must to start off with and I have ordered it every time we come here. Our last time I ordered the wrong one it was two serrano ham sanwhiches with tomato spread and manchego cheese rather then the serrano ham by itself with a side of tomato sauce. It ended up being delicious... I ordered a second plate. 

We ordered the:

+pan serrano (2 orders which are the sanwhiches)
+mediteranean chicken skewers
+grilled ribeye steak (a must have! )
+baby back ribs (soft and tender)
+sauteed Padron peppers (2 orders, his fav)
+fresh calamari a la plancha (which I can't have)

It was all very delicious! 

We also eyed the family Size plates another table had ordered.  Imagine your small tapas plate enlarged by the machine from the movie ""honey I blew up the kid"". It looked amazing!

After coming here for my 30th birthday dinner (what a great choice upon coincidence) we decided to come back the next night before our red-eye. I'm obsessed with their cheese platter and have found a new favorite cheese with their new monte enebro .. AMAZE.

Mozzarella ice cream? Whaaaaat. I thought my friend was brave to give this ""Heirloom Tomato salad"" a try, then was overly consumed with jealousy when I tasted it and wished I got one for myself (I got one the next night, don't you worry). This is a dish that proves to have a top-notch chef behind it. So creative, mind-blowing, and just absolutely delicious.

Goat cheese (can you go wrong with anything involving goat cheese?) and tomato marmalade cake... just get it. Like the Mozzarella ice cream, this dish was created by a mastermind. Interesting blend of flavors and textures... you have to try it.

The spanish pizza AKA Coca Vegetarian was alright, but did not compare to my other dishes. I usually avoid all fish in Vegas because it just never seems as fresh as the Boston-right-off-the-water seafood I'm used to. However, I did give the fried fish of the day a try, aka bunuelo, since it's fried I figured how can that go wrong...but as usual it just did not taste right. My boyfriend got a bunch of red meat-related dishes that he loved as well, and my friends all enjoyed the same dishes as I.

Sangria was also unique with a hint of cinnamon. I wish I could make Julian Serrano a regular spot in my rotation, but it will just have to wait til my next trip to Vegas!",0,0,0

Small plates means people can eat and share more different foods. The variety of it all is what attracts me. I'm not coming here to just eat my meat and potatoes. I can have a little bit of this, a little of that, and in the end of it all, I had a bite of more that what I would normally have in a single day. Julian Serrano made his mark with Masa's Restaurant in San Fransisco. Opening Picasso in Las Vegas in the Bellagio, his Vegas restaurant was the recipient of 2 Michelin stars and a AAA Five Diamond Award. With all these accolades, it was time for Julian Serrano to venture out into other things. Looking at the trends of restaurants and being of Spanish decent, tapas was an obvious choice. I like tapas because you can order a lot of food at one time, and this we did.

The brava potatoes was a popular item so we started off with these. They were small nuggets of fried potatoes - the outside was golden and crispy, and the inside was fluffy. The spicy tomato puree on top was a nice acidic sauce. The aioli sauce on top was fatty and smooth -- It all was a nice combination. Stabbing these fried nuggets with a skewer, the sauce had a perfect taste and balance for the potatoes. I would order these again. They were simple and delicious.

The grilled angus flat iron steak was a nice accompaniment to the potatoes. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the steak was meaty and had a nice chewy consistency -- kind of like flank steak. The japanese eggplant was a unique condiment, and the mushroom demi-glace gave it a nice earthy note. It was a perfect cut of meat and the flavors worked nicely.

It seems like every tapas restaurant has stuffed dates. The one at Julian Serrano was mediocre in my opinion. Though the dates were huge, almost too big, all the other ingredients were missing. The almond was barely noticed, and the wrapping of the applewood bacon was lost. With the panko crusted fried exterior, the flavors were kind of single noted, even when dipped in the spicy piquillo pepper sauce. Maybe the dates large size gave it too much of a sweet taste, but the saltiness of the bacon could have been more pronounced.

Yeah, the brava potatoes were delicious, but more fried potatoes couldn't hurt. The huevos estrellados had a bed of fried topped with imported spanish pork chorizo and eggs. The egg was cooked perfectly. With a crispy outline and egg yolk running everywhere, this dish was very rich. Each fork full had fries drenched in a mix of chorizo grease and egg yolk. The pork chorizo had a nice mellow flavor with a little kick of spice -- terrific. with all this grease and pork, I began to think this is a perfect hang over cure in Las Vegas.

Looking for a carb load other than potatoes, we ordered the creamy risotto. This was a nice risotto, though the rice was a little too undercooked. Maybe 30 seconds longer on the fire would have made it perfect. Better to be a tad undercooked that overcooked, I guess. Other than the texture, this was delicious. The wild mushrooms gave it a nice grounded flavor. The shaving of aged manchego cheese worked perfectly with the mushrooms. Manchego, my new favorite cheese, has a resemblance and taste profile of truffles. The rich earthy flavor worked perfectly with the rice. I just wished there was more of it.

Finally, we ordered the beef and cheese. Looking for more meat in our tapas, we figured this would be a perfect candidate. The prime tenderloin cooked to a perfect medium rare was soft as butter. Manchego cheese was on top and the dish was amazing. Topped with the honey and pecans, the sweetness kind of killed my savory steak experience. My mind was confused -- was this a steak or was it dessert? Though it didn't taste all that bad, the off putting sweetness of the honey was surprising. All in all, the meat was soft and buttery, and I preferred this over the flat iron.

Julian Serrano was an amazing experience. Tapas is gaining popularity -- it lets you try so many things! Be careful though, you can easily get carried away and run up the bill. Celebrity chef Julian Serrano knows what he is doing. When you are talking about chefs in California, he is the best around, and possibly in the nation. It was great to try his food in such a casual atmosphere. When you are in Vegas, you want to eat nice and splurge. At Julian Serrano, you can feel like you are splurging on a nice meal, but not pay over the top prices. The atmosphere is warm and elegant as is the food.

We had tuna cones, steak and cheese (which is a small smothered steak on bread), a salad (can't remember which one), and a cheese platter.  It's tapas and that means very small plates - like 3 or 4 bites per plate.  You are going to spend about $50 per person and you'll be satisfied but not stuffed.  Which is what we were going for. 

I will say that the pacing is off.  The tapas are treated equally, so if you like your soup or salad first then you really need to emphasize that or it will come out whenever.  That happened to us and I was miffed about it - salad came at the end.  They did make it up by giving us a dessert which we had the bread pudding and it was great.",0,0,0

We entered Aria, scoping out the new digs for the first time.  Somewhat strange and drab in there.  Lots of earthtones, amber, copper hues.  Many of the restaurants inside were not open for lunch.  Serrano was near the lobby whereat we found a list of food options, and tapas are tasty, so in we went.

It wasn't busy.  The seating area was cool.  I sat facing a bunch of glass vessels stacked into a wall.  It's very open to the casino floor, which I suppose is good.  

I'm no tapas expert: I've only eaten at a couple legit providers.  But JS just didn't wow me.  Others have mentioned the miniscule nature of the dishes.  I guess the two of us weren't that hungry, because we became overwhelmed by the 6 small plates we ordered.

I liked the mushroomy soup.  It had a richness and earthiness to it, well seasoned.  The manchego toast was sort of a bummer.  It was soft, cold, and a little mushy.  Suz puts manchego on toast and gets it nice and crispy, and forget that tomato sauce, just those two things together are beauty.

The chicken croquetas were creamy with a nice golden crust.  Rich.  Risotto--yes to its flavor, and though the ""al dente"" factor is far preferable to glue, a few grains of rice were undercooked to the point of grittiness, which wasn't delightful.  

The huevos estrellados were something.  Nicely done french fries coated in an easy-cooked egg with chorizo.  I would order those again.  The Branzino\/sea bass.  I had a hard time with the skin...not sure if that was their fault or mine. Probably mine.  In general, pretty good, but it didn't make me want to fight Suz for it--I left most of it to her.

Service was mostly good.  The server forgot what we ordered and had to come back for a double-check, otherwise attentive (as she should have been, with sparsely filled dining room).

How do I illustrate this? Take for example the yellowtail - I hate seafood and this delightful dish was full of surprises that made me think twice. 

Everything we had was exceptional and we will definitely be back. It makes me want to try other Julian Serrano restaurants.  For the better part of three years we've walked past this gem and we won't do that again, that's for sure.",0,0,0

We looked at the menu and saw many many things that sounded delicious. It's located inside of Aria. We were passing by and saw the menu. We weren't hungry yet, but we saw that for the paella, it takes 40 to 60 minutes to make from when you order it, so we asked if we could order it now, so that in an hour, it would be ready when we came in for our reservation later. The hostess at the bar said that we could do that (although she tried to tell us to just order in when we sat down and eat tapas in the meantime, so we had to explain that we needed to catch a show). She took a credit card I guess to hold the order. 

When we came back, we were seated and we ordered a bunch of tapas to share. Our paella was in the oven and not quite ready yet. We got the chicharonnes, Spanish tortilla, sauteed padron peppers, kale salad, and the spicy bomba. I also got a white sangria. The chicharonnes came in a cute glass jar, but they were HARD as a rock. They are caramelized, but it was so hard to bite into it or chew. I thought I would lose a tooth. We didn't finish these. The tortilla was good, but it was really small. The padron peppers were not what I was expecting. Pimientos de padron are one of my favorite tapas dishes. Usually prepared very simply, sauteed in oil and a little salt. These were covered in orange zest and I thought it took away from the peppers. It tasted good, but I think it would've been better without the orange. The kale salad was good - came with beets - we very much needed some fresh vegetables. The bomba, which is a beef + pork meatball, was yummy. So the tapas we ordered were sort of a mix. And I didn't like my white sangria. I can't remember what fruits were used, but I remember thinking it sounded really yummy. But I could hardly taste any fruitiness, and it didn't really taste like white wine, but just super strong alcohol. 

The paella we had ""pre-ordered"" came out and it was delicious. We got the mixed paella, which lobster, mussels, shrimp, chicken, and chorizo. The rice was cooked perfectly and the shrimp and chicken and chorizo were yummy, as were the veggies (peas and green onions). It came out on the paella pan. The menu says that the paella feeds two people, but I thought it was perfect for four, especially since we also had a bunch of tapas beforehand. 

We also ate the slow-cooked crispy roasted suckling pig. This was DELICIOUS!!! One of the most tastiest things I have ever eaten. The skin was indeed crispy - very thin and light, but perfectly crispy. Then there was a layer of fat and then the most tender pork ever. It was AMAZING. We didn't finish this, but we took the leftovers back to our hotel. I ate it later that evening and it still tasted delicious. I'm still dreaming about it. 

And then dessert. We were so full at this point, but I had seen that they had churros con chocolate on the menu, and I love churros. These were pretty good too. It came with four loops and a bowl of chocolate to dip the churros in. 

For the tapas, I guess I was hoping for the more original simple versions that I ate when I visited Spain. I appreciate the creative artistic twists on the tapas, but I was slightly disappointed by them. But the suckling pig and the paella were amazing here - AMAZING!!!",1,1,1

I originally thought of going to Javier's but after seeing the menu and what was being charged for tacos, I didn't want to be disappointed how I was at Chino Poblano. 

So I've heard so much about Julian Serrano I thought I'd give it a try. I browse the menu and know I can take a few things out to make it vegan. I ask the hostess if I can make substitutions to accommodate a vegan lifestyle. They said no, but instead pull out an entire vegan and vegetarian menu. SCORE!!! 

Everything looked so good! I honestly could've ordered the entire vegan menu but I couldn't justify spending more than $200 when I still need to grab groceries. 

I ordered the paella which is a must to try, either vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or meat eater. Let it be the first thing to be ordered. When the waiter comes over, just order the paella! No questions, just order it. Even without the meat and seafood, this is the best paella I've had in Las Vegas. It takes about 45 minutes to hit the table. The temperature was just perfect. 
I also ordered the kale salad which was amazing as well. Very light and fresh. I then ordered grilled jumbo asparagus which came out perfect and went so well with the salad. 
There was a non-alcoholic sangria I tried which was pretty good too. Not too sweet and not too from all the fruit. The orange garnish I could do without but still nicely done. 

Sadly there were no vegan desserts or I assume there wasn't since I wasn't offered a dessert menu. 

The service was good. I sat at the bar and it took a few minutes to have my order taken. No worries, they seemed busy. 

Julian Serrano, great for vegans and non vegans.",2,0,2

Its in the lobby of the Aria and despite being labeled as ""$$$"" there are a lot of people in flip flops and still wearing bathing suits or what have you from the pool. 

We had reservations for 9 and arrived 20 min early and asked one of the hosts if we could be sat a little early. He said he would check and then disappeared for 10 minutes. People that just walked in were sat down before us as we just waited for him. He eventually came back and looked at us then walked away. Ok. After another while and more walk ins being sat in front of us a waitress finally said to follow her and sat us at our table. It was already past 9 at that point. He could've just said ""Sorry we can't sit you earlier"" and we would have happily sat at the bar and ordered a drink. What a pointless waste of our time as we stood by the hostess stand. 

Food was ok. A couple hits and a couple misses. Overall wish we had gone to Jaleo instead. Food was not super creative, the tasting menu especially was really generic with caeser salad, chicken, and molten lava cake. Not very Spanish-y at all I imagine it was trying to appeal to the mass audience\/flip flop crowd.

Started off with chicken croquettes with bechamel, yummy and really creamy\/fried but not very reminiscent of Spanish croquettes. The pan con tomate and manchego was unremarkable. We were pretty excited for the black foot pig ribs with beans and the black foot pig shoulder on toast with caramelized onions. Black foot pigs are fed only acorns and their meat is supposed to taste amazing. The ribs were ALL fat. Honestly could not tell you what the meat tasted like because there were only tiny scraps of it attached to white blubber. The beans were ok. The pork shoulder had good flavor but was so tough. Its a shame to overcook such good quality meat like that. With the onions and toast it would've been lovely if properly cooked.

The dish I most liked was one of the specials, coca with goat cheese, figs and arugula. The coca bread was soooo good. Cannot wait to get that again somewhere. Its like a cakey thicker tortilla. With the fresh figs and goat cheese and arugula this was perfect.

The chicken with chorizo and potatoes was super flavorful and a lot of food. It came with salty whipped cream which I imagine you were supposed to mix into everything else but I was not quite fond of. It could have used a fresh\/vegetable element since everything was very heavy. 

They forgot my lobster saffron rice but at that point I was full so it was fine. 

Looked at desserts but they looked pretty meh. The table next to us ordered the churros and they looked pretty unremarkable. The almond cake with turron ice cream sounded better but after the meal we were reluctant to order it. Would probably not return here.",1,0,1

This was my first time at a tapas restaurant so I really wasn't sure what to expect. I am a local and went with a group of 6 other ladies who were in town visiting. 

The restaurant is beautiful and has a great location if you aren't staying at the hotel itself. We ended up being there for 4 hours. We ordered a pitcher of sangria which most of the girls did not care for and a couple bottles of wines and serval more glasses. We ordered starters and the beet salad was a hit as well as the mushroom soup. The apple foie gras was AMAZING. The mixed paella also got some good reviews. I got the beef tenderloin which was amazing. The only thing that was weird was since I got this and not what everyone else got mine came out and I finished it and my plate was cleared before everyone got their food. I would have liked some better timing on this so I could have ate with everyone. We ordered more but there was so much I can't remember everything. Dessert and coffee was amazing. The molten chocolate cake was great, but small, the churros were a hit but the topper of the night and if you love dessert was a large orange blossom cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Service was ok, but not really. We would be trying to ask our server a question and she walked away multiple times while we were talking to her. She never once smiled or seemed to remotely care about us.

And why not try a different cuisine out at the same time? When I came across Julian Serrano at the Aria, I knew this was the place to try. It is my first time trying out Spanish cuisine, not counting an Elite Event at Pintxo last year.

While the dinner entree menu is high priced, I found lunch here to be reasonably priced. Tapas are offered for lunch alongside items like sandwiches, salads and paellas which range from $10-$14.

The decor is Spanish with a lot of bold and bombastic colors. Yellow being dominant. It is an upscale restaurant, but it feels very inviting. Even though I was dressed casually, I felt comfortable here. Though this was at lunch. Not sure what the vibe at dinner is like here.

I had the seafood rice ($14) which is a paella that has calamari, mussels, shrimp and monkfish! It is served in an individual size skillet which I praise for presentation. The actual dish itself was okay. It was a little too salty. Probably from the stock. The saffron rice could have cooked a little longer. Tasted a bit firm. I did like all of the seafood and the green beans were fresh and crisp however.

I did also get a red sangria ($9) here. It is good, albeit a little pricey. The drink was filled with orange and apple slices. It is a good addition to your meal.

Overall, I like Julian Serrano more than I dislike it. Seemed like the dish that I had was not executed as well as I would have liked. Still the lunch menu here is worth checking out for moderately priced eats.",0,0,1

Unfortunately the second time we visited was not as good. There was a lack of detail to the preparation, which was surprising given how detail oriented Chef Serrano is. Especially after seeing his guest judge role on top chef. After an email to management I come to find out that their executive chef took some liberties to the dishes and
was recently no longer part of the staff.

Fast forward recently, my wife and I went back after management guaranteed a much better experience. First off, Manager Min absolutely took care of us for the day. He apologized for the prior experience and got us our favorite dishes. The octopus and yellowtail were up to par. Unfortunately the creamy risotto was not ""creamy"" enough and a bit too al dente.

I was less enamored with the octopus and potatoes as i found it too greasy and just not noteworthy from a taste perspective. I am a real wine guy and while i am normally a red wine drinker i had to have white due to the fish dishes and i enjoyed the hondarrabi zuri ( by the glass) which is a nice crisp, refreshing wine with enough depth and structure to stand up o these tapas.

Our waitress (Michele) was great as was the rest of the waitstaff.  

Although I wanted to try the paella, the tapas seemed more fun so we went that route.  

We tried: 
Beef and Cheese - To.Die.For.
Shrimp ceviche - Eh.  My husband liked it, I didn't care for it at all.
Chicken croquetas - Yummy!  We joked with our waitress that we wanted to get an order to go.
Pan Manchego - Good
Torjilla - Yummy!
Pinxto chorizo - Good
Something with shrimp but I can't remember the name for the life of me!  I just remember that it was good!

Drinks:
Red Sangria - Soooooo good!  Probably among the best I have ever had.
Margarita

We both loved our meal and we would go back in a heartbeat.  

While we were there, Julian was there!  We saw him walk Penn (of Penn and Teller) out and he was out front a little later and he said bye to me.  Then he showed me the kitchen and taught me how to replicate the tapas at home.  OK, so that last part didn't happen but a girl can dream, right?",0,0,1

The bacon wrapped dates stood out for me with a good balance of sweetness and saltiness.  Even though it's still not as good as the dates from AVEC in Chicago, I can appreciate the good execution.

The scallop was the one disappointing dish.  The taste wasn't bad, but the price to quality ratio was seriously lacking with one lonely scallop.  I definitely felt a lighter wallet with this one dish, but paying a premium for restaurant on the strip is expected.  The tuna cone was almost there, but the super thin won ton didn't quite belong.

We were hovering between going back to Sage for round two or heading over to try Julian Serrano for dinner. My hubby decided, for the sake of Yelp reviews, that we ought to try something we haven't done before. This is even despite the average 3.5 star rating.

So, we checked out the menu and ordered the Valencia Paella, the chicken croquettes, the sauteed spinach, the mushroom soup and the stuffed dates.

The chicken croquettes were singularily unpleasant. Not much chicken inside, the bechamel sauce was bland. So basically, you bit into a croquette filled with bland bechamel... yuck!

The mushroom soup as an odd mushroom underseasoned consumme with foie gras foam (that didn't taste like foie gras). Considering the price you paid for this dish, it clearly doesn't deliver the luxury you are expecting.

The stuffed dates were atrocious - greasy and boring.  You couldn't taste the bacon, just the warmed dates with the crunch of a flavourless blanched almond.

Sauteed spinach with apples, raisins, shallots and pine nuts - sounds really yummy right? Well, it would have been if they'd added a grain of salt to the dish. The spinach was also unappealing on two levels - 1) uneven cooking method (see the pic - some are cooked, some slighty wilted) and 2) not enough oil leads to that filmy sensation feel inside your mouth.

The Valencia Paella was improperly prepared. First of all, the flavours were off for such a dish - perhaps too much saffron. 

Secondly, the rice. Now, I know that the rice is supposed to be al dente. But this was not al dente, my friends. It's considered raw when the rice after chewing leaves a grainy texture in your mouth. Plus, if you look at my pics - no evidence of that wonderfully toasted socrrat layer (no golden brownness to the rice or the bits sticking to the bottom of the pan).

Third, the chorizo was subpar - texturally dry and one note... salty - it could not stand up to the other mediocre components of this dish.

So overall, a 2 starred review - mostly for the excellent service.",14,9,13

I have no complaints with the service which was impeccable! The moment you walk into the restaurant they make sure that your every need is attended to. My mom is allergic to eggs and I appreciated the fact that they made sure that none of the dishes we ordered had any egg in them. Service is 5 stars!

Ambiance is also wonderful! It's cozy yet classy. Price on the other hand not so wonderful, beware it is super duper expensive! It is overpriced by Vegas or NYC standards so, if you're on a budget, this is not the place to be. 

Now on to the food....I found the food to be uninspiring. The brava potatoes which are hard to mess up....were bland and had way too much sauce on them...so disappointing. Stuffed piquillo peppers...full of oil! Arroz vegetariano....alright, but nothing special. The chicken sandwich.....again nothing to write home about. Overall the food was just eh...

What drew me to Julian Serrano were the wild mushroom soup, rib-eye steak, and flan de turr√≥n. For being a tapas restaurant, the portion size was larger than what I was anticipating. The price point was perfect, but the overall dining experience not so much. 

First Course - Wild Mushroom Soup: Nothing wild about the broth and the crimini mushrooms, which was the dominant fungi out of the mushroom medley. However, dip the accompanying slice of toast with foie gras cream spread into the soup, rather than eating it by itself; the broth brings out the foie gras' flavor. 

Second Course - Rib-Eye Steak: Both my steak and my boyfriend's were WARM. Our server apologized and promptly returned our plates to the kitchen where our entrees were re-made. Now, the hot, medium-well version of our steaks were juicy and tender.

Third Course - Flan de Turr√≥n: A pleasant creamy, melt-in-your-mouth dessert. Flan can be incredibly sweet, but this wasn't. 

Regular Menu - Foie Gras: The tiny cut of foie gras was sandwiched in between a small apple cut in two. Although it may have looked appetizing and even cute, it's a shame that the apple wasn't sweet enough to balance the foie gras' rich flavor.

Service - Fantastic. Our server and the managers were on point with addressing our complaint about our warm entrees. My only major criticism: Don't push the standard lunch menu to customers and hide the three-course lunch menu, or in my case the Restaurant Week menu that benefits one of the local charities in town; the menus shouldn't be delivered only upon request. 

Overall -  Not as impressive as I was expecting, but certainly not horrible.",6,2,4

We noticed that a different server brought out each of the dishes, and our drinks were replenished immediately.  (Managers seemed friendly, courteous and comfortable, not uptight and angry-looking like others around the hotel.)  Spanish tapas are quite different from, say, Italian preparations.  So, one should not disparage the Pan Manchego and expect chunky bruschetta.  The Pan Manchego was a perfect start with excellent flavor.  In fact, pretty much everything we ordered was excellent.  The gazpacho came with the vegetables chopped up and elegantly arranged in a bowl, over which the waiter then poured the pur√©ed tomato base (again, not chunky as we might be used to).

It had a white mushroom on the bottom layered with grilled salmon with crispy skin and a black truffle aioli (I think... it doesn't describe much on the menu). 

My mom and dad each ordered the seafood rice from the lunch menu (which offers slightly bigger portions, but medium overall.... definitely not the typical obese American portion). It was also very tasty. It had mussels, big shrimp, calamari rings, peas, onions, and rice. It was texturally a mix between risotto and paella, which they also have on their menu. 

My brother ordered the lunch menu steak sandwich for $14, which came with a gazpacho and french fries. The sandwich was delicious, but the fries were my favorite!

My grandma ordered the lunch menu salmon sandwich with the mixed salad and gazpacho.

Yes they were expensive about $10-$15 a plate but Julian Serrano is the chef so I don't know what people expect and they are small portions but that is what tapas are. Tapas are not meant to be full meals, they are Spanish appetizers. If you are the type who looks for more bang for your buck or does not like to splurge then this would not be the restaurant for you. If it takes alot for you to get full then prepare to spend some money. The prices are clearly marked and the staff does inform you of the portion sizes beforehand so you can always walk if it is not what you want to spend your money on. There are no tricks or surprises. It would be nice to see more reviews about the food then people getting mad about the high prices of the tapas as if someone held a gun to their head and forced them to choose to eat there.Sorry about the rant. now back to the review:

Creamy Risotto - mushrooms and manchego 
Tuna cones (3) 
Lobster salad - ruby red dressing, beautiful, but lacked more contrasting ingredients

Duck salad  - looks more like an oblong scotch egg until you cut into it. Crispy and flavorful, with lightly dressed greens
Baby back ribs

Drinks were solid. I had a tequila and prickly pear puree cocktail that was refreshing and tangy.

The ambience was great but I think that the waiter just didn't recommend the best dishes for us. Everything we ordered on the menu with the waiter's suggestion was mediocre and didn't live up to my expectations. But the ambience and lighting of the place is quite nice. 

Saut√©ed shishito pepper felt overcooked and a bit sweet. The oxtail was too dry. The lobster gazpacho was too thick. And the yellowtail tirado unnecessarily paired with sweet potato haystack (fried) which killed the flavor of yellowtail. 

Everything was just a bit off - either a bit too rich, trying too hard with too much sauce, and not letting the ingredients shine as they should.

I heard much better reviews on Picasso by Serrano - maybe better to pay up to try a different restaurant by him.",4,3,1

The place has a beautiful, colorful ambience. The service was as great as I expected. Our waiter was awesome and informative. We arrived late but he made sure the courses came out quickly enough so we could make the show in time. I asked someone to take a picture of my friend and myself standing up. He took a few. I didn't like them. He later came back to our table and offered to take more. I treated myself to a sangria. It was strong and refreshing. 

Here's the breakdown of our amazing meal. Three course tapas plus bread was filling for 2.

Vegetarian courses 
Stuffed piquillo peppers (goat cheese and mushrooms), divine. Tomato sauce great for dipping the warm bread
Lobster (yes, somehow this counts as vegetarian) Gazpacho - very good. Had a gastronomic element, a sphere of butter with some filling in it. Crack it open and voila!

Seafood courses 
Sauteed gambas (shrimp), garlic, arbol chilis - deliciosa!
Fried crispy gambas with padron pepper and alioli sauce - spicy and yummy! 

Meat courses
Rabo de toro - BEST DISH of the night! Oxtail, iberian pork on top of creamy mashed potatoes. I savored every bite and was silent the whole time eating it. 
Pintxo de chorizos - The only disappointment. I learned I'm not a chorizo fan. It's too dry. My friend liked it though. 

Dessert 
Churros with spicy hot chocolate sauce 
Santiago's cake - almond cake, turron ice cream, candied almond
both were delicious. Nothing like freshly made churros. I love almonds, period.

There are a lot of choices for fine dining in Vegas. I would love to come back for another incredible meal and service. I would love to try their paella and get the fried gambas, rabo de toro and stuffed peppers again.",2,0,0

Our hostess (she was really sweet) recommended the bravo potatoes and tuna cone. She also said that 4-5 plates should be enough to fill us (just 2 people). We ordered those two, plus the garlic chicken, tempura tuna, and fried calamari. 

Bravo Potatoes: 5\/5
GET THEM! My favorite dish. It's delicious, and the sauce it comes on has a good kick to it.

Tuna Cone: 4\/5
If you're a tuna fan, you will love it! Taste may get overwhelming, but the bone balances everything out.

Tempura Tuna: 3\/5
Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of this. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy it, until he realized there was avocado on it (he's slightly allergic).

Garlic Chicken: 3.5\/5
It's good, but nothing memorable. It had 2 pieces of chicken, which was perfect since we had 2 people. I remember there were mushrooms on it...

Fried Calamri: 5\/5
LOVE calarmi. This wasn't an exception. It's a good portion as well. Squeezed the entire lemon all over it. :)

5 star food
-Mushroom risotto- I could've eaten a giant bowl of this. Absolutely PHENOMENAL!
-Garlic chicken thighs-crispy skin on the outside, nice and moist chicken on the inside.

4.5 star food
-Stuffed dates- great play on sweet and salty, just wished there were more than. 3 on the plate. I get the small plates concept, but compared to the huevos, three small dates seems skimpy.

4 star food
-Huevos estrellados- really great flavor, just a little too greasy.
-Iberico sliders- nice sliders, but for the best ham and beef on the market, I wasn't blown away.

3.5 star food
-Lobster salad- GORGEOUS presentation, nice vinaigrette, lobster was slightly overcooked.

We also ordered 3 other things - but my list is already too long. 

Then we ordered the almond cake and bunuelos (little donuts) for dessert.

The bunuelos came with a caramel sauce and our server said they would be good with the chocolate sauce that comes with the churros, so she brought a small bowl of that. It was a spicy chocolate sauce that was awesome!

After wading through the large menu of tasty-sounding things, we ended up with the piquillo peppers (based on our server's enthusiastic recommendation), braised rabbit, and a cheese tray. We rounded everything out with a couple of glasses of verdejo.

Yeah, I know cheese trays are typically kind of boring, but this one was excellent: four cheeses running that soft-to-hard, mild-to-blue-cheesy spectrum with tasty toast points and a bit of fig for good measure. And it was my first time trying rabbit, which was tender, well-seasoned, and perfectly cooked. I'm a fan, it seems. However, the stars of the show were the piquillo peppers, stuffed with creamy goat cheese and topped with a kind of mole-esque tomato sauce. Even my boyfriend (not a huge tomato fan) was in love with this, to the point that he was really excited to try making a tomato and red pepper soup at home to simulate some of the flavors of this dish.

Serrano does a very nice job with service, decor, and ambience. No qualms there.

Their menu is average. They have your typicals like cheese plate, meat plate, patatas bravas, and Spanish tortilla and paellas. There are a few interesting tapas. But nothing that truly jumps at you. However, the tapas we tried were very tasty. I thought the Spanish tortilla was one of the best I've had even compared to Spain. The paellas were also one of the best I have had. We tried there mixed paella and the angel hair one. Both were excellent. 

The price is the main problem. It is completely over priced. It is literally double the price you'd pay normally in the USA and quadruple what you pay in Spain. Although the food is tasty, it's not THAT tasty to make it worth it. 

The alcohol menu is extensive but also completely overpriced. For instance, a bottle of bud light costs $6.50. We did order the sangria for $44 and it was a very good sangria. I'm just not quite sure it's worth it though. Maybe every once in a while?",2,1,0

The two of us had a discussion about what to get, if we wanted a paella (which apparently feeds two but from what we've read, can feed more), or order a few tapas. Wanting to try different food, we ordered a handful of tapas, two sangrias, and a dessert.

For the tapas, we got the sauteed spinach (delicious), grilled eggplant (tasty), black rice (good), octopus (yummy), and a spanish charcuterie plate (also tasty). For dessert, we settled on the Torrija (great way to end the meal).

As mentioned above, all of the food was good. We had an issue with the black rice, in that some of the rice was undercooked and crunchy, and a couple of pieces of the calamari had sand in it. I mentioned this to our server, and he promptly apologized and offered to bring us a new dish. We declined his offer as we both thought the dish was very delicious and we had cleared the whole plate nonetheless. He told us that the feedback would be relayed to the kitchen, and we were satisfied with that.

The price for the meal wasn't horribly expensive for Vegas standards. Both of us left feeling happy and satisfied. The restaurant is also located in the beautiful Aria hotel and resort, so if you're going to visit, head there a bit earlier so you can walk around the lobby.

-creamy risotto was yummy 
- ceviche was excellent
-beef and cheese is a MUST

Had to wait a bit for our table cause we were late for our reservation time, the restaurant was very crowded, even the bar was full, but they gave us a big table for the two of us, so it was worth the wait! We brought our own Veuve Cliquot champagne, they told us three times that they had a corkage fee, we wondered why they kept telling us, it was $35! Steep! 

I still remember the menu, so big it's like a book. The items are very well categorized. Snacks, soups, salads, bread and egg tapas, poultry tapas, hot shellfish tapas, cold and hot seafood tapas, meat tapas, pork tapas and cheese & charcuterie. Also paellas and platos grande for two people, and family size choices of lamb, ribeye or whole roasted suckling pig.... Yikes! But, they also have vegetarian \/ vegan choices, so it's a restaurant for everybody! 

Ordering was easy, told the server what we would have liked to eat, the server recommended some of the popular dishes for us. The portions have definitely increased since our last visit, everything was big! The flavors have gotten stronger, much stronger too, to the point some of the dishes were a little bit too salty for us. So they just can't find a balance point, but it's much better than tiny portions with no flavors if you ask me! 

Tapas:
Yellowtail & tuna cones, fisherman's soup, grilled tuna belly, vegan saut√©ed spinach, lobster with angel hair pasta, ribeye rare plus and spicy pork meatballs. 

Loved tuna cones and lobster angel hair pasta, the lobster and grilled tuna belly were a bit too smoky for me, especially the lobster, but the pasta was amazingly flavorful, it was so good! Hubby loved the ribeye, so tender and rare enough for him. The spinach was too salty, as well as the soup. Spicy pork meatballs were flavorful and very spicy, hubby liked them a lot. 

For desserts we had three flavors of sorbets and creme br√ªl√©e, loved the mandarin orange sorbet, creme br√ªl√©e was heavenly yummy! 

Overall the food was so delicious, the presentations were so beautiful. I had a glass of white sangria, it was very refreshing and tasty. Service was friendly and fairly attentive considering how busy they were. 

Think we will come back whenever we want tapas in Vegas, cause they have many seafood, vegetarian \/ vegan choices on the menu, that's a big YES for me!

Lobster Pineapple Skewers 
Muscles
Traditional Spanish Chicken Croquettes 
Seared Scallop 
Creamy Risotto
Marinated Garlic Chicken and Mushroom Skewers 

Of these dishes that only ones that stood out were the scallops and the muscles but both were tiny and not mind blowing.

Also for a restaurant in Vegas you would think that the service would be great but instead they messed up two of our orders.  Also for a half full restaurant they kept overlooking our table and it took us 20 minutes just to get the check.

We got a pitcher of sangria as well, and with tip, we all only paid $45 a person. To me, that's quite a deal in Vegas, where everything is super inflated.

Honestly, we always thought we'd be hungry after eating tapas, since they tend to be smaller portions. We were definitely wrong about that. Each shareable dish was sooo- rich that each bite was decadent and filling. We loved it here. 

This is what we decided to try:
Tuna Cones - Ahi tuna tartare, crispy wontons, avocado, cucumber and ponzu sauce served in a cone. Some of the best tuna tartare I've ever had!

Short Rib Tapas - Spanish style prime short ribs, cranberry, and beans. Very tender, delicate meat full of flavor.

Seafood Zarzuela - Asian sea bass, shrimp, crab, mussels, calamari. This was served in a thick broth. It had a slight orange tint to it. We wish we had bread so we could've dipped into this wonderful broth even after we finished savoring the sea bass, shrimp, crab, mussels, and calamari. One of our favorite tapas that evening.

Crab black rice - Dungeness crab, blue foot shrimp and calamari. This reminded us of a black rice risotto. It had a buttery texture and flavor and the Dungeness crab was fresh and amazing. This was probably the richest of the tapas that we tasted that evening. 

Spanish Charcuterie - My husband managed to fit this in even after we consumed the above dishes. He substituted this as a ""dessert"" instead of churros or molten chocolate cake. With chorizo and pork loin cuts, I guess you really can't go wrong to polish a meal off with this, or even start a meal this way. I didn't get a chance to try any though because he finished it all before I could. 

As far as drinks go, I had the Agua de Serrano. It's basically like a Serrano margarita. The rim was covered in a sweet sugar sprinkled with some chili pepper. The rim was also decorated with an actual hot pepper which they warned me not to bite into. I headed their advice...this time. It was surprisingly sweet and spicy at the same time. 

Service was great the entire time. At first I was afraid they wouldn't let us in, since we had just come from a cabana day at the pool, but they welcomed us with open arms. Premo was an awesome waiter. He took over for another fella who I could not remember his name, which I regret because he was awesome too. Would I return here? Yes! In a heart beat.

We looked at their menu and weren't sure what to order, we ended up taking the waiter's suggestions.  We ordered:

*Avocado Cannelloni from their New Tapas menu. This dish from what I remember was seaweed with avocado for $14.

*Gambas shrimp from their Ceviches and Seafood menu for $12.  This dish had 4 pieces of sauteed shrimps, garlic and arbol chili.

When we got our dishes, my BF and I looked at each other surprised - our dishes were small and realized this place was an expensive place to eat.  Our food was delish and we loved both; but we walked out starving.

It was an open plan and open to the ""mall"" or whatever you call the Aria lobby. It almost gave off the feeling of a food court. And when you're paying top dollar for tapas, you want an ambiance. But regardless, the sangria was perfect, not too sweet and had the perfect balance of wine and fruit. The lobster gaspacho is so delicious, but I wish the bowl was bigger. With the gaspacho came an egg that may have been dipped in liquid nitrogen. It was exquisite. We also tried the patatas bravas, which were good and pretty much one of the only traditional things on the menu. I also had the tuna cones, which were fantastic and the lobster with molecular pineapple. This was my first experience with molecular gastronomy. I will say it was definitely interesting.

Not sure if it was us that gave the impression that we were in an awful hurry to leave, but the waitstaff did make us feel rushed as we ordered and then proceeded to wait and wait for our order to arrive. It obviously didnt help that we asked to modify our dishes to exclude cheese and dairy, but the end result was more palateable and darn it, after a few experiences so far in vegas with subpar cuisine, see my other reviews to compare, we were not going to put up with much in the way of waiting and to be fair, thus the four stars, i know we were antsy.

Julian Serrano is a great alternative to the multi-course restaurants in Vegas, and here are the reasons that I may revisit the restaurant: 
1) If you are looking for a good place to grab lunch and do not want to wait in line, this is the restaurant for you. 
2) The waiter knows the menu well and points out food for our friends who have dietary restrictions. 
3) The food is simple and arrives on your table quickly. 

However, I have decided to give the restaurant only three stars because of the following reasons:
1) Although the restaurant is not full, it takes a long time before the host takes notice of us.
2) The food is good but not great. Having had the tapas in Purple Pig and Girl and the Goat in Chicago, my friends and I are not impressed with the food at Julian Serrano.

The food you will get here is authentically Spanish. The Paella Valenciana is EXCELLENT, cooked to perfection, with enough ""socarra"" (the burnt stuff on the bottom on the pan) to prove its authenticity. The Brava Potatoes (known as ""patatas bravas"") were done a bit differently than what you would be served in Madrid, but the taste was very similar. The creamy, garlic-y, tomato-y sauce was delicious. The lamb chops are also delicious and cooked to perfection, perfectly medium, with a jus that is salty and savory. Delicious! If you want to splurge on Serrano ham, go for the Pata Negra. It is the best of the best, and though it is very pricey - and portions are quite limited - you'll be able to taste the difference between that and the processed cured hams you get at the supermarket.

While we were waiting we had some drinks and I have to say that I was impressed with the selection of everything they had. My favorite of the night was the Tito's Homemade Vodka. This is the first time I've heard of it and it was excellent on the rocks. 

The big downside to the tapas here is that the portions are relatively small. Since they were so small I can't even begin to get into the number of things we ordered but you can pretty much point to something on the left side of the menu and we had it.

We finished the meal with the Valenciana Paella. The Paellas are made for 2 people (so they say) and we asked that they make one large one for the table.

Food: 3\/5
Atmosphere: 4\/5
Service: 4\/5
Would I return?  Yes

Food:
Although the selection of Tapas seems broad, the majority offer very similar ingredients (fishes, meats, cheeses) in similar patterns.  Having been to Spain I would have liked to seen a broader range.  I didn't see any Spanish style sausage and not much in the range of vegetables.  The food we did have was good.  We shared the tortilla, crab cakes, cheese platter, and something else.  I would have liked for the tortilla to be less runny.  The ingredients were fresh and higher quality.  One thing to note, most of the tapas cost about $10-15 and really are not big enough to share so expect to buy at least 2-3 tapas per person or you can share a paella which is about $50.  IMO this is more of a $$$ restaurant.

Atmosphere: 
Much of the vibrancy of this restaurant has to do with the aesthetics of Aria.  The restaurant itself has great colors and modern styling.  The restaurant gets very loud especially if there is a lot of noise from the casino.  The crowd here tends to be younger and more trendy.

Service:

On our first night a friend of mine who lives in Vegas wanted to show us Aria since it just opened last week. Visually, Aria has, in my opinion, the most beautiful casino on the strip. And inside Aria is where Julian Serrano is.

First off I love the decor and the chairs, which look 70s modern are really comfortable. Usually I'm more of a plain chair to eat dude, but these were something special.

I looked at the beer list at the back of the wine list and also a beer list on the main menu and they were different. Very strange. They didn't have Weihenstephaner like one menu indicated, but Fat Tire was fine. You'll find FT everywhere in Vegas.

The food:

~Dates with almond centers: Good. Weird spicy red sauce to go with them actually melded well with the dates.

~Chicken croquetas: Loved these. Not sure what part was chicken but they were creamy crispy goddesses i'd eat way more of.

~Seared scallops with a peanut sauce: $12 for one scallop. Ouch. But!, it was really awesome. Barely cooked. Some people might not like that but I did. Probably would pass next time because of the high price and small size.

~Flat Calamari (not fried): The most interesting thing I ate in Vegas! I love calamari, but have never had this part of the squid. There were little baby one which you'll see most places, but then they had what look liked the ends of the tentacles. Not sure what part it was but they were fantastic! A must get for the adventurous eater!

When you sit down at a place like this, after not being able to taste the food from your country for months, or even years! little key words stand out. And those words make you very excited. For me, the key words were HAM, CABRALES, TORTILLA and PIMIENTO. 
The fact that I saw all of these key words on the menu was a good sign. Unfortunately it all went downhill from there.
My fiance and I were hungry and excited to eat some spanish food so we ordered a bunch of different things.
We started off with the Jamon Serrano and Spanish Charcuterie. The Jamon was on top of some tomato garlic sauce. It was about as bland as they come. And I mean bland. They served it on top of some garlic tomato sauce which to me, all it does is mask the flavor of the ham. I was really disappointed. 
The Charcuterie was also as bland as the ham. The lomo in that plate had absolutely no flavor. Where are they getting their products from?

Then we got the cheese platter! another key word, CABRALES! I am from Asturias, that is where Cabrales cheese comes from. And I can say this much. That was NOT it. It is a very stinky, spicy blue cheese and what they served us was a creamy bland mess they called cabrales. 

The tortilla....... sucked. Sorry, it sucked. It was so dry..... I almost finished my whole glass of wine with it. That is NOT how tortilla is supposed to be! For one because it sucks with onions in it. It completely overpowers the flavor of the potatoes and egg. But it was so overcooked..... 
I come from a family that makes spanish tortilla on a daily basis. I make it, my mom makes it, my grandma makes it.... and they all turn out glorious. Why is this one so..... meh?

Onto the next...... the Octopus. It was surprisingly good! Nothing bad to say on this one.

The Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were delicious. It gave me a few good ideas to make at home since I have them in my fridge. 

and lastly

The Stuffed Dates. They were very delicious. I don't know how spanish this dish is, because I actually never had it in Spain before, but they were fantastic. 

Overall the restaurant is nice, the atmosphere is trendy and it had a good vibe. I'm sure for someone who isn't used to this type of food, the food will be great. But I did not like it. As a matter of fact, I get upset when the waiter tells me the chef is from Madrid and then they serve me that. Is he really from Madrid? Has he even been there? Does he know what the food looks like there? I'm confused",2,2,0

Cheese Platter - again nothing spectacular. Overpriced in my opinion

Tuna Carpaccio - Simple but DELICIOUS! Served with toasted pine nuts, basil and drizzled with pesto & balsamic. This was the only memorable dish at Julian Serrano.

Examples of bad service:
-16 people and they gave us ONE Menu to share. 
-No one came to check on us or give water when we were first seated for a good 20 minutes. 
-No kidding- waiter had both hands on his hips when my friends asked him about sparking water
-Another friend asked if he can split a plate and he answered "" no and if you have a problem with that go tell my manager""
-The kitchen decided to request our order ( giving us something we did not request) and had the audacity to suggest that this is going to be better tasting than what we had originally ordered.. manager was even ruder when he came out ( our problem was paella takes 45 minutes to cook and we couldn't wait another 45 minutes to remake our food). 

If we weren't pressed for time, we would have left. Funny how we had to pay 18% gratuity for the horrible service",2,0,0

The food came out freakishly fast. I guess that's good if you're not trying to make a night of it but I can see that being a little irritating if you are with friends. 

I ordered the lobster gazpacho. I love gazpacho and this is really one of the best I've had. The lobster really works and isn't overpowering. 

Next I had tuna rice and raspberry concoction. I was pretty skeptical that I'd enjoy this but I was just floored. Probably one of the most memorable things I've eaten in a long while, highly recommend this. The raspberry worked PERFECTLY with the tuna and rice, it was like they were always meant to be together. 

Next I had the white fish ceviche. I was really looking forward to this but I found it a little too salty.  Definitely edible, but not the best ceviche I've had. 

Next had the anchovy on some toasted bread. Very delish. Wolfed it down so fast I can't really remember the details!

Also ordered some olives at this point which were ok if you are into that sort of thing. Nothing new here. 

Finally I had the oxtail and pork with mashed potatoes. Wow!!!  Talk about flavor.  This was just phenomenal in terms of texture and sheer deliciousness.

- Creamy Risotto:  very flavorful but the rice was a tad bit undercooked for our taste. 
  The manchego cheese was definitely a nice touch.
- Monkfish & Pisto: - seared monkfish, eggplant, zucchini, tomato was all very light

- Beef & Cheese: prime tenderloin, cheese, honey, walnuts. we didn't even taste

i got to try the steak tartare, which was kind of weird, but still pretty good. it was more minced than i'd ever had it and more of a tightly packed log. it was kind of weird, and i didn't prefer it, but it was still interesting to try this weird new way of eating steak tartare. it also wasn't as garlicky as i think it normally is, so i actually did like that part.

the main dish we had was the mixed paella, which had lobster, mussels, chicken, chorizo, veggies, and saffron rice. my friend said that the saffron flavor was super heavy and he was really into it. i thought the whole thing was just entirely too salty. i couldn't taste anything else at all. i had never had paella before, since i tend to shy away from rice things, but it was on the dry side and not as gumbo-y as i had imagined. there was also no crispy crusty on the bottom like i had imagined it. but maybe i just imagined it wrong. however, there was plenty of chunks and they definitely didn't skimp on that. the whole lobster tail and claws were on there and there were huge chunks of meats and plenty of mussels.

This meal wasn't a disaster by any means but when you pay these kind of prices, you expect a four or five star experience.

We arrived early for a 5:15pm reservation and were seated prompty. The look of the place (inside the Aria Resort which is part of the City Center complex) is fantastic with some of the best restaurant chairs I've sat in. If you have back problems and are large, you know what I'm talking about. These chairs were generously padded with upper back support.

My partner and I ordered the four-course Signature Tasting menu. I got the wine pairing. The first course was a delightful mixed baby Romaine salad with walnuts, roasted peppers, and Cabrales cheese.  In a sign of things to come, my first wine pairing came while I was in the restroom. It was a full glass of champagne - way too much. I was gulping it but was only a third of the way when the next course came. Also, the pairing was weak - matching champage with a lively, flavorful salad seems lazy.  It simply did not match the inspiration of the salad.

The second course was the standout course - a creamy, wild mushroom risotto. The flavor was intense and earthy. I'd go back just for this course. However, my wine pairing showed up when I was midway through the risotto.  Once again the wine selection was mediocre.  A great wine pairing will play off the flavors of the food. This wine did nothing. Maybe the emphasis on all things Spanish didn't give the somolier enough room to operate.

The third course was where it all crashed. First, my partner received his course first (chicken wrapped around sausage) and was a third of the way through it before I received mine. My first bites of the pork chop were delicious but by the third bite I knew they had seriously overcooked it.  It got drier and drier as I got into it. To get a sense of how dry it was, I had to use a fair amount of force to get my fork into it! At this point, I brought my waiter over to tell her. I continued eating, she brought of the manager over who offered to cook another pork chop or substitute another course. This might make sense if I was eating alone but not with a show to catch or a partner sitting by while I wait for a new entree. This wine pairing was better but I was using anything available (including the leftover champage from the first course) to wash down the pork chop.

The manager came back to ask if there was anything else he could do.  I said no. The manager deducted half the cost of my tasting menu for our tab.  I might go back and try an ala carte\/tapas approach. The reason we select the tasting menus is to allow the chef to showcase the best of what he has to offer. For the prices this restaurant charges, you expect fabulous. What we got instead was decidedly not.",0,0,0

Everything was so delicious and fresh with flavor. The portions turned out to be just right so you could try a little bit of everything and I admit I got two plates of the risotto! The service was impeccable, with waiters left and right, always ready to re-fill your glasses, clear your plates and bring you more dishes. It is a little pricey and I won't mention what our bill total came to, but I definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!!",1,0,1

The service was top notch, from the moment you walk thru the entrance to the wait staff, manager, everyone made you feel welcome. 

The price, OH THE PRICE!   Only complaint I would say.  The entire menu is seriously over priced, even by Las Vegas Strip standards. It's the reason it will not be coming back. There are far better places to go for tapas on the Vegas strip for a better price & value. And important a better selection.

The atmosphere is great!  Plenty of light, open, not stuff. It has a bar area as well. The noise level is on the average. And the place is clean, they did a pretty good job clearing the table as you was done.

The white ceviche was kind of bland- there wasn't enough lime to counteract the seafoody flavor. I thought Bacchanal made the ceviche better.
The creamy risotto with mushroom was pretty good- husband thought it was mediocre though.
The rabo de toro, or oxtail and Iberian pork with mashed potatoes, was surprisingly tasty.
The mixed paella takes around 40 minutes to cook and is HUGE! Contained lobster, mussels, Spanish chorizo, chicken, and saffron rice. I'm sure four people could have comfortably shared it, but we were able to eat everything!

My favorites
- Scallops
- Ahi Tempura
- Asparagus
- Steak
- Lamb Chop
- Chicken Croquetas

Word of Warning
- The plate of peppers is not for those with a sensitive to heat, the same witht he La Bamba Meatballs. WHOA!
- Desert was good but not my favorite. We tried the churros, donut holes and pound cake with the three dipping sauces a spicy chocolate, sweet caramel and a strawberry yogurt blend. Good but nothing to rave about. Stick with the savory items here.

I came here with a group of 6 girls for a bachelorette party dinner, which the bride-to-be generously arranged for the bridesmaids. We had a long night ahead of us and knew we should eat, but didn't want to get too full and uncomfortable in our dresses, so tapas was perfect for the occasion. 

Everything we ordered was truly fabulous! The highlight I would have to say was the paella. Just thinking about it makes me hungry - they cooked a relatively thin layer of seafood infused rice in a traditional paella pan, and the bottom had a perfect crust when it came out. And paella is one of those dishes that are best when a tad (overly) salty with a strong seafood flavor. We ordered one pan and it was so delicious we had to order another one (which proved to be critical later on in the night).

The waitstaff is also very friendly and not pushy at all - he recommended we order a few dishes to start, and to add more later if needed.

Note this restaurant is located inside ARIA in an open space, so the tables are clustered around in the lobby area (it's not an enclosed restaurant, but there is a more concentrated area of tables with more privacy), so people may be walking by as you dine depending on where you're seated.

If you want details here they are:

I should preface this review by saying that I studied abroad in Spain for four months. I lived with a Spanish host family and ate homemade Spanish food 2-3 meals a day. I've had it homemade, in restaurants, in at least 10 different Spanish cities and in America. I can be very picky about Spanish food and on the whole find the current tapas craze to be slightly annoying; don't get me started on over-priced, fussy restaurants calling themselves ""tapas bars.""

The menu at Julian Serrano can be divided into two groups: traditional Spanish food and contemporary Spanish inspired gastronomy in the mold of elBulli or Bazaar - but certainly not in their price range. The traditional dishes are delicious and 100% authentic. Each bite made me made me more nostalgic for Spain. The contemporary dishes are inventive and playful.
 
As a tapas bar you are encouraged to try everything that piques your interest, so I tasted a lot of dishes. I'll list them by rating on the customary yelp 5 star scale. Foreshadowing: most are 5s.


5 stars:
Sangria - Excellent. It's so hard to find well-made sangria outside Spain. You need to use an intense, acidic Spanish wine. Most sangria is doomed from the start because people pick wine that is already sweet and fruity. Serrano got it perfect: earthy, slightly sour, not overly sweet, completely refreshing.
Patatas Bravas
Stuffed Piquillo Peppers
White Ceviche
Tortilla - It is my opinion that a Spanish restaurant's tortilla can tell you everything you need to know about the restaurant. Serrano's tortilla is excellent.
Tuna Tiradito - Ahi with ponzu and seaweed. Far from Spanish but still amazing.
Beef and Cheese
Stuffed Dates
Deconstructed seafood soup - Ask when you go. Your waiter will be happy to explain the dish and its ""deconstruction.""
Churros con chocolate - I'm certain this dish is incredibly high in fat, sugar, and fat again. I'm also certain that it is totally worth it.

4 stars
Lobster Pineapple Skewers
Pan Manchengo


3 stars
Paella Marinera - Good but not excellent. Considering how delicious the tapas were I wish we had ordered more tapas and gone without paella.
Olives - The only thing left on the table. I was sad because I LOVE olives and Spanish olives are some of the best in the world. These were marinated with some spices I wasn't able to identify. I like them plain.
Almond cake with turron ice cream - Hi, my name is Jay and I'm a recovering turron ice cream ADDICT. When I lived in Spain I would sometimes eat it twice a day. I was excited to get my fix again but found Serrano's version to be lacking in intensity.

The service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, helpful, and talkative without being intrusive. When we wanted to order more tapas all we had to do was look up and someone was ready to take our order. Not one minute after realizing I had nowhere to put my ahi without getting salsa brava on it, our plates were changed. My only complaint was that the waiter asked if we wanted more sangria\/desserts\/coffee several times, even after we had ordered them. It was a minor annoyance in an otherwise perfect performance from the wait staff.

The atmosphere is more casual than I expected. The hostess said shorts and a T shirt were fine, but I dressed up slightly anyway. Other diners' attire ranged from jeans to suits. Like most of the dishes the d√©cor is simple and beautiful. Colored mosaic-style tiles cover the walls. The space is very open; the restaurant is separated from the casino by waist-high glass panels. I was afraid noise from the casino would be a problem but once we were seated I didn't even notice the casino.

My only serious complaints were regarding the wine list. Their prices seemed high, even by fine dining standards. The wine list isn't available online - although the menu is - and when I asked if they could email it to me they said I'd have to email the sommelier and that he doesn't like sending it out.

The prices for food are very reasonable, almost cheap by Vegas standards. Paella, 12 tapas, a pitcher of sangria (about 8 glasses), 2 desserts, tax, and tip was 268. I tipped 20% - the wait staff had certainly earned it. The amount of food was sufficient for 4 guys with large appetites. Most parties of 4 would probably have thought the amount of food we ordered indecent.

If you've read this far you clearly are giving a lot of thought to your Vegas dining options. If so, you're the kind of person who will love this restaurant. Go!",2,0,0

Be sure to be seated in the back, as it is more private and plush.  The seating infront of the bar at the front of the restaurant feels like you are eating in the casino and you are on display to everyone walking by.

The cocktails are well conceived, though the pear ginger julip, which sounded great, was very sweet.  Serving it in a taller glass with more ice or adding a splash of club soda would make it perfect.  I later switched to the red sangria, which was much better and half the price.

I must have sampled a dozen tapas plates, most of them based on the waitor's recommendation (our waitor Stefan was great server and very accomodating), and almost all of them were very good.  The only let down was the beef filet which was a bit tough and over done and needed more seasoning.

So... why 3 stars only this time???  I'm gonna throw the reservation peeps under the bus here... Early last week I called the direct restaurant line (not the general MGM dining reservation line) to speak with someone at the restaurant to reserve a special table (one of the cool ""penninsula"" tables right by the kitchen) for a special birthday celebration on the subsequent Friday. 

I called at an off hours to ensure that I could explain to the person that I really wanted this particular table blah blah.  To make a long story short, I explained everything and was assured that that table was booked for me at 7:30 that Friday, and received my confirmation code and was so excited for the special birthday meal to come... 

Well, Io and behold we arrived at the designated time that Friday all ready to celebrate and they had screwed up the reservation (had booked us instead at 6pm) so of course, no available kitchen-view table for us :(

Sigh... So our special evening was celebrated at at tiny table w\/ no view of anything at the way back of the restaurant.  The saving grace was absolutely *excellent* service by our super-friendly waitperson (Ernest) and the always amazing food ~ esp. the anchovies on toast, the white ceviche and and a drop-dead delicious mushroom risotto.

Moral of the story: CONFIRM your reservation the day before to ensure that it has not been screwed up, especially if it is a special occasion evening.",0,0,0

Straying away from burgers and buffets, I decided to try out Julian Serrano and if you're looking for some latin spice, this is definitely a place to check out.

The Place -
Julian Serrano is located inside the Aria and very easy to find. Located on the first floor next to the check-in area of the Aria, Julian Serrano is known for it's latin inspired menu with an upscale twist. The place itself is very open and by, no means, in a separate building or room. The restaurant blends very seamlessly with the main lobby of the hotel and can attract many guests as this is something they see first upon entering the Aria. The place is bright and, obviously, has a lot of latin-inspired decor. The bar is a VERY good size as it seems to wrap around the entire entry way. In addition to that, the restaurant itself has a very decent sized real estate being able to accommodate parties of any sizes. As with a lot of restaurants in Vegas, depending on where you are seated, people have a good few of the back of the house as well, which is always comforting knowing you can see the people handling and cooking the food. Not to mention, it's just always bad a$$ to see the chefs conjuring up everyone's dishes. Very nice place to come and relax for a few drinks or casually dine before hitting up all the various night clubs Vegas has to offer.
**** 4\/5 Stars ****

The Service -
It was a Friday night and I was struggling to find a place to go eat at. I was in town for a conference and it was the night before I was scheduled to fly back so I knew I didn't wanna stay out late or walk any place farther than I needed to. After perusing through the many options on Yelp and the dining guide, I settled on Julian Serrano. It was fairly early in the evening, around 5:30pm-6:00pm, so I managed to beat the dinner crowd. They had also just opened for dinner service so I lucked out and was able to walk right on in and pick my place at the bar. I was greeted by multiple friendly faces at the hostess stand one of which was the hostess herself as well as, what seemed to be, upper management preparing for the evening. The hostess smiled and politely let me know that the bar was available for open seating. I gladly obliged, took my seat, and was promptly greeted by the bartenders tending bar that evening. They took my drink order, handed me a menu, and gave me a few minutes to browse. The bartenders were very friendly and made themselves available to answer any and all questions I may have had about the place and\/or the menu. The great service continued throughout the evening making sure that I was well taken care of and I always had a full glass in front of me. Great job, guys and thanks!
***** 5\/5 Stars *****

The Food -
Prior to arriving at Julian Serrano, I glanced at the menu, as I always do, trying to figure out what would be appetizing for me to order. I decided on the short ribs dish; however, when I got there and looked at the menu more, I switched my choice and, instead, got the Crispy Baked Chicken (See Picture) and I'm glad I did. First, the accoutrements...the chicken was served with sauteed potatoes, Spanish pork chorizo, red bell peppers, and onions. The chorizo gave an excellent salty contrast to the chicken and I couldn't get enough of it. I wish they would've put more of it on there cause it was just that good. The bell peppers and onions were cooked throughout and gave the dish the bitterness and spice that it needed to balance everything out. The potatoes, unfortunately, left something to be desired. I'm not sure if it just happened to be the potatoes I was served, but they tasted really bland and stale to me and got to the point where I just ended up pushing a majority of them to the side. If it weren't for the deliciousness of everything else and combining the flavors, more of those potatoes would not have been eaten. Now, on to the main star of the dish...the crispy baked chicken. This has got to be, by far, one of the best baked chicken dishes I've had ever! The chicken, which are two boneless breasts, was cooked perfectly and very moist. The crispy breading that they coat it in, didn't just have a crunch to it, but also had a caramelized effect to it, which made it REALLY good. I'm glad I switched my choice from the short ribs to the chicken and I only want to come back for more and to try out the other dishes that Julian Serrano has to offer. Delicious!

Overall -

- Brava potatoes - spicy tomato, aioli sauce
- Creamy risotto - wild mushrooms, aged manchego cheese
- Tuna cones - ahi tartare, cucumber, crispy won ton, avocado, ponzu
- Lobster fideuna - angel hair pasta, half lobster tail, roasted red pepper
- ""Bomba"" - veal tenderloin and pork tenderloin, spicy meat ball, spicy rocoto sauce

The restaurant itself was packed, mainly due a convention that was being held at the same time.  It's also very loud, so it can be difficult to converse.  Service was excellent (possibly because we ordered a LOT of food as well as a bottle of wine and alcohol).  We ordered over 20 items, including almost every dessert on the menu, some more than once to feed our large group.  I have no idea what the bill cost, but I'm sure it would have been over $50 pp.  

The food itself was nothing special - I've had much better tapas here in LA at various places.  I'll only gloss over the highlights.  I read that the chicken croquettes were to die for, but I found them to be simply good but something that wouldn't generally stand out.  The stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were excellent (though I must point out that it's difficult to get this dish wrong), the creamy risotto was super delicious, the scallops were good, the pan manchego was tasty, the peppers were a favorite of others, and out of all the desserts, the Spanish creme brulee was the best (unfortunately I have no picture of it, but it was larger than most creme brulees).  Again, most of the other dishes were average and nothing to write home about.  Oh, and the Sangria is delicious and sweet - they add some liquor to it (rum I think but I'm not sure) so it doesn't have a strong wine taste to it.

There's definitely better restaurants on the strip, though this was my first experience in Vegas eating tapas.  I'd say the tapas run on the more expensive side (most are $8 - $16, some up to $30), and we had to order a lot to get full.",1,0,0

All of the tapas were excellent, but the paella was HORRIBLE.  Skip the paella and you will be satisfied.  It is a tapas restaurant so be aware that the dishes are small.  The restaurant is in the Aria and the restaurant is just as cool as the hotel.  A good place for a glass of wine and a few tapas.

Food dishes
Bacalao a la gabardina (atlantic cod | rocoto mayo | tempura batter)
The fish was light and fluffy and the batter was very delicate.  An excellent dish. 10\/10

Saut√©ed baby spinach (pine nuts | raisins | apple | shallots)
The pine nuts, raisins and apple added some interesting flavors and textures to the dish.  A good dish.  7\/10

Escalivada (eggplant | red pepper | tomato | onion)
I'm not a big fan of eggplant, but this one was pretty good.  The others at the table liked the dish.  8\/10

Creamy risotto (wild mushroom | manchego cheese | natural jus)
The risotto was cooked just right.  The flavor was excellent.  I thought I tasted truffle oil too.  9\/10

Pintxo de moruno (marinated pork loin | pancetta | toasted cous cous)
This dish had 4 pieces of pork on a skewer.  The pork was cooked just right and it had lots of flavor.  An excellent dish. 10\/10

Pintxo de chorizos (mini spanish pork chorizo | garlic mashed potatoes | garlic sauce)
There were 5 small pieces of sausage.  The sausage had a hint of spiciness.  8\/10

Paella Marinea (calamari | shrimp | mussels | monkfish | vegetables | saffron rice)
This was a HUGE disappointment.  The rice was not cooked right.  It was hard and it was not creamy.  The seafood was ok, but it didn't really add a good tasting flavor to the paella.  How bad was it?  I would rather eat Top Ramen than have this dish again.  1\/10

The tapas were tasty and the service was attentive but I wasn't left with an overwhelming sense of desire to come back. 

We were staying at Aria and wanted a bite but without reservations there was a wait so we grabbed seats at the the bar. 

The stuffed dates lacked the little crunch you expect with cooked bacon. The meat seemed a little under done.

The ribeye was a disappointment. It wasn't served warm, it was served with four slices of overwhelmingly fatty pieces of meat. The potatoes it's served with were delicious. 

The pan manchengo was simple enough, toast with garlic tomato spread and slices of cheese. The price seemed like a stretch for such a simple dish. 

The churros and spicy Mexican chocolate sauce were enjoyable but the churros seemed overcooked. They had a snap like a chip and not like your usual churro with a softer center. The sauce was drinkable though. Absolutely perfect with deeps of rich chocolate and just a small about of heat.

We did not make a reservation and we lucky to get seated right away, it was a pretty late dinner as well. The inside is very nice. Lots of bright lighting, outside seating, and very open. I would say casual dressy, but we were all pretty casual. It is a Spanish tapas style restaurant so everything would be shareable and our waiter mentioned about 2-3 plates each. We were a table of 5 girls. The menu is pretty big and overwhelming, so it took us awhile to decided what to get. 

_Lobster Salad ($18) Lobster meat | corn | tomatoes | avocado | country baguette. This sounded pretty good but the way it came out was not what I imagine. It was listed under salad, so I expected a big salad, with lobster and a side of country bread. Instead it came out as a tiny side salad and a small half of the baguette that was extra toasted with some tiny bits of lobster on top, of what seems to be avocado toast. I get tapas, but this was almost a joke. The side salad was just a few greens, you would get a better salad if you went to Panera bread and ordered a 1\/2 sandwich, 1\/2 salad dish. The lobster was good but nothing amazing. Rewind the overall dish was just bland, nothing amazing or memorable, and for the price point I could have easily made this myself. 
_Ensalada Mixta Salad ($12) Mix greens | tomato | cucumber | onion | olive | egg.A simple salad but pretty good in overall flavor. Again nothing amzing, just a simple salad, but I loved all the ingredients above and the dressing was a tad sweet and citrusy.
_Tuna Cones ($16, comes in 6 cones) Ahi tartare | cucumber | crispy won ton | avocado | ponzu. This was pretty good. The won ton cones were thin and crisp. The tuna was fresh and covered in some sauce, that seemed a bit like spicy mayo. The avocado is on the bottom, so you don't get that till the last 2 bites. This was a bit spicy as I was not expecting it, so which is was on the menu to give me a heads up. 
_Bronzino Donostiarra ($19) Mediterranean sea bass | tapenade | tomato confit. The Branzino was fresh flaky. It was well seasoned and the crispy skin have it extra texture and saltiness. The tapenade, gave this light fish some extra flavor and depth. A very light dish and can be a bit forgetful if everything else you order is heavier in flavor and richness. 
_Grilled New York ($19) Piquillo confit | mushroom demi | potato puree. This was good. The steak was nicely cooked, although I wish it could have been more tender. The potato puree was silky and the sauce was sweet, salty and paired well with the steak and potato. Pretty standard nothing to rave home about.
_Serrano Tender ($33) Foie gras | prime tenderloin | white chocolate bread. This was the most memorable dish. I loved the presentation, it had a toothpick on top of the meat that read M.Rare, which I thought was cute and clever. The tenderloin was well cooked and seasoned and the foe gras was just perfect. On it's own I find it gamey and rich but a little bite of the foie, with the tenderloin and bread was the perfect bite. Full of flavor and depth, it was dish that was just right for the size. The white bread was great, as you can taste the hints of white chocolate, it was like dessert. 
_Rabo de Toro ($18) Red wine braised oxtail | iberian pork | potato puree. This was another great dish. The oxtail was tender and juicy. The potato puree was whipped nicely and together with the sauce made it a very well balanced dish with a feeling of comfort and satisfaction. 
_Paella Serano ($50) Morcilla spanish sausage | iberico ribs | saffron | baby kale. Allow upto 45-60 minutes to prepare. The portion is for 2 people per say but it was more than enough to feed our whole table of 5 gals, plus with all the tapas above. They charge more if you want to make it a bigger serving. I found this just okay. Damn can it really be this hard to find a good paella?! The sausage was decent, no wow factor. It was soft in texture and a bit salty. The ribs were not that great. So fatty and oily I can barely taste or see any meat, all just fat. The rice was well cooked and I loved the taste of saffron. But the overall dish was very oily! I could see all the oil in my plate and everything just felt heavy. 

Overall for the price point I expected way more. Nothing really stood out and all seemed a bit flat. I would recommend checking it out if you are staying at the hotel, but don't expect too much.",11,5,5

Stuffed dates have pancetta with its wholesome self crisped around it. The gin cocktail with pureed apples and thyme, perfect. Short ribs a bit tough, lime sweet potatoes were delicious. Seabass was executed nicely... great flavors, perfectly crispy skin. Make sure you ask for your temperature on the sliders, ours came it well. Manager was great and gracious enough to attend time with us and explain everything. Our server on the other hand, not attentive. He did not have suggestions, didn't know the menu, spoke way to quiet, and stood around across the room most of the night. Nice kid but not up to par to serve at a complex strip restaurant.  Bussers and management were at our table 98 %. I would come back hopefully service is better.  Prices are a bit high but i knew and expected that. 3 1\/2 stars.",0,0,0

I love how it was family style plates where we can all share, I didn't think it was going to be enough food at first but the plates kept coming and we were so stuffed by the end of it. We couldn't leave without dessert and the churros hit the spot. Everything was presented beautifully and each plate was exploding with flavor.",0,0,0

First day I. Am alone for lunch and the staff Adrian,is very friendly and accommodation that heaven suggest that I should try their black rice.Wham!Yummy!

Today is my 5th Dine here!


Strongly suggest this.

We went for dinner (tapas), and everything was phenomenal!  The stuffed dates are so tasty (sweet, crunchy, and salty all at the same time ... and fried to boot!), the fried piquillo peppers were just sooooo good, we wolfed down the whole plate!  The bacalao croquettes (a special) were the most airy and tasty we've had in years, and the deconstructed mediterranean seafood stew was absolutely sublime!  And of course, the Pata Negra Jamon Iberico - well, if you know Pata Negra, enough said!   Pair all that with an outstanding bottle of Alion Ribera del Duero and you have the makings of one fantastic dinner!

 Our only dings: the coco chorizo was a disappointment, and they didn't serve bread on the table.  But, hey, who bats 1000?

The service was very good, eventhough it was quite busy, and our sommelier was especially helpful and friendly.

If you like Spanish food (heck, if you like food), do yourself a favor and visit Julian Serrano ... but be sure to have your credit card ready!",0,0,0

I must say this was probably the highlight food wise the entire trip. There was a big group of us (probably 15 or so total), we already had a table waiting for us so were seated quickly. The service first off was excellent, again we were a large group. Had some yummy sangria to start and then got down to business. A couple other people in our party did the ordering so I don't even know all the different items we tried but we did have a good variety. 

The standouts for me were beef and cheese, pintxo de chorizos, stuffed dates, cheese platter, and conejo al ajillo. Hands down the beef tenderloin with the cheese, honey and pecans was the best thing i ate on the entire trip. I normally am not a red meat person, but this was amazing. It was cooked perfectly, was so tender and the flavors just allowed it all to melt in your mouth. I probably could've sat there all day and just ate that one dish. For dessert we had arroz con leche de coco, santiago's cake, flan, churros and bu√±uelos. The arroz con leche was probably my favorite and allowed for a perfect way to end a  delicious meal

If you're in Vegas and want to try something new (even though it's pricey but heck you're in Vegas) I recommend going to Aria and dining at Julian Serrano's, you will not be disappointed.",2,0,1

We had a really hard time deciding on what to get because so many things on the menu sounded good.  We had the white anchovy fillets, served on toast.  Not my favorite anchovies I have ever had, but super solid.  The fried calamari was very good calamari, but wasn't anything that unique.  The scallops were perfect, great texture, fresh with a good balance of flavor.  The grilled lamb chop was probably our favorite, tender and flavorful.
