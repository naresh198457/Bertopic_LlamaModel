Service was fantastic.  To start, we had the deviled eggs and sliders.  I had both dishes before, and they didn't disappoint.  One guy proclaimed the sliders the best burger he had eaten.  They are perfect in composition and execution, you get every ingredient in every bite.  They are consistent as well.  Our table ordered a second helping....

To eat, I had fish and chips and part of the short rib\/beef cheek sandwich.  The sandwich was legit, had a little spice to it, and the meats were very tender.  Likewise, the fish and chips were fantastic, although the fries are a little thick for my taste.  I realize this is classic for this dish, I just prefer skinnier fries.  The fish and chips may seem expensive at around $26, but you get a LOT of food.  Very large pieces of fish, and the breading can stand up to vinegar or the homemade tartar sauce.  Both entrees are definite repeats.

For dessert, I recommended the sticky toffee pudding.  This is the 2nd time I've had it (we ordered 2 servings, like with the sliders), and I still say it may be the best dessert I've eaten.  We had people eating the caramel sauce out of the small pitcher it comes in.  This dessert is moist, yet a little crunchy.  The ice cream and sauce complement it very well.  A must order.

Good beer selection, and knowledgeable servers.  This is an excellent place to get a casual bite while at Caesars.",5,1,0

I was extremely looking forward to trying my first Ramsay restaurant and left disappointed. I've watched every season of MasterChef\/MasterChef Junior and Hell's Kitchen, so I feel like Gordon has subconsciously trained me to know how a decent meal is cooked. Unfortunately, my 1st negative YELP review goes to the fish n chips entrée. I remember him on a MasterChef season yelling at a contestant for putting steamy, hot food over fries. Why? Because it makes a soggy mess on the bottom of the fish batter and soggy fries on top. Also, the batter was way too heavy that I scooped out the cod which ended up to be terribly seasoned and bland. Our waiter says that this entrée is the most requested..really?! I know he just opened up a fish n chips restaurant, and I hope it's a lot better than what I ordered. 

However, my mother ordered the Shepard's Pie which she thoroughly enjoyed. I did appreciate the kind hosts in the front and our waiter who was very friendly and engaging. 

Please make sure that soggy fish and chips doesn't get through the pass..you might disappoint more Ramsay fans other than me. Chef Kristin from Hell's Kitchen was my all time FAV, so it might have been just an off day. I'm just pretty bummed that I'm heading back to LA not raving about this place to my friends.",0,1,1

I checked out Pub on Thursday for my first Gordon Ramsey dining experience.  We sat down and had Heather as our waitress (and she was amazing!) I asked about Hells Kitchen and Heather told me that one of the former contestants worked there and was there working that night.  Heather went above and beyond and arranged for us to meet Kristin (how cool!!) Kristin comes out to the table and talks to us for a bit and then takes pictures with us!  Everyone was so amazing and helpful all night. 

I didn't even mention the food and drinks yet! So there were four of us there and we weren't super hungry so we decided to go for a few different shared plates.  We started out with the nachos - I was thinking ""how good can nachos be, and what kind of special twist can you put on nachos..."" But at Pub they were amazing - the chips were a different twist and really brought it all together!  Then we had the pigs and a blanket which were hands down the best pigs and a blanket I've ever had!  I want to talk about all of the food I had but it was all just to amazing!

At the very least they could give a reasonable staff discount so that customers looking for an opinion about the specialty of the house could get one from the ""presumed"" expert who is standing at their table.

My burger was fine.  Everything with Gordon is a ""stunning"" hamburger.  Mine was good....  Not great....  I wasn't stunned.

Ketchup was probably the best part of the meal.... honestly.  In fairness it was pretty special ketchup though.

I say Vegas standards, because, in my opinion, you can be more discerning here. There are just so many fantastic restaurants here, and they're all pretty much walking distance from one another.

I've been here twice now. This last time, I was here for a convention, and actually favored going to Mesa Grill, however, the wait was ridiculous, so Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill it was.

I digress, onto the food.

I've had their grilled beef burger as well as their grilled lamb burger. My issue with their burgers is mostly their bun. It could stand being a bit more fresh. It's on the drier, crumbly side. Maybe people just don't order enough burgers here, so their bread doesn't move as fast? For a burger at the $20 mark, it should pretty much be flawless. Their fries are good, and the patties themselves are great.

For a much, much better overall burger, go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR, located inside Planet Hollywood.

Service is spot on, and the interior looks great.

I had the fish and chips, which was quite substantial. I didn't even finish it. I was leery of the ""mushy peas"" it came with but they were quite good! The crispy fish portions were huge! At $30, it was very tasty but a tad overpriced.

Somewhat disappoint that the sparkling wine listed on the menu was not the one they were pouring...it was Chateau Ste. Michele, which is a good value but only about $8.00 at CVS and naturally it was $8.00 a glass here.  However, the bartender was cool and topped me off a few times free of charge, but I did order 3 glasses...I would have been smarter buying the bottle from the beginning.  Like I said I don't gamble, and expected my guest to turn up definitely by the time I was on drink #2...sadly they showed up when I completed glass #3 and was about to order #4...however, thankfully, husband intervened and comforted me that we have several bottle of this in our ""everyday"" wine stock.

Staying in Vegas, it is necessary to try a famous chef's restaurant and this was the perfect Vegas meal.
We were staying at Caesars and were not wanting to travel far and this was perfect for our casual attire.
We were in comfortable booth that was great for lounging and drinking. 
The little details from the union jack logo, wooden menu, keg wall, and many other things really made this place great. 
Starting Vegas off with a Boddington Pub Ale that Ramsay has on tap. This is one of the smoothest beers I've had in a can and having it on tap was delicious! 
We started by ordering the scotch eggs and soft pretzel sticks(may be under a different name) that were inhaled so fast I was unable to get a picture.
The scotch eggs are breaded soft boiled eggs with sausage with a mustard cream sauce. These were perfect for the table. 
The pretzel rods come with a spicy mustard and a cheese sauce that you will want to lick clean. 
I ordered the Sheperd's Pie which is one of my all time favorite dishes. The beef in this dish seemed to be inconsistently seasoned but the areas that were tasted amazing. It also comes with a small kale salad and pretzel rod. 
My boyfriend ordered the Dublin Corned Beef Brisket Sandwich that comes with homemade chips. I am not a fan of corned beef but this tasted good to me. Its not a traditional Texas brisket like what were used to back home which caused some confusion but it was devoured. 
My cousin ordered the fish and chips and I have to say this was the best item of the table. The fish was light and with the malt vinegar it was incredible. The ""chips""\/fries that came with it were slowly being stolen from him plate as these tasted incredible also. The only thing that was odd was the peas that were served had mint in them which may be an authentic British thing but was not my favorite. 
Now the best part was as being a part of the Yelp family, when you check into this restaurant, you get a coupon for a free Sticky Toffee Pudding. It is served with a cookie butter ice cream. This is RICH but I think one of the top sticky toffee puddings I have had. This was split between 5 at the table and everyone had a hefty portion.
This is the perfect place to grab a beer, great food, and sticky toffee pudding! Highly Recommend.",2,0,1

Overall, the place wasn't bad, but it wasn't wowing. I actually came here twice. Once for a business dinner, which was good food and great service. We had reservations and were promptly seated. The waiters had interesting uniforms, especially the very well supporting women's dresses. We ended up having 5 instead of 4 halfway through our meal and were very pleased with the flexibility of the staff considering the stature of the restaurant and their relatively business and newness. Props to them for being extremely considerate.

The food was good, for being British. Admittedly, my opinion of British food has never been good or bad. Just mediocre. Gordon Ramsay's name on it makes me have naturally higher expectations. As expected, the menu is relatively small, but very selective.

Since I had higher expectations, I can tell you that the food was good, but I wouldn't say it was amazing. I enjoyed eating here and so did all of the other people that came with me. We had a full course of appetizers, followed by entrees, and desserts.

So, I managed to get a full compliment of what the restaurant had to offer. After this visit, I went back with a few buddies after gambling at Caesar's and we just wanted to get drinks at the bar but they were 'too busy' to seat us so we actually stood at the bar waiting for somewhere to sit. We even had a waitress try to get one of the hostesses to seat us in one of the obviously empty tables, but they refused saying that they were booked. Needless to say, this part of my experience was a bit offsetting. In addition to that, we bartenders were a bit hissy when it came to asking to close the tab, which we found a bit odd. They seemed less than concerned to help us pay them.

Overall, I would say my experience was pretty good and that I would come back, just not for the bar. Only for food\/drinks if I have a reservation. Oh, and I loved the Corgi chair that I had been sitting in. I'll post a picture later.",1,0,1

We're staying in Nobu and wanted lunch after getting into Vegas; this place is super conveniently located, and you can walk straight out and gamble. 

We got here at around 2:30pm and were seated immediately. It took our waiter, Michael, about 10 minutes to come introduce himself, and while the restaurant was busy, it was far from packed. We wanted to do a preemptive strike against the long night ahead, and ordered waters, which was when our waiter seemed to ""size"" us up. We're a mid-twenties couple, which in LA doesn't really have any bearing on the service we receive, but Michael definitely treated us differently from the older patrons around us. 

We decided to start with some of the happy hour appetizers, and went with the pub nachos and hellfire wings. Both were AMAZING, and I would gladly come back for them. The pub nachos were a surprisingly large portion, and everything was fresh and cheesy and flavorful, without being greasy or too heavy, a surprising feat for kettle potato chips, pub cheese, and a ton of brisket. The wings were some of the best I've ever had; I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese, but the blue cheese sauce served with them was divine and the sauce they were tossed in was wonderful. Easily 5\/5 on both of those. When we ordered these, though, our waiter took our menus and almost sprinted away, never asking if we were going to order more or not. 

Our waiter didn't drop our appetizers himself, and he didn't come to check on us a single time while we were eating. We were planning to order more food, and my husband had to flag him down after about 20 minutes of him walking by us constantly, standing at the bar, and talking to other patrons. It was so blatant it was almost comical, except for the fact that we were paying customers. 

When we finally got his attention, we ordered the steak and ale pie to split. It came out piping hot (literally), and was delicious. The ale came through in the savory broth, which was loaded with steak and fresh mushrooms, and the crust was crispy, soft heaven. 


Again, our waiter never came to check on us while we were eating and didn't drop the food himself. After about 20 more minutes he brought us dessert menus, since we apparently now seemed like people who came to a restaurant to order food, but I was so annoyed at this point I was ready to leave. 

This waiter was not in the weeds, the restaurant didn't have a wait, and I watched him provide basic service to other tables. I don't know if it's our age or what, but being ignored isn't something I typically pay for. I tipped him 15%, very low for us, and I maintain I would've been better taking that money to the roulette table. The food will bring us back, but we'll likely get it to-go.",1,0,0

 I believe our Server was Elise. She was amazing. 

We saw they had mac and cheese on the menu up front however it was not on the menu we were given. So we asked and were brought the pub menu as well. We both ordered beers they were great.  We then ordered out Mac and Cheese and were going to share the truffle chips (fries). Our Mac and Cheese came out before our appetizer.  We asked about it and then just told them never mind. The Mac and Cheese was Damn  good.  They ended up bringing the truffle fries. They were very good, however the dipping sauces were not very good. 

Back to the Service. OMG Elise she was great. She was joking with us and made our dinner out a wonderful experience. She made a real connection with us. Would recommend her to anyone...

The ambiance is upscale pub. Overall, it's got a nice vibe.

The beer list didn't do much for me as there wasn't anything particularly notable. But all the standard ones you'd expect at a pub are there.

We ordered the calamari, fish and chips, English ale onion soup, and lobster mac 'n' cheese. Our server somehow forgot the lobster mac 'n' cheese and brought us fries instead. She promptly fixed the error, leaving the fries and putting in an order for the lobster mac 'n' cheese. But then she added the fries to our bill! Seriously. 

The calamari was alright. Good enough to eat when you're hungry. Not good enough to ever order again. The fish and chips were good. They're fish and chips - nothing particularly notable, but the fish was battered and fried well. The English ale soup was quite tasty and the best thing of the night. The fries were alright.

In my case, I happened to stop in on my last day in town before getting on the road back to Los Angeles.  The bartenders were great, extremely friendly and very prompt when service was needed.

For food we ordered the Truffle Fries ($5) and Nachos ($7).  On the fence about the wings, we were proposed to give the wings a shot and if we didn't like them, we would not be charged for them.  Swayed, we gave them a shot.  Despite the name, they were not breathtakingly spicy.  They did have a tinge of Asian-style sweetness, but all-in-all were pretty good.  The nachos came with a good chunk of meet on top of potato chips.  A little different, more British style, but all around pretty good.  The truffle fries I was quite excited for given that I saw pictures of thick planks of fries on Yelp.  Unfortunately, they were the thin variation, not much different from fries you could get anywhere.  The aioli was good, but I was unimpressed by the fries, especially for $5.

Perhaps there are some disillusioned expectations due to his status as a celebrity chef. Or maybe people are just pickier on the Strip ;)

We went with one of the fixed menu options.

Soup - Cream of Cauliflower. This was excellent. And I say that as some one who normally abhors cauliflower.  The curry oil was a wonderful, warm touch.

Fish and Chips - The batter was delicious and the portion of fish was generous. More then enough food on the plate, I was pleasantly surprised. The chips were some of the best I have ever had. Fresh potatoes and the shaved cheese was super flavorful

Shepherd's Pie - My husband ordered this but of course I had to sneak a bite. Smooth, creamy potatoes. The meat was tender and the vegetables still had a nice flavor to them that was not covered up by the broth from the meat. I am not normally a fan of lamb but this was pretty dang good!

Dessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding. This was my first time trying sticky toffee pudding but I am now a converted fan. I wanted to take a bath in the sauce that was poured all over the cake and the sweet cream ice cream was fantastic.

Peanut Butter & Jelly Cobbler - My husband picked this based on our server's recommendation (the sticky toffee pudding was her first recommendation but she said this was her second choice since we wanted to order different things). This was way different then any cobbler I have ever had. But it wasn't a bad thing! The crumble part tasted kind of like a crumbled up peanut butter cookie and the filling was reminiscent of black berry jam. The jam was not overly sweet so it wasn't overwhelming at all. We actually really liked it.

The service was attentive and informative. Our drinks never got below half before someone came by to refill. I was nervous after seeing so many complaining reviews but again. After going to the restaurant I really have no idea what those reviews are talking about. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone who was visiting or simply wanted to try Gordon Ramsey's food without paying the steak house prices.

We didn't have reservations and that did not seem to be a problem as we were sat immediately.  Our seats ended up being right near the edge of the casino and near the posted menu which was distracting for me.  Since it was a Sunday the tv's all had football games on them with the sound playing loudly over the restaurant speakers.  While i enjoyed that, i wish the volume would have been a bit softer.  The decor of the restaurant itself is quite cool with one room being divided from another with a wall of kegs and then there was some cool chandeliers and a lounge type area.  I also enjoyed the wooden chargers on the table as well as the silverware of which the bottoms reminded me of the St. George cross. What i didn't enjoy was the outfits of the staff as the hounds-tooth was hideous and i would have to agree with other users who said it made them look cheap and trashy.

For an appetizer my fiance and I started out with the duck confit poutine.  Whenever it first came out I was unable to see any of the duck but I eventually found it lurking in the goodness of the poutine.  My favorite parts of it were the duck and cheese although the fries were nice and crispy except for the ones that sat too long in the duck gravy which ended up being overly sweet for me.  Who would have thought that this Canadian dish would end up on a English pub menu.  For my main course I decided on the shepherds pie.  Whenever it came out I thought that it looked a bit small but I was stuffed by the time I had finished it all.  The base was a mixture of beef and lamb combined with some carrots and peas and then topped with some mashed potatoes.  In the end it was a decent dish as the meat was tender but it did not really wow me at all.

The bottom line for me is that I would probably not come back to the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grille in the future.  While my meal was ok, there are too many other places nearby that are better and at the same price point or even cheaper.",0,0,0

No doubt that the lack of service starts at the top. 

Like I said, food was ok, but way overshadowed by the lack of service.

We were seated right away, but in requesting that we did not get one of the ""high"" bar style tables we saw at the entrance, were shown instead to an oversize ""booth"" consisting of a table and two large but lightweight movable couches. This proved to be somewhat uncomfortable, I felt like I was hunching over my food the entire meal as the table was too low for the level of the couches and the couches better suited for lounging than eating. All I could think was, if I wanted to eat dinner at my couch in front of my TV, I would do so. Might be fun with a larger group but it was not very intimate for 2. 

So lets get to the food, we had the calamari appetizer which was light, perfectly fried and tasty, and also a decent size portion as well. The accompanying sauces were the standard cocktail and aioli, uninventive but appreciated. We both decided on the lamb burger, which was enormous. If anything the meat to bun ratio here is unbalanced, the patty could be downsized a little bit or bun upsized without losing anything, the meat overwhelmed the remaining ingredients on the burger to the point you felt like you were eating just a big pile of patty. It was a very good lamb burger nonetheless.  Meanwhile, the accompanying fries were nothing to write home about, and like the fried squid, they also came in a suitably large portion. 

The service was surprisingly poor, my iced tea glass remained empty at one point for more than 10 minutes during our meal, and we were not attended to promptly when sitting down. I suppose by American standards the service was ""normal"" and Europeans would find it too fast a pace. 

Lastly, the place was quite expensive, you do indeed pay for the name in addition to the food. Two burgers, an appetizer and two sodas cost us $85 with tip. I was expecting this, but its worth noting nonetheless.",0,0,0

I was so wrong. 

I wasn't terribly hungry so hubby and I decided to do appetizers only. We were staying at the hotel so we reviewed the menu in the room (note: the listing says casual dining but the prices are equivalent to or more than the upscale restaurants) and headed down. 

The hostess told us it was a 15 minute wait so we added our name and stood around. After half an hour, I realized the hostess forgot us as she kept seating other 2 top parties right away. I told her the dilemma and she insisted she didn't forget us and that we were next. Sooo we finally got seated after 30 minutes of wasted time. Not too good of a start for dinner. 

Our waitress took our drink order of a soda each ($5 sodas. Yeah. That's not casual dining prices) and didn't return with our drinks for 20+minutes. So here we are thinking we were forgotten by the hostess and now by our server. 

We ordered the lobster mini rolls (it comes with only 2.....not really an appetizer and more of a small bite) and the jumbo shrimp cocktail (7 shrimp if even...with large croutons stuffed between them.)

The food was actually delicious but was overshadowed by the ridiculous expense of it all. We spent equivalent to a full fledged meal for two on two drinks and two appetizers. The service was abhorrent and absolutely TERRIBLE for a high end establishment.

The prime rib's flavor and texture were very good. I don't think they offer it all the time since it was a special. I also enjoyed the truffle fries and nachos smothered in short ribs, cheddar cheese & sour cream. The chicken curry seasoning was a bit strong for me and the fish&chips were alright. Kind of pricey for 2 pieces of fish but then again it is Vegas. Overall, good food & service.",2,2,3

Hot damn this is one of the better HH deals you'll find on the strip and throw in the fact it's at Ceasar's makes it that much better. The slots may be tight but you'll feel like a King walking away without burning a hole in your wallet.

Their HH is valid between Monday-Friday and the range of hours is pretty decent honestly. I can't recall the exact hours because I was drinking but I know we had more than enough time to enjoy it properly.

Some of the bar food items you could enjoy were their signature wings, mini corn dogs, pretzel sticks, truffle fries, mini sliders, and about 2 other food items. As for the drinks you could choose from a few beers\/wines\/cocktails.

My family was all over the wings, mini corn dogs and fries. For my personal taste the truffle fries were stronger on the truffle fries but damn they were delicious. I'm certain my Mom was obsessed with them everytime we had to take a new order for the table. What's great about the HH menu is the food items range from $5-$7 a pop. (Crazy I know). The pretzel sticks weren't the freshest but s*&$ for that price you really don't have room to complain and that beer cheese and mustard dip (it has a kick, you've been warned) is to die for. The wings were the true hit of the night and we ordered a few of them.

The staff was super friendly and very accommodating for a party of five.

I really digged the decor of this restaurant and the kegerator wall with real kegs was definitely unique and fun. The party was wearing shorts and casual wear and didn't feel uncomfortable whatsoever.

Riding on the coat tails of Ramsay's popularity, I came here for dinner one night with my mother.  After a day of high-rolling gambling (nickel slots), I was interested in trying this place out.  We were not in the mood for burgers (that's why we passed on Ramsay's Burgr) and didn't feel like taking out a loan to dine at Ramsay's Steak at the Paris casino.  So being the penny-pincher that I am, I opted for Pub & Grille since a) it was somewhat affordable, b) it was close-by (walking distance from where we were staying), and c) had food items on the menu that we were interested in trying.

Since it was on a weekday, the hostess said that reservations were not necessary but it would be a good idea.  So I made a reservation for 7:00 p.m. and continued with my high-rolling ways until then.  We got there a few minutes before 7:00 p.m. and was a bit surprised that the place was nearly empty.  There were a few patrons sitting in the front for drinks but not many for food.

The dining area was pretty nice; it was fairly dim but not too dark that we couldn't read the menu.  The entire restaurant was spotless and well decorated.  There was this huge poster of Ramsay on the wall just staring at the patrons, which was intimidating yet sort of funny.

Since my mother and I are relatively small eaters, we shared the fish n' chips and a side of braised vegetables.  The fish n' chips were nearly $30 so it better be good!

And it was!  I was probably one of the best fish n' chips I ever had.  The fish was perfectly cooked and flaky and the batter was not heavy\/oily at all.  The fish was not overwhelmed by the batter.  The braised vegetables was perfectly cooked; it wasn't mushy and the flavor of each individual vegetable was preserved.  There was a light covering of butter but not too much; it complemented the dish perfectly.

Our server was very nice and attentive; checked on us every so often to make sure our meal was pleasant.

Overall my experience at Pub & Grille was positive.  Both my mother and I agreed that the quality of food was outstanding (agreement between us is very rare!).

So... we went to dine here over Christmas week.  Jerry Seinfeld had a show we were attending and we just came to this place by chance.  Because we were early enough there was no wait for a table.  And because this is his 3rd restaurant we've been to, we had high expectations, even if it was ""a pub.""  

Starting out, I'd say that the service was chaotic.  No one came to our table after we were sat for a while.  I distinctly remember because I tried to figure out who our server was based on the hustling of servers around us, but not even those servers ever looked at us and said, ""Someone will be right with you, we'll have someone bring over waters, nothing."" There was NO teamwork at all, just unorganized chaos. 

So hubby drank a Boddington's which he can usually get at home for $1.99, and I had a martini.  Drinks were good since we knew what to expect. That is really, the best part of this whole dining experience.  Their menu was lacking at first glance.  Nothing I saw made me wish I could have more than one item...in fact after we'd been sat so long I kind of wish we could of gotten up and gone somewhere else....

But anyway, an English Ale soup and burger later we were at least not starving before the show.  But for counting this as one of our meals in Las Vegas...it was really disappointing.

I took a few days off last week to celebrate yet another year getting away from me. My wife and I went to Vegas, not for the gambling but for the entertainment and food. We stayed at Caesars Palace and one evening we thought we'd try the ""Gastro Pub"" experience offered by none other than Brit Bad Boy, Gordon Ramsay. Truth be told, although I love to cook, I'm not a huge fan of cooking shows, and shows where Mr. Ramsay makes a buck by humiliating what are often hardworking (albeit out of their depth) restaurateurs I find less than edifying. As a fellow reasonably foul-mouthed Brit bad boy who has been known to yell on occasion, maybe I just find it too close for comfort.

In any event, I love good Pub Grub so we gave it a shot. In their defense, the beer menu was excellent and the chips (French Fries for our US cousins) were authentically soggy and British... but beyond that, the food was just horrible... by far the worst we had all week. What was especially galling was the pretense that this was in some way Great British cuisine. Let's all agree on something... much (if not most) British food is horrible... really horrible. It's food made by poor people from less than great ingredients, typically over cooked under spiced and dull. It may have won us the British Empire... but it would get one star on Yelp on a good day. It is possible to do British staple dishes really well, with great ingredients and proper care Bangers and Mash or Fish and Chips can be killer... that's what's behind the current craze of ""Gastro Pubs."" Unfortunately, done poorly Brit Grub just sucks... as did the Fare at Mr. Ramsay's Caesars Palace joint.

To start with the bread was stale. I had the fish and chips with mushy peas; my darling wife had the ""mixed grill"". The fish bore absolutely no resemblance to real Fish and Chips, and the mushy peas were simply green peas which had been pulsed in a blender for a couple of seconds... not remotely authentic. The mixed grill (to phrase it how Gordon himself might) was ""F*@king atrocious"". The steak was perhaps passable (though over-cooked and served cold), the weird pork belly thing was a revolting gelatinous mess, and the lame lone shrimp was either horribly spiced or perhaps spoiled. The waitperson did her best, and when I pointed out the shortcoming she apologized but made no effort to resolve.

Mr. Ramsay, if you are going to use your brand and our heritage to foist over priced high concept but poorly executed crap to an unsuspecting world, would you at least take the ""British"" part out of your promotion to save us the national embarrassment.  There are a thousand chip shops or hole-in-the-wall cafes up and down our damp nation which wouldn't dream of serving up the swill you deal out in Vegas. It is (by the way) entirely possible to do that kind of fare well in a Vegas context, Todd English proves that to be true every day of the week. If the menu at Caesars was ever decent, it is being betrayed by your team there... sort it out!

If this makes it to your hallowed halls, we ate on September 10th and our check number was 1884527.",3,1,1

Cons: Price obviously lol. $30 for fish and chips and over $20 or something for the burger. You have to pay to play at restaurants like this in Vegas lol. If this were just some random joint then the prices of the food would have more of an impact on my rating.

We were served complimentary pretzel bread with a sharp cheddar cheese spread that I could have just eaten as my meal - Delish! Since it's pretty cold here right now I started with the english ale onion soup which was an even better version than french onion soup. It was rich and very filling.

VISIT #1
I came with some Yelperazzis for a snack before a Yelp event ( yes, we ate before a food sampling event and we went to eat after that too). We just decided to share some bits at the recommendation of David who has tried a extensive bit of the menu. 

The short rib and beef cheek sandwich was the star for me. It was beautifully braised and tender and I love their housemade stone ground mustard with a horseradish kick.

 I hate when a place can make a Shepherds pie that puts mine to shame (and I know mine is fucking delicious) but this did me in. I like that its a combo of lamb and beef and the gravy of it was savory and worth sopping up if there's some left after devouring (save a piece of bread or ask for some!). 

The deviled eggs were good in that the bacon does add a kick to it, but to me a deviled egg is just alright. 

Pei mussels and clams were perfectly cooked and the broth with it was solid and had a nice saffron flavor.

I got the Magic Hat #9 to drink which was nice and freshly apricot to cut the richness of the food. 

Service was on point. Lovely, funny, enthusiastic Elise took such great care of us, filled our drinks, checked in on us, gave great recommendations and got us checked out in a flash.  

VISIT #2

A few days later I return for my BFs friends birthday with a large party of 10 people. It was much busier on a Saturday night than the weekday we came. 

The BF and I got the duck confit poutine to start as I really wanted it when I came last but they were out. I say it's rather good and comforting, lots of shredded confit to go around for each bite of fries. I don't know if I would call it poutine as I normally have a much thicker gravy, but this au jus gravy situation was densely rich. We tried bites of our friends scotch egg which was a great version of a dish I am a big fan of. One friend got some pub spot sliders which was okay but a bit too well done for my taste. 

The BF got fish and chips which I thought was a solidly done one. I definitely am a fan of their tartar sauce! They don't give you malt vinegar automatically but ask if you want it. They have this garlic aioli that came with someones order but I asked for more to dip the steak fries in. If you love aioli on potatoes like I do, it'll elevate your fries. 

I got the Irish beef cheek stew and fuck me sideways it was so tender and perfect. I did need some more potato but people kept throwing me their log fries so I mashed that into the jus and aaahhh, noms. Clean plate of course. Between this, the short rib and cheek sandwich this place knows how to braise meat to meltingly tender. 

I had to get some sticky toffee pudding and it was delicious. It's one of my all time favorite comforts and theirs was definitely everything this is supposed to be. People wanted to taste and inside in my head was screaming ""no, no, no"" while I shared nicely like my mommy taught me. 

Everyone was happy with their food. One of our friends orders wasn't put in... It worked out since there was no way another friend could finish their sandwich so they shared and they expedited a duck confit poutine for him. 

Service was decent enough from our server and another server helping our table with water a few times. The person who white knighted the service though was our busser David that helped get all our random sauces and got to some ignored sodas and waters a few times.

 The thing that really blew chunks was we were held hostage for the bill. People shoulda spoke up to maybe split before things were even ordered so that part was our fault, but the way it was split was so inefficient. Went to one person and asked what they ordered and then disappeared and going one by one and coming back to recheck and check again and again which is which. He came to ask us what we had twice after the first time. 

Split checks during my first visit was painless. She tabbed which person is whose on one big check then came with one check back that split it into seat #1, #2, #3, etc. to make sure it was right then paired the card\/cash to the seat and came back with our individual receipts - done. This took forever this time when I really think it shouldn't have been that hard to get items to the right person. A little wait was expected, but we waited almost as long for checks than our entire meal duration. One friend was salty they got attitude from the server about the bill? I did not witness or asked for a elaboration. Apparently this place also runs with having a cashier settle bills for the servers and they only have one? This place is packed so I think they may need another if a lot of people are waiting. 

Pleased with the food and my first visit but coming with a smaller party at non peak hours to sit in Elises section! I'll average it to a 4stars as ""I'm a fan"", but warn big parties to handle splitting yourself and don't come when busy!

I love BurGR and GR Steak but this place missed the mark for me and I can't say I was surprised based on the reviews. We had a friend that wanted to go though so we gave it a try. 

Roast beef sandwich - ""would you like a sandwich with those fries?"" This is what they should ask when you order. The fries were impressive in both portion and taste and totally overshadowed the much less impressive roast beef sandwich. The caramelized onion au jus was awesome but they barely gave me enough for half of my already small sandwich. I ordered mine without the horseradish aioli as I'm not a fan of horseradish and honestly a good roast beef sandwich shouldn't need much else other than the au jus. The meat was good, not great and it was pretty much just lacking all around. At $18 I was quite disappointed. But again... fries... awesome. Had to ask for additional ketchup though as they brought out the smallest little half shot glass of ketchup lol

Warm salty pretzels - 3 pretzel bread sticks for $8... umm... how about some free bread on the table? Isn't this pretty standard when you are paying for a nice meal?

PEI Mussels & Clams - not my choice to order but I'm a fan of clams so I picked at it... and when I say picked at it.. I mean i had to literally pick at the plate to find the tiny bits of clam that had fallen out of all the shells. The chorizo was the best part of this dish and there was about 4 little slices of it.

Chicken Pot Pie - KC ordered this and enjoyed it but it was awfully small for $23. I took a bite and it had good flavor but the one she makes is better.

Our friends ordered steak and caesar salad and seemed to enjoy it but felt like it was overpriced for the place.

Service was so-so... waitress was very friendly but made a few mistakes and forgot some things. She made up for it by comping the pretzels and I don't get too upset with mistakes as long as you are friendly and make an attempt to make up for it.

I have been to Gordon Ramsay Steak and it is amazing, so I knew right away where I wanted to go. I brought along 11 of my friends to share the experience.  The service is pretty fantastic. They all learn your name and take the time to chat, they even put on fake British accents when they heard us doing it. My water glass was never empty and they even had the entire restaurant sing happy birthday to me. There are two menus, the grill menu which is a bit pricier and the pub menu which has yummy pub food. We ordered off of the pub menu. Since we were such a large party, we tried a lot of food!

Fish and Chips - The fish is so buttery and melt in your mouth delicious! OMG! I didn't care so much for the garlic on the chips. I love garlic, but they tasted like they had been rubbed with raw garlic, not my favorite. 

Shepherd's Pie - The mashed potatoes were so buttery delicious. Everything really worked well together, it was easy to see why this is a signature dish. 

Duck Poutine - The fries and the duck gravy were phenomenal. There were bits of duck that were a little overdone so didn't add much to the dish, maybe if they were cooked a little less it would have worked a little better.

Trio of Pretzels with cheese and mustard - Two of us ordered this appetizer and the bacon cheese pretzel was fantastic! The mustard was a bit too spicy for my liking and the cheese spread it a little weird, but not too bad. This dish is not worth ordering because they bring the exact same thing to the table for free, except the free one has a small loaf of pumpernickel bread and butter instead of mustard. I can't believe they charge for this and then bring almost the exact same thing to the table for free. 

Mac and Cheese - Almost everyone at the table ordered this and the response was 50\/50. I was expecting a warm and rich mac and cheese, unfortunately, there was a really sharp cheese flavor which turned me off. 

Short rib and Cheek sandwich - My friend ordered this and passed it around the table. The meat was tender and delicious and there was a horseradish sauce that really added a kick.

Sticky Toffee Pudding - You really must try this! It is absolutely delicious! Everyone at the table stole a bite and enjoyed it.

Overall, there were a lot of hits and some misses. We did have one big thing that turned me off a little. My sister in law ordered a burger, they forgot the bacon and then the burger was almost raw. She sent it back and by the time they brought the new one everyone was finished eating. She asked them to just box it up since we were finished. I would have liked to see that taken off the check since she didn't even get to eat with everyone, unfortunately this didn't happen and I was not comfortable asking. 

There are some great dishes on the menu, the restaurant has a really cool vibe, and the service was pretty good. This is definitely a cool hangout for some yummy upscale pub food, but Gordon Ramsay Steak is where it's really at!",4,1,2

I started with the Maine Lobster Rolls Minis which had a generous portion of lobster and a light seasoning of lemon. I loved that the brioche they were served on also had a faint lemon taste. 

For my lunch I selected to the Pub Chopped Salad which I loved. Everything in the salad was finely diced so I did not need to use my knife, and the dressing was light and evenly distributed. 

The only downside to the pub was the seating. I was on a low chair by a large coffee table and it was incredibly uncomfortable to eat from that angle (and thank goodness I wasn't wearing a skirt!)",1,0,0

Then, one of the servers spilled water all over our table and never bothered to wipe it up, leaving our placemats and flatware in a puddle.

My Husband's Toad in Hole was tasty, and they cooked his steak rare, just like he requested, but the British Ale and Onion Soup was just so-so, and my Shepherd's Pie lacked seasoning.

Richard E was our server. He was fast about getting our drinks and complimentary bread and appetizers, but after that he rarely came to check our table.

I confronted a bus boy about how long our food (because our waiter Richard E was nowhere to be found) was taking because we noticed a table of 4 that got seated at least 15-20 mins after us got served before us. He went in the back to check and came back telling me that the reason they got served first was because they have a smaller party and it takes longer for the kitchen to prepare all our meals to come out together....Once the food came out it was okay but definitely not worth the wait and rudeness we experienced. Richard brought one check over without asking us if we were all paying together at the end. We were a party of 8 so we asked if he could split the check for us and he made a huge deal about how long and difficult it would be for him to do it but he guessed he could.

My friends and I had dinner at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill inside Caesars Palace and it was incredibly disappointing.

We decided to cancel our drink orders right then and there, because hey, why spend $11 on a beer when you can get drinks for free while gambling? She then brought out our canceled drinks 5 minutes later, reminding us that she had in fact remembered to enter in our drink orders. Uh, what the !@#$? We asked that she take them back.

Other than the strange drink order situation, the food was nothing more than mediocre. But ridiculously expensive. My stupid salad was $17. The scotch egg appetizer was $11. For one egg. I know prices are high in Vegas, but for the spotty service and so-so food, this is a big no-no.

We arrived around 915p on a Tuesday and was told by a snarling hostess that it was 30 minutes.  Not the best start to the evening...but I thought the SMS system was cool - leave a number and they text you when the table is ready.

Got myself a Strongbow cider to go with the bread and pretzel.  Came with butter and some odd cheese sauce that didn't really do any justice to the pretzels.  Still, the caraway seed bread was tasty.

We started with crab salad with pickled radish and corn soup to share.  Crab salad was very good, lots of crab meat - though I wouldn't say the little bits of crab bones\/shells were any good for the texture.  Suppose it's hard to get everything when there's that much crab meat.  Corn soup was kind of plain, even with the minced crab in it, and didn't have enough corn kernels to call it corn soup - unless it was puréed...then I just didn't taste it.

Wife had mussels and clams.  Was an enormous pile of them.  She was salivating when I was taking photos, but a few bites in she thought the broth brought out too much of the fishy taste in the shellfish.  Most chefs would use some butter, sake, or wine to cut the fish taste a bit - not here.    Needless to say, she didn't finish the dish.

I ordered the shepards pie.  After watching GR enough on tv, I'd figure I'd try his signature dish out and see what the hype was all about.  One of his biggest peeves about the pies he tries is the amount of grease in the dish.  Well, his kitchen staff must have missed those episodes, because my pie was chalk full of grease.  The meats in the stew itself was nice and tender, albeit a bit bland; but with the mashed potatos soaking up all the grease, the dish got to be really heavy.  Texture wise though, the dish wins 5 stars - creamy mashed, chewy meats, and crunchy vegetables makes for a texture dream.

Waiter asked how things were at the end and we started into some of the things above; but as he was tuning us out the moment his question was finished, we didn't bother to go into much detail.  We had hopes of bringing a visiting friend next week, but in the end, we decided on two things -- not to get a dessert as to prolong the staffs evening, and not returning for another visit.

I was meeting friends from San Diego, They wanted a really good place to eat so I recommended Gordon Ramseys!

We've always ate at the bar, but now we had to get a table. I normally opt for a bar spot, since I am a good tipper and bartenders normally take care of my drinks. I was a little nervous because of the a few reviews on poor service, but we had the opposite experience here.
( This is why I don't add much into Negative reviews)

The night before we just had a party that Gordon Ramsey attended, so we were excited for another trip to GRPG!

The place was pretty busy, so I was hoping the service would be good. We were sat down right away in the back and our wait was named Adam. Actually we had two waiters and both their names was Adam.

We got our drinks and started off with the Short rib nachos. These nachos were actually better than the last time I was here and those were off the hook!

I had the Bacon Burger and my wife had the pulled Pork sandwich. My friend had the fish and chips - recommended by Adam.

My bacon Burger came and was well done like I asked. It came with a cone of fries, and to my surprise there was a lot more fries than I expected.

Fish and chips- My friends plate was huge and the fish was very fresh tasting. He is a big seafood eater and was happy with both the taste and the size. He stated the batter was perfect. Not a little fish overwhelmed by 10 pounds of fried batter. These were giant fish pieces.

My wives pulled pork sandwich was actually a little larger than she was expecting. She could only eat half. This plate comes with homemade chips as well. She has tried pulled pork sandwiches at some of the best places in Vegas and rate this the best. She likes it more than the Guy Fieri pulled pork sandwich, which I think is one of the best in Vegas.

Bangers and Mash: which consisted of chicken, beef & pork english sausages w\/ mash potatoes, sauerkraut & onion gravy. My friends wife cleared this plate in no time. She ordered it without Sauerkraut (Which is a crime in most states) She stated that this was a very good dish as well and wasn't greasy like some sausages are.

We had a lot of drinks, between the Belgium Margs, Good Bye Blue Sky, Pub Crawl- wow were were feeling good after our meal. Drinks were 15 dollars a pop which is about right for a strip restaurant. 

Both Waiters names Adam were great and met our every needs. They let us have a good time and knew the meaning of the service industry! We will be back in Nov for sure!!

My wife and I ordered the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish and Chips, Chicken Lollipops, and the English Ale Onion Soup. The names were very creative, but unfortunately, the food was not all that great. The fish for the fish and chips were NOT hot and flaky like you'd expect on a fresh battered fish. It came off like frozen fish. The fries were not quite as crunchy as you'd expect. It was slightly soggy and the standards just were not there. Definitely not what you would expect when paying for a $28 fish and chip basket. The onion soup was just another french onion soup in the guise of great marketing. As for the chicken lollipops, they tasted like frozen wings that were not fried crispy and the wing sauce was super salty. I had to drown the wings' saltiness with a good helping of the bleu cheese sauce and the peeled veggies next to it. 

The decor was a mixed bag. There was nothing all that special about the decor. They had stacked beer kegs and chairs with his dogs on them. I would've expected a little more wood to make it look a little more authentic pub and modernize the furnishings.

At the end of our dinner service, our tab came out to about $110, and we gave the server a $100 VISA gift card and a $20 bill and explained to him to only charge a $100 and take the rest, The guy clearly understood what I told him, and came back saying he tried charging $100 and then $90 but it declined. LIES! I checked my balance on the card when I got back to my hotel room later, and he had charged $120 the first time, and then $115 just to make me use another form of payment. I gave him my regular credit card, but that was just poor service, and didn't appreciate the lying from the server.

All in all, dinner service from the food to the service was subpar. I was really disappointed going into what I thought would be an enjoyable experience. Even if the experience was not the best, I wouldn't give a star on here, but the subpar food, and the server being dishonest just killed it for me at the end of it all. Look through the rest of the reviews for this place. The reviews speak for themselves as to the disappointment from many diners. I can't in good conscience recommend this place, and I can't believe that Gordon Ramsay would appreciate what's going on at this restaurant with his branding on it.",5,2,1

I was walking around in the bellagio and i decided to cross the bridge to come here for a late dinner. Since i was a party of one again, i was ushered to the bar to have my dinner. 

I ordered a fish and chips, it was supposed to be a ""classic favourite"" so i assumed it should be good. Boy i couldn't be more wrong. I also ordered a innis and gunn which was supposed to ""pair well""  with the fish and chips and was ""gordon's"" favourite. 

The fish and chips came in a bowl shaped plate on a piece of fancy tracing paper. The fish and chips were nicely done. The huge chunks of cod were very very fresh(gotta give it to them) and cooked perfectly. However, without the tartar sauce and the lemon, the fried fish was disgustingly plain, the fried batter came off the fish completely and i was eating fried batter separately from the fish. ""the entire plate was so oily, that the USA is deciding to invade the plate"" was how i felt after eating this 30 dollar dish. 

The innis and gunn did its job, the only 2 reasons why i could think of why it paired so well with the dish is because it washes the grease away from your palate, and if you have enough glasses of this beer, you would probably get drunk enough to forget you had paid 30 bucks for a disgusting, oily plate of cod fish, fried batter and chips. 

I was so disappointed by my experience at GR pub and grill i didn't even post it on my facebook. I do not recommend this restaurant for a first date.",2,1,1

Despite being 50% empty at 5PM, we ended up being told we couldn't be seated until 8:45PM. Still, 2 minutes later via use of the opentable app, I had a reservation in hand for 6PM and killed an hour at the tables prior to getting seated in a half-empty house.

Figuring we were at a british pub, I did the fish and chips w. mushy peas, and skipped a starter as we had an awesome lunch earlier and weren't super hungry.

Despite the pleasant service from the Gary Busey lookalike waiter, the food arrived scalding hot, as we downed our first pints. 

The chips were undercooked and scaling hot (as my buddy got a side of chips that were a bit crisper with his dish).

The fish was super-oily, and despite the newspaper themed dresses worn by the hostesses, it wasn't served over any sort of newspaper\/newspaper style wax paper.

The mushy peas were pretty good.

As we were leaving after finishing dinner, the restaurant was still 1\/3 empty. 

No idea what was up with their reservation system, as we were told we'd need to wait 3.5 hours for a table at 5PM, got a table via opentable at 6PM and were seated in a half-empty house, and when leaving at 6:45PM, left a restaurant that was 1\/3 empty.

I nearly nicked Ramsay a star for a lady walking around taking souvenir pictures. She had a rattling loud gab fest at the table next to us in a restaurant that has to modify noise levels anyways. She stayed too long chatting it up at this table.  I don't think we need souvenir photographers in a world with Iphones.

I knew I was getting the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Oh my goodness! I wish if I can have it as entree, if only my friend didn't ask me not to put on a show LOL. I'm telling you it is to die for and so addictive.

So for my entree, I got the classic steak & ale pie. When my pie arrived, it was small but after the first bite I realized how filling and flavorful my pie was.

We didn't have reservations although they take them and were sat in 10 minutes.  We had the luxury of being seated at a low standing coffee table w\/ two king chairs on one side and a huge sofa on the other.  Since our party consisted of me, my wife, my 6 month old and our 3 year old, the seating was perfect.  Our waitress came by within 2 minutes of us being sat to take our drink order.  For a gastropub, the ""hard stuff"" concoctions were a little limited (about 10 to choose from - zero tequila based beverages) as the majority of their libations are Beers.  Not a bad thing for a gastropub, but I like having variety open.  We ordered a very tasty Bourbon drink that immediately put a smile on my wife's face and I ordered a Rum concoction that tasted like a Watermelon Cooler.  To start we ordered the ""Chilled Shrimp Salad"" - poached in lemon-beer shandy, light ginger-mayo, w\/ red cocktail sauce.  It came out in about 8 minutes and my 3 year old couldn't stop eating ""his shrimpys"".   Very good dish.
For our entrees, I ordered the Traditional Shepherd's Pie and the Beef Short-Rib & Cheek sandwhich - on hearth baked sourdough, horseradish mayo, roasted red pepper jam, red onion marmalade.  The Beef Short Rib was one of the best sandwich's i've had.  Dipping it into the horeseradish infused ketchup made all the difference too.  Couldn't get enough of this flavor bomb.

Given that we love GR, this was initially an easy pick for lunch after it opened in Caesar's.  The menu looked promising, and if it is GR, it has to be good, right?  Sadly, no.  Not even close.  
 
The wife went with the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips w\/ Mushy Peas ($30) and got a single, small, bland fish patty and what seemed like frozen french fries.  The peas were cold and off-putting in both flavor and texture.  All for the bargain price of $30.  Gotta love Vegas, right?

The steak sauce also wasn't good nor anything like A1 and they didnt offer A1 as an alternative! Steak was probably dryer than the desert.

-Pub Chopped Salad ($16):  I will admit that the salad was very fresh and they did give a lot of shrimp and grilled chicken.

It was supposed to have avocado too but I only found 2 small chunks.  The pretzel crisps was a nice touch which I liked. 
-Grilled Beef Burger ($19):  Huge disappointment.  The beef patty was dry and unseasoned.  The only toppings on the burger were two slices of white cheddar.  There wasn't any lettuce or tomato so it made the burger completely lackluster.  A small side of fries accompanied the burger.  Presentation was nice as it came out on a chopping board but that's as far as it goes. 
Total tab was $43.  Overall, not worth the hype or anticipation.  You could get a better burger at so many other places and probably for half the price.  The other half said that even Habit Burger was better.",4,2,1

Finding this place was the happiest of total accidents. My group and I were just wandering around and happened to be hungry just before walking past this fun little Pub & Grill. Thankfully it was still pretty early in the evening so we were seated right away and camped out to watch the Astros beat the Yankees in game 1 of the ALCS. I'm not saying that solidified this place in the history of my life as a winner, but I'm also not not saying that. We helped ourselves to the Happy Hour menu and watched the restaurant fill up as we enjoyed pretzels with some amazing beer cheese dip, truffle fries with the perfect amount of truffle and a side of some kind of delicious truffle aioli, sliders and more. The name of my drink escapes me currently, but it's Gordon Ramsay's take on a Gin & Tonic (except I got mine with vodka instead because Gin is ew). So refreshing and slightly cheaper before dinner starts.

Everything in this place looks awesome, including the staff. The silverware is also pretty rad - makes you feel like you're at a medieval times feast.

Our second visit was equally as interesting with a lot of the same food and my husband ordering the birthday cake milkshake. It's basically a meal in a shake, complete with a cupcake on top. It also came with candles, which our server was happy to light for us. 

Perhaps my only complaint is that Gordon himself didn't emerge from the kitchen to insult my entire life's existence. Next time, I hope.",0,1,0

I've been to every pub style restaurant in Las Vegas, and this was at least as good if not better than all of them.  I love British food, having lived in England for some years, and was looking forward to having a British experience.  My husband has lived in Canada and was looking forward to authentic fish and chips.

The wait staff were efficient.  They did their jobs well, and the service was prompt.  

We had looked up the menu online before arriving, but when we arrived, the menu seemed to be pared down from what we were expecting.  That was a slight disappointment.  Even though the quality was good, it wasn't on par with the cost of the meal.  We had heard this so we were expecting it, and we thought it might be worth it if it truly reminds us of London.  While I'm not sorry that we went, we won't be back.  I don't think it's the type of place that relies on repeat business.

One more comment about the wait staff:  My husband and I always tip 20%.  We feel that if you can't afford to tip, don't eat out.  If something is wrong, a comment to the manager or on Yelp is far more effective than stiffing a wait person.  Our waiter made a comment about money.  It was a deliberate reminder to tip, and it was crass.  I'm sorry if the waiter gets stiffed sometimes and feels it necessary to drop hints about tipping, but it's not my problem.  This is a common practice on the strip, and it's one of the reasons I rarely like to go there.",0,0,0

We also ordered a couple snacks of truffle fries and brussel sprouts. We had to wait over 20 minutes to get our food, with no updates. I was frustrated enough that I was getting ready to leave, but then the fries were placed on my table without any apology for the wait. As for the fries they were... Okay but unimpressive. I'd do just as well to get fresh fries from McDonald's. The sprouts were a little better with the balsamic, bacon, and I think apricot... But not amazing.

The egg was soft boiled and wrapped in thinly sliced beef and dipped in a flour batter and baked...it was served with balsamic caramelize onions and some micro greens...all I can say is that the photo I included, does not do it justice, as it was layered with different textures and flavors, and I loved the kick and zing of the tasty mustard sauce.

Adam, the server, was terrific, and knew all of  the ingredients of the Ramsay tonic and the Scotch Egg, and enthusiastically explained how they were made. He was also personable a friendly, and I appreciated his interest in what I thought of each dish.

The Shepherd's pie was good after adding a bit of salt and pepper. Made of ground lamb, carrots and peas in a mild sauce, it came piped on top with creamy mashed potatoes. As a basic meat and potatoes type of dish, it was filling, however, I do not think I will order it again, as, to me, there just was not a lot of flavour going on in the dish. I think next time I will try the Ramsay signature fish and chips.

I decided to order the sticky toffee for dessert, as I had heard so much about it.., and Wow! Was it ever good!
It was so creamy and delicious with a moist date cake base, topped with a sweet cream ice cream and Florentine cookie, that I almost wanted to order another.

Adam came table side, and slowly drizzled the luscious warm toffee syrup over the top. This dessert together with rich hot coffee, was such a perfect ending to a tasty adventure in Gordon Ramsay's Grill and Pub!",2,0,2

First we arrived at the establishment to be greeted by the unfriendly hostess who had a nasty little attitude. She asked us what our last name was, in which my fiance replied: ""I will just tell you my first name, because my last name is very long, and hard to pronounce."" So he told her his first name, and she preceded to still ask for his last name. My fiance repeated his reason for not giving it to her, to which she replied with a roll of the eyes and a ""Well, it's a 45 minute wait."" I think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling, and pronouncing our last name; which she would have butchered if left to her. 

After that, we went to the bar. I am not a fan at sitting at the bar, but the bartenders were very animated and friendly. They served us our drinks and food quickly. The bartenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections. We ordered (I don't remember the exact names) the pub sliders, pretzel sticks, and the fish and chips. Me and my fiance share food a lot, and it is a wise idea to do that here,because the portions are large. 

I thought that the food was presented beautifully, and that it tasted good. The pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo, loved it. The pretzel sticks came with a side of spicy mustard (VERY SPICY AND AWESOME), and the fish and chips were tasty and not too greasy. 

While we were eating at the bar and enjoying ourselves, we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum. We also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment. Clearly, doing their job is so exasperating for them. Gosh, they should take a break. 

I would come here again, and I would recommend it to a friend. I took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses. Ramsay above all people should know that first impressions mean a lot, and that those ladies up front gave us, and from what I'm reading most people, a bad taste in their mouth.",5,0,0

We were seated in the bar section which was fine, but the seating was unusual - I felt like the seats weren't tall enough for the table.

Aside from that the fish and chips entree was stellar!  I think that possibly the best cooked fish and chips I've ever had.  The batter was light and tasty, perfectly salted and the cod that lay beneath was wonderful.  The tartar sauce was also lovely with the fish.  I couldn't have been happier with my dish.  My friend was a little less satisfied with his meal of the steak and ale pie.  His biggest complaint was that there wasn't enough of it.  I'll agree that the pie was pretty small for the price - but other than that he enjoyed the flavour of the dish.

Both experiences were exceptional.  The first time I tried Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill I was looking for something affordable yet indicative of the reputation of Gordon Ramsay.  

I looked the eatery up on the website and decided that a great way to test the waters would be to stop in for lunch.  We had a reservation, but we arrived early.  They sat us right away.  The atmosphere was interesting and industrial.  Large beer kegs lined the walls and pictures of Ramsay scattered the hallway.  There was a punk feel and a deliberately English design with emphasis on reds.  

My husband had a burger and I had bangers and mash.  For appetizers we had the soft pretzels and I had the onion soup.  When I tried the English ale onion soup I was furious.  I am a 41 year old woman.  I have been cooking for over 20 years and I managed a commercial cookware store.  I'd like to think I know a thing or two about cooking.  That soup... it was so light.  The cheese on the croutons was so creamy.  My heavy, rich onion soup made with red wine pales in comparison.  The onions were sweet and perfectly caramelized just so slightly.  What a difference.  It occurred to me that that everything I thought I knew about cooking was absolutely 2nd rate.  It also was a portent or the next to come.  Sausages so flavorful and delicate... I was expecting heavy, filling pub food.  I received a delightful surprise.  The wait staff was expedient and attentive.  I was happy with the portions.  I didn't need a take home box at all.    

Because of this experience my husband and I went right on Facebook and told everyone what an amazing time we had.  Of course when my cousin was in town for a sales meeting from Boston recently, it gave us the perfect excuse to return.  I spoke of that onion soup all the way there.  I've been searching for that recipe to no avail!

Again we arrived early and again we were seated immediately.  Boy was it busy!  We still had an attentive waitstaff though and my glass was never empty.  Music like Joy Division played and our waiter brought a round of ale.  He asked if we were in a hurry.  We said no and proceeded to work our way through roasted vegetables, smelt, scallops, onion soup, shepherd's pie and sticky toffee pudding.     

EVERYTHING was amazing.  It was an experience to savor and although the restaurant was quite busy, we never felt rushed even though we were there for about 2 hours.  The next day I asked my cousin if I could bring some sushi up to her hotel.  She said she was in meetings all day then would fly back to Boston.  I said maybe next time then.  She said next time she comes to Las Vegas we're eating at Gordon Ramsay's again.  Forget sushi!",3,1,2

This Saturday night we decided to try the new Ramsay place, being we are both long time fans, and we were dying for some good ol pub food.  First off, when we approached the place, they said it was a 25 minute wait (which for Saturday night at Caesar's, not much of an issue)-although there WERE so many hostesses up front it didn't really give off the idea that they were too busy, even though some tables were full.  We walked around waiting for our table, and once we were notified we were ready, we returned to the front.  The gaggle of hostesses tried to take our names again, then finally realized we'd already waited our turn.  One stepped forward to walk us to our table, and as we asked twice to be sat a lower table in front, she continued to ignore us and tried to put us at some high up table in the back.  We asked AGAIN to sit at a different table, and the response was a little ""hee hee, I didn't even see that one!!"" (She walked right by it!)
Finally, we sit.  And sit.  Annnnnnnd sit.  After a good 20 minutes someone came by with water in a bottle, explained they were our server's ""assistant"" and the server would be ""right back"" to take our order.  Yeah...Ok....I guess not!  We continued to sit by ourselves and drink our plain water, with STILL no sign of our server-FINALLY FINALLY a manager saw us sitting there with nothing, and asked if we'd been helped, or if there was anything he could bring us.  We were, of course, about two items short of memorizing the ENTIRE menu at this point (quiz me, I dare you!), so we placed our drink AND food order with the manager.  He wisked off, all apologies, and was back in a flash with our drinks, which he thoughtfully comped for us (which was nice, they were $15 each!).  STILL don't know who our server is, and very shortly we had someone ELSE (a THIRD different person, mind you) deliver our food, which once it was ordered came out QUICKLY. (Which makes it even MORE aggravating!) The two pies we ordered were tasty, I got the Steak N' Ale Pie, and my husband had the Shepard's Pie; however we were BOTH left wanting some veggies in the pies with the huge amount of meats (totally backwards, I know, but that WAS the case!)  The price point for the pies was a little steep, at $24 each.  At this point, we'd been there about an hour, and FINALLY we meet our server-he came over (WITH NO SIGN OF AN APOLOGY or ANYTHING), never introduced himself, and asked if we wanted desert.  We decided to order the Brownie Cheesecake-which don't be fooled, it's NOT a Brownie Cheesecake, it's a piece of Brownie, a piece of Cheesecake and some ice cream-was tasty, BUT BUT....JUST WAIT--
Since we'd been at this experience for a VERY long time, we wanted a smoke-we waited to see our waiter again, and told him we would be RIGHT BACK and we were NOT FINISHED....went out in front of the restaurant, and proceeded to endure SEVERAL dirty looks from the server while we each had only 1\/2 a cigarette.  We decided we better go back in, and the server had COMPLETELY cleaned off our table; desert, forks, spoons, MY drink (which was still pretty full, it didn't taste very good)...even the crumbs from our pies were washed away.  Needless to say, MOST ESPECIALLY due to the price point, this has GOT TO BE the WORST EXAMPLE OF SERVICE we have ever endured, and I DOUBT we will return.  To Gordon Ramsay: I'm sure if you REALLY knew how much in profits you were missing out on due to managers comping alcohol and food because of SLOW TERRIBLE SERVICE, you would quickly do a ""Kitchen Nightmares"" episode on your own place-and there would be plates and knives galore thrown and broken all over the spot.  We were VERY DISAPPOINTED to be sure.  The only reason for the stars at all is the food we received was good.",0,1,0

Although Gordon Ramsay has several restaurants in Las Vegas, they're all super packed as everyone anticipates to dine at the hyped up establishment of Hell's Kitchen's superstar.

Located inside the Caesar's Palace casino, you may be tempted to put some bills into those slot machines while waiting for your table. Thankfully, our wait (with reservation) wasn't too long and we were seated near the kitchen that had a huge painting of Gordon's menacing face. 

I'm sure if Gordon was there in person, the employees would have provided better service. Our waiter did not appear too happy about doing separate bills, even though we advised prior to ordering our meals. He said the best he can do is separate our table of 11 into four separate bills, so we gotta partner up with someone.. 

I have no complaints about the food, but it wasn't so amazing I would go back and try other items. I ordered the pork belly - the serving size looks small but because of how fatty the meat was, the dish was actually very filling. We weren't allowed to substitute the sides - but if I could, I would have gotten the mac and cheese, which according to my coworkers are amazing. 

The ambience was a little like a jazz bar, except that it was extremely loud - you'd be shouting all night long. So would I come back? Probably not.

At some moments, I thought there must be secret cameras filming my exasperating experience for the sake of entertainment and reality TV. But alas, it was just an unintentionally underwhelming dining experience.

I ordered the beef burger, and it was delicious. Juicy, huge, well seasoned and cooked as I requested, medium. Served with ketchup and garlic aioli on a soft bun, it was decadent, rich and meaty, everything one would need after a night out in Vegas. However delicious, I found it to be extremely plain. No options for toppings or anything could have offered some freshness. Just a meat patty, bun and bacon. I can't say it was worth the over $20 price tag for a burger alone. The accompanying fries were nothing special. The fish and chips were good, but extremely oily. I loved that they were huge, thick chunks of fish, and the batter was crispy and flavorful. But just a little too greasy for my taste.

Service is undeniably what put a damper on our experience. Our food took an eternity to come out. The two tables next to us were seated, ate their meals, and even paid their bill all in the time it took for our party of six to receive our food. When we asked for the check, it took an eternity for our credit cards to be processed. Most of our meal was spent anxiously waiting, either for the food, drink refills, and finally, the bill. There was no sense of urgency, and the restaurant was less than half full.  For a restaurant of Gordon Ramsay repute, the service was baffling. I wish he were there to scream at the chef and waitstaff to hurry the f**k up.

There are really clever design elements everywhere you look, from the hand-painted Keg wall to the 70s British punk uniforms for the staff, the distressed effect menus on wood boards, and the hand-hammered silverware that makes you want to buy a castle and tall-back velvet dining chairs just to put that silverware in it. So from an aesthetic standpoint, it does not disappoint at ALL.

The first thing that jumped out at me were the handmade soft pretzels appetizer. I just had to have that. SO good. They're amazing and come on a tray with a spicy, horse-radishy melted cheese and pub mustard. We also shared an order of the craziest (and most delicious) deviled eggs I've ever had. Four egg white halves seasoned with a warm, sparkly vinaigrette, and a bowl of the yolk seasoned with mustard, bacon and herbs.

I ordered Beer-Braised Short Rib $38 this lacks flavor. I mean, they added vegetables to add flavor to the short rib but the vegetables didn't have any flavors either. It was missing basic ingredients, like salt and or pepper. Such a disappointment. I expected it to be better.
My friends ordered steak, well done. They loved it but then again, they don't dine as much as I do so when I tried their steak... my god, it was not good. When they said well done, it was literally well done that it was tough, dry, and flavorless. I don't understand why they said it was good when it was literally hard to chew. That steak was a fail.

2 good thing about my experience: The skinny fries and the dessert which I forgot the name of it.

.As to this particular review, being the romantic, for Valentines Day i gave the girlfriend:

Diamonds ?  uhhhh No
Perfume ?  Seriously ?
Flowers ?  we've been together 3 years, I've yet to give her a flower so why start now.
Candy ?  getting closer

How about two tickets to the Uncorked Dinner with Chef Gordon Ramsay since I think she loves him more than me ?  What can i say, I'm a giver.

So even though it's a special dinner, it is being prepared by the chefs that work at the pub and you figure, it's gotta be there best effort since Chef Ramsay is there riding their ass so i've opted to make this a review of the restaurant and not the event.

briefly, as to the event, they simply cut off a portion of the restaurant for about 60 diners.  Chef Ramsay made the rounds - pics autographs, etc.  My gf was gushing when he came up to our table - i jokingly told the chef he can grab my girls ass when i take the pic.  I gotta admit, the guy is personable - i couldn't resist - asked him about this so-called riff between him and Bobby Flay - to his credit, didn't miss a beat and explained that it's ""press-driven"" - he likes Bobby, thinks he's a great chef, blah blah blah.  Overall, A nice event.  What about the food ?

All the courses were paired with beers provided by Innis & Gunn

Course one -   Chilled Fennel Soup with Shrimp paired with I&G Original.  If I wasn't told it was fennel soup i never would have guessed fennel was in the soup and I'm a fennel fan !   Smooth, creamy, but it needs ... flava !  The beer was decent.

Course two - Heirloom Tomato. Goat Cheese and Chervil ( paired with Original again )  - believe it or not, the star of the evening - simple fresh the classic flavor explosion. 

Course three - Pan seared Diver Scallops, braised artichokes, spring garlic ( paired with Original ) - nice, simple really like the artichokes.

Course four - Grilled Rack of Lamb, olive crushed potatoes, baby zucchini ( paired with I&G Finish ) - again, simple yet full of flavor and the beer was amazing.  The GF had a hard time with the rareness of the lamb - good, more for me !

Course five - Sticky toffee pudding ( matched with Melville fruit beer )  - for this being his ""signature"" dessert and i've seen rave reviews about it,  I can't lie - didn't care for it.  i actually was surprised what it looked like ( never had before ) - to me it looked and tasted like an upside down bran muffin.  I was expected a little jug of toffee sauce to pour over the muffin and ice cream - i guess not.  I simply didn't understand the dessert.  The beer had a fresh berry flavor to it - not bad, just not sure it complimented the dessert.

Overall, I thought it was a decent effort with the theme being fresh, quality ingredients that were not stifled by seasoning.

Most importantly, the GF was very pleased.

...not if you eat here, you're not.  I first had the opportunity to eat at a Chef Ramsay restaurant when I went to Plane Food in Heathrow.  I'm glad to see what regardless of where in the world it is, his restaurants live up to certain quality standards. 

We dropped in without a reservation while wandering through Caesar's.  I had the Mule's Hind Leg cocktail and it was pretty good, though just par for the course for a Vegas cocktail.  But the food really shined, especially for the price (relative to Vegas anyway).  I had the fish and chips and while the chips were nothing to write home about the fish was maybe the best fish and chips I've had anywhere in the U.S.  It was lightly breaded with nice chunks of white fish.  My friend had the steak and ale pie and really enjoyed it.  Through Yelp we got the sticky toffee pudding and it was a nice way to end the meal.  

I think if you're looking for an unpretentious not-over-the-top Vegas restaurant that beats the food court, you can't go wrong with GR's pub & grill.",3,0,0

After a half hour or so our food comes out. I got a salad that contained chanterelle mushrooms and spring mix with a vinaigrette on it... that's it. My special salad sucked. It wasn't very special and I ate about a third of it. 

My wife had fish and chips and the fries were ok. The batter fell off the fish and was an oily mess and she said the Dog and Duck pub in Austin makes it better... This is supposed to be one of their signature dishes and it was a total fail.

$30 for fish & chips!!!!  (Was it you or Caesers that set the prices?)

Best I've had in Vegas, definitely outside of England, but are you freaking kidding me??  $30!! For a spoonful of mushy peas, a few steak cut fries, and (2) 2x2 inch fish fillets??  Yard House fish & chips are almost half the price, same portion size & just as good. 

Lightly battered. Crunchy on both sides. Fish flakey & cooked through. Fries were great. Mushy peas...I prefer them without the mint. Fantastic!!  Definitely not worth $30!!

Lobster mac? Just good. Cheesy. Not great. Not fab. Not worth $25, even if you split it with a friend.  It's a side item, not an entree. No chunks of lobster in this, but its there. Just not easily noticeable. 

$5 for ice tea. And we had to beg for a refill. 

As for our server: don't know her name. My receipt says Lisa W. Wanted to take our drink order before the hostess walked away from seating us. She was nice when she was at our table. Lots of attention prior to ordering, none after. She was kinda a know it all about English food, trying to one-up us when we asked a question about the food in comparison to what we've eaten in England.  Refilled our tea WITHOUT ice. So much for ice tea. 

Our bill was $90 for 2 people: 2 ice teas, mac & cheese, fish & chips, & some corned beef sandwich. We left with NO desire to come back. NO longing to come back to try something else. Chef, your prices suck!!  Your own burger here is TWICE that of what you serve at BurGR and truffle chips are better & $3 less at BurGR too! And you get more!!  I expect to pay these prices at an upscale restaurant, like Steak, but NOT a pub. Not even in the UK!!

Come during happy hour. Sadly I will never be able to. I work full-time!!  This place DEFINITELY caters to tourists & not the locals.",8,5,1

The restaurant is definitely British themed, no doubt about that. There were a few TV's playing the various games, but other than the medium size bar and the wall of empty kegs, nothing screamed pub. Once we were seated, they gave us the Ipad which had the drinks menu on it. I was fine with water, but my husband ordered a 20 oz Innis and Gunn. His drink was brought over fairly quickly and we decided to order the appetizer, while we decided on our main course. We ordered the pork belly entree to share as a starter. After deciding what we wanted to eat, we placed our menu's down on the table. Our server  came by and took them away without asking or getting our order! I had to flag her down to ask her to bring them back so we could order our food. A few moments after we ordered our entrees, our pork belly arrived. I had noticed that every other table around us had received bread, so I asked if we could get some bread. She said she had put out order for the bread in. We were almost finished with the pork belly roll, with pea puree which was very tasty, when our bread arrived. Around this time the server came over to refill our water glasses, she touched the spout of the water pitcher (which looks like a clear wine bottle) to the rim of my cup. Lucky, she had not refilled my husbands water, so I switched and drank out of his. When she came over to refill 'his' glass, she again touched the rim. I was able to waive down a bus boy and get a straw. Our dinner arrived and I decided to focus on that. I had ordered the lamb, while my husband had ordered the mixed grill, which included, filet, pork belly and shrimp. I had ordered my lamb medium and I felt and that it was on the well side, and I also thought that it tasted burnt. It was charred after all, but my husband tasted it and said it tasted fine. My taste buds are extremely sensitiveness at the moment, so I decided to let it go. My husband was happy with his dish, but the side dishes that we ordered to share got mixed reviews. We ordered the carrots, two ways (roasted and pureed) and the mashed potatoes. Neither side dish was served with a spoon. Keep in mind these are family style dished. Luckily, we didn't mind sharing. So we had to use our forks to get the carrot puree and the mashed potatoes out of the dishes. I was by no means happy about this and than the server came over to refill my water for the third time she not only touched the rims of the glasses but also the straws. In addition every time the server came over to our table she bent down so her face was at my level. I did not like this, especially when she was at the table next to us. When she bent over to them, her butt was in our faces. Not very lady like and not very professional at all. I was pretty much fed up with her service at this point. I walked to the front and asked to speak with the manager. I ended up waiting at the front for at least 5 minutes while being repeatedly told that the manager was on her way. When she finally arrived, I informed her what was going on in regards to our water glasses, and said I didn't appreciate that at all. I also questioned the method of serving side dished without spoons and she said that side dishes were not served with spoons. She said that she would follow me back to the table and observe. I thought the least she would do is have someone bring us new water glasses.  After a few minutes of waiting and never receiving new glasses, the server came over to ask what we wanted for dessert. We turned down dessert and asked for the check. The check in case you were wondering was not discounted in any way and was close to $200. I have now been to ""Steak"" four time, and always rave about it to my friends. Everyone was waiting for my review on the Pub and Grill and I will not be raving about this to anyone. I was so disappointed. Yes, I understand it is a Pub and Grill, it is not Steak, but I think that a little professional can go a long way- especially considering the prices at just a 'pub!' Little things like touching my water glass and then the glasses next tables and back again, doesn't make me very happy. Also serving side dishes that need spoons, without spoons??? This restaurant has a long way to go.

The food selections were your usual pub fare (fries, burgers, etc.) with some nicer exceptions (scallops, fresh fish, etc.). We tried the sliders (called something else) and the scallops, very fresh and tasty. The only small nit-picky complaint was that the entrees were not very hot when they arrived, but still were wonderfully prepared. The pretzel and cheese free bread appetizer was so yummy, I'd go back just for that! Overall, a good experience, but be prepared to pay for it!

The crust left a gritty texture in your mouth that detracted from the overall yumminess of the filling.  I was sad.

Arrived 6pm and the place was 75% empty. Seating only by reservation! We had to cool our heels 15 minutes because they do not accept walk up business! I suppose this keeps out the riff-raff but it also keeps out customers. The bimbo squad that act as greeters\/seaters are just that - bimbos. Fairly attractive and none too smart or just not well trained. Or both. The drink menu is presented to you on an iPad but the size of drink involved and the pricing does not match what they offer you! Attempted an $8.75 25oz. Newcastle draft off the iPad but could only order a pint at $7.75! Pints were not even on the iPad menu! They mention that this is a 'craft' beer place but it must be relegated to the bottled section as the draft selection is pretty pedestrian. Did I mention the food is outstanding? No doubt, this is what kept this at a 4-star rating. But they serve the entrees in a plate that is almost like a bowl. This makes cutting meat a bit of a challenge. The 2-seat tables are pretty small with little room to manage all the glasses, bread plates, raised wooded placemats, etc AND the freaking iPad. Service was decent by the wait staff. The decor does not match the hype. It is pretty boring and almost ugly unless half-kegs of beer as wall art is your thing. From place settings to 'reservation only' seating this is as far from a friendly, down-to-earth pub as one can imagine. I suspect Gordon Ramsay was involved in the menu and the overall licensing of his name\/image and that is about it as part of his overall Harrah's deal. This location in Caesar's was Bradley Ogden's which was an overall brilliant restaurant across the board. Too bad it was replaced with this - which boasts as friendly and inviting but really isn't.

We were seated quickly and were entertained with World Cup Soccer on the TVs around us. We had very attentive waitstaff. There was a nice selection of beer on tap, which made my dining companions happy. We started with the fried calamari, which was yummy. I appreciated that they included the tentacle pieces since those are my favorite. What was pretty gross was the pond of grease that was at the bottom of the paper when we finished our meal. The kitchen needs to be a better job of draining the grease before serving.

I had the BLT Duo. I wish I knew it was served cold ahead of time. Cold pork just isn't my thing. The pulled pork was more of a pulled pork salad since it was mixed with a light creamy dressing. A thick cold piece of bacon on top was less than appetizing. Minus a star right there. Again, I wish I knew ahead of time that it was served cold. I would definitely not order this again.

One companion ordered the NY Strip. His comment was that it was much better than the NY steak at the Old Homestead Steakhouse. It came with a tiny portion of fingerling potatoes and asparagus. He asked the server for a piece of bread since the meal was pretty rich. The server said no. He indicated he would need to order the appetizer pretzel bread. This seemed unreasonable as we saw other dishes that had bread. This 80+ year old man wanted a small piece of bread with his steak. Seriously, the waiter should have brought him a piece of bread on the house. It's not like we didn't each order a full meal, plus appetizer and drinks from the bar. They lost 2 stars and a percentage of their tip right there. 

The other companion ordered the curry chicken. It's an Indian curry served with a side of chutney. I thought it was just ok, but my companion really liked it. By the end of the meal he was sweating from the spices.

One last point: The seating is meant to be like a pub. Each table had different style of chairs and tables. Some were regular restaurant table and chairs, there was also traditional bar seating and other tables that were homey with high backed sitting room style chairs. We were seated on a raised table with high bar stool seats. It wasn't my preference to eat dinner on stools without back support. I wish the hostess checked in with us about this prior to seating, especially considering we had a senior citizen in our party.

The decor was a hip modern twist on a traditional British pub.  The lighting was a little bit darker than I would've like but it definitely added to the ambiance.  The keg wall was probably one of the coolest parts.  Though a little loud, the charm of the restaurant was definitely appealing.

We made a reservation on-line but we were a little irritated that we couldn't call to get ahold of anyone if we needed to make changes to the reservation.  It just kept gong through and automated recording.  Also, when we approached the hostess, she actually didn't seem very enthusiastic towards us nor any other guests who approached.

It was a minor wait before we were seated.  The table was cool and I really like the chairs.  It seemed to take awhile before our server even came to greet us let alone give us water. I guess it was busy.  Once the waiter greeted us he was really nice.  Great smile and willing to answer any questions we had.  He also offered suggestions for items on the menu.  We did order some cocktails from the bar which got to us in a timely fashion and we also got a platter of bread and butter courtesy of Gordon...thanks!  The pretzel sticks were amazing.  I lathered them in butter and gobbled them up!  The drinks were good and strong yet pricey but what do you expect for Vegas.  

Most of the entrees were pricey as well.  I ordered the lamb shanks and was definitely pleased.  They were tender and well seasoned.  Absolutely yummy!  My boyfriend ordered the Shepard's pie.  The mashed potatoes were to die for.  

Overall, my experience was great.  Ramsay definitely does know his way around a restaurant.  Then only qualm I had was with the hostess'.  If they were a little more charismatic and interested in the customers they were about to seat, I think I would've rated it a 5\/5 instead of a 4\/5.  Still great though. :-)  Will definitely go again!",0,0,0

When I went there, the service was great and spot on. 

The Food:
The lamb burger is delicious! Order that sucker as medium rare and you'll have no regrets. I was pleased on how much french fried it came with. Personally I think its around $2-5 over priced, but hey its a dish from an A list chef. 
The steak with potatoes and asparagus was very tasty and quite large, and I think it was worth the money.
The chicken sandwich is quite gigantic and wast good, not as good as the burger or steak in my opinion.

Only go, If you've been planning on eating at a Ramsay establishment for a while and have the money.

Their beer selection is actually pretty weak although they did have Innis and Gunn on tap which is an amazing beer.   This being Vegas,  there are much cheaper places to drink so I would suggest just getting the 1 beer to go with your meal.

So, we get to the service part.  We waited for drinks, our table, and the food for well over 3 hours.

I had to choose between rounding down to 3 or up to 4 but I used my city-judging tie breaker and gave them a 4.

I've had my heart set on coming here for a while.  Then I started reading the recent reviews and few had something positive to say. However, I really wanted to judge for myself and give a fair assessment. 

All thing a considered during the experience, here is how I landed at 3:

- Upon arriving, greeted by 3 possibly unhappy hostesses? 0 smiles given and a very bland ""enjoy your meal"" after seating us.  

- Hospitality - 0 points - It's non-existent from the entire staff, which I would be making a much bigger deal out of if not for the fact that this is A: A Gordon Ramsay Establishment and well, hospitality isn't his M.O. and B: It's still Vegas where money and beauty trump all other things.  

Food - We didn't eat anything bad.  But only the Chicken, Kale and Bacon pot pie stood out as a ""wow"" item.  Portions are small and it's kind of ridiculous when you consider the cuisine.  I'll pay $12 for truffle fries but you should be able to share them, not ration out a few fries to a table of 4.  Last I checked a 50 pound bag of potatoes was still $11.

Prices - this goes against everything I believe in but I'm going to go ahead and complain about it.  $30 for Fish N Chips Gordon? No one at the table even ordered them and I'm pissed off about this.  Again, noting that the portion on it is barely enough to feed 1 person and you're using Cod, not an expensive fish.  

Service - not to be confused with hospitality, which there was none of....they do the job they need to do.  Water was always full, appetizers and entrees came out quickly, no mistakes on the orders.  Our server made no attempt to enhance the experience though.  Made no suggestions, didn't offer dessert which is a shame since I had already picked out what I would have 2 weeks prior and was pretty excited.  

Atmosphere - It's a beautiful pub and very swanky.  Being located in Caesars Palace kind of makes that a requirement.

There are certainly a hundred much better options on the Strip but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try this place.  Just taper your expectations and be willing to overpay for what you get.",3,1,0

At first glance you can see by the decor the theme they were going after; a charming casual place that served bold flavors. The menu was appropriately priced for Vegas and the food was modeled after a traditional English pub with keeping its American guests in mind. The beer list had a nice blend of English ales and some good American craft beers among the standard miller lite. 

As for the food, I had the corned beef sandwich as a few bites of the lamb burger. Both were outstanding in flavor and well portioned. Having them accompanied by a 90 minute IPA, my lunch was set.

I'll start off with my one and only positive comment about this place the service was pretty good. They waiters were friendly and fairly attentive. 

Now to my laundry list of why this place was a major disappointment: 
1. The food was mediocre at best, and inedible at worst. I came in and thought ""hey I'm at Gordon Ramsey's Pub, I'll have the Fish 'n Chips. I bet they'll be fantastic!"". Wrong! It's more like Fish 'n Wedges..flavorless, unseasoned, & cold wedges. The fish was ok, but not  even note worthy. I've had better Fish 'n Chip's at the local Chippy at Brixham harbor..

2. The prices were disproportional to the quality of the food..if you want me to be happy about paying $30 for Fish n Chips, and $5 for a diet Coke it had better be fricken amazing. It wasn't. 

3. The decor in that place is tacky, just awful. And the uniforms of the waiters boarders on bizarre. Whoever styled that restaurant has all they style and class of one of the local Las Vegas hookers.",4,1,0

I was prepared to be unimpressed, but the celebrity stamp on a fairly affordable restaurant specializing in the chef's country of origin was interesting enough to give it a shot. Also, the people I was with wanted to eat there. 

I had an Innis & Gunn stout with the black truffle macaroni and cheese, which was EXCELLENT, and I've had macaroni and cheese in a billion places. The Scotch egg and salt and vinegar crisps (calling them that doesn't make them feel any more English than regular potato chips do, but I get it) appetizers were pretty spot-on... not amazing, but good drinking food. 

Drink, meal, and tip landed just over $40. Good on you, Gordon Ramsay, for not charging the hell out of people for food that doesn't really justify its price tag. It's sort of a foreign dining experience--I won't call it authentic, but dark, pub-like, with living room-style chairs that were awkwardly low versus the height of the table. Fun and easily satisfying for groups and drinkers.

The service was mediocre that night; our waiter disappeared for long stretches, I had to ask for a water refill; it wasn't the worst service I've had, but it didn't warrant a hefty tip.

A couple days later, we stopped in again (The connected Forum Shoppes made us all tired... from all the shopping) for drinks. The bartender recommended cocktails from the menu, discussed each at length, and was super charming and attentive, even discussing other local restaurant recommendations and letting me sample a bit of a drink I asked about.

People are complaining about service and steep price point. They do know they are in Vegas right? Also, the word PUB is in the name, that literally means that it's a casual ambiance so chill the hell down. 

Food was remarkable. Sister had the deviled eggs, I had the lamb burger, wife had the ale onion soup. All of which were perfect. 

I love lamb. You can say you love it more but I will disagree. I don't like the actual animal, I like the meat it gives. It's juicy. It has that remarkable taste. Leaves a taste that lingers in your mind.

This lamb was cooked perfectly. Great burger. Great price. You're in Vegas. It's in the middle of the dessert. Food isn't cheap. 

The ale onion soup lived up to its name and tasted like ale reduction. A fun take on the French onion soup. 

Service was FANTASTIC. I wish I could remember our waitress name but she was amazing.

Side note: if you're the manager reading this, she had blonde hair and was stationed by the kitchen entrance that served the booth with 2 love seats, on 8\/08 , around 4pm. Give her a high five.

Where the dag nabbit was Ramsay with his inappropriate and oft mal-placed British curses and wrinkled forehead to scare the bejesus out of these chefs for a hustle on our order? 45 minutes on a meal in Vegas? You know what I missed? I missed the taxi cab that was going to take me to MGM to see Calvin Harris. Or... I might have missed the end results of the poker tournament at Rio. Or...

I am not sure if Chef Gordon realizes what he has going behind the bar but between Adam Rains (also the beverage editor of Las Vegas Food and Beverage Professional magazine) Adam O'Donnell (Voted best bartender in Vegas by Vegas Seven and Bols Bartending Academy) Raul Faria (Host and creator of Mixology Made Simple), Ray Ray, Gene and a few others, this ""pub"" has created a great cocktail program. 

While I have had the pleasure of being served by almost everyone above, I have had the most experience with Adam Rains including on this most recent trip.

Adam is one of the most knowledgeable people I have ever met when it comes to cocktails and spirits in general AND food. I have a feeling that if he had chosen to be a chef he would have been as equally skilled as he is with spirits.

He has a collection of house made infusions and bitters that he uses as tools to create some very unique, next level cocktails but can also make you one of the best classic cocktails you've ever tasted as well. I had one or two cocktails listed on the menu but I was entirely comfortable just asking Adam to shoot from the hip and make me something unique. Every cocktail was a success. I did have the ""God Save the Queen"" off the menu and it was pretty tasty, everything else was a Rains original I believe. I go here for the cocktails, the food is secondary to me but I have never had a bad experience. 

That being said, I have never had anything bad here, it's just everything seems so heavy. I know I know English Pub fare. I'm not flaming the food but we normally just get smaller plates throughout the course of the night at multiple restaurants and would like to see lighter options other than salad. They did  add a couple of lighter option since my last trip, the lobster roll being one of them. It was delicious, light, sweet, savory, one of the best lobster rolls I've had. We also had the wings which were wings and the pub sliders that were pretty good although we were sad to see that they changed the recipe for their deviled eggs though. The last incarnation were the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten. 

In the end, it's a great place to grab an early cocktail and a snack as they open at 11am and while I have never had anything truly amazing off the food menu it's definitely worth a stop if you want to try a Ramsay property without spending an arm and a leg or if you want to have an amazing cocktail.",2,0,1

You won't believe how casual and laid back this place is, in comparison to its neighbors at Caesar's Place. Peter was our host and he reminded us of Mario Lopez! 

I really like the pork rillettes (despite mistaking it for fish initially). It had none of the porky taste and looked as white as fish meat. Topped with strings of sweet caramelized onions. It was the perfect finger food to wash down with a pint of beer. We had a good pint! I can't recall its name but if a non-beer fan can love it, I am sure most people will too! It had a dark oaky color, wasn't very strong but had slightly bitter aftertaste. 

The Deviled egg was a miss for me though my friend seemed to liked it. To each his own.

Our waitress informed us that they were out of fish & chips...this is supposed to be an ""English"" pub and you're out of fish & chips...ok. 

I had the Caesar salad for an appetizer which was drenched in dressing. For my meal, I had the pork belly roll. I had high hopes since I love pork belly, but this had more fat than actual pork. It was also so salty that I could feel my fingers swelling as I ate it. Others ordered the scallops which were terrible, as well as the shepards pie, which was dry and had no vegetables in it. 

The best part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding. 

Overall, this place sucked. I am appalled that Gordon Ramsey yells at and denigrates people on television for their cooking skills while his own restaurant is sub-par with terrible service.

Third visit - just about midnight and the hostess asked if I just wanted drinks. As my answer was yes, I followed the group of 4 that were just ahead of me into the bar area.

I preferred the bar because there were TVs and I like to socialize with the bartenders. However these bartenders were not very friendly. They seemed cold and was all business. We asked to change a channel on a TV to watch one of the March Madness games since there were at least 2 other TVs that were showing the same game. Not sure if they heard us or not, but no response.

I was there before the Shania Twain concert and ordered the beet salad that took well over 30 minutes to receive and we sat at the bar for faster service. On my second bite, I bit down on something very hard and realized something went very wrong in my mouth. The waiter, Adam, just happened to be looking at me and asking how was our food. I'm shaking by head NO and pulling the salad out of my mouth to see what was in it and found a very hard object like a rock. Then, I realized it had also broken my molar and ran to the bathroom to see the damage. It was so dark, I couldn't tell but touched the area with my finger and the nerve was exposed and sent me a zap through my body with pain. They called the EMT to write up the incident report, but by now the concert was starting in 5 minutes. We ran to the concert with my mouth in pain and came back to the Pub & Grill after the concert to meet with the EMT again to fill out the paperwork. Even the manager said, it was chewing on a rock and we also found many more smaller pieces in the salad. I had to wait until the next morning to get emergency dental care and found out I would need a crown after the temporary fix in Vegas. I ended up in bed all day with a headache, ruined vacation, missed event, and alot of pain, novocaine, and drilling...no fun!  
Long story short, I was supposed to hear from Caesar's within 3 days...never happened! I called them to find out it had been passed on to CCMSI, a law firm who takes care of their injury claims. I was told they mailed me a letter...never got it. I was told they emailed me...never got it until I called again. They never ever asked me for any information or details of the incidence except the simple form of what happened that night and my 2 dental bills. The manager had indicated to keep track of my auto expenses to and from dentist...they had no idea and never asked how much this affected my life. After not hearing from them again for weeks, I kept calling. Finally, two weeks ago the assistant got back on the phone and informed me the supervisor decided they were not honoring the claim because they didn't consider the nut shell or whatever it was to be a ""foreign object."" I was shocked!!! 
All I could think of was if Gordon Ramsay was filming a Hell's Kitchen episode and during the tasting time of judging personally ate the ""foreign object"", broke his tooth off, and swallowed a piece of his molar, would that be acceptable? I've also reached out to his company in London to NO AVAIL with an email to his press department and a message to his facebook page. They have no other email for coorespondence, except to call a London phone number.  
After I called Caesar's again to let them know CCMSI had denied the claim, they offered to just pay my two dental bills for my broken tooth. Really? How about the  lost 4 days of my life, lost work, lost vacation, novocaine-drilling-crown for the rest of my life, auto expenses, not to mention all the pain and time it's taken to deal with CCMSI who has not represented Caesar's well at all. Here's the icing on the cake...there's another review in July, 5 weeks after my incident, with the same report of a shell or foreign object in the beet salad at Pub & Grill and he thought it cracked his tooth, but didn't. He even posted a pic with his review of the ""foreign object"". You would have thought the rock-like nutshell or whatever it is, would have been taken care of when it happened to me in such a big way. Obviously it hasn't. Now I'm talking with an attorney to get this resolved and I'm not a sue-happy person. Please message me if you've had a similar experience.

On the downside: the calamari was tiny and insubstantial, the deviled eggs unimpressive, but the biggest disappointment was the chicken curry dish. If G.

The decor is definitely attractive and will peak your curiosity. Looks like a trendy new spot to stop by and hang out by the bar, or give a go at authentic British cuisine. 

And we're done with the good. Now let's go into why I felt like I wasted a perfect meal-time (i hate it when that happens...) at Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant.

I literally ate like a rabbit all day just to save my stomach for Gordon Ramsay's. I mean, it's GORDON RAMSAY. The chef who is so angry and critical all the time, that I feel like his restaurant HAS to be good. I was so hungry that any mediocre dish (even fast food) could probably satisfy me, but Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill wasn't even close. For someone who markets himself as being a perfectionist in the kitchen, it certainly does not seem he has met his own standards. 

I started with the Fried Oysters appetizer. The dish was presented with three oyster shells with two tiny fried bits in each. I literally felt like I was just eating batter. Wasn't much flavoring to it and wasn't anything special. 

I followed it with the fish and chips. It wasn't terrible, but I feel like I could've probably found the same level of satisfaction at Long John Silver's. I would honestly rather make a stop at Long John's than pay $26 for that plate again. My date ordered the Braised Pork Belly ($30) and looked like it would be promising, but again, it was rather bland. You can definitely find a much better prepared pork belly elsewhere. 

The most exciting part was probably the pretzels as the form of complimentary bread. It was offered with butter and a type of cheese-mustard. I've heard good things about the pudding dessert and that's probably the only thing that would ever weigh my consideration on returning.

My bill ended up being $100, 1 appetizer, 2 main course dishes, and 1 glass of Hennesey. Sadly, I would've been much happier spending that $100 at the Bacchanal Buffet.",5,2,1

Located conveniently at Caesars Palace, it opened about three years ago with now head chef Scott Commings from Hell's Kitchen!

When I first walked in, I was greeted by a friendly hostess and noticed the unique uniform that the staff wears. I love how they dress the part and really makes the dining experience even more unique. I came here on a Saturday for lunch where there was futbol (soccer) game showing so the
restaurant was live and packed! The ambiance felt so warm and welcoming and the décor inside the restaurant was modern and very classy. Of course, I didn't except anything less for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant inside Caesars Palace!

I ate here for lunch and picking my meal was hard when I wanted to try everything! Carrie and Sara were our waitress and they were so friendly and accommodating to me and my friend. They told us about the restaurant, a little bit of the background and many things about the menu. Just talking to them for the first few minutes, I knew they were knowledgeable and trustworthy of their suggestions.

First, the drinks! They have an array of beers, wines, and cocktails! They have a full bar and use fresh ingredients to make your drinks. I tried the very popular cocktail suggested by Carrie called ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" and I must say... best drink ever! It is so refreshing for a hot summer day. I believe it is a blueberry vodka drink with muddled fresh berries and a splash of sparkling wine! For an appetizer, I tried the calamari with bacon bits. Wow! It is out of the ordinary. The calamari was crunchy and packed with flavor, especially with the bacon added to it and they make their own tartar sauce! For my main course, I tried the chicken pesto sandwich with fries. The portions are huge! My sandwich came with a very thick and toasted sandwich packed with chicken and mouth-watering pesto! The fries were crunchy and simple to compliment all the flavors inside the sandwich! Lunch was delicious and I wish I had enough room for dessert. I have been hearing from word of mouth, yelp and the staff that the sticky toffee pudding is a must-try! I will definitely try it next time I dine!

Overall, the experience was amazing. Everything from food to service was impeccable. Carrie and Sara were amazing!

We sat at the bar and Adam took care of us. We had a great time with Adam who guided us through an awesome dining experience. If you go to the bar ask for Adam. However there is one problem virtually all the bar tenders are named Adam. But no worries it seems they are all above average. Ok now the important part the food. It having Ramsey's name carries high expectations. I am happy to say they were meet. I need to particularly point out the Shepherd's Pie. This is something I would normally avoid because of my stepfather's failed attempts. His was the worst thing I ever ate. Gordon's was the best thing I have ever had.  I will be back again and again. Finally a famous chief opens a very approachable place and blows away expectations. Good Job!!!,0,0,1

On Hells kitchen he's rude and curse yelling and swearing while people make mistakes. It's not really my favourite show as I don't subscribe to that form of people treatment. 

Had a fantastic group dinner on the evening I visited.  Everything here has a fine British pub touch. It's charming, different!  This is the third time I've eaten here. We had ordered some appetizers calamari and the devilled eggs. Both were above average.  For my main course I had selected the Scottish salmon which I had eaten two years ago. It came with a crispy skin and was succulent and served with some potatoes and greens on top. Really it was a very high quality meal. As a side we had some lobster Mac and cheese which was very tasty and brussell sprouts (nicely done). For dessert we ordered the trifle and also the sticky toffee pudding. I had a small serving of each and it was tasty and nice in presentation. 

We ate in the private room in the back. Service was very good and of no issue.  My only interesting semi-negative is I had ordered a Sam Adams on tap and it tasted nothing like a Sam. I should have ordered an Innis and Gunn. 

I've seen some negative complaints on Yelp. Sure it's expensive, maybe you had bad or rude service.  Many restaurants on the strip and in hotels are pricey. Complain all you want, we enjoyed a great meal with old friends and new!",3,0,0

We can't hear for dinner because of its close proximity to a show that we were going to see. It is located in the casino of Ceasar's Palace. 

We had chicken wings for an app, a burger and a presto chicken sandwich for main course, and the sticky toffee pudding to end the meal. 

The pesto chicken sandwich was to die for. It had so many fresh ingredients. 

Normally, we do not get dessert, but we kept seeing that sticky toffee pudding ordered at other tables. With much envy, we decided to order it ourselves. We had no regrets.

We started with the calamari. There were bacon pieces in...of course it made it over the top delicious. Delightfully fried and light on the oil and perfect crunch. Maybe the oil was just changed or maybe it's always good.

I had the lamb burger. I ordered it medium temp. which I realize now was my mistake. Medium rare is the way to go as that is how I had it last time. This time there were parts of the burger that were charred to a crispy blackness which were unappetizing. Come on...that's amateur. However the truffle fries saved me.

The cheeseburger was dry and tasteless. It came with nothing; no lettuce or tomato. I had the choice of putting ketchup or garlic aioli on it but nothing else. 
The fries were OK but nothing special.
I was lucky enough to have the one server behind the bar who really took care of his customers but the rest of the Hipsters working behind the bar, they were more interested in talking to and impressing eachother than taking care of the customers. There was a definate lack of Management on my visit.  
A pint of draft IPA $13, I could buy a 6-pack of this beer for $10.
Cheeseburger and fries $19. I would rather have a 5-Guys burger with it's better tasting meat and many toppings and bigger, better tasting fries all for half of the price.
I just can't believe that Chef Ramsay has tasted and approved of this food. But after eating at his namesake Gordon Ramsay Restaurant at the London Hotel in Hollywood (Restaurant has closed) maybe he has found a way to make money on hipe alone. 
So everyone, don't waste your money here. I guarantee you that if you order the cheeseburger at the hotel coffee shop you will be eating better than at GR Pub and Grill.

All the food on the happy hour menu is from $5 - $7, which is pretty decently priced for the richness of the selection. You do have to sit at the bar, which was super crowded on this cold November Tuesday, but if you can manage to find a spot it'll be worth your while. 

Each dish was delicious! We were blown away. They were all classic happy hour appetizer type foods (nachos, wings, etc) but made with better quality and a slight twist of the fancy. The type of food you can eat until you're full and not feel like you're going to pass out after, you just feel good. 

Here's the dishes: 
Truffle Chips: Basically, fries with truffle aioli. The fries are super good, those thick but not too thick ones that are just crispy enough. The truffle, and the other dipping sauce, was flavorful too. 

Toad-in-the-Hole: A sausage wrapped in a pastry with dipping sauce in swirls around the plate. Fluffy, pastry with perfect balance of sausage. This dish only comes with one tiny sausage for a $5 price tag, so just be warned if you're sharing you'd need to order a few more if you want your own. 

Crab Deviled Egg (w\/ cucumber, tomato, relish): This was good, the flavors were balanced. I'm a hug fan of regular deviled eggs, so the twist was definitely interesting. Not my favorite, but good and definitely worth the try! (They come with three egg halves). 

Kettle Chip Nachos (w\/ corned short ribs & cheddar sauce): SO GOOD, probably my favorite dish. It's everything good about nachos but with better made parts. The chips by themselves are the real potato kind, the meat is flavorful enough to eat on it's own, and the cheddar sauce is rich. It all balances super well, especially with the sweet baked peppers on the top (I think that's what they are). It was so good we were literally scrapping every last tiny bite off the plate even though it was our last dish of the meal.

Was in Vegas on a recent guys weekend, and had set up a few reservations a month or so in advance.  This happened to be one of those ""filler"" nights where I tagged along with what was fast and easy before a show.  I should have known better.

Listen, it would be far more difficult to skewer a place, if its owner and Executive Chef weren't on TV every other night berating contestants over one flaw or another while simultaneously puffing his chest and pimping his brand.  

Either Gordon Ramsey has never eaten at Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill, or he's full of shit.

For starters, the place is so fully ""in the casino"" you can't really differentiate between the scent of the beer steamed clams, and the cigarette smoke wafting around you as you attempt to chew.

Ordered the ""Calimari and Bacon Crackle"" for an app.  I'm not sure what exactly makes it part bacon, but I actually counted the pieces of finger-nail sized bacon in my cone of calamari and there were 4.  Besides marketing to a ravenous for all things pig consumer base, I can think of no worldly reason for the word ""Bacon"" to be in this dish.  The calamari were cooked well with utilitarian dipping sauces.

Sprang for the Herb Caesar Salad w\/ Chicken for an entrée in a feeble attempt to incorporate a vegetable into a meal during the stay.  I am not kidding when I say that Applebees serves a better chicken Caesar salad.  This salad is 23 dollars.  Twenty three dollars. The chicken breast (and I use that term loosely) that came on top had the texture somewhere between a tire and a silicone breast implant.  If it was not cooked via microwave I will literally give Gordon Ramsey the entirety of my craps earnings. This salad was atrocious.  Minimally dressed and lacking in every viable flavor that usually makes its way into a Caesar.

Service started out decently, but then we turned into an afterthought.  Cocktails were surprisingly good.

This takes me back to my opening sentence.  This experience has soiled me on the name Gordon Ramsey.  I have zero desire to ever set foot in another one of his establishments.  For every contestant on another one of his shows, please point to this restaurant when you get scolded on the inadequate ratio of crust to filling in your apple pie.  That is all.",6,3,2

The evening before we enjoyed a FANTASTIC dinner at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab (It's in Caesars...run...don't walk to this place if you want a wonderful dining experience) 

So... we figured we would give this place a try, the menu price wise is about the same as Joe's, we expected something close to the level of service Joe's offers.... BOY we we wrong!  

The waitress sat us and the bench seat I was in sank down like an old worn out sofa... it was awkward to dine in. 

She brought us an Ipad for the drink menu and didn't really go over the ordering process... we figured it out and pressed on. 

I ordered the mixed grill which comes with a couple of shrimp, pork belly, and a fillet.  When the food arrived the side dish we ordered did not show up. No apology, the guy just said he would go back and the dish would be out in 5 min. My wife ordered the Scallops with polenta...  Her scallops were not bad but the polenta was nonexistent ... her bowl looked empty LOL a few scallops and faint smear of polenta.  My meal... the steak was over cooked, it had a good flavor but wasn't nearly as good as the fillet I had at Joe's the night before. The pork-belly was the best thing in the dish and the shrimp were very plain... lacked any seasoning. 

About half way through the meal we stopped eating... called over the waitress who hadn't followed up about the missing side dish.  She went back... said it would be out in 5 min.  Again... no apology... nada.  Then she went on drifting around the place not doing much of anything.  We waited a little longer... said screw it and finished our meals.  Not once during the meal did the waitress check on us... offer to get us additional drinks... nada.  

As soon as we finished the meal... the guy shows up with the side.  I politely let him know we didn't want it... we had finished our meals. About 10 min later the waitress drops off the check... minus the side and says have a good night.  Again... never admitting there was an issue... just treated us like the millionth pain in the ass tourist she has served. 

For a $150 + meal... you would expect better food and better service.  

This place was a huge letdown.  I only wish I would have read the Yelp reviews prior to wasting our time and money at this 2 star establishment.  I've had better meals and service and chain restaurants. 

Again... if you want a great meal... with great service... I highly recommend you walk on down to Joe's on the 1st level of Caesar's Palace. You will not be disappointed.

For appetizers, we ordered Pork & Duck Rilletes which was very tasty.  (We had never had Rilletes before so we don't have anything to compare).  They also give you  a small bread course for free.  My main course was the Mixed Grill.  It contained steak, pork belly and shrimp.  I loved it.  It was the best steak I had ever had, so tender!  The shrimp are large and juicy.  My husband ordered the flat iron steak.  He said the flavor was great, but when he received it, it was barely lukewarm so it was cold before he could finish it.  The sides are separate but we both ordered smashed fingerling potatoes.  Black truffle makes this dish absolutely delicious.  For dessert, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  This literally made my eyes roll back in to my head!  It was so heavenly.  My husband also tried a few of their tap beers.  The service was excellent!  They constantly checked up on us and were very attentive.  As packed as the place was, I was amazed by that.  Expect to drop some cash (almost $200 for both of us) but it was worth it in our eyes.  
There were only two negatives...  his steak being barely lukewarm and the music was SO loud that we had a hard time talking.  They play music by British artists. . However, they get props from me for playing Depeche Mode.  :)

I would have to say that Gordon Ramsay is hyped up way too much. From the outside it looks like a hip restaurant. I would describe it as an upscale pub.

===Service===

The service here was extremely slow. Our waiter took at least 10 minutes just to come and take our order. It took an additional 35 minutes just to get our food. I understand the place is pretty busy, but they should already know the place will be packed on a Saturday night and have the correct amount of staff on hand. 

===Food===

Complimentary bread and pretzels: The pretzels were in the shape of a breadstick, but they were perfectly chewy and soft. They serve the pretzel with a mustard cheese sauce and regular butter. I'd recommend going with the cheese sauce. The other bread that they served seemed to be some type of wheat bread with toasted seeds on top. Definitely not as good as the pretzels.

Braised beef cheek: Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. This dish was very disappointing. The beef cheek itself didn't taste fresh. Think of when a fatty beef dish gets cold. You get that layer of oily white fat. It tasted and felt like that in my mouth which is not appetizing at all. Also the gravy was pretty bland. Not worth the $28. 2\/5

Pan seared diver scallops: Braised artichokes, baby carrots, pearl onions in a white wine garlic broth. They give 4 scallops in this dish. It's not very filling at all since they don't give any type of carb with this dish. It could definitely use some risotto, mashed potatoes, pasta or anything that's a carb! $32. 2.5 stars

Overall, I was sadly disappointed with this Gordon Ramsay location. The service was poor and the food was boring. I personally wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone that I know.",3,3,2

The bartender refused to change the station because he was a chargers fan. He was wearing a chargers leather helmet at the time. When we asked to speak to a manager it took over 20 min for Casey who was the manager to arrive and she argued with us about changing the station instead of complying with our customer request. In addition when I asked the hostess in front for a manager she said there were a lot of managers on duty and one of the managers is Brandy. When I asked Casey about this she claimed there was no manager there named Casey. We ended up leaving the bar very upset at the level of unprofessionalism displayed at this establishment by the staff and management. I suggest that Corporate management start sponsoring customer service training for all staff members at this establishment.,0,0,0

First meal in Vegas after checking into Caesars.  Love the location, and the service was excellent.  The food was just okay though, and FYI, I think the menu online is outdated.

I got the Hell Burger, which was a spicy beef burger with jalapenos and habanero.  It had a delicious smokey flavor, a nice bit of heat to it, and it was juicy.  The patty was perfectly round though, so it makes me wonder if they were using prepackaged food or not.  Nothing on the menu said fresh, hand-made patties though, so can't blame them if they aren't.  Gordon Ramsay wouldn't expect any less though.  The fries were really good though.

My gf got the classic fish and chips.  We both agreed that the fish was perfectly breaded as it was light and crispy, but the fish itself was plain.  You really had to dip it in the sauces to give it any flavor.  Not sure if this how it's supposed to be or not.  They also give you wedge fries, which weren't as good as the shoe string fries I got with the burger.

The best thing we got was the lobster roll starter.  I love the buttery, toasted bread that it comes on, and the lobster is the cold style type.  It was very refreshing, and was topped generously with lobster, so you got a lot of flavor in every bite.

I'd probably try the other places in the area before coming back here, but that doesn't mean this was a bad spot.",3,0,0

We decided to start with the deviled eggs and am glad that we did. They are really creamy with nice spice. I will say that I think the are overpriced due to the fact that you only get a few for the price.

I had the fish and chips as I see it on hells kitchen all the time and wanted to try it. It really is delicious.

My partner had a burger and said it was amazing and the bun was really great.

A few minutes after we seated, our server came to our table to take the orders, due to my eating style I asked for a dish from sandwich section with no dairy on it.

We chose to eat at the bar since a couple of basketball games were on.  That way we could also ask the bartender about their beer selection.  Our bartender let us sample a few and we ended up going with a pints of Innis & Gunn and Moa.  Those were $8.75 each but so was Pacifico and Corona so no point in going for stuff you can get anywhere else.   

The first entree was the ""Dublin Brisket"" which was set in a pumpernickel bread bowl.  The bowl was filled with hearty tender chunks of beef, cheese and sauerkraut that went well with the side of thousand island.  3 standard steak fries=1 fry here so you only get 4 of them which was enough.  

My wife wanted the ""Shepard's Pie"" and just hearing those two words gave me flashbacks of terrible school cafeteria mush, a poor man's English lasagna if you will.  But this was galaxies away from what I had in the past.  Savory was the word from the first bite.  Each spoonful filled with buttery mashed potatoes, carrots, peas and slow cooked beef and lamb.

I didn't expect much, but boy, I was I surprised. The lamb Shepherd's pie was excellent, the beer list was great, ambiance was classy, and service was stellar. I couldn't wait to return. 

On my recent jaunt, my friend and I are there twice in two days, and again, it couldn't have been better. First, the cocktails were huge and strong and perfectly balanced. The lobster roll appetizer was insane! Best we've had outside of the East Coast. The bread was soft and buttery, and full of tender, sweet hunks of Maine lobster. No skimping. 

We also shared a corned beef sandwich that was hands down the best I've ever had thanks to the mouth-watering, well-marbled meat that was not salty at all and the exquisite preparation, with delicious rye bread grilled expertly; luscious, melted cheese; and lip-smacking sauerkraut. 

Same for the steak pie, chock full of the most tender cubes of beef in an addictive gravy. The lobster mac and cheese also was a winner, with claw meat on top and strewn with bits of buttery chunks. Asparagus was simply delicious, grilled perfectly and served with a delicate Bernaise sauce on the side. 

Service on all trips was top-rate; these people are trained well (no surprise there if you've ever seen one of Ramsey's TV shows). I asked the bartender jokingly if he ever met the man himself, and to my surprise, he said yes, a few times. Apparently Ramsey is quite attentive to his properties and gracious to his employees in real life. Everyone seems to enjoy their job. We also appreciate the fact that we saw plenty of people of color in the front of the house.

My friend and I split the steak and ale pie, fish and chips, lobster mac and cheese, and truffle fries. All were very pleasing! The steak and ale pie was my favorite - the pie filling was fantastic. I wish I could get my own personal stews to have the same bold yet delicate flavor of steak, mushroom, and ale. 

The fish and chips were also satisfying. I am definitely a harsh critic of the batter on the fish (after two years of living in Ireland and eating at my fair share of chippers and pubs) and this one was light and crispy, but still solid. I wish the fish was a bit more seasoned before it was battered, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with some malt vinegar.

The lobster mac and cheese was gorgeous. Exactly the ooey-gooey cheesy consistency I look for in mac and cheese - and filled with lots of lobster chunks and flavor. The truffle fries were also fantastic. The truffle aioli had so many chunks of truffle that I was alternating dipping my fries and fish.

So here is my email. 
Dear Mr. Ramsay,

I hope this email finds its way to you. I thought I would give it a try. 

My husband and I were in Las Vegas this past weekend celebrating our 24th anniversary (it's actually on Oct 16th) We had tickets to see Celine Dion at Caesar's palace. Apparently Celine didn't know our anniversary was the 16th or I am sure she would have performed that evening. (Doubt it) We decided to try your pub at Caesar's since it was right there.

First off, my husband is a big fan of your show. He watches several cooking shows and yours is right up there on top. So we wanted to eat somewhere special. Personally it doesn't matter to me because I don't like to cook and have been blessed with a husband who really enjoys it. (Thank goodness!)

We showed up for our reservation and were seated right away.  Our waitress and all the wait staff was more than pleasant. 
Things went downhill fast from there........... We ordered a cocktail, Gin & tonic for my husband and a Vodka martini (up) for me. My husband's drink was wonderful and mine was as warm as tapwater. No problem,  I thought it could happen. Not going to complain over such a minor issue. 
For dinner, my husband ordered the Burger with truffle fries.  So let's start with his meal....... The fries that were brought out were  plain fries. I hate to think what you would have done to one of your chef's if they served plain instead of truffle fries. Again, no problem we simply asked our server and she took care of it right away. I had the flat iron steak and it was just ok. It was Ok if I was at Chili's or Outback (not that they serve a bad meal) but not Gordon Ramsay good. I was however, looking for some kind of bread or dinner roll.  The waitress told me that I would have to order a side of bread and pay.......again, no problem, I wanted a piece of damn bread with my steak. So what came out towards the end of my meal was undercooked pita bread and butter. Yikes, I couldn't keep quiet any longer and had to tell her that it was awful pita bread when she asked how everything was. I didn't and wouldn't have asked her to remove the cost from our meal but she was very sweet and offered.

So my point in all of this is...... the meal was just average except for the price ($150) and we were expecting a ""Hell's Kitchen"" quality meal. 
I thought you might like to know how the restaurants that are promoting your name are actually cooking your meals below what we you're your standard is. 

Disappointedly Yours,",5,0,0

We ordered the chip nachos appetizer and those were delicious, even tho there were burnt pieces (and I mean BURNT pieces of chips.. they were black..) 

Here's where thinks went downhill. 
4 of us ordered the famous fish n chips.
As I started eating, I noticed the puddle of oil under the chips that were coming from the fish. 
Half if not all my chips were soaked in oil and were therefore soggy.. fish was okay.. honestly I wasn't blown away.
My boyfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and he LOVES GORDON RAMSAY. As he ate the burger he said the burger was pretty much a Chili's or TGIF burger.. and expressed how disappointing it was.

- I ordered the Chicken Curry. It took about 25 minutes to come out and when it arrived the portion wasn't the biggest, the sauce was good, the rice was fine, but the chicken was undercooked (pink). Definitely not worth the $24 price tag.

We went with 5 people. My sister got the lamb burger and I got the fish and chips. The other 3 got the burger. We also go pretzels to munch on while we were waiting. It came with 2 sauces - course mustard and cheese. They looked hard but were very soft. 

Food took a while but it was very great. When I got my fish and chips, i said I could eat more than it but in fact, I couldn't even finish! The waiter said that their fish is never frozen and I believe it. It was firm, yet flaky. The batter was perfection. The only thing was the ""chips"" were more like roasted potatoes (not crispy) but were still good in their own right. Mushy peas were fresh with a hint of mint. The TARTAR SAUCE (!!) was very creamy and clearly homemade. It was worth the cost ($29).

I tried my sister's lamb burger and the spices were not appealing for me, but she loved it.

Lastly, we tried the toffee pudding ($10) after the rave reviews! It did not disappoint! It was more like cake consistency than pudding and came with sweet cream ice cream. The server pours the toffee sauce on top. So so good!",0,0,0

""Pricey"" is an appropriate term here.  After three appetizers, an order of Onion Soup, and two orders of Fish & Chips, an Iced Tea, tax, and tip, I walked out with my wallet $165 lighter.  But it was $165 well spent.  I rate restaurants mainly on food taste and according to their type--not on how costly they might be.  And for a pub & grill, Gordon Ramsey delivered great quality and taste on everything I sampled.

Plus, the atmosphere was pub-like and comfortable sitting in a sunken booth with regal sword-like silverware in a well-decorated dining room.  Service, too, was good and very accommodating of special requests for a very busy restaurant.

We began with a truly Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail with a Citrus Crunch, Horseradish, and tantalizing reddish Cocktail sauce.  The shrimp was meaty, perfectly cooked, and delicious.

Deviled Eggs served with bits of chives, tomato, bacon, and tiny Red Onion and White Onion squares contained beautifully whipped up yolks,  The individual egg halves taken as a whole yielded a pleasant crunchy flavor that offered a fine prelude to what was to come.  And Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese, with Gruyere, English Cheddar, and Parmesan, at $25 a pop delivered a fine shareable and soothing side for me and Diane even though the dish was presented as an appetizer.  The three conjoined cheeses melted harmoniously over the cooked macaroni, and flowed over good-sized chunks of tasty lobster meat.

Since it was on the menu I had to also try the Sweet English Ale Onion Soup, which was quite cheesy, mellow, and without any noticeable hint of alcohol.  It will join my list of memorable French Onion Soups even though it was technically British rather than French.   

My two long lengths of blonde battered cod with Mushy Peas, lemon juice, malt vinegar, and a superior homemade Tartar Sauce were served hot and were simply excellent, cooked just right with steaming and flaky flesh inside the lightly golden batter.  And the thick log-like ""chips"" were quite tasty as well.  Although I didn't try it, a friend dining with us pronounced the golden-crusted Chicken, Kale & Bacon Pot Pie with Marjoram & Creme Fraiche, & Vegetables the best pot pie she had ever tasted.  That is now on my ""to try"" list!  So a return visit will definitely be made once my wallet has been replenished.",5,3,4

Really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. Just dimly light enough so that it was intimate, and the servers were very nice and helpful. Our waiter was top-notch - and he even offered to connect us with a promoter for night clubs. The 3 stars is for the food, though. I sampled the pesto chicken sandwich and lamb shepherd's pie. Both were good, but nothing really wowed me. Some other friends tried the maple sage fried chicken sandwich, which they said was delicious (it looked delicious too).

We were really excited as we've been fans of Gordon Ramsey for quite some time. There was a 30 minute wait (no problem) and actually built the anticipation. Somewhere with this kind of wait MUST be awesome. We were texted when our seat was available. The decor was nice and the uniforms were fun. 

We ordered the Roasted Tomato soup and Truffle fries. The Tomato Soup was great, not quite as good as we just had in London, but thats okay. Truffle fries were great. We also ordered a mixed beverage with Bourbon and a glass of wine. Mixed drink was really tasty. 

Because the appetizers were so good, we were even more excited for our entrees. We ordered The NY Strip and the Scottish Salmon. What a disappointment. The NY Strip was medium-medium well when we ordered medium rare. It was INCREDIBLY chewy. We've had better steaks at chain steakhouses (no exaggeration). And the sides: the asparagus was so overcooked it was actually mushy and there were just a few tiny potatoes. The salmon came with lentils and was SO SO SO bland. Like SO bland. Our water was never refilled and when my husband got his steak, the did not bring a steak knife and had to get up himself to go find one after waiting quite a while for someone to bring one. 

Overall, I was so disappointed and feel like I wasted my last night with my husband at a subpar establishment. We would have gotten better food from a Macaroni Grill. 

With a name like Gordon Ramsay plastered on the front of the menu, you expect to leave with a smile on your face.

So awesome to see different style tables and chairs. Everything from high tops, to couches, to stools and love seats around tables, very charming. Unfortunately we were seated at a high top table lol but that's ok because the atmosphere was great, lots of people at the bar, lots of good looking waitresses and bartenders, and our waitress was very sweet. I ordered the fish and chips, and my friend ordered the salmon and both were incredible. My fish was crispy and so tender on the inside, the plate came with seasoned potato wedges and mashed peas. The peas were very different, interesting taste but I liked them. My friend's salmon was thick and it melted in your mouth. They didn't have an extensive wine list but we made it work.

My cousin wanted to dine here before we proceeded with his bachelor party evening. We didn't make reservations here, so we ended up with a wait of forty five minute to an hour. When the estimated seating time came, we were seated promptly. While browsing our menus, our drink orders were taken and water glasses filled. I was very anxious and excited to try Chef Ramsay's favorite dish, beef wellington. Apparently, it wasn't on the menu. So, I ended up getting the roast prime rib entree, medium rare.

After twenty minutes had passed, we were told our entrees would be out in five minutes. Then ten, fifteen, and thirty came and went. Still, no signs of our entrees. Yet, other customers who were seated after us had their entrees served. We were all ready to get up and leave and dine else where. But, we all just decided to stick it through. Once our entrees were being served, they were served in waves. I was the last one in our party of seven to receive my entree.

For a $40 entree, I'll admit the entree looked hearty. The prime rib was cooked to a medium rare and accompanied with some glazed baby carrots, brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. I had a side of creamy horseradish sauce, but no au jus for dipping. I would say that the prime rib was comparable to other dining establishments in Vegas. I would've been better off with the $10 prime rib dinners and paid way less than $40. But, I guess it was for the name and experience, right?

The three of us were greater by 5-6 hostesses that was a little awkward. All bored and chatting it up. We asked for a place next to the bar TVs however they seated us towards the back of the bar next to one TV. That was mildly frustrating as the place was dead for a labor day weekend at lunch rush. I'm guessing people are intimidated by the prices but we had cash to blow. 
When the waitress addressed us she apologized for the wait as it was 10 minutes into being seated, she said she was the only server and someone called in. This was sad Bc there was 5-6 hostesses and a manager in a suit watching this whole ordeal and not doing anything about it. I wanted him to approach us and ask about the experience but he skipped our table. 

Long story summed up, the craft cocktail (Mr Tokyo or something) was like a pink lemonade with egg white froth, not good but the waitress didn't explain what it entailed.. My friend loved the blt. Other friend loved the lamb burger. The fish and chips was the biggest let down. $30 bucks for HUGE chunks of cod.. They state how awesome the batter KS but with peices so large you miss out. 

Long story short, I'd rather fly to England for $1,000 bucks, take a 40 pound cab ride to Mildenhall Village and eat at the dog track than to recommend anyone eating here.

When we returned, we were promptly seated.  About 10 minutes later, our waiter showed up for the first time to take drink orders.  By that time, we had already decided what we wanted for dinner.  Another 10 minutes later, the waiter returned with water and took our order.  Our appetizers arrive about 10 minutes later and the food was excellent.  

Now for the not-so-excellent part.

After we finished our appetizers, we waited an additional 40 minutes before I started trying to find our waiter and ask him where our food was.  We noticed several other groups of people come in and get their entrees less than 20 minutes after they were seated.  Once I finally found him, he said he would check on it, and returned 5 minutes later with ""You food is next up, I just checked"".  20 minutes later, I was ready to leave and got up to find our waiter for the bill. I tracked him down again, and reminded him that we'd been there for almost 1.5 hours.  He gave me the look, then disappeared.  Another 5 minutes goes by, and finally our food shows up, right as we were about to bail.

The food was hot, outstanding and completely awesome.  It just took forever to get for some unknown reason, and I don't need to tell you how frustrating it was to watch people come in 10 minutes after you, get the same food you ordered, finish their meal and then leave, all before your food shows up.  Even though it was completely awkward, our waiter did apologize for the delays, but made no effort whatsoever to make it right.  No manager, no reasonable explanation, nothing.  Just a $144 bill.  It took us less than 15 minutes to eat the food that took them more than an hour to prepare.

So, the food was awesome, but the service was absolutely awful.  It was actually like participating in an episode of Hell's Kitchen, wondering if you'll ever actually get the food you ordered.  Except in this case, we got the ""pleasure"" of paying $144 for ""participating"" in this rather disappointing episode.

Gordon Ramsey seriously needs to tune this place.  Incredible food coupled with incredibly awful service essentially equals an awful experience.

With so many other awesome choices available for an outstanding dinner, I absolutely cannot recommend this place.  Even though the food was outstanding, we still left disappointed, and no one should pay $144 to come out of a restaurant disappointed.

I had a delicious ""White Cheddar Garlic Mac and Cheese (Mini Mac)"" and for people who don't like garlic I wouldn't recommend this but I love Mac and Cheese and garlic so this was great for me because the taste of garlic is definitely noticeable in this dish. This was more of a pub type item with a hint of grill with the added grace ad class of white cheddar and garlic. If it would have only been Mac and cheese this would have been a complete pub food item. 
One of the other items I had was ""Smoked Salmon Toast"" which was my favourite of the tree items. However, I like toast to be medium toasty not completely toasty so this was extremely crunchy and even hurt the roof of my mouth a touch but was my favourite. However, this is a typical dish so it is hard to go wrong with. 
I also had the ""White Bean Hummus""which I wanted because the other options such as beer nuts or house marinated olives did not sound appetizing to me. You may not think that white bean hummus would taste different than a regular hummus made from chickpeas... but it does and its great.

Menu tip: they have a bar menu & a dinner menu. So make sure to ask for both. If you sit at the bar you can only order from the bar menu.

Our waiter came with no intro, instead just asked us if we had any questions or not. Then we ordered the Shepherds Pie, the Steak & Ale Pie and happy hour Truffle Chips. 

Food came within 5 minutes. That's impressively fast for starving people. Food tasted very good!

We 2 persons did the Yelp check-in with a free sticky toffee pudding. The waiter brought in 1 portion only. After he checked with his colleague. He came back and said they offered 1 per table. That's ok, but hope they indicate this restriction on the redeem page.

Never knew his name until persons seated next to us. As he did a full introduction to them with recommendations. We found funny that a waiter mentioned to the customers that certain dishes he did not suggest as they weren't his favourite. Lol...

   We should have checked the menu before going in though, because we really wanted to try a burger, but there was none on the menu.  Fortunately, our server told us he could get us one from the bar area, so that made us very happy! (we probably should have just gone to the bar, but we didn't know there were two different menus).

   Having come from Happy Hour elsewhere not long before, we both just hydrated with iced tea, which was okay tea.  And since we weren't starving, we opted to share three things:  The onion soup, the burger and the infamous sticky toffee pudding.

  The soup was possibly the best onion soup I've ever had...the broth was rich and delicious.  Not sure about anything that tasted like welsh cheddar rarebit though?  

   Big plus on the burger, they were kind enough to split it for us, so they brought us each a plate with fries.  The burger was very tasty, had a bit of a smokey flavor.  Good, but not the best we've ever had.  Husband kept saying he thought there was another meat in it besides beef...I don't know about that, I think he was tasting bacon.  The fries were okay, but unevenly cooked.  Some were mushy, some crisp and some in between.  

  The highlight was definitely the sticky toffee pudding.  Yep, it ranks right up there in sweet heaven like everyone says.

  Service was also like most everyone has said.  SLOW SLOW SLOW.  We were in there for what felt like forever.  We even got to know our two-top neighbors from Canada, who seemed to enjoy the beet salad they shared and their scallop entrees.

We ordered the lobster roll appetizer, it came as one thing, and we asked the waiter to split it and he didn't cut if very well, so it was really hard to share. None of the appetizers looked good for sharing, except the calamari, but i've had enough calamari this year.

So I ordered the lamb burger, kind of a long wait to get the food. We took pictures with the British background while we waited and posted on facebook. It was nice for social media purposes, I guess. We had the bad luck of ending up with a wobbly table and it ended up shaking and spilling water everywhere and the cloth napkins were water-resistant so it was hard to clean up. 

The burger itself was pretty good, although it was strange that I couldn't tell if it was beef or lamb- i'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. The cheese on the burger was good and the fries were good. My boyfriend got the salmon, which was good as well.

He needs to come to this location and train these cooks... better yet insult them. KIDDING. When I took a bite out of my Butter Chicken Curry, it was very bland, along with the saffron rice. Curry and saffron rice are supposed to be flavorful, which they both lacked.. I guess I shouldn't have expected a strong flavor of curry since this is a pub & grill... BUT its GORDON RAMSAY! Why put it on the menu if its not a dish you specialize in. Note: the menu is pretty limited with signature dishes.

My bf got the fish and chips with peas, and that was just okay as well... IDK if it was an off day or what, but everything felt under-salted. The experience there was also meh, service was just OK,  the waiter asked us how our mixed greens salad was, and never checked up on us when we got our entree's. 

Fortunately, there was a good ending to our meal, which was the sticky toffee pudding -- it comes with caramel sauce and vanilla ice-cream (ice cream was the best part) and that kind of made up for the lack of flavor from our dishes, it's really sweet, but the vanilla ice cream gave it a nice balance.


Would I come back?

From jaynefurman.com ""It was beyond sensational."" The drink menu is extensive and they bring it to you on an ipad. Three kinds of pretzel rolls accompanied by an amazing flavored butter and an extraordinary cheese sauce. The burger was flavorful and cooked as ordered, which is phenomenal for any restaurant.  Our group is finicky, so kudos to our superb server, Kimberly, who must have a photographic memory.  The server\/runner Lisa Marie was incredibly helpful and sweet.

Either that or some people get some kind of weird thrill out of nitpicking celeb restaurants rather than reviewing honestly) We ended up here Christmas Eve after deciding that the 4 hour wait for Bacchanal wasn't putting us in the holiday mood. We asked for specific seating (not  wanting to sit at the pub tables) and received it with a smile. 
We started with the pork and duck rillettes, which were delicious and well prepared.
Our table of 3 had the hangar steak, the scallops and the pork belly with the baby carrots and potato puree to share. Steak was flavorful and tender (the server did suggest my Mom order it no more done than medium which was a good call), the scallops were very well done and the pork belly was yummy.
Desserts were beyond good. We had the triple chocolate trifle, the pear crumble and the spotted dog.
Total for our table with 3 entrees, 2 sides, 1 app, 3 desserts, 2 glasses of wine and bottled water was $240. Service was impeccable and friendly.
This is pub food at its best. English pubs, by the way, are not known for huge menus, so to expect a Cheesecake Factory type menu here is ridiculous. It is actually a fairly extensive menu for a pub. Prices were in line with other casino restaurants of the same pedigree.",2,2,2

Arrived here last night at approximately 9:20pm and was told the wait was 35 minutes for a table.  We gave the waitress our cell phone number and she said she would text us once our table was ready... 50 minutes later, we were seated at our table.  The hostess was rude - hardly looked me in the eye, never smiled, and was completely miserable.  - I'm sure Gordon Ramsey would have thrown a few F-bombs. 

My four stars is given to the Traditional Shepard's Pie.  Ohhh baby, it's GOOD.  It's a smaller portion, but don't let that fool you.  This rich, juicy, and savory dish will leave you more than satisfied.  You can tell that the beef in this dish had been marinating in the stock all day.  Needless to say, I ate the entire thing.  

You get a little bread basket before your meal that consists of pretzels and a caraway seed roll.  Salted butter and melted cheese are served next to the breads for dipping.  

My guest had the fish and chips, which were excellent too.  The ""chips"" were my favorite.  They are large, one inch potato sticks seasoned with parmesan cheese and salt - fried perfectly.  If you get another dish without chips, I recommend getting a side of these to try, you can't find them cooked like this anywhere else. 

The dinner was pricey.  Our bill (two entrees and one soda), was $50.00.  This isn't your 'visit-every-week' pub, but it's definitely worth going to - whether a local or a tourist.  I would say, it might be one of the more unique restaurants on the strip, food wise.  

BUT, like I stated before, service needs to be improved.  The hostess made me feel as though she didn't want my business, and I didn't feel very welcomed.  Once I sat down, our waiter was nice, but the hostess ruined the initial experience.",4,3,2

My awesome friend and I came here after shopping and the service was great.  Our servers name was Mike and he was really tentative and provided great input for the drinks and food on the menu.  

Based on his recommendation I ordered the Pub Crawl... I was in the mood for something where I could taste the alcohol.  I never had bourbon and I wanted to try something new... Definitely a great recommendation Mike, both my friend and I really enjoyed it.  My friend had a beer, I have no idea what it's called, just came in a cool gray bottle (I don't drink beer, but it's there fav one so I'm glad they had it there)

So the food.. Uhh so good.
For the Starters or App we had the Pork and Duck Rillettes.  That was delicious.  I will say it was interesting as well b\/c I've never had anything like it.

For the real deal we had the Fish and Chips and the Grilled Lamb Burger... OMG the burger was the kind that melts in your mouth... We took Mike's recommendation on ordering it medium... Yeah that was good.  I was a little nervous ordering fish and chips b\/c I didn't think they could be any different, but once again Mike was right and the fish was amazing.  The breading melts in your mouth and doesn't fall off the fish.. Tartar sauce was good with it, and the peas were more for decoration for me, but they were actually seasoned well too.

I know Ramsay and he would have expected nothing less than perfection at one of his restaurants.  I can't wait to go back on my next visit!!  We were definitely in food heaven going here!!  I will save a little room for dessert on round 2 and I will try some of Ramsay's other places on the next visit.",1,0,1

I've learned not to always judge a book by its cover so I still decided to give this place a try. 

We went to dinner on a Sunday evening. Made reservations around 7:45p and this place was pretty busy.  My boyfriend ordered the Pistachio Pesto Chicken Sandwich-it's a cold sandwich by the way. Also ordered truffle fries. He enjoyed it. I had a bite and it was pretty good. 

However.....I ordered an 8 oz burger, the waiter asked if I wanted cheese...I declined. But when the burger arrived....the burger was just a plain bun and the meat. I was thinking...okay...that's odd. Maybe these fancy-smancy restaurants make their burgers like that. It was plain and boring. Yes...I get it. I ordered a ""boring dish."" But sometimes, a good restaurant can turn the most simple dish into something that will tickle your tastebuds and leave you wanting more. 
We decide to ask the waiter what happened to the condiments. Where's the lettuce...tomatoes...onions...etc? He told us we were supposed to order that if we wanted it. -__- ugh. Thanks for your help, waiter. You were such a helpful guy. *insert sarcastic tone here.* So remember..FYI...IF you ever order the burger here, make sure to ask for veggies!!!!! What kind of restaurant don't automatically give you the lettuce to your burger? It's like ordering a chicken pot pie without the chicken. 

Also, the price for what we paid was NOT worth the quality of the food. $17 for the pesto chicken sandwich and $18 for a plain ol tasteless hamburger. Disappointing. I'm never coming back here.",6,9,4

My boyfriend he is a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen so I picked this place since it was open for lunch. The decor was really fun and it had a British punk vibe. Our server was incredible sweet and nice.

Main lobster roll appetizer - two mini Lobster rolls, kinda felt like what sliders are to hamburgers. Very delicious and buttery.

Fish and chips with mashed peas - my boyfriend loves fish and chips so he ordered this classic. He isn't a huge fan of tartar sauce but really liked the kind served here, it was so fluffy like butter! The mashed peas were a surprise hit for him, since stateside they do not serve mashed peas. they really paired well with the giant pieces of fish.

Rib eye steak - it was good, but a little oversalted for me. I thought about sending it back but it was still decent and I was lazy and didn't want to bother. I was also hungry. The bearnaise sauce was good but too rich to go along. I wish I got a different sauce. It was served simply with asparagus. Not sure if I would pay $45 for it. Eh, I probably should have sent it back.

Sticky toffee pudding - my first time trying this! It was sickly sweet but delicious. The caramel topping had a deep flavor that added to the decadence of the cake. It reminds me of a very moist cake. You can taste the dates in it, but it's well blended, no chunks of dates it's just a well soaked cake. If you have a sweet tooth I wouldn't skip it. Sugar load in the best way!

All in all we had a good experience, I would round to 3.5 stars but rounded down due to my indifference about the steak. Should have been perfectly seasoned for $45,",0,1,0

It took 10 minutes to be properly greeted. When we were greeted it was quick short and in a rush and not personable. Another 10 minutes to receive water and my iced tea took even longer. 

We ordered an appetizer which took atleast 30 minutes. I would guess our order was not even put in because our server ran by our table to tell us our dinner was on the way and we were already at 40 minutes from out initial order. 

I spoke with the manager and the only thing he was able to do was provide us with a free B-day dessert which we would have not ordered in the first place, and decided to take off my iced tea from the bill. All together our food took about 1 1\/2 hours to receive, and the overall time took 2+ hours.

I've watched Hell's Kitchen, but only religiously during season 1 and 2. I highly enjoy the world of cooking and creating a meal that's enjoyable on all levels. I've wanted to eat at a Ramsay restaurant for some time now, and I finally got that chance! 

Now, let's talk about the atmosphere. The decorations, the barrels (or maybe kegs?) on the walls, the lighting, the choice of color, the ""British Art Decor"" on the wall; all of it was highly appealing and fit for a ""British Pub and Dinner Grill environment"". It actually encouraged to eat. Even the dang menu was fancy and red and nice, and it was pushing me to try this stuff. I loved it. 

Now let's get to the food. I ate 'Bangers and Mash' a traditional British meal consisting of sausages and potatoes, and this had been spruced up a bit for Ramsay's Establishment. It was a small portion (I can consume so much, so to my standards it was small), but the presentation was superb. The taste was amazing too, the potatoes were great and they deliciously went well with the three sausages I had! And those three babies had been cooked just right too, it was ridiculous. 

I also tried a bit of the ""Rueben sand which"", a corned beef, rye breaded and Swiss cheesed (mind the grammar) American made meal. The Rueben was great; it fell apart nicely with one bite. Not too tough to overcome at all. The bread was soft and tasty and the meat tasted great as well. 

Finally, I had some a delicious spot of some cake. Not too sure what it was but at first, it didn't look too appealing. And then man. Bit into that buggar and my mouth was having a holiday. Again, the quality was great and it came apart quite nice in my mouth, and the taste just overtook my tongue. It was not too sweet at all, it was probably one of the best desserts I've had for some time. 

Now, price wise? Quite the tab, but quality definitely ran rampant in the meal I devoured. You definitely get some high quality chow that doesn't disappoint. I'm really starting to appreciate this sort of eating. 

I also highly appreciated being able to eat some actual European themed food. It's not too often that you come upon a British or German restaurant. Heck, it's hard enough to find something Norwegian or Scottish. Most European themed places are Irish pubs for the most part. It was great to actually be cultured with some English recipes. 

Would o return? Definitely would. My only disappointment was not being able to see Gordon Ramsay yell at some. But we can't all get everything we want.",0,0,0

I had the Bangers and Mash, wife had Prime Rib. Quite frankly, both wee under seasoned. My Banger quite small. :) and the mash was too creamy. Wife's prime rib really needed a bit more seasoning. Horseradish tasted really watered down.

Service was good, though it did take a little longer than expected for the entrees, especially since our appetizer came out super fast. We also had the ""DIC"" desert. Keep in mind, there's Bourbon in the caramel, so be aware. It was delicious, by far the best part of the Menu.

Overall, for the price we paid two, the Baccanal Buffet would of been a much better value and experience.",1,0,0

Food was all great, cocktails were great too. I can get great food and great cocktails at about 100 different places just off the top of my head. All 100 of them also provide service.

Greeting took 10-15, i  wasnt checking my watch because I was trying  to avoid my wife becoming aware of the lengthy wait, not because she is a bitch, because i didnt want her experience going south upon arrival.

cocktails took about 5 minutes.  not terrible, not quick (it was a monday night and not very busy)

Long story short, the service was sluggish at best, the server was friendly and generally acknowledged that things were moving slowly and she apologized. water under the bridge for us. the food made up for it..

Then the manager happened. Not the younger guy who had stopped by our table once to say hello and ensure we were happy. Not him at all, this manager was the old guy, the one wandering around the restaurant not talking  to anyone. the one who spent all his time chatting up the hostesses until....

He turned all of the music off and all of the tv's off 15 minutes till 11. at first I thought this was odd (i thought they closed at 1030) i then remembered that they closed at 11.

For apps we had Pretzel Sticks and Onion Rings.  My ten year old, who doesn't eat onions, tried an onion ring and gave a thumbs up.  The pretzel sticks were soft on the inside with a dark, chewy exterior.  Delicious!
Our main courses were the Fish and Chips, Hell's Kitchen Ghost Pepper Burger and a Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  The light crispy batter on the fish was out of this world.  Chips were seasoned wedge-ish shapes, crispy outside and soft inside, yum.  I had the Ghost Pepper burger and was delightfully pleased with the heat level, knowing it wouldn't be crazy hot for the masses and hopeful it would have a nice bite.  The after-burn was perfect.  Chicken Pesto was delicious as well.
Dessert we had to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding at the suggestion of the waiter, knowing full well they push certain dishes but he didn't steer us wrong with the appetizers.  OMG!!!  When we got back to our room I immediately began searching for recipes (still haven't tried it though).  The Sticky Toffee Pudding is to DIE for, I have no more words.  Just thinking about makes my mouth water.  Ok.
Our waiter was great, staff makes the experience.  He took our order with no notes and we all received exactly what we ordered.  I was in the mood for a cocktail and asked for his recommendation and he brought me a drink with blackberry and something else.  I don't remember, but it was super tasty.  Not too sweet with whatever alcohol in the background.
If we lived closer I would definitely go back and tell all my friends about it (I'll do that anyway).  Two thumbs WAY up!",0,0,0

The look and feel of the place is a hip, upscale pub.  There is a a big bar, tons of tables and then some booths too.  It is a really big space and it is lined with lots of big TVs if you want to watch a game (they had soccer on while we were there).  All the waitresses are in newsprint and safety pin dresses and the waiters are in skinny black jeans and spiked suspenders.  It is modern hip punk....whatever!  I liked it all, it worked.  

We basically ordered burgers and beer.  Their drinks menu is on an ipad that they bring over and let you flip through so you can see pretty pictures of whatever you want to order.  Drinks are Vegas prices (so high).  Our Sam Adams was like $9.  The burgers came out and they were thick and well cooked.  The fries that come with it, as many have commented, are different.  They are a very, very think cut steak fry.  It is almost like they quarter a potato and deep fry it (to give you a visual on how thick they were).  I loved both my burger and my fries.  The burger had great flavor & it was juicy. The fries were fully cooked and had a bit of crust, but were a little more mushy in the middle.  They had a great flavor though and I loved the different take on a classic.

For the prices charged here I just don't think this one made the mark. For lunch I ordered the Burger. The burger here is massive and you better be hungry if you expect to eat it all. The burger was also quite good. If I was doing this review solely on the burger would be 4 stars. However my Husband ordered the Calamari and it was awful. For $18 it should be fresh and this was anything but. It was chewy and loaded with salt. If this dish was on hells kitchen Gordon would thrown it right in the garbage. The pretzels were also just ok nothing special. If you go here stick to the burger but if you are going for a burger you are also much better off at Gordon Ramsay's other restaurant Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood. Gordon needs to make a surprise visit here because I have a feeling he would rip his name right off the sign if he tried the food being served here.,1,0,0

Spent $300 on drinks and food, and then was ASKED TO LEAVE. I was still not even finished with my wine. In 30 years of dining experience I have never been asked to leave a restaurant until now. I ordered 3 times in 2 and a half hours. WORST experience I have ever had.

Was also served stale wine, when I requested a new bottle, I was served wrong one.

Servers shift changed and a server never came to replace the other one. Even when I went to the MANAGER to ask for another server, I still never got one. I had to get my own server.

Along with this horrible experience, they also put $30 of beer that I didn't order on my bill.
After that, finally got a glass of wine after waiting 20 minutes. And then was asked to leave!

For added detail, we were sitting in the BAR AREA. Taking up only 2 seats (me and my husband.) 
 
Don't ever eat here if you actually want to sit and enjoy you food. Bad wine.

 The service needs a lot of work as it is dreadfully slow. The time it took just to take our order, receive our drinks and get our bread was pushing 35+ minutes - underscored by the fact that the Pub was at about 70% capacity.

 The food was very good. My app and entree was very good as were my buddies'. 

 I read some comments on here, which are really short sighted. Of course it is expensive - you are in Vegas and at Caesers Palace. I paid $5.90 for a large coffee at the damn food court nearby. Everything is over priced there. Room service for 2 burgers at Caesars was about $75 so compared to room service this is a bargain.

The staff seemed disoriented and somewhat aloof. Not sure what the culture is there, but it is different from the other GR places I've been.

Perhaps that is why the restaurant seems to have hit or miss reviews right now. The show finished filming awhile ago so the new head chef has already been chosen, but they can't be seen at the restaurant since that would give away the ending of the show. Having an absentee head chef certainly can't be helping. Even though overall I had a good dining experience, the restaurant was not without its rough edges.

We showed up around 9pm without reservations, but were able to get seated on the restaurant side almost immediately. They put our party of 5 at a table for 4. There were plenty of other tables, but we were told they had all been reserved. Of course they remained empty the rest of the night (we were there until closing) despite a post show rush right after we arrived. This was annoying, but pretty common for Las Vegas as almost no one charges a reservation no show fee.

Our server was pretty awesome. He was funny and really knew the food. Pretty much everyone working there was great from the hostess to the runners. The one big exception was one particularly sour runner. When she brought our starters I told her I did not have a fork and she snapped ""well, then I'll bring you one"" at me. She then brought me 3 forks and four knives. I shrugged this off as maybe a poorly executed attempt at humor. Later on, one of our party asked her for more bread, a fairly common request at a restaurant and one that other reviewers made with no difficulties, but she reacted with shock and began to tell us that wasn't allowed. Before she could finish, she cut herself off and said she would let the server know. Maybe she did, but I doubt it since we just saw her go off to the back while our server was elsewhere in the restaurant helping put some smaller tables together for a big group since heaven forbid they actually seat someone at one of the reserved tables that obviously weren't coming. When they brought out our entrees, she didn't bring mine and asked me what I ordered. After I told her she went to get it and plooped it down in front of me before walking away without a word. I guess that's what I get for asking for a fork.

The food was excellent all around, although the menu seemed too small. We later found out that the menu was once nearly twice the size, but they trimmed it down to just the most popular items. In my humble opinion, they went a bit too far with the trimming. The small plates (appetizers) menu now only has 5 choices and 3 of them are cold seafood items. There were 5 seafood items and 8 meat items (actually 7 since the beef cheeks were not available the evening we dined). There may or may not have been an entree sized salad since the menu did not differentiate them. The most expensive salad was only $4 more than the salad I had as a starter so I don't think it was entree size.

For starters I had the Herb Caesar Salad. The server warned that it came with ""a lot"" of anchovies which I was OK with, but it turns out it just came with one small anchovy. It was a good, if not particularly memorable salad. Another member of our party ordered the smashed potatoes and sauteed asparagus as her starters. They are technically sides, but none of the other starters interested her so she ordered them as starters. I thought the potatoes were good, but the asparagus was just OK for me. Another member of our party ordered the Pub ""Spots"" which are described as sliders on the menu, but the name ""Spots"" is a better description. They were very good, but also very small. You could finish the whole plate in 3 bites. We also had two members of our party order soups which they said were delicious, but I didn't get a chance to try.

For entrees, my friend and I each had a shepherd's pie. Since we were both quite hungry we were a little disappointed at how small it looked, but looks can be deceiving. The little pot they are served in is quite deep and there is a decent amount of food in there. I ended up completely satisfied and can say that this was the best shepherd's pie I have ever had. I also got to try the Scottish Salmon, rib eye steak, and the rack of lamb. All three were delicious. The rack of lamb in particular stood out because I love lamb, but am weary about ordering it in restaurants because often the portions are on the small side. The lamb here is a very hearty portion. Of course for dessert I had to try the sticky toffee. It was delicious. I can see why it is Gordon Ramsay's signature dessert. My friend ordered the chocolate trifle. We shared both desserts with the whole table and while the trifle was OK, the sticky toffee disappeared far quicker.

So overall I had a great experience except for the one bitter food runner. I could see myself coming back, but unless they expand that menu a bit I don't think I would come that often.",1,0,0

Rather dried out. If you watch Gordon Ramsay's Hells kitchen on TV, you know he insists upon properly seasoned food. With today's lamb shank, I had to ask for salt as it definitely lacked  seasoning.  On the positive side, after the manager asked me how I liked the lamb, he was gracious enough to cut my bill in half.

5 of the 6 of us had the prime rib, the 6th (damn combo-breaker), had something else which I don't remember.

In any case, the meal was excellent. The prime rib was perfectly marbled, had the right amount of seasoning and tasted exactly how it should. I will say, generally speaking, either restaurants don't know what the hell ""medium rare"" means or they're afraid of getting sued if someone eats meat too underdone and gets sick. Medium-rare seems to be always served as Medium.

The Yorkshire pudding that came with it was also excellent. Fluffy and flavourful. I don't see this served with prime rib in other restaurants as much as I'd like to.

The service was adequate but not spectacular by any stretch. Drinks came in a reasonable amount of time, as with the food. Refills were a touch slow.

Back to the food...I had the crispy calamari as an appetizer and the fish and chips as the main course. 

The crispy calamari should have been called the nothing special calamari for 18 bucks. There definitely was no crisp to it and the actual calamari was just ok. 

Now the fish and chips.....the fish was cooked well but just having literally watched the master chef episode where they cooked the most amazing looking fish and chips, I was excited.

i ordered medium-rare and bf ordered medium, they switched our orders and i ended up with the medium burger wondering why such an expensive burger couldn't be cooked the way i wanted it. upon inspection we realized that our burgers had been switched (which is strange because the waiter made a big deal of putting a flag on one of the burgers to remember which is which, lol) and so we traded burgers. the medium-rare was downright cold, which isn't how a proper burger patty should be.

the salad was really much too mild in flavor because the dressing didn't have enough kick. there were anchovies in the salad but they weren't salty, just oily and bland. overall the salad lacked salt and since there was no salt or pepper on the table i couldn't adjust the taste for myself.

the fries were really good though. crispy and garlicky, my favorite kind of fries :)",0,0,1

It is a restaurant that brings the British Pub experience to you with the atmosphere as well as the authentic British pub foods that it offers.

Upon walking up to the front entrance of the restaurant, I noticed a bunch of barrels stacked on top of each other.  The decor of the place was pretty cool.  The lighting was very dim and obviously this is a casual restaurant since it is supposed to mimic a British pub.  The pub has 36 different beers on tap as well as another 63 different bottled beers.  I don't drink so this was not a selling point for me.  I was more there for the Gordon Ramsay food and because the winner of Hell's Kitchen for one of the seasons was supposed to be the main chef at this particular restaurant. 

The bf and I did not have to make reservations to Pub & Grill and we were glad to find out that there was no wait time.  This was possibly the foreshadowing of what was to come after we were seated.

Pub & Grill does serve a 3-course meal, but since the bf and I had just done the Hell's Kitchen courses at Gordon Ramsay's Steak inside Paris the night before, we decided not to do the courses at Pub & Grill.  We both ordered our own dishes and shared.

We ordered the GRP Lolli-Pop Chicken Wings which came with a stilton blue cheese dip.  You can either order a dozen wings which is $22 or 1\/2 dozen wings which is $12.  As you can see from the picture, I felt like we got ripped off.  All we got were luke warm puny looking chicken wings that were overpriced in my opinion.  For $12, you'd expect to at least not be served wings from anorexic chickens.  Is it too much to expect hot food instead of warm?  Ramsay would be fuckin' pissed if he was there.

Next, we ordered the 9 oz Grilled Lamb Burger which consists of caramelized onions with a goats cheese-feta spread & rosemary brioche bun and is served with fries & a house pickle.  The price of this burger was $21.  The waitress couldn't stop raving about how good this burger was and that she highly recommended it.  The Grilled Lamb Burger came out and honestly, there was nothing special about it.  It tasted like any regular lamb burger.  For being pricey, you'd expect it to taste amazing or at least have a wow factor to it.  Nope!  It was a huge disappointment.  We should have demanded our money back and spent it on the burgers at BurGR.  At least they were a little bit cheaper and taste amazing!

The last dish we ordered was the Pan-Seared Diver Scallops which came with steamed clams, leeks, potato-bacon chowder & confit tomatoes.  This dish was $32.  This was another dish that came out luke warm.  For being super expensive, the clams were tiny and the chowder didn't really have much flavor.  It almost tasted as though someone had forgotten to season it.  This was a huge disappointment.  It was definitely not worth the money.  While eating this dish, I bit into a small piece of the clam shell that was mixed into the chowder.  

Pub & Grill is Ramsay's worse restaurant in Vegas.  He needs to pay a visit there and make sure that everything is up to his standards.  Being served warm food is not acceptable unless that is how British pub food is served.  If that's the case, I do apologize in advance for talking shit.  Overall, the customer service was alright.  The food is way overpriced and it is not worth it so I don't recommend anyone going here.",5,6,0

It was a bit too late for the two little ones so we showed up early in hopes there might be a table.

They offered to seat us in the bar area up front but later on when I passed by the main dining room on the way to the restroom, I saw tons of empty tables. :\/
The bar seating is fine for grown ups but tough for little ones due to the height & no backs.

Service was great here. Food was okay.
It is pub food & not meant to be high end frou frou. I tried Ramsay's high end restaurant in Hollywood thanks to DineLA. I LOVED the food there.

I got the Hangar steak with fries here at the pub but thought the steak was under seasoned (for my taste). But it had great beef flavor & was tender.
Fries were ok.

I tried a bite of our friend's fish of his fish & chips (the fries that came with the burger at our table & my steak were all the same.) While the fish was not super moist, the batter was amazing. I'd get the fish & chips were I ever to return. They give you a lot of food with this plate!

Overall, the food is simple but for the price, lacked a little something....extra. I guess you're just paying for the name Gordon Ramsay.

One other thing to note....this is more a Harrah's thing than Ramsay's thing but photographers go around & take pictures of your table & then mildly try to pressure you to purchase the pictures after they print them. What's funny is they photoshop a picture of a pixie sized Ramsay standing on your table. A bit odd!",4,1,1

We were impressed with the tap beer selection and ordered a Boddington's and Fuller's ESB.  Both were poured well and were great.  The beers were a bit cold for these types of beers.  It was nice to find these on tap in Las Vegas!

We decided to get a snack and ordered the crispy bait (some name like that).  The small fish were perfectly fried and had a crispy, light breading.  We changed from the standard lemon aioli to the curry aioli served with a separate menu item and really enjoyed that with the fish.  Maybe they could make an aioli choice with these standard on the menu.

Bar service was perfect and we appreciated bartender Rains work.

They ended up giving and extra one for free which was very nice of them. Service was great! It was super busy but still ended up getting a table within 15 min.

Sadly no. Just no. In fact ""HELL NO"".

I came in with a group of 5 people to celebrate a birthday and try an early dinner since the latest winner of Hell's Kitchen had arrived 2 weeks ago. From my experience I feel like a bad friend for suggesting the place.

Really when you goto a restaurant there are 3 different things that you rate the place by: atmosphere (looks), food, and service. You measure your expectations of these things by location, chef, and price. So lets run down the list shall we?

The place itself is on the main casino floor of caesars casino and they had a great time decorating it with a lot of british pub flair that still is up beat and modern looking. So really they nailed it here. The bar area is very inviting and tvs on the walls make it comfy and the restaurant area is equally inviting. 

The problem of course is when you go to order the actual food. As I said we came in for an early dinner (6pm) so the venue was fully staffed and maybe only 20% full with patrons. This should be an easy task for the staff. But, my experience rendered that assumption otherwise. To be fair our waiter was extremely up beat and full of suggestions and we were sat quite quickly so I can put most of the onus of service issues on back of house. But upon ordering it took almost 30 minutes for the table to get their alcoholic drinks. That just doesn't ring well with anyone. Especially a group of people that are in the mood to celebrate. Whats even worse is the food took well over 40 min before appetizers and starters came out with one of the more attentive managers checking in on us the entire time being very shocked that food was moving so slow that I could have walked into the mall, ordered food at any other place, taken it to go, and eaten it before our starters came out. 

So lets talk about whats really most important, the food! Since we were in a group of mixed friends that all love to eat we kind of did a one of everything approach to our starters and shared whatever came out. This would be cool if there was some hit or misses but, in our case the entire table just got more disheartened right up front after the long wait which is kind of a great way to crush the excitement and spirits of your guests prior to the main course I guess. The sliders were way over cooked, the fried calamari was bland, the scotch egg was downright forgettable, the toad in the hole should have stayed in whatever hole it came from as it was absent of any real flavor, and the lobster roll had an odd after taste to it (more on this later). The only positives here were the fries and the lollipop wings. In fact we scarfed the fries because they were the only thing stood out as not just edible but tasty with the included aioli. 

So lets say if you order starters the only thing nearly worth while are the fries. From a british gastropub? Wrong on so many levels.

So now lets move onto the main course. Something you would want to do in a decent time after the first round of food. But, the kitchen staff had the idea of letting us wait till we were really hungry for it before serving it. Yes I am being sarcastic, no it wasn't cool, and as you can guess it was far from worth the wait. So the main course comes after 2 more rounds of drinks that took to long and a manger was still ""shocked"" at the food service time. If you're counting at home do the math and you can see this is entirely too long. The next round of food included the wedge salad that wasn't even a wedge and the dressing didn't even have the right to call itself Bleu Cheese as it lacked any flavor and was so watery we wondered what the dressing did to offend the chef, the scallops that hey were cooked perfectly yet lacked any trace of seasoning, the lobster mac & cheese that we all agreed should have skipped the lobster, the chicken pot pie with a perfect crust yet lacked any flavor from the inside ingredients and the short rib that was so unbelievably void of the texture and flavor that it was sent back with the question of why a place like this would serve something that is supposed to be flavorful and tender but comes off like a bad croc pot version of pot roast. The one shining positive was the BLT which we all agreed just nailed it.

So after trying almost half the menu we are left with fries and the BLT being the only things that are positive standouts? At this price point?!?!? Are you kidding me? 

When it comes to dessert the sticky toffee pudding was however to die for. 

Oh remember the lobster? Yeah all 3 people that had it felt slightly ill after. This place is a kitchen nightmare. Such a let down and a terrible experience.",4,5,4

The meal we experienced would have invoked rage in the man himself had he been served such mediocre food. 

Starting with a Scotch Eggs ($9) - Eggs are plural, meaning more than one. We were served a sole lonely egg - just one. Appearance was nice, but there were more pickled vegetables than Scotch Egg. The egg itself, which is supposed to be soft boiled, was right on the edge of hard boiled. Sausage was bland and crumbly. The hit of the dish was the mustard, yes, the mustard. 

Main course:
Mini Pie Sampling of All Three Pies ($21) - 
The menu was accurate with this description - they are definitely MINI. These ""pies"" are more like pie sliders. Barely a taste of each for what was supposed to be my main meal. The meats and vegetables inside were perfectly cubed, which made it look like those old Swanson turkey pot pies - taste was about the same.  I could not discern a noticeable taste difference between the three, so I can't label a favorite - all were below average. 
The pies come complete with a puzzle for your dining entertainment \/ frustration. Take note of the long wooden basket with the thick wooden dowel running the length over the pies. Trying to eat with a dowel running interference is brilliant if the point is to slow you down. Practical no, frustrating - yes. 
Why didn't I simply remove the pies do you ask? The server will warn you that the ramekins are blisteringly hot...

Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ($28) - 
My petite wife scored with the largest serving size of the day! There were several nice pieces of fish, which were flaky and cooked perfectly. However, having seen Ramsey's perfect fish & chips on TV, these would also have not made the pass. The batter was not crisp - soft and pliable would be a better description. 
The chips - try to find them in the photo... still looking? There are a smidgen tucked under the fish - under the fish, where they can steam and lose ALL crispiness. No crunch in the bunch. As Gordon would say, ""Damn...""
Ah-ha, there was malt vinegar in a little pour bottle on the table, love malt vinegar on fish & chips! Tipped the bottle and a tsunami of vinegar filled the basket, spilled over the edge and all over the table, stopping short of becoming sour perfume all over my wife lest it not for quick reflexes snapping the bottle back to attention. 

Desert....not a chance.

Server...very animated and could tell loved his job, but once the food came, was absent until the check appeared. It seems like he was trying to cover one to many tables and a table of two obviously wasn't going to make him as much as the other larger tables that received lots of attention. If he had made the rounds during our meal, we certainly would have made our feelings regarding the food known.

Highlights: Yes, there was one - I had a pint of the Innis & Gunn ($11) - quite pricey, but not available anywhere else in Vegas that I know of, so it was enjoyable.

Overall, to sum up the meal and experience at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill Las Vegas, no arm flailing or curse words although it may have made me feel better. I am simply at a loss...

I think Gordon himself would sum it up all to well...

We ordered the Maine lobster and shrimp roll minis as one of our entrée, to save space for dessert. It was a well grilled brioche and the lemon- garlic mayo with the seafood was really nice.
The butter chicken curry was authentic. It was as Indian as Indian gets! It was served with a flavorful saffron basmati rice , and a fluffy naan bread, with a side of raita ( yoghurt).
The bangers and mash was great too!! It nice sized portion with English sausages made of a trio of meats. The gravy went well with the sausages and the creamy mash potatoes.

Upon entering the hotel room I immediately noticed a magazine with Gordon Ramsay on the front ""Ramsay takes over Vegas"" Being a HUGE fan, I read it and got giddy when I found out that not only did Pub & Grill open already, but Burgr was planned to open that very night!! (Turns out it opened earlier in the week, but IT WAS OPEN).  

We decided to hit Pub and Grill on Saturday night. Josh was our waiter and I swear he had ESP. Every time we mentioned something we needed POOF there he was with it in hand or said...hey could you use...... I jokingly asked him if the bulldog lamp was wired. Josh was simply amazing. I can't say it enough. I would say he gave us the best service out of all the places we ate at this year. He gets brownie points for remembering my name is Darlene, so many people two minutes later forget and call me Diane, Donna...something with a D. 

Ok now for the food. I ordered the Shephard's Pie and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger. The Shephard's Pie was good at first. The mashed potatoes were amazing. However, I quickly discovered I didn't care for lamb, my first time ever trying it. I ate about 1\/2 of the dish. I soooo wanted to love it, but just couldn't. My boyfriend loved his lamb burger, said it was in his top 10 of burgers. We ordered dessert, I got the sticky toffee pudding and he got the chocoloate trifle. OH MY GOD!!! The sticky toffee pudding was to die for. I could eat that everyday!! The warm sauce topping the cake with a side of frozen cream was just fantastic.

Ambiance: This place looks amazing! It's got a very modern and sleek design and I loved it!

The Price: Get your wallets ready because there's a big price attached to this place. I was prepared for it and I didn't flinch because it's a Ramsay restaurant. I'm paying premium prices for high quality food. Entrees ran around $27-$30, sandwiches around $20-25, starters anywhere from $8-$20, and sides around $12. Unfortunately, the value was extremely lacking. The portions were fine, but the quality was terrible.

The Food: This was the biggest disappointment I've had in a very long time. 

My fiance ordered the Bangers and Mash. It's Ramsay and it's a British pub so I'm thinking you can't possibly screw this up.... wrong! I was actually INSULTED at what we received for the $30. They served dehydrated potatoes. Guys... even chilis bar and grill serves me real potatoes when they serve mash! When I'm served dehydrated potatoes at $30 a meal that is Unacceptable. Period. There's an expectation of value and quality that comes with that name and that price.

He sent it back for Fish and Chips. This meal was acceptable... not excellent, delicious, amazing, or worth the cost of the $30. It means he ate it without issues. That's not good enough for a Ramsay place. Do better!

I ordered the Chicken Tikki. I was assured that they used Ramsay's recipe for this dish, which may be why I was satisfied. My dish was good. The chicken was well proportioned and well seasoned. I had just enough naan for all my chicken and just enough yogurt to blend well with the tikki sauce. The down side of my dish was the rice. It was boxed rice with very little seasoning and it was not cooked properly.. While I can say that this dish was good and recommend it (aside from the rice), I can't say that it was head and shoulders above anywhere else. My local place is almost as good as this. Ramsay's tikki should be incomparable. 

I wanted to try the Mac and cheese because I know it's one of Ramsay's signatures but I'm allergic to lobster. Luckily, there was a starter option called Little Mac. There are a few flavor options and I went for the Jalapeño Bacon option. The predominant flavor of the dish was jalapeno, not cheese. The cheese was such a subtle flavor that it felt more like texture than a main component. I did not taste cheese. The noodles were cooked better than the rice but overall I'd say this dish was just okay.

The Speed: There are a couple speed components here - kitchen and service. I'll address Kitchen first and talk about service as my final piece. Too fast! I know Ramsay is all about speed and this is great! You don't want to wait forever for your food! However.... you DO want fresh food made to order at a place with Gordon Ramsay in the name of the restaurant. My Mac and cheese came out maybe 5 minutes after I ordered. Sure, ok... it's a starter so I'll be lenient. The noodles were likely precooked to al dente to speed the process. However, our meals came out within seconds of my starter being presented to me. WAY too fast!! No way do fresh bangers AND tikki chicken come out that quickly if they were made to order. Simply not possible. This made me feel extremely rushed... I picked the starter with the intention of having time to enjoy it before my meal came out because the flavors don't mix without time to cleanse your palate. On top of that, it made me feel as if all our food had been pre-made in morning prep then stuck in microwaves when it was ordered. This is what I'd expect of a chain restaurant... NOT what I'd expect of a $30 entree attached to the name Gordon Ramsay. How disappointing. 

The Service: Our server was Michael. He was the one redeeming factor of our visit. I work in the restaurant industry, and over the past 10 years have been both a cook and a server, and his service truly blew me away. It's so rare these days to find a server like him. He struck the perfect balance of being approachable without hovering, made menu recommendations with ease, and never let our glasses empty before refilling. He handled the sent back dish smoothly and without making us feel awkward about it. If only the back of house was as phenomenal as the service!!

Overall this place has received 2\/5 stars, with the ambiance and service keeping it from a 1 star review.

We came in late one evening, and the place was absolutely packed. Now, I understand the place is not geared for kids, there was no kids menu available. But I really appreciated their accommodating our little party. The manager made a special point greeting our little munchkin, and made her day by giving her a Gordon Ramsay pen...it instantly became her favorite art instrument of choice.

The deviled eggs were expensive, at over $3 per bite, but really surprisingly bland. Fish and chips consisted of two huge fillets of crispy but bland fried cod, a nice version of mushy peas, and large serving of steak fries that were just meh. The $45 ribeye was a perfect medium rare, but was marred by being excessively gristly and fatty without being particularly marbled. The accompanying bear aide sauce was a cold, congealed mess. Come on Gordon, at these prices you can afford to serve better quality than this! 

Speaking of prices, single bottles of hard cider were $11...a ""special"" was a bucket of five beers for the low, discounted price of...$40!  Whoa!",1,1,0

My friend and I didn't believe the restaurant  could be as bad as the reviews claimed. It was worse.

The fish and chips were revolting. I said to my friend, at least the bad reviews usually say the mushy peas are good. FALSE. I managed 2-3 bites of each, as did my friend, before sending it back. The waitress acted like she was doing me a favor by comping it, which was also contingent upon her taking the plates right then. Pretty insulting.

The staff was incompetent and rude. They wandered around clueless of what they should be doing. They would form large packs then break apart and begin wandering again, only to reform the pack in another area.

The sound from the sub woofer which was conveniently located 5 FEET behind my friends chair was an added bonus. We asked that it be turned down. The manager had the waitress tell us ""No"". For the record my friend and I are guys, we were there to eat, drink and watch the games. When I say the sound was to loud, I'm saying we had to lean in and almost yell to converse.

Christopher had several recommendation but when my wife and I were both interested in the Fish and Chips, he suggested that we order one with their dessert add on special and share. We agreed and added a mixed green salad. 

The salad was big enough for three and was very tasty. The fish and chips were delicious, the beer batter very flavorful and the fish itself was cooked to perfection. More than enough again for two of us and we still had dessert to go. 

The sticky toffee pudding to close things out was amazing. Probably the best dessert we have ever tasted and again more than enough for two people to share.

My God, after watching KN & HK, you'd expect nothing but the best.  Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed.  We were there at 6:00 on a Monday night for dinner.  The place was nearly empty.  So whom do they sit next to us, when there are dozens of open seats everywhere?  A table of 4 loud drunks.  The server came up to us immediately, but that was the high point of the evening.

We ordered fish & chips and prime rib, both of which also came to us immediately.  My fish was cold, my fries were cold and greasy, my husband's prime rib was nothing special.  His vegetables were cold and mushy; his mashed potatoes cold and tasteless.  When we questioned the server, he said that the fish & chips were made ""only"" 5-10 minutes before our order.  If he admits to 5-10 minutes, I bet on at least 30.  I thought that Gordon's restaurants always made dinners to order -- at least something as traditional and simple as fish & chips.  How can you screw that up?

Besides that, the place just doesn't feel and look clean.  The silverware is put right on the table, which in our case was covered with sprinkled salt, a sure sign that the table had not been cleaned between diners.  The uniforms of the servers were wrinkled and mismatched.  I'm not sure what look Gordon was seeking, but the servers clearly do not have the same ""vision"".

When we complained to the manager, he was dismissive and condescending, making sure to inform us that ""Gordon had just been there last week and everything was great"".  Well maybe great when the boss is around, but with zero or no quality standards when he is not.

We were in Vegas for opening weekend of the tournament and originally had reservations for Gordon's steak house but after conversing with our bartender a couple days prior he mentioned that pub would be better suited for a larger group. We arrived for our reservation after seeing Seinfeld and were seated promptly, after that its ALL DOWNHILL. It took over 20 minutes just to get water! When the server finally came over he looked confused and to be honest a little pretentious.  I would have expected this from his steakhouse but not the pub. Anyway we put in our appetizer order, calamari and shrimp cocktail, which came out in piece meal again not seeing our waiter this entire time. I will say the shrimp cocktail was the best part of the meal (that's why they received a star) but the calamari left something to be desired. Two people in our party ordered the prime rib and after specifically asking the server how it was given the time (it was 10pm) he noted that it was perfectly cooked and good to go, however what they received was a tough gray log. I ordered the tenderloin medium rare and it came out medium....at best, it was definitely more gray then pink. My one friend might have had it right just ordering a chicken sandwich!

When we arrived, we were escorted to our seats and immediately brought water by a very warm and welcoming waiter. The menu was very broad and seemingly had something for everyone. For what it was, prices were a little on the high side, but as we are on vacation, we ordered and that's where things began to slip.

My girlfriend and I both opted for the chicken madras, my mum got the bangers and mash and dad went for the fish and chips. We were all waiting in anticipation to finally try some of Ramsay's British pub classics. The wait, however, was sadly much longer than anticipated. We clocked around 35 minutes sitting talking at the table before our food finally arrived. At this point, the waiter dropped the fish and chips all over the floor. Without a word, he cleaned the plate up and went back to the kitchen. We were waiting for 5 more minutes before our allocated waiter even recognised a plate was missing and no apology was given, simply a ""at least one made it"" when the second dish was delivered. 

The food itself was actually delicious from what I had, which is perhaps the only thing keeping this review above 2 stars. The curry had excellent heat and flavour to it and was warm throughout. The bangers and mash were a hit as well, although it should be noted that the sausages are 3 different meats, so if you're not a fan of beef, chicken or pork sausage, I'm sure they would substitute to your preference. As for the fish and chips, it looked good and had crispy batter, however, I had expected it to be more like chip shop style chips from the UK rather than French fries.

A local recommended this place as they had the best fish in chips in town, so my husband being a big fan of fish and chips, we thought hey why not? 

Well, once we got seated, I looked around that people had pretzal breads at their tables, and I thought, looks good and cant wait to try. 

Once we ordered our drinks, and food, there was no mention of bread coming or anything. So I looked at the menu, and did not see it on the menu to order it. We thought, it must come later.

So after about 15 min, we got our drinks, and no bread.
Another 15 min, no bread. by this time, we are like WTF? Our waitress did not even come by!! UGH. I am hungry and mad

So 10 more min, she came by and we asked about the bread, and she said, "" you have to order it"". well by this time, our dinner was coming, and we said no.

Our food finally came. I ordered the Salmon, and I had asked if it was salty, and she said no. well first bite: SALTY!! UGH! Oh and it said it came with garlic chips, so I was expecting FRIES! as the rest of the menu had CHIPS (which are fries). Well you know what they were? SMALL ASS 4 pieces of garlic american chips. So small I didnt even see them!!! 

the fish and chips were OKAY, notthing special. I have had much better in Seattle and in dana Point, CA. 

So overall:

1. SERVICE: SUCKS! ( water NEVER got refilled)
2. FOOD is WAY TO Overprices for what you get (I can get much better food for the same price in Vegas)
3. FOOD IS OKAY, nothing WOW.

I will never come back here again, and I do not recommend it at all. horrible horrible. Dont waste you time. Vegas is about fun and good food, well this is not one of them. 

Gordan Ramsey, sorry  this place is not so good.",7,4,3

The service - F. Our waitress was inattentive and rude. She rarely checked on us, and when we tried to get our bill to leave, she was MIA. When we finally flagged her down and asked for the bill, she took 15 minutes to have another server bring it to us.

The only thing that I have a gripe about is the prices of the beers. But whatever. If I like my meal, I don't care what it costs. If you are on a budget, perhaps this is not the place for you.

One downside is the service was on the slower side each time I've been here, but I make reservations and allot 2 hours just so I don't feel rushed. I like to take my time to eat. 

Give it a try, look at the menu before you come to make sure it is in your budget and you don't go on yelp later and complain. Also, make reservations, plan accordingly. Order something a bit out of your normal realm too. Complaining about burgers and fish and chips....you people....smh.",1,0,0

Dear Chef Gordon Ramsey, 
You made me cry twice today. Came to your Pub...where were you? Looked everywhere, asked everyone but to no avail. 1st tear. 
Luckily the staff in charge is completely amazing, delightful, and well trained. Had reservations but arrived early. The place was bouncing with people, full, to the ""fish and chip gills"" but the Hostess' words of ""No problem"" was like a sonnet to my ears! (did I mentioned I was tired?) 
Our evening server and now friend Miss Evie took such great care of our roost; she was such a pleasure. Her genteel manner and service was remarkable. 
On to the 2nd tear Chef Ramsey-
Our order consisted of: 
*Appetizers- Crispy Calamari and Lobster Rolls. These dishes need no work, please leave them as they are;stunningly delicious!
*Ordered 2 Stella Draft beers, a 35oz for the loser of the earlier battle and a 20oz for the Lady whom did not even break a sweat in that exchange. 
*Main Course- Prime Rib (medium rare) and order of Fish and Chips. The Prime Rib was done to perfection with Mash Potatoes following suit. Again amazing! 
Now for the 2nd tear- The Fish and Chips were SENSATIONAL! A total Knock-Out! The tear came out because it brought back memories of a stint at English Public school, how this meal was authentic, and very indicative of how it tastes in England. Bravo!  Bravo! Thank you Chef.
As if that wasn't enough, you graciously sent out a free Sticky Toffee Pudding. I knew right then, you were at the Pub watching me eat with full delight and splendor. The heavenly dessert was consumed VICIOUSLY!...as it should be.

I close now giving you many thanks and warmest regards,
Ever Faithfully yours,
Jon H.

PS...my battle contender ""the Spouse"" said I would\/could not finish the 35oz Stella. So after dissipating the ""35"" with full vigor, I had to win that quarrel (at least) by ordering an extra 20oz for me, consuming it with a grin, slowly, like a World Class Champ or Chimp",6,6,6

I had a burger that was at least $20 and lacked flavor so I sighed when my husband wanted to come try it again today. Luckily there has been some significant changes made because the only sigh today was one of nothing but satisfaction. 

I tried the Shepherds Pie and found it came with a tiny salad and a pretzel stick. The plating was beautiful. The pie itself was phenomenal and super filling. As someone that hates to waste money, I'd spend $25 bucks again any day for a pie from here. My husband got the Banger & Mash which I saw on the menu and didn't think it would be something I'd care too much for.

We had a list of ""chef signature"" places we wanted to visit.  Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill was actually an accident because one of our other places was a bust.

The Experience:
We came around 2pm for a late lunch and were seated right away.  The experience here started off a bit rocky since our waitress never came, but once we asked the manager what was going on, we were seated at a different table with a very friendly waitress (her name was Bridgette I believe).  The manager (his name was Derek) was extremely apologetic and checked on us often through the duration of our meal.  He even offered to comp our appetizer, which was a really nice touch, and alleviated any possible hostility that we might have had.  Derek was probably the highlight of our experience since he was so accommodating and warm.  He truly went above and beyond for us.  Thank you Derek!

The Food:
Both my boyfriend and I had the lobster rolls, shared a chicken caesar salad, and lastly the toffee pudding.

Lobster rolls:  Great portions, but lacked a little flavor.  I expected a bit more or maybe something different, but still delicious.

Chicken Cesar: Comes on large leaves of lettuce, but generous portions of chicken, and the dressing was phenom.  Very delicious.

Toffee Pudding: We bought it per recommendation from Derek...it was incredibly delicious.  Im not a super fan of caramel, and even I demolished this thing.  It was perfection.  The caramel is served warm and you pour it on top....YUM!!

For a celebrity chef restaurant, the prices are VERY fair. $20-30 an entree. Good luck finding that any where else on the strip (to all you people that are complaining about it being overpriced). 

The atmosphere is very very cool! Old British pub style with a hint of the Royal Family and a dab of punk rock. Love that the restaurant has an open facade; Ceasars is such a beautiful casino, it's nice that they embraced that. Cool decor with old barrels, chairs decorated with corgis, painting of bulldogs, etc. brings a nice little bit of England to the strip.

I love the food here. I've ordered many things off the menu, and all were fantastic. My favorite is the Scottish Salmon; it is made to perfection. Their bread service is really interesting as well: comes with an array of different types of bread and sticks and delicious dipping sauces - new twist on an old tradition. 

The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because of the rude hostesses at the front. Attn ladies: I understand you work at one of the busiest casinos on the strip, but don't act like you are doing me a favor by taking my reservation. We had to wait at the main entrance for 5 mins before one of them even asked if I had been helped. They were all too busy chatting to each other to attend to the long line of customers.

Also, the table service here can be a little slow as well. We weren't too bothered by that because the food was so awesome. 

Book a reservation online before you get here, it does get quite packed.",1,1,1

Came here to just get a quick bite between other meals. Upon showing up, plenty of empty seats available but the Hostess just pointed us to the bar. No worries, I didn't really need a table but at least being led in would have been nice. Went into the ""bar area"" that I was pointed to and sat down at table there. Had several servers walk by with no acknowledgement. eventually, as I was about to get actually pissed off, a server came by and told me the table was ""reserved"" and we would have to sit at the bar. Again, no effort to actually assist or direct or give any sort of service, just really poor form. 

By the way, while I was sitting at the ""reserved"" table waiting for service, I had a chance to notice how poorly kept things were. There were dirty tables everywhere. It just seemed as there was a lot of staff walking around and no one actually caring for things. With the amount of staff they had here this place should have been spotless. So not only was the service completely lacking but it was a mess to look at.

We moved ourselves over to the actual bar and were greeted by a friendly enough bartender, (he is one of two things keeping this rating from being a 1). He took our order and poured up some drinks. The weird thing is that I had a Stella Artois, and it had absolutely no head at all, I assume that either the line was dirty or there was some film in the glass that prevented a head. They rinse their glasses so it almost has to be a dirty line.

We only ordered a couple of items, Scotch egg and deviled eggs. Both were really good for sure, (there is the other thing that kept this a 2 star instead of 1). 

The other thing about this place - it just looks confused as hell. If I were to go all Asian on you I would say there is absolutely no Feng Shui. It just seems like there was an argument between the chef, the hotel, the backers, and the bank and they ALL got their way. It just does not flow and for shits sake GET RID OF ALL THE RIDICULOUS KEGS ON THE WALL!! They are not trendy, it is not visually pleasing. It is just super heavy and distracting.

Just a little claim to fame anecdote.  I hope you guys find it impressive because I tell this story at least 2-3 times a week.

My BF and I are both really big fans of Gordon Ramsay and our favorite show to watch together is Kitchen Nightmare.  This Pub & Grill seemed like a nightmare, to a small degree of course.  One thing Gordon Ramsay boasts on the show is a small fresh menu.  The menu was far from small and seemed to have everything under the sun. 

What I ordered was pretty impressive.  It combined everything I loved.  Scallops, clams, in a chowder broth with BACON.  BACON BACON BACON.  Love me some BACON.  Although the food was delicious the price left me wanting more.  I had the scallop dish and my BF had the fish and chips.  Our tab was nearly $75 with tip.  And, NO we did not order soda or alcohol.

Service:

Alex did not have a professional demeanor but rather was condescending in his remarks to our simple order of 2 items - the beef burger and calamari. He commented ""3 people for 1 burger, really?"" When in reality, we wanted to sample the food & order more if we were still hungry.

My girl and I are at Caesars looking for a bite and I decided on Ramsey's pub n grill so we stood at the hostess desk for a good fee minutes before we were even spoken to by one of the 3 girls in miniskirts that were talking to eachother. Then we are taken to a seat in the bar area next to all the kegs that were used as the divider for the bar area and the seating area. We were not asked if we wanted to sit at the bar, my girl always will prefer a booth but we were not given that option. 
We were seated and left alone for about 5min before I had to flag down a busser to ask for a menu. Looking at the menu for about 5-10 more minutes we were never approached by another employee at all. We were not offered water or drinks or asked if we were ready to order. Now considering the fact that by the time we each have a meal and a drink we were looking to spend close to $100 for burgers we elected to just get up and walk out. As far as the food goes I have actually eaten wings and a burger from here while playing poker in Caesars poker room and it is pretty good food from what I have seen. Having said that I cannot say the same for their service in my particular case. I'm sorry with me you only get one shot at my business I really see no reason to go back after my initial experience. I would rather go to Bachi Burger by my house and only spend $40-$50 for an even better quality meal that you will get here.

The service and hospitality was impeccable, which certainly added to the quality of the food and drink experience. Our servers, Adam (on 3\/7) and Sara (on 3\/11), were terrific. On our first visit the bar manager, Randy, also came over and introduced himself. He was very personable and we shared some laughs as Norma and Sherry related how they had met Gordon Ramsay a couple of years ago.

The calamari with bacon crackle was simply one of the best we have ever had. My wife fell in love with the fish & chips (great batter!) and my NY strip steak was exactly medium rare. Every dish was one of the best we have ever had. But the kudos do not end there -  Sherry's Cosmopolitan and Norma's blueberry & blackberry concoction were delicious and my bourbon cocktail was literally PERFECT and the best outside of my own! It was wonderful to not have to explain how to mix a Perfect Manhattan. As Randy explained, all the bartenders have won contests. Well...it showed. Randy also steered us to two wonderful desserts, sticky toffee pudding and snickerdoodle madeleine.

A month ago, I came here with 3 girlfriends. I had decent expectations.
While waiting at the bar for a table, 3 drinks got returned from the dining area to our bartender (who seemed new). The the servers were bluntly rude to the bartender about the drinks right in front of us. It was uncomfortable and customers shouldn't be around when an employee is getting scolded.
There was also a woman tending (who appeared to be training the bartender). She was snappy to him in front of us about checking our IDs after we had already been served (we are all nearing our 30's and he had indeed already checked all of our birthdays). She never smiled or acknowledged us. Again, it made us uncomfortable. 
This woman took our tabs (as opposed to our bartender who had served us, laughed with us, been friendly, taken pictures, etc.) when it was time to sit at our table even though she had 0 communication with our party. She then shorted me money. It was a very small amount, but I was immediately irate because it had been an odd amount due to tax (I believe my total had been 5.36, I paid with $10) and I only got $4.50 in change back. I would understand if it was an odd amount, but I received 2 basic quarters. Nothing else. No odd pennies or nickels, just 2 quarters. It was CLEARLY wrong without even thinking about the math. It was pure laziness. She never even looked at us, just took our money and left. 
I did not want to leave a tip for risk this woman would steal it (after she'd already taken $.14 of my own) and I couldn't find our bartender to tip him directly. I boldly circled my ""change due"" section on my receipt since after we paid the woman never returned to our side of the bar and my party was already at a table. If our nice bartender ever reads this, I'm sorry I didn't tip you.
Once seated, it was very hot in our dining area. We were all sweating. Had the food made up for this, we could have looked past it. 
I ordered french onion soup and it had (what I hope was) a chunk of rock solid bone in it. We couldn't identify it. Why would there be anything hard in french onion soup? It was super disappointing because the soup was great until then.
My friend ordered sliders that were ok, slightly dry but ok.
The other 2 ordered the same thing: the burger. One rare, the other medium. When they were delivered at the same time looking identical, one girl clarified with the food runner that they had each gotten the correct burgers to the correct person: she guaranteed they had.
They were wrong. One bite in and each girl could tell they had the wrong one. They swapped, we were all friends, no big deal.
Up until this point our dining service had been fast, attentive, and great. My water glass never stayed empty.
 When our server came around to ask how our food was, the 2 ladies told him about the burger swap. They wanted our server to know of the mistake so that it didn't happen to any other diners and risk the restaurant having to re-cook or clear a check for someone later on. They were professional and kind about it, and didn't expect anything besides acknowledgement that there had been a mistake.

After bringing this to their attention, none stopped at our table again.

We had to stop a random busboy and tell him to get our checks after we'd been sitting, finished eating, for quite some time even though we were in the center of the dining room.
The check came out as 1 whole (not sure who they thought intended to pick up our entire $70 bill...maybe they should have given it to the bartender who shorted me) so we then had to wait for it to be separated.

But whatever it was that led me here - hunger, tired feet, FATE - I'm so glad it did.  This was hands-down my favorite lunch out of all the places we tried on vacation.

First of all, I loved the decor of the restuarant.  You really felt this is what a real English pub would look like.  It could be an Americanized version for all I know, but I still liked it.

Our service was great.  Very friendly wait staff.  There were water spots on my husband's fork, which isn't even that big of a deal, but our waiter noticed it (without us pointing it out first) and replaced it right away.  I thought that was a very nice, above-and-beyond touch.

I started off with a very delicious cocktail called Goodbye Blue Sky, which was blueberry vodka, Chambord, sparkling wine and fresh lemon and blueberries.  So refreshing.  I hardly ever finish my cocktail at any place I go, but this one could have easily begat a second one as much as I loved it.

We decided to pass on appetizers as we didn't really want to stuff ourselves for lunch (knowing we had a very large dinner ahead of us later).  I debated on what to order because so many things sounded delicious.  Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, even considered ordering several apps as my entree (Scotch Egg - yum!).  Finally decided to go classic English pub and ordered the Fish and Chips.  This was without a doubt the best fish and chips I've ever eaten.  Three lovely pieces of beautifully battered white fish - the texture was spot on (crispy and light), fish cooked to perfection.  Served with a side of mushy peas, which were also very tasty.  They were minty, although I didn't taste too much of it.  If I could complain about anything, I'd say the fries were nothing special.  The weren't horrible by any means, but for $30 you may expect something hand-cut at the very least.

Everytime we see a Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert, we have to try it.  For something not chocolately, this bread pudding is surprisingly good.  Warm, with a rich caramelly drizzle atop a delicious sweet cream ice cream.  It's like a comfort dessert - you leave feeling wrapped in a warm blanket, cozy and comfy.  Perfect ending to a fantastic meal.

The only thing I wasn't keen on was the price of the food.  Now, I can eat expensive food, and have no problem paying for it.  But let's be honest - this was not an upscale 5-star restaurant.  It's a pub with above average food.  It's not overly gourmet or made with luxury ingredients.  I'd say you're paying for the Gordon Ramsey name for the most part.  Don't get me wrong cuz the food was spectacular, but it could definitely handle being slightly cheaper.  Lunch food shouldn't cost over $100 for two people.",3,1,3

Instead, we went and sat at the bar. I ordered a Goodbye Blue Sky and she ordered a Margarita. My drink was bitter and lacking in any other flavor. Hers was served in a small glass that was half filled with ice. There seemed to be very little alcohol in either. For this, we were charged $15 for each glass (one bad drink and one tiny one).

Reading the reviews - the Fish and Chips are ""AMAZING,"" I am not sure where these people have had fish and chips before, or maybe the Chef forgot to drain the grease from the fish before plating - in any case - not impressed. Two of the Three Filets were a bit overcooked, and the Third Fillet was dripping with grease, which left a pool into my Mushy Peas.

Service - meh. Typical Vegas, seat you when available, give you a beverage menu, return 10 mins later, take the beverage order, and if you are not ready to order your grub, then be ready to wait at least another 10-20 minutes to order when your beverages arrive. At one point I am pretty sure our Server was too concerned with her co-workers conversations instead of our table with empty glasses and dirty plates.

Reccomendations if feeling the need to experience - the soft warm pretzel appetizer (best spicy mustard!), and the Pear Cider was a winner too!

The appetizer sliders were delicious. My entre salad was just lettuce and pears so it was lacking another component- pecans, blue cheese, something! It was disappointing. I would not recommend that item. My husband got the shepherds pie, which again tasted fine just not worth the price and it was smaller than I expected.

We made reservations because we had read about long waits. We arrived and we're seated in minutes. I read some reviews that said that they staggered seating. I didn't see this happen. The tables that were empty for a bit seemed to be for larger parties with reservations. We also didn't have a long wait for our food. Waiting time, all around, was average. 

My husband had the lamb shank and I had the lamb rack. Both were delicious. The lamb rack comes with a couscous that is to die for. The sides not listed with your dinner come at extra cost. We ordered the mac and cheese, which was the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. To be fair, the sides probably come at an extra cost because you don't need rhem. We both would have been full and satisfied with just our meals. Our helpings were pretty large. We struggled to finish the extra side. 

As a side note, I ordered my lamb rack medium and it came almost well done. This didn't bother me at all, since the only reason I didn't order it well is that we'll usually translates to burnt at most places. So I was perfectly satisfied with what I was served. 

There is a photographer that will ask if you want your picture taken at dinner. She comes around about 20 minutes later to show you the picture. You get three and a frame for like $18. She also stated that she worked for ceasears and does this at all of the restaurants and attractions within the hotel. So, no matter where you go in ceasears it seems this will happen. You can always say no and she will leave. She in no way pressured us into getting or buying our pictures. 

We also ended with dessert, because we were waiting for our pictured. We ate the pear cobbler, which was warm and gooey. It came with a sweat cream which evened out the dish very well. 

The only complaint I have about the night was that the chairs (not the stools) are pretty low compared to the tablw. I felt like a toddler trying to reach everything, no matter how close I got to the table. 

Other than that, great and interesting place! Would definitely eat here again if I was given the choice!",1,0,0

Buns were soaked with butter and grease from the patty. More fattiness coming from avocadoes and mayo dressing with nothing in the burger to cut through the fattiness. There simply wasn't a balance of flavors. When you are charging 20 bucks for a burger at least serve it with a house salad with some vinigratte. I couldn't finish the burger because it was simply too heavy when the portion was kind of small to begin with. The poutine was good. But the server didn't get our order right and forgot my friend's order which cost another 30 minutes of waiting time.

It's difficult to understand the purpose of placing a table that is practiacally outside of the restaurant.

We ordered Sheppard's Pie and Flank Steak and shared. The Flank steak was one of the top steaks ever ordered in a restaurant, so tender and perfect. Loved the cocktails. The Sheppard's Pie looked smaller than it was - very filling, even for two, if you get another plate too.  It's shredded beef and was so tender. We couldn't finish it all.  The onion soup was great - a little sweeter and less salty than the french version.  My husband wanted to add salt, but there's none of that on the table. Without reservations, we'd have waited a while. It's only steps away from the concert venue, Elton John, so perfect place for dinner if you plan to see that show. The service was good - four or five hostesses to greet you - which one do I choose. The bartender was swamped, so took a while for drinks.  The manager came by several times and walked the restaurant a lot.  The guy who dropped off our food asked if we would be sharing and offered to bring sharing plates.  I loved the initiative of that. We never had to wait for plates to be cleared - they were picked up right away.  Definitely allow 2 hours for your dining experience.  It's not a fast-food restaurant.  This is a place to come and savor your meal, the company, and the ambiance.  Nothing is rushed, which I loved.  The table was never crowded and plates weren't coming out on top of each other.  The entire staff was pleasant and enjoyable - contrary to the punk get-up.  

I read the reviews prior to coming and almost went somewhere else.  Geez, you guys are hard to please.  I LOVED my experience!  it was pricey, but the special occassion warranted the splurge.  And it's Vegas.  You expect that there.  Glad I decided to take a risk and find out for myself.  I hope others can take these reviews with a grain of salt too.  My only regret was that we were too full for dessert.   Oh, also regret not ordering the deviled eggs at the bar while we waited for our reservation.  Certain menu items in the bar are not available at the table.   Will definitely go back!

Suggestion:  If you plan to have a full dinner, make reservations and request a booth or a high table.  A lot of the tables are low, better for drinks and appetizers, but not a meal.  And also request the back of the restaurant.  I also didn't like the fishbowl effect of the front of the restaurant.  Once you're well inside the restaurant, you feel more cozy and intimate.",0,0,0

The waiter must have been scared to do his job because he kept glancing at our table and not stopping by. I watched him pass about 4 times before asking if we wanted water (uhm yes, it's Vegas and we need to stay hydrated), another 4 times before asking if we wanted drinks, and another 6 times before finally bringing them. He literally forgot to bring the beer and then quickly left again when we were clearly ready to order. It wasn't a busy night, so his flightiness was unexplainable. 

This continued throughout the night. We needed salt\/pepper, and the waiter continued to walk by hesitantly and not stop by asking how we are doing and if we needed anything. This might not seem like a huge deal, but no paying customer wants to feel avoided or neglected. 

Also, he'll need to brush up on his adjectives and food reviews. When we asked about how their pea soup tasted, his only response was ""it has texture."" WOW you sold us on that one.

I have also dined at the London NYC and it was one of the best meals of my life.  Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill?  Not so much.

We waited at the bar for the text that our table was ready and the wait was the highlight of our experience.  Great drinks and friendly bar tender.  He made great recommendations of what to eat and seemed to know the menu well.  We were seated just after finishing our first drink which was perfect.

After that it was all downhill.  The table we sat at was directly behind the hostess both so it was a high traffic area but it was so close you could reach out and touch them.  Not only was it awkward placement but the table was far to short, both in height and depth, for the 2 chairs and booth that were pushed up to it.  Strange and uncomfortable, but I could get past it for great food and service.  Unfortunately we got very little of either.

The waiter was friendly enough and for some reason felt the need to share that he was a competitive eater (even called another staff member over to prove it).  Again, awkward, but whatever.

For an appetizer we ordered the Scottish Egg, as recommended by the bar tender, and it was good.  Not great, but good.  There were 3 of us, we had the Prime Rib, Diver Scallops, and Fish and Chips.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were very good (best entree ordered), the batter on the Fish and Chips was flavorful but slid right off the fish, which was tasteless, and the french fries didn't have any salt at all.  The Prime Rib was extremely bland but the mash potatoes were pretty decent.  For desert we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was definitely the star of our dining experience.  I have watched Gordon make it on TV for years and was very happy that I wasn't disappointed.  

For what I have reviewed so far I would have given 3 stars but the service is where it really fell flat.  Every single dish we used from our drinks, to the apps, to dinner, to desert were all still on the table when we left the restaurant.  We were out of drinks, even water, 45 min before we got our check, which I had to wave our waiter down to request and then it still took another 20 minutes before we got it.  Outside of taking our order and delivering food he only stopped at our table to check on us once the whole hour and 45 minutes that we were seated.

I saw the manager at the hostess both several times and tried to get his attention to inform him of our experience but he never would make eye contact.  Normally I would have got up and went to him but at this point I was annoyed and just wanted to leave.

Needless to say for a meal that cost over $170 (not including the $60 we spent at the bar) I was EXTREMELY disappointed.  This is a restaurant worthy of Gordon's show Kitchen Nightmares!  What a shame.  I hope, Scott Commings (Hell's Kitchen season 12 winner) will turn things around when he takes the head Chef position and hopefully that is soon!",0,0,0

Gordon Ramsay is always talking about his Shepard's pie so I wanted something great.  What I got was eh...ok.  It really was just pot roast with severely undercooked crunchy semi-raw veggies topped with un seasoned mash potatoes.  Good idea but severely poorly executed.  The pot roast was super watery making the dish a big mushy mess.  Having ordered sticky toffee pudding from Gordon Ramsay Steak and absolutely loving it, I thought I would order it here and maybe find a possibly cheaper fix to my craving.  I was disappointed.  Sadly the pudding was overcooked and hard chewy on the outside and dry inside.  The place has a good concept, but the wait staff is lacking and the kitchen staff is lacking execution.

My dinner on the other hand was kind of a let down at $39.00. I ordered the Beer Braised Short Rib meal that came with mashed potatoes, grilled carrots, and a brown sauce. The beef was the same meat that came on the nachos and was completely tasteless and bland. It tasted like bland pot roast out of a crock pot.

We dined here Tuesday night I believe, I ordered the oven-roasted Scottish Salmon with a side of mashed potatoes and my husband ordered the grilled lamb burger. Unfortunately, there was no real flavour in my salmon dish, and the lamb burger came with a block of goat cheese which just dwarfed any other flavors the lamb burger may have had. I'm no expert, but that seems like such an amateur mistake to make, not knowing how to balance flavors. 

In addition to that, service was incredibly slow although they did try to make up for this by getting another waiter to get us started with drinks. As an aside, the tap water that they eventually brought to our table had an odd taste. Initially I figured maybe that was what tap water tastes like in Nevada so I didn't think I had cause for complaint, but after a more pleasant experience at another restaurant in Caesar's Palace, I know that this clearly isn't the case.

Calling this place overpriced would be an understatement and what we ordered was so devoid of flavor that this whole experience can, at best, be summed up as spectacularly underwhelming.  I left the restaurant supremely annoyed at the less-than-average dining experience offered at such premium prices. Certainly not worth the 70 bucks for two that they charged, in my opinion.",1,1,1

Now that that's out of the way, here's the main reason for my one star review:  THEY MADE MY WIFE CRY.

Why?  Because they served her an alcoholic drink when she ordered a virgin one.  While this doesn't sound like a big deal, it is.  She's pregnant.  She was crying, my in-laws (who didn't yet know and had to find out his way) were confused, and I was not happy.  The issue lies in that there is a drink on the non-alcoholic menu that has the same name as one on the alcoholic menu.  The confusion was almost guaranteed.  While we couldn't really taste the booze (it was a pretty weak fru-fru drink), we noticed on the bill.

This mistake was the feather on the cap because even getting into the restaurant was a pain.  We had 6pm reservations, but didn't get seated until almost 6:30.  That, too, was an issue because we had show tickets for 7:30pm.  To top it off, the incompetent hostess initially gave us a table for two when there was four people in our party.

Despite how good the food was, we'll never be back and probably won't patronize any of Ramsay's other establishments based upon the mistakes that were made at the Pub & Grill.",0,1,0

Having been a fan of his many cooking reality shows we decided to eat at the grill at Cesars Palace.Things quickly went down hill after being seated in a tiny table stuck next to a row of 4 cramped tables with barely breathing room. Our waiter was the worst I have ever encountered after eating out for 30 years at some of the better to best restaurants in the US and Europe. He repeatedly ignored us and after sitting for 30 minutes without a drink I complained to the management who got us started with our cocktails. This caused our waiter to futher act out in a blatant passive aggressive way. He did not smile, gave us no eye contact but plenty of attitude as he sarcastically announced with each entree ""is this good enough for you"". I literally wanted to put the food up his U KNOW WHAT but we were hungry and would have been late for our show so we had to put up wth this clown. While ordering, they had 'RUN OUT "" of 3 of the 4 items????. Sounded odd. Anyway the shepards pie was ok, the lobster mac and cheese very salty and my memory is a wash with the rest of the meal. Thus I conclude that it must not have been memorable. I was so irritated with this snarky, pompous jack ass of a waiter it was all I could do to contain myself.
The one plus was dessert some kind of bread pudding that was super sweet but definitely the best among the items ordered . Just when I thought things were bad enough I went into the rest room. Had I done that first thing, I would NEVER have eaten at this establishment. It was FILTHY. Yes! you may find it hard to believe, I DID but the smell and look of the toilet was as if they had not cleaned it. Rather disgusting what was on the toilet seat thus I will NOT describe it in case you are as visual as I am. I still can't get the imagery out of my mind a month later. When it came to soap supplies, they had 1 little bottle of soap for 4 sinks and plenty of patrons waiting like kindergardeners to get a squirt of the stuff. A 50 plus year old to my left erupted and questioned the staff and was seen on my way out complaining to upper management. Tell you what, for such a fussy chef with his noteriety of perfectionistic standards, he should visit the place he sold his name to on the sly and see for himself.

\/FOOD  I went with the lamb burger. It was hella good. However, I went splits with another mate at the table who went with the fish and chips. Not so good. I was disappointed that I gave up half of my lamb burger. Chips are mediocre. That is sacrilege.

With that being said, I am so surprise to see so many two and three star reviews here. Nevertheless I had to give it a go and form my own opinion. 

From the minute you walk in the door you can see that the decorator went above and beyond to provide the guest a ""pub"" experience.  Now it may not fit an authentic English Pub, but you're not in London, you're in Las Vegas and I found the setting to be perfectly fitting.  We sat in the dining room and found the wait staff was personable, attentive and quick with the drink. I will say that the menu held more than your traditional pub fare, but still offered classics like Bangers & Mash or Fish & Chips. 

For the table we started with Hellfire Lollipop Wings, English Beer Steamed Clams and Maine Lobster Roll Minis.  As I sit here and write this review I still cannot think of one thing I would change about the starters. The wings were unique, they were crispy, sweet, spicy and savory all at the same time, I still regret not asking what chili pepper they used in the sauce - I would say these are in the Top Three best wings I have had.  The clams were exactly what I expected, perfectly cooked clams in a tasty broth with little pieces of chorizo and the lobster rolls were spot on, as if we had been sitting in a restaurant in downtown Bangor. 

For main courses, two of us got the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish& Chips and the odd man out went with a Grilled Lamb Burger. Now I can speak to the burger but from what I could see and what I was told, it was juicy, flavorful and very filling. I almost wished I had ordered it.  The fish and chips were really good. The batter was light and crisp, the cod was perfectly prepared and flaky, it was simplicity at its best. I also enjoyed the different take on chips, as they were fried potato wedges and held up well against the malt vinegar without getting soggy. The one thing that brought it all together was the little ramekin of Minted Mushy Peas.... Delicious. 

As I left Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill I remember rubbing my stomach and telling my friends what a good meal that was. I really enjoyed it.  Typically I would give the restaurant 5-Stars at this point, but because of the other lesser reviews I am wondering if there are some issues with consistency and therefore until I visit again I can only give them 4-Stars.",0,0,0

My first time at a Gordon Ramsey establishment. In all fairness, I was overly excited for this opportunity owing to the fact that I have been watching Ramsey on a number of TV programs for some time, and he is hands down my favorite celebrity chef. That being said, I was a bit disappointed that after an hour long wait for a table, it took another ten minutes after being seated to even be approached by a waitress, upon which we finally received water and a drink menu. I had the scotch egg appetizer and the mussels and clams, both of which I thought were delicious. I was surprised by the heftiness of the mussel plate...I'm guessing there was at least 2 lbs. of shellfish on there. Overall, good pub food, but service needs a bit of work.",1,0,1

First, the hostess, trained yes, competent, not really. Poorly handled phone res and directions. As locals we hadn't been here and hosted my brother and friend, party of 4 plus child. The waiter was nice, simple in his approach, friendly, etc. but I hate it when the have deliver\/expediter servers that come and drop off food without really knowing who has what, no sense for service, unfriendly and unengaging and close to being rude. Both food delivery people-a guy for our apps and a lady for the salads were basically rude. Uninterested in serving, embarrassing for the fact that the restaurant was barely busy. I feel
Bad for being their table tonight. The waiter did provide some nice choices for my wife and I to dine locally as we just moved here which, was above and beyond, and for that he earned his 18% tip. The lighting went high to low twice during dinner. Amateur hour? I personally question the pricing on the beers and the wines too. I'm in F&B consultancy\/marketing with large corporate accounts and my take here is their beer pricing is too high. Ok, expensive to be expensive- I get that, it's Vegas tourism, but portion sizes should be questioned too. I had the Kale and Bacon Shepherds Pie. Mistake. Ok to Good-yes, small-oh yes!!! It was a French onion soup size bowl filled half way with a puff pastry on top. Are you kidding? I don't even want to know what that cost me! 300 bucks later, left hungry. Thank goodness for wives that leave portions for their husbands to eat. Won't recommend.",0,0,0

Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill was the first place we saw so we decided to try it out. We were told that this restaurant has wonderful food and to make sure and try it out if we get the chance.  Since we are on vacation from Hawaii and don't have this restaurant back home. 

We went to get a table for five, the hostess was very sweet and asked us to wait about 2 minutes while they set the table for us. We were seated at a super cute table. We all started looking over the menu. 

During this time no one came to greet us or offer us water.  We were sat at the table at about 4:37 pm. at about 4:57 pm still no one had come to greet us or offer any beverages. 

At about 4:59 pm another table was sat right next to us. This table was greeted offered water within a minute of being seated. 

At this time we decided to leave the restaurant because it appeared no one wanted to serve us. As we were making our way out of the restaurant my mom informed the manager of the poor service we had encountered. The manager stood there and looked confused they got out his table map to check who was suppose to serve us. After that he offered us another table but we would have to wait a minute.

By now we were fed up, hungry and not feeling welcome at all. So we left. Thanks for ruining what could have been a wonderful experience.",1,2,0

I told him that I asked for the burger to be med well and it was more than well done.  He said well med well is some pink and it barely past that stage. I said there should be pink for med well and red for med. He offered to get me a new one but we had plans to be somewhere with friends.  The manager or supervisor past is more than 8 times and never acknowledged us and never said hi. He would spend more time with the girls that worked there talking and laughing by the table then supervising.

Sadly, it would appear that rather than pay homage to all things British, Gordon Ramsay has chosen for his new pub at Caesars Las Vegas to be decidedly, well, ""Vegas."" There are some delightful menu items that you would find in a typical pub, however, the décor is a confusing mix of casino tackiness and partially abandoned distillery. Much of the restaurant is open to the casino and the rest is a hodgepodge of randomly selected items any Anglophile would order from Amazon. The only part of the restaurant that harkened toward anything truly 'pub-like"" was the bar. Ray-Ray, the bartender on staff, was a hoot and I'd probably go back just to chat with him again. (We left him a tip double the cost of our meal partly because of his compassionate care of an elderly couple we assume must be regulars). Much of the wait staff is also typical Vegas, so you may or may not be concerned about strange bosoms falling out as they deliver your meal. We really only wanted a light nosh and a cocktail, so thought sticking with appetizers and salads was the best way to sample the fare. I must admit that I broke a cardinal rule in straying from ""typical"" pub fare and ordered the lobster roll, simply because I am desperate to have at least one great one each year. (For any who've read any of my reviews on Tripadvisor, you'll note I made the same mistake at Hilton Head Island in March, 2015.) I should have listened to my husband! He ordered the Wedge Salad and he truly enjoyed the Shropshire bleu cheese paired with the bacon vinaigrette, I ordered a Maine Lobster roll on lemon poppy seed brioche. (I know!) I was so anticipating that first, delightful bite of buttery richness from the roll that looked as if it was lovingly slathered and grilled face down, anticipating it would complement the rich, slightly sweet creaminess of the lobster salad. And then, the music died. As I deconstructed the roll, I noticed that the butter was probably brushed across the top, then the bread was slid through a pizza oven so that only the bare top was toasted. The rest was a fairly dry, barely lemon or poppy seed flavored brioche. Disappointed again. I'd like to say that maybe they were having an off day since it was shortly before Las Vegas' annual Bon Appetite event that was being held at Caesars, but would have to make plans to visit again when we return in June. This time, I'll try the Frog in a hole or the Bangers and Mash. With so many other places to try on the Strip, a restaurant can't just be okay; it has to rock your socks off. We travel to Las Vegas multiple times a year, and consider ourselves to be ""foodies,"" and will normally give a place two bites of the apple so to speak. If we are disappointed again; we won't be back.",0,0,0

We ordered french onion (though it went under a different name), the tomato soup, the burger sliders with bacon, fries, and brussel sprouts.

The tomato soup was served warm, not hot, and the local Safeway does better with its Signature soup line.

The onion soup had a great broth, and the cheese was freshly melted and hot. There were plenty of onions. Unfortunately the broth wasn't hot.

The sliders, bun was toasted, yet cold on the bottom. The meat cooked nicely, but warm at best.

The fries, not hot.

And the candied brussel sprouts? Not hot except right in the center, and the candy, appeared to be maple syrup in the bottom of the dish.

Very small menu so that made our choices pretty easy. Now mind u its 7:30pm i havent eaten since breakfast bcuz i wanted to make sure i would b able to eat my meal and end it with a great dessert.

Me: Had to go with the fish & chips of course bcuz thats all Gordon talks about, with a very heavy heart i must say i was not I'm
pressed a matter of fact i was disappointed none of the dishes were flavorful. The only difference btween this fish & chips and HSalt fish & chips was it wasnt as greasy.Thank God they give u such big potatoe slices bcuz the fish pieces were small.

My daughter: shepards pie n this tiny bowl, which she had to salt and pepper, but she did love it.

My other daughter: braised lamb shank: shallow
 bowl\/plate the lamb was very tender. 

Maybe if the meals came with a soup or salad or if they had some bread or something on the table u wouldnt realize how long it takes the food to come out.

I never really crave this kind of food but I  thought it was great change. After ordering we were all really excited but the food took forever to come!!  I swear it was 45 mins. Granted we did have a bigger group of 8 but I thought it was still too long. I ordered the lamb burger upon recommendation. For 25 bucks a burger... I expected more.

Well, clearly we should have kept walking. The service was not good, I don't think our waiter smiled once during the entire meal, and didn't offer any suggestions, and it took a for him forever to even come over and take our drink orders when we first arrived. Come to think of it the service was slow the whole night.

I won't complain about my meal because out of the three it was by far the best. I got the fish and chips and it was really good, and a huge serving. There were three cod fillets and a large helping of fries. The tarter sauce was probably the best I've ever had. That being said my mom ordered the scallops, and the presentation was awful. They brought it out in a large bowl probably three sizes too big for the amount of food that was in it. There were only five scallops sitting in a broth with carrots. No presentation at all, and for the price of that meal with absolutely no side included it was far from worth it.

My brother ordered the lamb burger and fries, and his serving of fries was about half as much as I got, which was a little confusing. The burger had too many flavors that did not mesh well together. The menu selection didn't offer enough choices in terms of meat, there was only once chicken dish. The drink menu was pretty good, but they were all pretty pricey, and for the amount of wine my mom got in her first glass it was not worth the price at all, I think it counted as ""half a glass of wine"" so it should have been half the price.

The interior was very nice and very ""British."" Our chairs were arm chairs that you would normally think of for a restaurant but they were very comfortable and made waiting for our food relaxing. All in all I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone, there are so many better places to eat on the strip.",2,2,1

My friend had ordered a glass of sparkling wine, but the one on the menu wasn't right, I mean come on update your menu. As to the menu it's not detailed enough 3 of us ordered ""toad in the hole"" but although the server questioned the order he didn't explain how much food it was, plus they were supposed to come with HP Sauce but didn't, when we asked for some they said they didn't have any (order hadn't come in). The food is ok, but the service is just so, so.

the selection of draft beers is fantastic. they even offer a draft hard apple and pear ciders. the pear was amazing and Matt was happy to let me try a sample of the apple as well.

We started with the duck poutine and the warm pretzels. Pretzels were wonderful and the English mustard was super spicy and delicious. Duck poutine was good but not a lot of confit for the price.

Fish and Chips was a mixed bag. the fish was excellent, cooked perfectly with a great malt vinegar presentation. We did not care for the ""Chips"" the french fries served witht he Poutine were much better.

Sticky toffee pudding an excellent. Peanut butter and Jelly dessert needed work. If I am in the Forum SHops or going to an event\/show at Caeser's I will be back.

I stated maybe they should give the bread after the order is put in. He stated ""you know our rent is $250,000 per month"".  My thought, you can't argue with stupid. They also removed the truffled fingerling potatoes, that was my favorite, from the menu. We ordered fish and chips and sliders. The fish and Chips were $30 and are only average. When some of us were done with our subpar meal the bus boy began removing plates and reaching right over my plate as I was still attempting to eat. I suggested to him that maybe he should wait until we are all done.   Tayler, in all his brilliance, decided to come over and tell us that the bus boy was the best they had, blah,blah, blah.

The good impressions started even before we entered the place. In the first moments of walking up to the restaurant, I fell in love with their uniforms! The hostess' are outfitted in the most adorably sexy newspaper dress accessorized with fingerless leather gloves and matching booties. Someone remind me to ask our loving David S. to steal one for me ;) The uniforms only got better as the rest of the FOH people were dressed in this awesome British punk street wear. Designer Allison Leach of Mad Men and Glee did one heck of a job of creating that awesome first impression.
 
Our server was a little too high energy for me. You know when you have that fake salesperson vibe when they're trying to sell you something? Yeah, it was a little much. But other then that our server and serving assistants were working like a well-oiled machine. My mother is a lightweight and needed a girly beer. Our server smartly suggested the strawberry Fruli... It is now her favorite beer ever. And bread service was amazing. It shows up warm and delicious with a cheddar cheese spread and whipped butter cream. Andthey don't have a problem with serving you seconds. Hands down the best bread basket in town. 
 
The food. Oh man, the food is British pub action on point. I was itching to try some Sheperd's Pie. And although it is one of the cheapest entrée items it was one of the most delicious non-Asian foods I've eaten in forever. Tender chunks of lamb, beef, and vegetables blanketed in mouth-watering mashed potatoes. *heaven* In the fish & chips, they used cod which was a little heavier on the breading but fried to perfection. And the chips (fries) were thick blocks of fried potato served piping hot. Instead of a salad, we ordered a side of Brussels sprouts sautéed with bacon and apples. The slices of apple were real treats! They absorbed all the delicious flavors from the seasoning  and the sugar cooked off in the little bit of bacon fat. Amazing! I wish there were more than just 2! 

The only downside to our meal was the lamb riblettes appetizer. Tiny bits of lamb were served with a creamy cumin-based yogurt sauce. It was tasty but for the price, portion size was absolutely abysmal. GR insider David S. says the lamb entrée is the way to go and 1000x better.
 
I'm loving GR's new diggs. It's cool but still upscale with the food & service to match. I shall return.

Server uniforms are fun, as are the little decorative touches like the custom cutlery. Dining room is much larger than it appears from the outside.

KETTLE CHIP NACHOS: huge portion of house-made kettle chips topped with corned beef, short rib, and English cheddar cheese. Definitely a shareable portion, in terms of size of the dish and how well the flavors worked together.
MAINE LOBSTER & SHRIMP ROLL MINIS: Two cute little rolls packed with shrimp and lobster salad. This version is way better than those served at the Phillips Seafood nearby. Generous amount of lobster and perfectly toasted, buttered rolls.
GRILLED LAMB BURGER: Yes, it's as good as other reviews say. Lamb was cooked perfectly medium, topped with curry onions (flavor was subtle) and a thick layer of goat cheese and feta spread. The burger itself was so good, we barely touched the side of fries- even though they come with a delicious garlic aioli that I couldn't get enough of.  

Heads up, the menu seems to change pretty frequently and many of the dishes mentioned and shown in previous reviews are no longer available so don't get your heart set on any one thing.

Again, not bad and completely inoffensive, but for 26 bucks my rather small portion left me wishing I'd either picked a different dish or different restaurant.

We also ordered a cheese plate to share. The sharp cheddar and goat cheese were quite good, but the English blue cheese tasted & looked like canned cheese with crumbled blue mixed in. The bread was too hard, and there wasn't enough of it. Eventually we were left eating the cheese alone.

I understand that Gordon Ramsay is not back in the kitchen personally and I understand none of his top Chefs are back there as well.  But I was shocked that he would put his name on the mediocre food that is served there. 

I ordered the Onion Soup and my wife ordered the Duck Confit Poutine for our lunch starters.  The Onion soup was good, it had a different after taste but it was a good soup.  My wife was not fond of the flavor of the soup.  Her Duck Confit Poutine was tasteless and was a slightly warm glob of a mess and again it was really tasteless.  

For our main dish I had the Traditional Sheppard's Pie and she had the Pub ""Spots"" (3 mini-house blend pub burgers.)  My Sheppard's pie was ok, not great but not horrible, I was shocked that it came out of a Gordon Ramsay kitchen.  It was bland and a bit greasy, it tasted like pot roast  that was served in my elementary school which I was not a fan of.   I have had much better Sheppard's Pie at Walt Disney World's EPCOT.   My wife's the Pub ""Spots"" (3 mini-house blend pub burgers.) were ordered Med Rare and came out over well done.  The overcooked burgers were taken off the bill, not by our request but by the server who agreed that they were not cooked properly and were way over cooked.   The wait staff again was excellent and I tipped her approx 30 percent because she and the rest of the staff were excellent.   

I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan and really enjoy reading his cookbooks and his television shows.  However, after the let down at Gordon Ramsay Steak and now at the Pub. 

 I just don't think I can spend our money on a product that is supposed to be top quality in all aspects and falls short, but you never know what the future brings..  I may go back..",1,0,0

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, ""the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!"" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.",42,18,17

We were pleased with our overall experience. We arrived around 7pm, were seated immediately without reservations, and were well-monitored by relatively friendly staff. We both got the fish and chips with some drinks. There were four huge fillets of fish and plenty of chips (fries), and everything tasted great. No disappointments! We should have split the dish (and I wish our server had warned us of the portions but it was our responsibility to ask). The beer and my cocktail were good (I got the mocha martini) but both arrived at the end of the meal, which was annoying . However, our server apologized for the wait, explaining that the bar was backed up. I liked the decor of the place, the servers' and host\/hostess's uniforms were really cool classic British punk themed.

My only significant complaint is regarding the few tables behind the host\/hostess counter. The table was very high compared to the low-resting chairs and made for an uncomfortable dining position. The table was also a bit wide and it was difficult to have a more intimate evening when we were seated so far apart and had to have a shouting match over the casino music.

I was somewhat disappointed - I really wanted the short rib sandwich and the fancy smancy fries. The lamb burger, while it was good, was no where worth $21. Come on Ramsay, I know its Vegas and all, but don't you think $21 for a lamb burger is a bit excessive?

As a beer lover, I was most excited about the beer offerings at Ramsay's Pub and Grill, which was supposed to have 36 beers on tap, and another 63 in bottles. I make a point to seek out new brews where ever I travel. The quantity of the beer selection at Ramsay's Pub was the sole reason my girlfriend and I made the trek for dinner that night. 

I was disappointed to find out that they do not have nearly this amount of beers for sale. They still have plenty (about 30-ish), but I was hoping to find something new, or perhaps a hard to find ale from when I used to live in London. If you visit hoping to drink some great craft brews, you will be let down. They stock the usual big brands, nothing special. Unless, of course, our server with-held some secret menu that contained the rest of the beers advertised on the website? I asked about this but was told everything they had was on the menu. :-(

As for the food, it's Vegas prices. High prices, almost too high for what they offer. I had the Steak and Ale pie, which is a staple of hearty pub food in the UK. But at $24, I suppose I expected something more than the underwhelming pie I received. I didn't think I would have to spice up a Gordon Ramsay pie with HP sauce... I've had better from UK chains like Fuller's. My girlfriend had the fish and chips, which were good, but still very expensive ($28) for what it is. 

Again, I understand it's Vegas and prices are inflated, but it just seems like too much for the food they offer. They can advertise it as ""elevated"" pub food, but in the end it's still just pub food and doesn't justify a $75 bill for steak and ale pie, fish and chips, and two drinks (a full draft pint is anywhere from $9-$13). 

I originally gave it 2 stars because of high prices, generally underwhelming food, and missing beer. But, the food wasn't bad, just not worth the high prices. The place does, however, have a great vibe. Lots of fun, but I would reconsider dining here again. For the price, there are better options. In fact, hundreds of options!

Especially having tried Gordon Ramsay Steak and loving it. With that said we were greeted by a cute chatty hostess to show us to our table. I liked the staffs outfits, dark wood decor and barrels stacked to create a wall between the bar and restaurant but I hated our table. The location was fine, but it was a high top with backless stools, I felt like a little kid and never felt comfortable. Request a booth, they look so comfy. We got food menus right away but had to wait for the drink menu, they brought us some water ( which wasn't the tastiest tap water) while we passed the one drink menu iPad around deciding what to drink. Doug was the only one getting a specialty cocktail, the Pub Crawl. It was light and tasty, I'd recommend it, he ended up getting a second one later. 
I had my heart set on a Scotch Egg but I noticed it wasn't on the menu, once we finally made our minds up on food I asked our waiter about the Scotch Egg, he said it's on the pub menu and offered to get us one. We waited and waited, when he finally came back, he asked if we were ready to order,  again I asked about the pub menu, he apologized and got us one within a minute. He seemed to discourage us from most things on the pub menu, not sure why? But I ended up getting the Scotch Egg which was very disappointing, it wasn't greasy, had a nice crunch but the sausage was dry and very spicy which overwhelmed the egg and I didn't care for dipping it in the hp sauce. I had one at another gastropub in town and it was tremendously better than Gordon's. 
We had also received their free bread service which included 3 different pretzel bites and a rye roll with pots of butter and cheese. Having 4 people at our table I think we should've gotten 2 but we all shared so we could have a bit of everything. They were all very good, I would order it if it wasn't complimentary. One thing we thought was strange was we didn't get bread plates to eat our bread or share the apps. Very messy.
When ordering our entrees, Doug was unsure on what to get and tried to get some help from the waiter, but it was one of those scenarios where they say everything is good but push the most expensive choice, not very helpful.
Our entrees came not too long after our apps and bread. Crowding our already small table, they never removed the Scotch Egg dish. There was a Pork Belly Roll, the Lamb T-Bone, and 2 of us got the Fish and Chips. We sampled each dish. The Pork belly was very moist and tender but it didn't have much else going on. The lamb was okay but nothing special, I didn't taste any of the mint jus that was suppose to be present, the mustard on the side was strong with horseradish but it was good. The Fish was tender and not greasy with a decent crunch but it wasn't anything special either, I've had better fish and chips at an English pub in town. The ""chips"" were way too big, not crispy at all, I didn't like them. The mushy peas were really nice and fresh tasting though. I couldn't finish one of fish pieces so asked for it to packed up, I think in higher end places the waiter should box it for you, but maybe that's just me. I had to box it myself.  
We couldn't leave with out getting the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. It was really good. Sweet, moist, gooey, some crispy spots all with a side of sweet cream ice cream. Yum.
Thus far my impression was poor service, don't waste your time on an entree here (IMO go to his steakhouse instead), seems like a good spot for drinks, small bites\/apps, and dessert. I have to say they were nice enough to allow us to hang out for awhile after dinner, they warned us they were closing for a private event so the place cleared out fast around us but let us stay til the last minute before they had to have everything ready. We were also well supplied with water, even though we had already paid and tipped. 

For the prices and name on the door, I was disappointed. Gordon, say it ain't so!",5,0,0

My girlfriend loved the braised pork belly dish and I was glad to have their Fish n Chips with a side of beer. The fish and chips was well prepared and it was a very generous portion.  It was served with a rosemary tartar sauce and garlic mayo.  I really enjoyed it.

My top recommendation is that you absolutely cannot miss Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding.  It was so good that I'm going to plan to stop at this restaurant the next time I'm in town.  I was happy to find out that this dessert is a staple at most of his restaurants.  If you have the opportunity...get that dessert!  It's a warm toffee pudding - the consistency of bread pudding - and it's served with a hot caramel sauce and cream fraiche ice cream.  It isn't overly sweet and it's a very well balance mixed of flavors.

They're were surprisingly filling, but there were only peppers and meat on the top, not layered it's the chips. Since we got them during happy hour, the price was reasonable for what we received, but we would have felt robbed if we'd paid full price. The pot pie was under seasoned, and there was no salt or pepper at the table. The waitress came to ask if we wanted any halfway through the meal. The bacon pieces in it were fatty and limp, the crust was soggy, and there were maybe 5 pieces of kale in the whole thing. Portion was small by American standards, which was what I expected and would have been fine except that it didn't come with any sides. Odd for a dinner entree, and really ridiculous for the $24 price.

I had the most enjoyable dining experience at GR's Pub & Grill. Being warmly greeted and seated quickly established my positive impression and the staff maintained the momentum. Our server, Joshua, arrived promptly and took exceptional care of us. 

We started off with Spiced Cider and Sloe Bramble cocktails. The sweet cinnamon flavor of the cider hit the spot. I cannot recommend it enough! The Sloe Bramble was ""berry"" nice but lacking in the wow factor. I enjoyed rifling through the online bar menu on Joshua's tablet. 

The Rib & Cheek Sandwich is beyond tender. It was flavorful and rich. The potatoes were huge and nicely seasoned on the outside with Parmesan cheese. 

The Mac N Cheese is divine. I adore the truffle and tiny duck fat crouton topping. Just a luscious dish. 

For dessert a must is the Sticky Toffee Pudding! Forgo the Chocolate Trifle and order two of the puddings! Don't worry about the servings being too big. They are just right.

The salad was just a big waste of time, had some good elements but not worth the money or the time to chew it . 

As for the pies, now that's where the magic is. the combo is 3 pies, chicken lamb and the famous shepherd pie. Each one was absolutely great but the Shepherd pie definitely blew the others out of the way. So flaky, and warm, it was just perfect.

First of all, the food is so bad. I can't believe Ramsay would even want his name associated with this restaurant. We tried multiple dishes on the menu including the caesar salad, beef pie, scallops, and lamb. The caesar salad had overly fishy, bad tasting anchovies which you could barely taste under the dressing the salad was drenched in. The beef pie was not only much too salty, but too peppery as well. The scallops must not have been cleaned because eating them was like eating a handful of sand on the beach. They were also in a chowder type broth that was mostly potatoes with no flavor. The lamb was nothing special and irony tasting. We enjoyed nothing except our cocktails, which by the way were excellent. Guess this is the place to only grab a drink. I would expect food like this at Denny's, but not at an extremely high priced restaurant with Ramsay's name attached to it. 

The best part if the story is that this awful foodie experience took place on a night that Ramsay was actually visiting the restaurant, but he clearly wasn't watching what was going on in the kitchen and was preoccupied by fans. If we couldn't have a somewhat decent meal with him there I would sure be afraid to try this place when he isnt there.

A square table for four, we sat in our mismatched, padded high back chairs.  All of us sunk.  Me, a 6' foot tall man, having to arch my arms up to grasp a fork and knife.  I felt worse for the girls.  I used to work with interior designers so all I could think of was, ""Who picked out these disfunctional chairs for the restaurant?  Does anyone height check to see that they are suitable to dine in?  Are there some telephone books I can put beneath my bottom so that I can see what's on the table?""  

Very important... There are two menus here.  The full dinner menu and the bar snacks\/small bites menu.  No matter where you sit in the restaurant (at the bar or not), you can order from the bar menu.  If your server doesn't hand one to you ask for it.  Some of the dishes over lap, but there are others that don't.  

Bread Basket - Good.  There were four different breads, including pretzel bread with bacon bits and caraway seed buns with pumpkin seeds on top. A salted butter and a cheese dipping sauce.  

Little Piggy Deviled Eggs - Could definitely taste the bacon in the deviled egg spread.  They serve you four egg whites empty and you fill them yourself with however much deviled egg spread you want.  It wasn't whoa crazy crazy, but everyone enjoyed these.  

Fresh Fried Potato Chips with Herbs & French Onion Dip - The potato chips were my favorite food of the night!  Light and crispy, perfect for snacking on.  I could've downed the whole bowl of chips myself, but I opted to share.  I think it's $2 more if you'd like them done Salt & Vinegar style.  

Fish and Chips\/Cod and Chips - Three generously sized pieces served with mushy peas (mushed peas mixed in with whole peas) and fries.  I liked the peas better than the fries, which is sad because usually the potato always wins with me.  The fries were too soft for my liking.  

Pan Seared Diver Scallops - My friend loved and devoured these.  4 large scallops with artichoke hearts, carrots and spring garlic.  A light dish for pub food. 

Sheperd's Pie - The other friend said this was okay.  No complaints.  

Burger - Was okay.  My friend swapped out her fries for the Smashed Fingerling Potatoes at no extra charge.  

Smashed Fingerling Potatoes - Wanna enjoy your meal that much more?  Swap out your fries (or some other side) for this.  The fingerling potatoes have much crunch and flavor than the fries.  Cooked with butter, double cream and black truffle!  Mmmm... the truffle.  So rich but so good!

A few notes and thoughts:

If you don't have one, get your Caesar's Players' Club Card before eating here.  Each dish is discounted $1-2 as long as one person in your party has the free players' card.  

The restaurant is pricey considering it's ""only"" pub food.  I know, I'm in Vegas... pay to play.  But $28 fish and chips and a $20 burger?  There was no ""wow"" factor with any of the major dishes.  Food quality overall is not whoa, but it's solid.  

They have a good selection of beers, but I thought they'd have more UK beers on tap.  They didn't even have Smithwick's or Harp on tap or in a bottle.  

Our server was nice and brought us all that we needed, but it took awhile to track her down a couple of times because she had too many tables to watch.  The restaurant could probably schedule a couple of extra servers on the weekends.  

Overall it's 3.5 stars, with price knocking down the rating.  When it's $180 for four people with three of us having one drink each (and no wine), that's pricey for pub food.",11,8,6

No tables and the hostess said they basically wouldn't have any tables available for the rest of the night - so luckily we found two spots at the bar. We shared the Scotch Eggs, Lobster Rolls and Fish and Chips. Everything was just OK - I was expecting more from Gordon Ramsay!!! The Scotch Egg was basically just one egg, cut in two. At most pubs, when you order Scotch eggs, you usually get at least two eggs - for half the price of what we paid for this one. As far as taste, it was just OK - they put some kind of sauce on it that was almost a little too much. The lobster rolls were pretty flavorless, in hindsight I'm not even sure why we ordered them. I guess it sounded good at the time. The fish and chips was the best thing we ordered - and also the most expensive fish and chips I've ever had. The fish was actually the best thing - the chips were just mediocre. The fish was really good though - and the tartar sauce was tasty. Also, they close at 11:00, which was weird to me for a pub in Vegas. I definitely won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to others. So many better places to eat in Vegas!!",0,0,0

Never been to a snobby english prick restaurant before, but there's a first time for everything.  For perspective, our res was New Year's Day.  Waitress was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu (coincidentally she LOVED all the expensive stuff on the menu, I guess it is Vegas...).  Aside from the weird, tight, newspaper looking dresses that Gordon frocked them in, the waitstaff seemed on the ball as a whole.  

Not sure what was going on in the kitchen though, it took a bit over an hour for our food.  If you haven't seen the menu its a trendy gastropub fare with flashes of England throughout.  I got the Lamb T-bone and it was so damn salty my foot swelled almost immediately.  For some reason, all four of our meals seemed a bit salty to me, I guess it is pretty typical english fare but I was a bit disappointed.  The atmosphere was awash with loud english flair accented by the waitstaff's overly loud garb.  

Gordon, I just expected more from you.  If you're gonna make a fish and chips joint, be sure to keep it simple and rely on the pure flavor of the food not overseasoning as compensation.",5,1,1

Overall, it was good, but there were definitely some large flaws that pulled down my review to 3 stars.  I arrived a little late (about 10 minutes after the rest of my party) and the waitress seemed instantly offended by my tardiness and decided to be rude to me.  It took her forever to take my order, and she seemed annoyed to speak to me and have to take a second order for the table.  

When the food came out, they completely messed up our entire order.  The waitress hadn't ordered the first people in the party's food, so I got my plate and everyone else was waiting around.  The waitress became somewhat more apologetic at that point, but the speed of the service was terrible.

As for the food, I ordered fish and chips.  The fish was really good but the chips were dry and over-salted.  I thought they had a good beer selection as well which I was happy about.

Our waitress was very pleasant and friendly, she took our drink order right away and returned with our drinks promptly. We then ordered food, my brother got the burger and I ordered the chicken sandwich. 

The food came quickly (it was 2:30pm on Wednesday and not busy) but it wasn't very good. The fries were soggy and way over salted. My chicken sandwich was really greasy too.

What I guess was some type of manager visited a table next to us during our 2 hour dinner literally 15 times - and quickly came by once early in our meal to check in.  Reminded me of some of the shlub managers Ramsey runs in to on Kitchen Nightmares.   Another manager at the hostess station was also a waste - we had 8:30p reservations and arrived promptly, we were asked by three different people why we were waiting - including a manager, who when we said we had reservations asked if they were for 7:45p - presumably to give us grief for showing up late... but then just turned and walked away - rude!!!

I am a huge fan of Ramsay's TV shows -  so really wanted to like the whole experience, but it just wasn't happening. Luckily we had no specific plans for after dinner, because I never would have thought a pub and grill dinner would take two hours (it should not have - just inefficient).

This hands down has to me one of the best sweets I've ever eaten.  I don't have much of  a sweet tooth but this dessert was delicious.  

The meal itself was a little on the pricy side for being lunch but it's Vegas, so it comes with the territory.  The waitress was both so nice, knowledgable, and made great recommendations.",1,0,1

The waitstaff is on-point. They're quick with drinks, friendly, super-high-energy, well-dressed, well-versed on the menu, quick to offer suggestions, and they just go above and beyond to cater to your needs.

The atmosphere is great. It's a perfect setting as a pub. It didn't seem as loud as other reviewers were complaining about.

Where this place is lacking (and I'm so surprised I'm saying this) was the food. I had the fish and chips. While I appreciated the nod toward Gordon Ramsay's heritage, there's really nothing authentic about the dish aside from the minted mushy peas. They tasted just like my grandma's peas (Which led to an awkward conversation with my dining companion when I accidentally let it slip that they tasted like ""her peas"").

The fish and chips weren't really like anything I've had in England. The batter was soggy inside\/under-cooked, and the chips were potato wedges, also undercooked... And completely bland. They hadn't seen a bit of salt.

Other things we tried were excellent, though. The pretzels were great. And the sticky toffee pudding may have been the best thing I've ever put in my mouth in my entire life.

Maybe we just got a bad batch for our entrees, but I kind of hold this restaurant to a higher standard than most. Unfair? Maybe. But it could have been better.",2,0,0

And in my view  one of the best places on the Strip is Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris casino. We go there from time to time and we're consistently impressed. It's excellent from the moment you sit down to the minute you leave. We're not all too concerned with price, particularly for a great experience, but it's hard not to notice how expensive Steak is. Still, it's just that good. 

This weekend we gave Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill a try at Caesars casino. It's decidedly different. Far more casual than Steak and focused on pub style food. Overall, we had a very good experience but as I recollect it now, I'm not sure it's enough to get us to go back. It's the kind of place that I'd gladly step into if I were strolling through Caesars, perhaps there to shop at the attached mall, but I don't think I'd make a special trip in just to eat there again. It's not that it's bad, not at all. But it's surrounded by a city full of great dining experiences.

To start (and despite some terrible reviews here to the contrary), our server was lovely, vivacious and helpful. She was friendly and attentive. The bar menu, complete with some innovative custom cocktails, tons of beer options, and a serviceable wine list, was presented on an iPad that provides plenty of details and an easy way to sort through to find what you want. We started with two of their own cocktails (I tried ""Mother's Ruin,"" a nice mix of gin, sage liqueur, cucumber and lime), and some oysters, which were tastefully presented on cutting boards with traditional accompaniments. The bread service was a nice array of crusty, warm, house-baked pretzels (three different kinds) and a nice cheese dipping sauce, all very good. 

The only hiccup in service was when our mains arrived so quickly that our appetizers hadn't yet been cleared. The servers who delivered them (not our waitress but two other men) seemed flummoxed. Their hands full they sort of just looked at us to move the dishes aside for them. But the table being small, there really was no place to put the spent plates and utensils. A line manager came to help, but he too seemed sort of clueless and overwhelmed. Neither of us thought too much of it and helped as best we could, but it was a strange moment that you'd expect the team was better trained to handle.

Our food was good. I had the beef cheeks, which has the consistency of a pot roast. It was served over some mashed potatoes and roasted onion. The portion was very generous and the dish was tasty, though just a little underseasoned. My wife had the mustard-basted flat iron steak served with an onion puree and Stilton cheese. Good, but underwhelming, she said.

We split sides of smashed fingerling potatoes (which were seasoned with double cream, butter, and black truffle) and creamed spinach with Stilton cheese. Both were very good. The sticky toffee pudding for dessert was excellent.

At the bar that night was Jan'el Witt, the recent winner of Ramsay's television show ""Hell's Kitchen."" Our waitress told us that she'd begin her reward as the ""head chef"" of the Pub & Grill in August. 

So, in all, that leaves us at about a 3-star rating. A nice evening, a good meal, a fun time. But with so many options in Vegas, I'm not sure we'll be back again to the Pub & Grill. Unlike Gordon Ramsay Steak, which just screams a kind of uniqueness, Pub & Grill is good, but perhaps not special enough to warrant a return trip.",3,0,0

Except for the Calamari which were good, everything else was horrible. The chicken wings were meatless (a vegetarian could have eaten them for all the chicken they had). The prime rib was so tough that my father in law sent his back. I nibbled at enough of mine that I didn't send it back, but you could tell it was old, tough, dog food grade meat.

Gordon Ramsay should be ashamed of himself! His next Kitchen Nightmares should be filmed in his own bloody restaurant!

I had made a reservation for a table of four, two months prior to our visit to Vegas and even specified the Birthday on the reservation. We arrive at the Pub, 8 minutes early and are greeted in a frantic fashion from the hostess staff and are told to move over to the side and wait, as if we were in the way while they seat another party of 4 without a reservation, before us. What was the point of making a reservation? We waited patiently and another hostess comes over and gives is a choice- high top in the bar or wait until a table open ups in the dining area. Again, what was the point of a reservation? Annoyed at this point, we take the high top. Another customer is using one of our bar stools, so I kindly ask her if I can sit in the chair. The hostess should have done this. The server was fine. The food was okay, but the portions were very small and the Prime Rib special for $55 was a complete price gouge- a fatty slice with really silly sized sides of mashed potatoes and carrots. The 8 oz filet served with 3 puny asparagus stalks for $42 was another price gouge. The shepherds pie portion was very small. The roasted chicken was served in a massive plate with massive amounts of chick peas relative to the small size roasted chicken. We prefer smaller portion sizes, but the price here at GR Pub & Grill has increased too much for what we received. We ordered 2 desserts and they were good, not great.

While it wasn't a nightmare dining experience, it was disappointing because I know the hell GR puts other restaurants through.

Misses:  French soup was not a soup but an onion stew.  Way overdone on the onions and the bread was burnt on the edges.

Shepherd's Pie had greasy gravy instead of a well-developed flavorful, thick gravy.  

The service was fast on delivering the food and drinks but slow on clearing plates, not getting the right entree in front of the right person (that has to be an expected from GR!?) and checking back in, not bringing malt vinegar automatically for fish & chips nor a lime for a vodka and tonic.

Hits:  Atmosphere was fun, if a little loud.

Mini Burger Sliders were small but tasty.

Mashed potatoes on top of the shepherd's pie - so smooth and well executed.

Dear Mr. Gordon 
I live here in Las Vegas and I had friends come in to town from Corpus Christi, Texas we had gone to Ceasars to eat the buffet but found ourselves having to wait for 2 hrs in a half just to get in so instead my husband was looking through the Internet and found that you had a restaurant there at Ceasars so he knows I watch you all the time on T.V. and came up with the idea to let's try it so we did as we were greeted with a well manner manager I told him I see you all the time on T.V. and he told me I had just miss you that you had been there the day before so I was sad but I just wanted to tell you that we all really enjoyed everything we ordered my husband ordered a burger with bacon and of course I had the rib eye steak and a salad everyone was very nice and in great spirits I just wanted to say it was the best food I have had in a long time that I can't even remember when I had a great time and eating great food I will definitely go again and try something else next time I mean no words can't describe how great your food really taste like until they have had it I was also so amazed when I took a bite off my husband's burger it didn't smell like a burger it smelled and taste as you were eating a great piece of steak it was awesome I will give you 5 stars and  A plus plus plus plus plus plus that's how good it was thank you so much for bring great food to vegas I think others need to learn from your restaurant so we can have better food here in las vegas home of the world!!!!

We had the deviled eggs to start with. They were just ok, way over priced. I would have thought for somewhere around $12.00 we would have gotten more than two boiled eggs ( 4 halves) the taste wasn't anything special.

My husband had the fish and chips, he liked the fish fairly well but some of the chips\/fries were way under cooked. He couldn't even eat all of them due to the fact that the potato was hard in the middle.

I had the chicken chopped salad. The dressing was flavorless, the flavors all blended together, (what little flavor there was) I wasn't even certain that there was chicken in the salad until I was able to finally spot  it, once I tasted it, I realized that it wasn't worth looking for. There were large chunks of hard lettuce mixed into the salad that was fairly bitter.

My husband and daughter ordered different versions of their burger, and both loved them.  We also got a side of Brussels Sprouts.  These were very smoky and a bit overcooked, but otherwise okay.

They have this funny gimmick where your server hands you an iPad so you can view the drink menu.  There are buttons you can tap to place a drink order, only they don't actually work.  Turns out, the order isn't really placed via the iPad; you still have to order your drinks from your server.  Seems like a waste of time and technology to me.

We love all things Gordan Ramsey, just not sure if this is an accurate highlight of his talents. 

The butter chicken curry is supposedly one of the star dishes which takes four days to prepare. While the chicken was tender and the curry was decent, the basmati rice was actually one of my favorite parts of the dish. The naan was a pretty charred (which the boyfriend actually loved... Me, not so much) and the yogurt tasted like it was just plain yogurt with a bit of citrus.  I'd take lower-quality Indian buffet food over this for a fraction of the price. 

The charcuterie board came with slightly more than a single serving of each item and the cheeses of the night were a Cabot cheddar (wait, can't I get a while block of this at the store?) and what I think was a drunken goat cheese...

I asked what wines they served by the glass and when he mentioned there was a Malbec, I inquired what the price was.  The server quoted $9-11.  I said ok.  Our food arrived and the pretzels were a variety including plain, herbed and bacon\/cheddar.  I told the server I was a vegetarian and he looked shocked.

Yes--I realize he is not there personally making every order--but I was hoping for much more--particularly at this price point. As I mentioned--I went for the fish and chips, anticipating authenticity and flavor. Unfortunately, the fish was very bland, and had a very strong, oily taste that I could not quite figure out. I've eaten my share of fried foods--and know what overused oil tastes like--but this was something different. The chips were also less than impressive, and the portion was rather small.

Took a bit for the bartenders to realize I was new and have not been helped. Once noticed I ordered a bloody marry and that was fantastic. I then ordered a 1\/2dz wings and a medium burger with fries. I was expecting u wings to come first since they were an app but when they came the burger was served at the same time...

I started with the wings. The second one I bit into was raw. yuck! What a turn offfffff. They got sent back and they brought me new ones but after biting into raw chicken in the first set I couldn't think about eating them the second time around. Didn't even really want to eat my burger after that. My burger was suppose to medium but it came out medium rare and the bun was soggy but at this point I just sucked it up and just ate it. I had to ask for ketchup. When it was brought to me I thought it was cocktail sauce but was informed by the bartender that was how they made their ketchup.

Over all I give you two stars for the fact that your bloody Mary's are the bomb and I appreciated the managers checking in on me. Not charging me for the wings and hooking me up with a second drink.

Less than thrilled about the dinner but the service was very good. Eating at one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants was a bucket list item so on my recent vacation to Las Vegas we went to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  I was so disappointed.  I ordered what was named a Classic Ramsey Beer Braised Short Ribs, 1st the order came out in less than 5 minutes... before our drinks and everything was ice cold; the rib, potato puree and vegetables.  Our waiter caught on very quickly that the food came out very fast and asked if it was ok.  I told him it was ice cold and he returned it right away.

The re-fire order came with minimal sauce on the short rib, the puree had small lumps and the vegetables tasted under cooked but like they were cooked in oil that was not hot enough because they were greasy.

I have been a fan of Gordon Ramsey through his recipes and TV shows.  Quality seems to be #1 for his brand, however Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill did not have quality control in the kitchen as a priority.

Since I did not eat much for dinner and we had traveled so far to get to Vegas we ordered dessert.  Our waiter recommended the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  The waiter was wonderful, because I have a nut allergy he had them make the dessert with the brittle on the side.  I have to admit that I am not a dessert person but that had to be the best tasting dessert I ever had.  Keep in mind it is very sweet.  I shared the dessert with my mother and we were only able to eat half, but it is worth tasting at least once in life.

Because I went for dinner and not dessert I would not return. Another item crossed off my bucket list but I am so disappointed.",1,0,0

The 2 of us were seated near the back of the restaurant. The ambiance\/vibes are definitely watered down back there.

I would caution accepting high reviews on face value. Appears they must have had a stellar opening and served drinks because the good reviews rarely focused on the Dinner food but liked the bar. Guess it depends on if you are there to eat or drink!

Overall, I left my short trip to Vegas feeling I had wasted one good meal opportunity given the price there are just too many other outstanding choices to waste a dollar or precious time here!

I had saved over a year for my 40th birthday celebration, prepared to make this an experience of a lifetime, until all the friends I invited bailed leaving me spending my 40th in Vegas with my ex-boyfriend\/best friend. We decided to make it a lavish affair, buying backstage passes to ""O"" and booking reservations at Gordon Ramsay Steak, fulfilling dreams I thought beyond my reach.

July 27th , 2013 - Dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak

I have watched every episode of Hell's Kitchen so we decide to splurge and order the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu with Wine Pairings, fulfilling both my foodie and photographic dreams to eat, and capture food perfection. Our waiter William, and sommelier Thomas were fantastic and might even remember me as the girl in the pink tutu and rainbow furries. Every moment was savoured and devoured, as an evening of good food should be.  Christina Wilson was the chef that day, and I remember happily paying our $600 bill upon receiving my sealed, numbered, souvenir menus to take home.

What we didn't know as we dressed to see ""O"" the next day is that those menus were already gone, it was not until I looked through the pictures while on the plane and confirmed with my friend when I returned to Canada that we realized neither of us had packed them...because the maid had thrown them out.

I contacted the hotel to search for them, not realizing at first that they were not even in our room on the last day. After a lengthy investigation (6 months), I was informed Planet Hollywood was not accepting responsibility for my menus, and therefore consider the matter closed. I was heartbroken. I attempted to reach out to Gordon Ramsay Steak, it was certainly not the restaurants' fault, but I thought I'd tell them my story in case they could reprint my menus or something. I called the restaurant on multiple occasions, being put on hold and transferred over and over again to the hotel. I never did manage to talk to anyone at the restaurant, until a recent visit to Vegas (April 2015) with my 13 year old daughter.  I wanted to show her where I had discovered my food love, and took a chance on approaching the hostess, I don't think I got one sentence out before I realized she wasn't even listening and then dismissed me saying sorry there is nothing we can do.  Deflated once more, I gave up on having any chance of fixing this situation and thought I had moved on, until tonight.

June 19th, 2015 - Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill

We meet our lovely and kind waitress Elyse, while grabbing a late dinner before our first night @EDC.  Throughout the course of our delicious meal I share the story of my 40th birthday, the amazing food and sad ending, tears begin to fall.  Elyse decides to make this dinner extra special, and brings me a piece of fabulous sticky toffee pudding closely followed by Scott Cummings carrying an autographed menu, I was over the moon.  While being regaled with Gordon Ramsay stories, Randall (the Bar Manager) brings me a couple of lovely mementos and asked to share my story on Yelp.

I'd say we are both ""amateur"" foodies, but we will go out of our way for good food, never fast food.  

The food was great, and a vey ample selection of beer, wine and drinks to choose from- that thankfully they condensed by using an iPad- making it much easier to navigate than a bulky menu.

We shared the duck confit, my husband ordered the beef short rib and cheek sandwich, and I had the fish and chips.  The duck was so tender and sweet, no gamey after taste at all.  My husbands sandwich looked beautiful and the small piece he shared with me tasted wonderful, my fish was amazing.  It was so light and wasn't greasy.  (A silly side note... the ketchup is AMAZING- and I normally hate ketchup)

I've seen other reviews saying it's expensive or that they had long wait times or that portion sizes aren't huge....  my husband is a decent sized guy, 6'5"" and a good 250 lbs and his meal was enough to satisfy.  I am much smaller and almost never can finish my plate, but I could finished this one and we both had room for the BEST dessert ever.... the Sticky Toffee Pudding is definitely a recommendation.  

I, personally, appreciated that it wasn't an over sized portion.  Mainly because I hate not finishing my plate and not having any place to store leftovers (our room didn't have a fridge).  

The price was on par with all things Vegas in my opinion (at least on the strip).  For the food, the experience and the atmosphere are worth it.",0,0,0

Considering we were seeing Elton John, it really completed a British evening. We made reservations on Open Table and like any place on the Strip on a Sat night, reservations are key. I overheard the wait was 30 minutes but we were seated straight away, due to pre-planning.

We started off with the calamari which was fresh, crisp and had a hint of heat due to the peppers. They were served with two types of sauces, a tartar and cocktail. The serving was a good size as it allowed enough room for the main courses.

I ordered the typical WWII patriotic English dish of Fish and chips. It was not served in newspaper, sorry folks. I was pleased to see the fish as one long piece which is typical in England. I've visited the UK about four times and when I order fish and chips it's always as long as my forearm. The fish at Gordon Ramsey was no exception. The chips were actually potato wedges and not your typical chips. I ate a few only because I don't eat a lot of potatoes, it's a personal thing :). It also came with a side of yummy mushy peas, another typical British accompaniment with fish and Chips. 

I highly recommend their sticky toffee pudding. For us Yanks, our pudding is different so don't expect the stuff you buy in cups and lick the lid. It's more of a sticky cake and served with a side of warm caramel and vanilla ice cream. It was sooooooooooooooo gooooooooood!!! Omg. It was moist, sweet, sticky and when you add caramel it takes it to a whole new dimension. 

So to round it up, experiment and go with the British dishes. I mean you are in a British pub\/ restaurant!",6,3,4

We watch his shows and thought dinner would be amazing. The first two items we ordered were ""86ed"". We said that was too bad since we really wanted to have them and the waiter replied that it was ""good"" since they were busy that night.  Good for him, bad for us,  but it didn't occur to him to think that way.  My husband ordered rack of lamb, and since the apps we wanted were not available he asked about the portion size and was told it was "" three bones"". When  the dish came with two, he asked the waiter about it and the waiter said he would check with the kitchen, then came back and told us he was misinformed  and the serving  went by weight. However, he agreed that it looked like a double cut chop, not a rack of lamb for $38. The meat was chewy,had no sauce, & needed seasoning.

My son ordered the short ribs.  I noticed he didn't eat much of the meat...very strange for a 17 year old!!  I could tell something wasn't quiet right....

We returned to our hotel and within three hours he became so violently Ill that he ended up in the ER on IV fluids and medications.  The doctor mentioned it was most likely something he ate, And asked when his last meal was.  Apparently the timing is perfect.  No way to prove it, but I fully believe it was this meal.

I was seated promptly at a high top table in the bar area close to the railing opened to the casino floor.  I got an iced tea, and I ordered bangers and mash for the main course and chocolate trifle for dessert.

The bangers and mash were OK.  Three small sausages of chicken, beef, and pork served with a modicum of mashed potatoes and with some onion gravy and fried onion sticks.  It was a small portion for a mere $24.

The chocolate trifle was very good--it made the evening.  It was made with both light and dark chocolate and topped with Chantilly cream.  There were two small cookies with the trifle.  It wasn't overly sweet.

Service was OK.  My server was a very pleasant woman.  While she brought my iced tea quickly, she was never back to ask about refills.  A busser was going around refilling water glasses so that was a help.

This is a convenient place to go for dinner when going to the Colosseum but it is Strip pricing plus.  I think another time I'll go to the food court.  There are several options and they'd be much less pricey than this.",16,4,11

Even though the place looked packed, we were seated within 5 minutes of walking in without a reservation. We didn't want to spend too much money since we had mistakenly come to Caesar's looking for Ramsey's BURGR and decided to eat here since we were starving.

We were seated behind the wall of beer kegs which was awkward since the table was raised and we were technically sharing the table with another group on the other side. The table was also weirdly wide and the place was noisy so we couldn't have much conversation. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and I had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is a side dish. The fish and chips was surprisingly big. The fish was well seasoned and still moist. With the tartar sauce they tasted really good. The fries were also nice and crisp and well seasoned. The house made ketchup was really good. The lobster Mac n' cheese was a bit underwhelming. The noodles were a nice al dente and the bechamel sauce was rich and creamy but I was expecting more lobster for the price (ridiculously $21). And it was still side dish size. I had maybe 1 small piece of  lobster for every 7 bites which is too small a ratio to call it lobster Mac n' cheese if you ask me! Also could have used more cheese, but I guess that's personal preference.

First night we came for drinks and a snack.  We had the Vic Queen Chips and Deviled Eggs.  Both were excellent.  The Chips were very delicate - thinly cut and perfectly fried - served with a side of malt vinegar for dipping.  Just excellent!!  The Deviled Eggs were served in an interesting way.  The egg whites were served separately, sprinkled with parsley, and the yolks were served in a small cup for you to scoop out and put as much as you wanted into the egg whites. The yolks were smashed and mixed with smokey bacon and cheese.   They were by far the best deviled eggs I have ever had.  In all, this experience was 5 star.

The second night we came shortly after 5 PM for the dinner menu.  We again sat at the bar.  They were out of the first beer that I ordered, but offered me a sample of another beer that I might like.  The bartender was very helpful.  We ordered the Fish & Chips.  It took about 25 minutes for us to get our food, which is a little long, but we thought it might be due to a lot of folks ordering right around 5 PM when they start the dinner menu.  I figured if anyone could do fish & chips right it would be Gordon Ramsay - however, I was disappointed in this meal.  It was definitely not the best fish & chips that I had ever had.  The fish was OK, the batter was really good, but the fish was a little dry & tough - like it had been overcooked.  I prefer fish that is more moist and flaky.  A thicker piece of fish would probably have held up better to the cooking.  The potatoes were the biggest disappointment, though.  We expected chips (french fries) what we got were big blocks of potatoes - hand cut in rectangles - which had been boiled and baked and fried into a state of blandness that I would never expect from a Gordon Ramsay product.  They were hard at the ends, like they had been overdone.  They were not seasoned at all - no salt when they were removed from the deep fryer - and no flavor at all.  However, the mushy peas were outstanding!!!  I have never really liked mushy peas - I mean, really, who would like anything called mushy peas?  However, this was a combination of whole baby peas and mushy peas with some seasoning that had me eating the entire portion (a first for me.)

In general the bartenders were very helpful and friendly.  Would have been nice had someone checked on our dinner and let us know the status when we went so long without getting our meal, but that's a small point.

I liked the decorations.  It's pretty noisy with music playing but not so much that we couldn't hear each other or talk to the people next to us.  It was pretty busy for 5 PM.  Probably even busier later on.

I would go again, but not for the Fish & Chips - definitely for the Deviled Eggs though.",2,0,0

Fish & Chips; thick soggy batter with white mush inside for fish and Zero flavor.  The chips big huge block like sticks of greasy mush potato.

Brook Trout; a slab of fish with no flavor and root vegetables that tasted just like dirt.

I started dinner off with a cocktail. I had the spiced cider which was amazinggg. If you like any kind of ciders or if apples are your favorite fruit get this drink. It was very tasty. I also loved that they brought out pretzels and bread as a free appetizer. They give you a roll and three different kinds of pretzels along with a horse radish cheese dip and butter. Amazing and a great touch to the start of the meal. I got the Beef Cheek stew because our waiter said that if you wanted to try something different to eat that. I really enjoyed it. The beef was so so tender, maybe just a bit on the salty side. I was surprised because it wasn't so much of a stew as it was just beef with potatoes and veggies. I still enjoyed it though-I love when my beef is tender. We also got a side of the Yukon potatoes. They were great and went really well with the beef. I would get these as a side again. Then for dessert we had the chocolate dessert. I forget what its called but it has three different kinds of chocolate mousse in between chocolate cake and topped with whipped cream and chocolate caiver. It's served in a mason jar which I thought was cute. It was Delicious! And my favorite part of the meal (of course). I would get this again.

Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill resides in the space formerly occupied Bradley Ogden, one of the early pioneers of chef-driven restaurants in Las Vegas.  Given what came before in the space, GRP&G and its gastropub cuisine had a tough act to follow.  While GRP&G may tout itself as an English pub, from a design perspective, it looked like anything but.  No matter, since I wasn't there to dissect the interior design.  

On the first night, I had the Pub Crawl ($15) made with Knob Creek Bourbon, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, fresh lemon, mint & black tea syrup.  Perfectly balanced, nicely sweet, but not overdone, it was a big winner!  On the second night, I left it in the hands of the talented bartenders to craft me something with whiskey, boozy and bitter.  I don't know what they made me, but it was a taste success.  We also had the Duck Confit Poutine ($13\/12 for Total Rewards members), which may have seemed out of place at an English pub, but I found it tasty if a bit untraditional. The fries were hot and crispy reminiscent of McDonald's fries in a very good way.  They were topped with a relatively generous amount of nicely tender and moist duck.  Thoughtfully, a flavorful and thankfully not overly salty duck gravy was served on the side allowing you to sauce the dish yourself (and likely preserve the crispiness of the fries).  What seemed to be missing from the dish were the expected cheese curds.  Perhaps they don't use it in their recipe since it wasn't listed on the menu or maybe they didn't add very much and it was simply lost in the dish.  Nevertheless, cheese curds would've added a nice color, textural, and flavor contrast to the poutine.

Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill was an unexpected good time.  However, it was the friendliness, professionalism, and skill of the bartenders in crafting our drinks on both nights that really made it memorable.  If Gene, either of the Adams, and\/or Raul are behind the bar, you'll be in very good hands with regards to craft cocktails, great customer service and witty banter.  As for the food, it was good, but not on par with the drinks.  Hopefully, with the newly anointed Hell's Kitchen winner in kitchen, the food will come together more completely and coherently with the rest of the restaurant.

My parents each had a beef burger and lamb burger. They were really good. 

My date had the vegetable salad, which was refreshing, amazing, and light. I would so go back just for that! The vinaigrette on it was so delectable. 

He had the scallops for his entree, which was covered in the best white sauce. It was so good that I kept dipping my fish in it or my fries. Definitely the best out of the ones we ordered. 

As a side, we all had the lobster mac and cheese to share for the table. Um ... yes. This was actually better than the mac & cheese at GR's Steak. There were HUGE chunks of lobster in it. 

By the end, I was licking the bowl - we sadly have photographic proof of this that I must now go destroy. 

Also, GR's Pub & Grill have two of the dishes that are exclusives to his Hell's Kitchen menu at Steak: Scottish Egg and the toffee dessert!!!!

Pub and Grill is located right in Caesar Palace near the coliseum.  We came on Friday around 5:00 pm.  The wait was minimal and we were quickly seated.  I have to say I'm not really a pub and fish and chips kind of girl so I was happy to see a diverse menu. We ordered the potato chips nachos (very good) to share and for my entree I ordered the Butter chicken curry with basmati rice and naan.  My entree was phenomenal and the portion was big.  My daughter and sister ordered the burger and that looked delicious.  We all agreed this was a good solid meal.  Drinks were also well crafted and executed.  For four people, an appetizer, salad, 4 entrees and 2 drinks the total was around $200.  Not bad considering this is Vegas.",2,0,2

They only had room for us at the cocktail tables, and the stools were very squishy and sinking down, but had hard edges, so my legs kept falling asleep. 

Our server was very friendly, but our food was somewhat slow to come out. With the location right on the casino floor, there was a man smoking a large cigar in line to get a rewards card, and the smoke cloud was almost intolerable, of course our food finally came out while the smoke cloud was hanging over us.

The food was very good. We ordered a NY strip that was surprisingly tender for a NY and cooked perfectly, but had a chunk of gristle. It was very good value compared to Mesa Grill, maybe not quite as good, but also much cheaper. Asparagus cooked well. Peppercorn sauce had an overwhelming rosemary flavor, but was good.

The pub chopped salad was also good. I think for a similar price, Cheesecake Factory has a better salad, and their portions are three times as big. The menu indicated the salad had apples, which I do not remember on the salad. The ham was more like strips of salami perhaps? It was very good, though.

The mashed potatoes were good, but the STAR of the show was the mushroom side with poached egg. This is brilliant! The egg, and I think chanterelle mushrooms, had similar texture and it was a wonderful and unexpected combination. Loved that.

The server wasn't able to adequately describe the toffee pudding. She described it as a cake. Maybe it was; her description was vague enough that I didn't want to try it.

If I were to return, I'd make sure I had a reservation and ask to be seated farther into the restaurant. I think I'd try the fish and chips next time. They looked fantastic.",0,0,0

The table and chairs were very comfortable and the big screens located throughout the restaurant provided for a fun, pub-style atmosphere.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and made our experience enjoyable. 

I had the fish and chips, my wife had the shephard's pie, my son the lamb burger and my daughter the butter curry.  All dishes were very tasty and met our expectations.  I paired by fish and chips with an Innus & Gunn beer which hit the spot.  We all shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert - also tasty.

The only thing that was a disappointment was the fact that they discontinued the Total Rewards discount and they have nothing in place for locals (as many other restaurants in tourist areas do).  Nonetheless, I was expecting to pay Gordon Ramsey prices, so it was not a shock.  The food was good, service great and overall experience was fantastic.

w\/ my food, i was kinda disappointed too :\/\/\/ i got the ny steak w\/ fingerling potatoes and replaced the asparagus (ewwww) w\/ carrots. considering how expensive it was, u'd expect absolute perfection on a plate! well, a few carrots were too raw\/hard to even put my fork into, and the potatoes were only a handful amount so the side dishes were really a let down :\/\/\/\/ BUT the steak was delish! :)))) the plating for the steak sucked too tho! GR is all about presentation & plating so i think he may be disappointed to find out my dish came out very messy (or idk, maybe that's how the dish is supposed to be plated??)... see, the carrots and potatoes were randomly scattered on the plate *carelessly* imo, and the steak had a potato and carrot underneath it, like the steak was just plopped on top of the potatoes and carrots :\/\/\/ i just tweeted pics of the dish from b4 and after i ate it to show the plating, and the raw carrots and fatty steak part i left behind.. dunno if he'll respond at all, but i thought i'd at least notify him of how things were done.. i also got the potted triple chocolate trifle which i LOVED. it was various layers\/textures of dark, milk, and white chocolate :)) w\/ a couple small cookies on the side. 

so i had very mixed feelings about my 1st and likely only experience at a GR restaurant as i doubt i'll have the chance to go back to vegas again (or any other location where his restaurants are). i really did have high expectations w\/ his location b\/c it's GR! he's all about perfection w\/ taste and plating, and of course, he's anti-raw foods lol.. and then there's the horrible server i mentioned b4 who really was frustrating, if i wasn't in such a great mood about the 1st nite in vegas, i would've complained more outwardly at the time, right now, i'm wishing i had... will try to post pics of everything.",2,0,0

Still it was very good and the sauce was nice. The potatoes that came with it were cold and not seasoned. The other veggies on the plate cold. I tried the chicken pot pie and it was not bad not great.

Overprice - ehh, it's Vegas, and it's Gordon Ramsay, so what.   What was constant in other reviews was the service.  I thought, you know, worth a try, could be start up pains.  Well, WOW.  Very disappointed with the front of the house.  We had reservations, showed up early, and they were clearly confused looking up reservation on the computer and an iPad, so stand to the side.  A manager type (noted as a manager by not wearing the newsprint jumper mini dress all other hostess were wearing) asks ""may I help you"".  Tell her we were told to wait, she asks for name again, and then with an attitude, tells us, ""for 7:45""  (it was 8:25 and we had an 8:30).  I reply 8:30, she walks away without saying a word.   Eventually we're seated, smack in the middle of the dining room that is visible from the casino, good table, near a POS\/waiter station.   18 minutes later - yes, eighteen, the waiter comes by, politely greets us, asks about drinks, but we didn't have a drink menu.  He was trying his best, but good service is not solely the poor waiter's responsibility.    

When we placed our drink order, we placed our entire order (app, 2 entrees).   Bread plates were provided, then breads were brought.  Breads were finished, so empty crock, tray and 2 small bowls for sauces remained on the table.  (did I mention the waiter station\/lsland 6 feet from us).

Our appetizer came, long plate, used our bread plates for serving plates.  Finished, and now all those plates were still at the table.  Our entrees came, after having been walked around to the dining room with the beer barrels (cause I saw the food go by me first, then come back).   Plates were set, we moved our bread plates to the side on top of the appetizer long tray - and there they remained.

The only redemption was the food was good.  My husband ordered Shepard's Pie, which I wish I would have ordered as it was very good.  I had fish and chips, which, one of my fish got soggy at the bottom, but another was crispy.  I read critiques that the chips weren't authentic - I liked them.  My guess if I had to replicate at home, is that you take 1 potato, make it a thick steak fry - so 1 potato = 1 fry; and they probably use the rest of the sides for the mash, but I liked them.

There was another manager type, male this time, (manager noted by his not wearing the punk suspender type clothes waiters were wearing) and this guy looked so sleazy .  Sweaty - seriously, like the kind Gordon rips to shred on Kitchen Nightmares.   I actually told my husband it looked like the KN in NY where this godfather type guy wore the trench coat and glasses and they owned a lobster house, and argued with Chef about ""maine lobsters"".  This guy seriously went to the table behind me, about 12 times.  And please, I'm not knocking appearance, I'm not a barbie type person, but I do expect people regardless of age or size, to look presentable, meaning, clothes fit properly, clothes are clean & neat.   Not sure what the couple did or who they were to warrant attention every 7 minutes, but obviously this clueless manager couldn't turn his back and see a stack of empty plates at our table while we were trying to finish our entrees!

Almost thru our meal, the waiter came buy, said could I take those plates, since you've been staring at them your entire meal.   Again, he was waiting every table in that dining room, and he was hustling, but no support!  At one point when we finished our meal, he ask someone when he saw us finish, to please bus our table - and he did, about 10 minutes later.

Never did I think a pub meal would take 2+ hours.  Again, it's Vegas, so yes, it's over priced, but shamefully not worth it.  I won't be back.  The poor front of house isn't a testament to starting pains, it's poor execution and leadership.  I'll keep watching the damn shows though!",1,0,0

We each ordered salad and an entree. It's a good thing I enjoy taking with my girlfriend, because by the time the salad came, I had completely forgotten we ordered them. 

Dinner came about 6:30 and was ok. We both ordered the same thing, a small fillet, piece of pork belly, and a couple shrimp. The fillet was cooked perfectly, but the other two items were over cooked at dry. 

The manager came over to offer a free dessert for the long wait, which was appreciated. The bill came and the $11 charge was there. The show read starting and I didn't push the issue.

So, I'll just cut to the chase. I intend to rate it 4.5 stars, but kind of hard to swallow the .5, so, I'll leave it at 4 stars, due to couple reasons. 
If I'm bringing a group of six adults for dinner after the CES convention week, I just assumed this will be a great place to experience the actual GR food. No to mention, two of my guests are GR fans, so, why not give it a try, right? 
The overall food experience was good, I wish I could've said great! I first ordered the calamari as to share the appetizer, and the truffle fries, which I thought is a great way to start a meal. Especially if GR had been showing how crispy he likes to make them calamari. Well...I didn't expect it to have seen the calamari to have so many tendons, AND not being somewhat crispy as I'd had hoped for. A few of us tried it, it really turned out to be a bit soft and chewy. So, we had to send it back and ordered something else instead. 
Anyways, aside to the bad calamari, the food we ordered were delicious, we had the burgers, and few of the folks ordered the steak. It was a lot of food, but we managed to finish. 
Our server was friendly and super courteous, but perhaps they need to pay more attention to the cleanliness of their sections! Not a Ramsay standard, I'd say! ;)
The booth we got sat in, the seats weren't wiped clean, the floors were dirty and not swept properly. I understand the concept is to be a pub and setting is to be as if we are to eat at a London pub...But, if we're to spend $45 on a Ribeyes, I'd consider that being a steakhouse, right? 
So, aside to the chewy calamari and cleanliness, I do enjoy the rest of the food served after, as well the rest of the folks in my table.

Caveat:  I've heard what a jerk this guy is supposed to be, and I really wanted to be able to call him out on this meal.  We'd previously tried Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood, and it was very good.  So this visit was our shot to see what the big deal is.  

We actually sat at the bar before it opened.  We were sitting right there, watching, and the bartender did not use the ingredients listed in the menu.  Now, this was a recon visit, so we didn't say anything--I just took notes for this review.  Our other drink was as stated in the menu.  Okay.  Both drinks were very tasty, even very good.  (We're into mixology, so take that for what it is--the drinks were good.)

We had fish and chips and the beef burger.  We both thought the food was excellent.  Damn it to hell, I cannot trash him on this meal.  I would have liked more peas with the fish, but no ding for that. 

Incidentally, I don't think it's widely known that many of these big shots' restaurants are actually joint ventures with the hotels.  Very likely there is some lack of control and issues with quality control in such arrangements.  Nevertheless, if a guy who expects 110% out of everyone in his sphere of greatness puts his name on something, he gets held to that same standard. 

So, 4 out of 5 stars.  It was very good, but not 110%.  Next Vegas visit is GR Steak.  Stay tuned.  I'll be taking notes.",0,0,0

Since we were at Caesar's Palace, we decided to try Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill. I'm obsessed with the food network channel so of course I automatically assume Gordon Ramsey's restaurants will be good. 

SERVICE - Our waitress was very nice but incredibly slow. We wanted extra dipping sauce for our wings but by the time she came around, we had about 4 left so it wasn't worth it. 

FOOD 
Mini Lobster Rolls - These came filled with lobster. So much flavor. The buns were toasty and delicious. They definitely didn't short us on meat. 

Wings - Spicy and sweet. My fiancé thought they were really spicy but I thought they had the perfect amount of kick. I usually don't like blue cheese but the blue cheese dipping sauce it came with were a perfect match for the wings! 

Brussel Sprouts - Nicely caramelized.  Tender with a crunch. Had pieces of meat and apricot throughout as well. Very enjoyable!

Overall, a great meal. We would come back! Main complaint is that the items were pretty pricey.",4,0,0

   I ordered a BLT and my husband ordered the fish and chips. The BLT was easily had the best the flavor, probably the best BLT I've ever had.

There was a side order of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes listed on the menu for $12 or $13. Those potatoes would have to perform a dance or stand up routine to be worth that kind of money. This is pub food not fine dining.

- Tenderloin was excellent.
- Sticky toffee pudding was great.

The bad:

- Bangers and Mash. Sausages were bland, rubbery, and the ends were too close together. Stingy portion of barely-warm mash. This is such a simple pub dish, it is a shame it is not done well. Lincolnshire sausages with hearty mash would be so much better. 
- No custard option on the sticky toffee pudding. Although good with the ice cream it just feels like the lazy option. Not very authentic for a pub. 

The ugly:

- Poor selection of draft beers, especially from the UK and Vegas area microbrews. Mostly standard beers you can get at many bars. The exception is Fullers, and to a lesser extent Boddingtons. 
- Everything is seriously overpriced, even for Vegas. Add 50% to what you think is reasonable, and you'll be in the ballpark of what you are going to pay. 
- The prices may be justified with fine dining food or service, but you don't get either. You get adequate food and service.

When we got there everything was set! We were seated quickly at a large table in the back. It was cool because I could lean back in the seat I was in and see right into the kitchen, which was awesome!! Our waiter took our drink orders while my party arrived and looked over the menu. Pricey yes! But I totally knew this going in and was not shocked. My fellow Yelper and good friend Dyanna L. asked the waiter what his suggestions were. First thing out of his mouth was the Seared Scallops. This totally helped me in my picking process! 

Ok, so for the food, it was ALL excellent! Let me start out with the appetizers. We ordered the Mini Pub Burgers which were three perfect little sliders with bacon, lettuce, onion, and a little side of mayo. The Calamari was fried perfectly and they even used the leg parts (my fav) it came with a side of tartar sauce and a side of cocktail sauce. The Deviled Eggs I did not try, but the presentation was awesome. Instead of the eggs being filled you get to fill the eggs yourself! We also ordered the warm pretzels that came with a delicious cheese spread and a tangy mustard. 

For our entrees I finally decided on the Seared Scallops. Yummy!!! They were perfectly cooked and came in a cream broth with small clams, leeks, and potatoes! I wanted to tip the bowl up and drink the rest of the broth, but I remembered my manners. lol My husband chose the Shepards Pie. It was tender and filled to the brim with meat and veggies! Dyanna L. chose the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Omg was it filled with lobster!!! I was in heaven when she offered me a bite! She also had a Caesar Salad that looked very tasty! Her boyfriend got the Fish and Chips. It looked so crispy. I'm totally getting that next time! My other friend Rachael ordered the Mini Pie Tasting. It came with three little pies one was a Shepards Pie. The other was a Steak and Ale Pie. That was her favorite one. The last of the three was a Chicken Pot Pie. My other friends Becki and Eric got Lamb Burgers that where huge and came with crispy fries! 

Other than the service being a little slow, it was a great experience overall, but I think it was because our original waiter was sent home in the middle of our visit. I loved all the food. This is a great place for a special occasion! Just be prepared to drop some cash, but it's completely worth it! Yummy!",0,1,0

So when I was planning my anniversary trip it was a must that we eat in at least one of Gordon's restaurants. So we decided on the Pub & Grill because my girlfriend really wanted the fish and chips after seeing him make his recipe on one of his shows. I ordered the Shepard's Pie with cheddar mashed potatoes. Then we ended the meal with the lemon raspberry tart. 

The negatives: we made a reservation weeks in advance and were placed directly next to kitchen. There was also a store room where chairs were paraded in and out throughout our hour there. I don't know if they get a lot of walk ins or if they are primarily reservations, but making a reservation should ensure you don't get placed in the worst seat in the house. Maybe that's an unspoken rule that this restaurant doesn't acknowledge. The fish and chips were ridiculously greasy. I understand fried food is greasy but I pinched off a small bit and had grease running down my arm. Parts of the batter were raw which is never pleasant to bite into. The Lemon Raspberry tart did not arrive per the menu description and the staff did not mention any changes to the menu. I get that ingredients sometimes run out but there wasn't even any raspberry on the tart. It was supposed to have a jam and compote, but instead it  came with some fresh strawberry and blueberries with a dollop of whip. Not bad just not as expected.

On the plus side: The wait staff was amazing. The food came out hot and delicious in a matter of minutes. The shepard's pie was perfect in every delightful morsel of a way.

Started with the deviled egg and pretzel apps. Deviled eggs were great, with a build-your-own presentation. Other people at the table liked them a lot more than me, but I thought they were quite good. The pretzels were good, but far overpriced for a few pieces of bread and mustard. I feel like this should be something every table gets for free. I really wanted to try to duck poutine too, but they were out.

One main reason for giving this 3 stars instead of 4 is that for a pub their beer selection is quite poor. All common bar beers, with just a few common English ""pub"" beers like Boddingtons and Guinness. Nothing exotic. Nothing unique. As a beer lover I was extremely disappointed with their selection. This should be a feature!

I'm not a big fan of the choices in costume for Pub & Grill or Gordon's ""Steak"" place. It all comes off as a bit Vegas and cheesy to me. Dressing the servers and hostesses up in stereotypical ""English"" garb is... it's either shortsighted, or worse, pandering. I can't imagine the people working there enjoy it either.

I was skeptical after reading some bad reviews and I should have followed their advice. Overall, there are many better choices in Vegas to dine at and would not even give it a second chance.

Reservation\/Atmosphere - We had a reservation but were seated at a bad location and bad table. They put to tables in a walk way area and then put short chairs around it. They were mix & matching the dining tables and chairs to squeeze in more people. The low bar chairs made us feel like we were at the kids table during Thanksgiving. Before we started I asked to be re-seated but they came up with excuses (30 minutes and no guarantee) and a little attitude. The waitress acknowledged the table\/seats wasn't good but not much they would due. Given the time and not delaying the dinner we took it, but it was annoying and uncomfortable. 

The music was way too loud when we arrived and after about 30 minutes it was turned down, probably someone complained. Hard to believe that management couldn't tell that it was too loud even for Vegas.

Service - Pretty good, attentive enough given that they were busy.

Food - Here is the second reason I wouldn't go back. The food we had was average, and I expected a lot more. Bangers & Mash was only ok. Fish & Chips were also only ok, same you can get at any sports bar. The Braised Short Ribs was a huge disappointment, the meat had a lack of any flavor, the sauce was boring and the risotto was flavorless & held too long. I really expected the quality to be better on this dish. The highlight of the night was the Chicken Pot Pie, it had a flakey crust and some great flavor for the filing, good chucks of chicken and veggies. Deserts were ok, the Sticky Toffee Pudding was the highlight.

They were very busy as expected on a Saturday night, but it showed in their arrogance over the table & waits. They we stay busy with first time diners but don't believe they will get many as repeat. They are pricey, which I am ok with, but they need to deliver on the food and they failed there.",0,0,0

We had the lamb burger and the regular burger. The lamb burger was great, but the other burger had to be sent back, it was supposed to be rare but it came out medium, and we requested truffle oil on our fries, but that didn't happen either. Props does go out to our waitress ( I do not have her name :(, but she lived in Mexico prior) who took care of us, she insisted on returning the burger and fixed the fries. We also had the sticky pudding, which I'd order again and the bread pudding was also yummy. 

I guess the one thing that bothers me is that on Kitchen Nightmares you have Mr. Ramsay saving other restaurants, but this our third time at one of his and I have yet to say Wow, you can tell Gordon Ramsay ""the dude from TV"" owns this place. 

The floor to the bathroom was so greasy my husband and I had to hold on while walking. We were joking about the lawsuit that is just waiting to happen. And the men's bathroom was missing toilet paper and when they brought it, it didn't fit the holder.

Having come away from a late-2013 visit to Chef Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse at The Paris quite impressed by both the quality and the brand I knew a visit to casual sibling ""Pub & Grill"" was only a matter of time - friends and fans of chef's shows and celebrity frequent to visit Sin City.  Housed in Caesars in a sizable space renovated from Bradley Ogden featuring plenty of wood, kegs, television, and Brit-kitsch it was just after noon when I sat down with two old friends and greeted by friendly, though pushy, service orders were expedited to the tune of an appetizer, a side, three mains, and two desserts - high prices and small portions tempered by a Total Rewards card...at least slightly.  Focusing mostly on signatures and favorites present since the menu's inception dining began with three small but lovely seasoned pretzels paired with cheese and mustard for $8 and progressing to plates proper another trio arrived in the $21 trio of small ramekin-pies, all well prepared but only the lamb loaded Shepherd living up to the high standards set by the exemplary golden cod selected by my friend, soggy 'chips' notwithstanding.  Ignoring the shortrib and what I'm told were vastly overseasoned potatoes while wishing some form of seasoning had graced the flavorless mushrooms it was with sweet redemption that desserts both shined, the rustic Sticky Toffee Pudding every bit as good as the fancy version at Steak and the ""DIC"" a bowl of buttery custard hefty with raisins and aromatics that I'd gladly return for along with a cup of coffee - breakfast, lunch, or dinner.",7,1,3

It's located in Caesar's Palace, near the Forum shops entrance.  This is the location where the winner of the current Hell's Kitchen will be awarded the Executive Chef position.  Making reservations didn't seem necessary as the restaurant wasn't very full.  In fact, I was a little disappointed in our table selection considering we took the extra time to make reservations and plan weeks in advance of our LV trip (we were put in a middle isle table away from the outside view or more intimate, private booth areas).

The atmosphere of the restaurant was incredible.  The theme of an English Pub was evident in every detail, including the staffs' attire.  The color coordinated Doc Martens were awesome!  We absolutely LOVED the music (throw back memories of high school), which included The Smiths, The Cure, and other great Brit hits.

The menu offered standard English pub food.  The drink menu wasn't very expansive.  We opted to start out with the fried oysters as an appetizer with the Mothers Ruin and Ramsey's Tonic for drinks.  The appetizer was executed and delivered perfectly.  The drinks were ok, nothing spectacular compared to other places on the Strip.

One of my fav parts of our dining experience was the bread plate they bring to your table.  It was phenomenal and I wanted like 5 more!  It includes 3 different flavored pretzel sticks and nut loaf.  My fav was the herb pretzel!  It had 2 dipping options: butter and a cheddar\/horseradish (which had just the right amount of ""kick"").

For our main course we got the Shepard's Pie and the Fish 'n Chips.  I really don't care for lamb and its flavor seemed to take over the whole dish.  The Fish 'n Chips were superb.  All the food was piping hot and seasoned perfectly.  

We ended the meal with the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  Honestly, we were so full that we left half the dessert, which was a shame considering it was so good!  The caramelized top was the best part!  It wasn't too sweet and had a nice balance with the sweet cream ice cream. Definitely worth a try!

The only reason I didn't give my experience 5 stars is because of the service.  I was disappointed that for the cost of the meal and quite honestly because it is attached to Chef Ramsey's name, the service wasn't more professional.  I took offense to the young hostess calling me ""sweetie"".  Her interactions came off as condescending and indifferent... she never greeted us until a manager came up.  And considering I am at least 2 decades older than her, it was rude.  Our waiter wasn't attentive, in fact he refilled our water AFTER we asked for the check.  We also had to ask for appetizer plates and utensils\/napkins twice, while the appetizer grew cold.  While fine dining is meant to be savored and time is not of the essence...the 20 minutes it took to just get our check and pay wasn't necessary and was wasted moments of my life.   

If only Chef Ramsey had been around....our dining excursion would have been heavenly.....  I mean who doesn't like Hell's Kitchen?!?  :)",3,0,0

I came here with fellow elite Melissa Y. because she had invited me for lunch. I could not resist skipping out on a celebrity chef meal right? I actually came here 2 years ago for a Yelp event and they have certainly made changes for the better. 

Before we ordered our waitress Carrie gave us a little run down on the background of the resto in addition to some of her recommendations from appetizers to entrees. I thought that was very nice of her to do that considering some people are clueless as to what they want to order. We started our meal with calamari which was suggested to us by Carrie. It came out pretty fast and I did enjoy it because the breading was quit different than what I'm used to. Typically calamari is more of a flour based breading and I could tell they used bread crumbs possibly? I liked it because it added a bit more texture to it and to add to that the squid was not rubbery which I have experienced at other places. The tartar sauce was had a home made touch to it, it was probably house made? For the entree, I had the pub salad. The protein in the salad was chicken, ham and shrimp. It may sound overwhelming, but it actually wasn't. The amount they put of each was just right, which made the salad still a light option. There was also little bits of apples, chickpeas, and cherry tomatoes which added to the freshness to the dish as a whole. Finally the red wine vinaigrette brought everything together and they did so by putting the perfect amount for the salad. I was definitely pleased because I did not want anything heavy because I knew I was going to have a heavy dinner. As we were eating we saw that a man in a suit walking around the resto asking customers how their food was, I overheard him say his name was Derrick. I assume he was the manager and it just goes to show how much they care about pleasing their dinners. While eating we needed re-fills on our drinks and caught the attention of a server by the name of Sara. Normally I don't like asking other servers for anything because they are assigned a certain area of tables. However, Sara  did so willingly and was very nice about it. She even said if there was anything else we needed to let her know. To top off our meal Chef Scott from Hell's Kitchen came our and introduced himself to Melissa Y. and I, totally unexpected. We were kind of star-struck too at the same time! Lol.. Anyway, this place has definitely improved this time around and I can't wait to be back.",0,0,0

Sadly GR Pub and Grill was the latter. 

I am a huge GR fan and was very excited in trying Mr. Ramsay's inspired menu and experience his detail to service. We arrived around 1:15pm for lunch and waited for a few mins while waitstaff cleared a table.  The restaurant was only about 1\/4-1\/2 full (at best) and yet we still had to wait about 10mins before a waiter poured our water and asked for drink orders.  I ordered a Dark and Stormy and it was waaaay too heavy on the rum and was not served with lime.  To the server's credit - he was very apologetic - rushed to get me a second one.  #2 Dark and stormy was slightly better (less rum)  but still a sub-standard drink which did NOT warrant the $11 price tag.  Again not served with lime - I had to ask for them.  Not.a.great start.  

So I thought 'ok -we are not here for drinks the food should really speak for itself'. We ordered the deviled eggs per the waiter's suggestion plus I LOVE deviled eggs. I was so psyched to see them on the menu.  I have been known to eat 8-10 in one seating but I digress. With all Mr. Ramsay's emphasis on simplicity - it was lost on this dish.  I thought it was interesting mix of flavors on paper but in reality there was too much going on between the vinegar, bacon and cheese.  Weird texture too with the bits of bacon. The worst was that the egg whites were too firm - like they had been sitting in the fridge for too long or were just pulled out and were not given enough time to soften a little. And the yolks simply did not taste fresh.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by farm fresh eggs.  Nevertheless I was disappointed.  

Ah but the entree should be better - right?  Nope.  My lamb burger arrived cold.  Cold fries and cold burger. WTF?! Not only did we wait approximately 15-20mins for the entrees to arrive but the my entire meal was cold.  COLD!  Again the waiter was very apologetic and rushed a second burger out to me.  So this one was warmer but sadly it had absolutely No.taste. None. Could not tell it was lamb.  In Mr. Ramsay's words: BLAND!.  It was not seasoned.  I've had better tasting lamb in the local middle eastern restaurant here in Pittsburgh.  I cannot speak to my mother's dish because it contained gluten but she said her heirloom tomato sandwich was quite good.  So there was one bright spot.  Then again she admits that she really does not care about food e.g. tastes, flavors, experience as much as I do.  

In conclusion, I had very high expectations for Mr. Ramsay's food and restaurant.  For the prices he charges I should have been WOWed.  Instead I left disappointed and very unhappy.  I do have to mention that the watier was thoughtful enough to offer a 20% employee discount which brought our lunch total to $59.02 but still a pricey sum for a sub-standard-will-not-return-to-lunch.  I would not recommend this place.  Sigh.

Being from Sonoma County, we are surrounded by delicious food. My husband and I both love watching all of Gordon Ramsay's shows so when we stumbled across his Pub and Grill at Caesar's Palace, we knew we had to give it a try. The hostess sat us in a lovely cozy booth and the ambiance was on point. Our server was David S. Gordon Ramsay is very lucky to have such an amazing and talented server such as David, working for him. My husband and I come from the restaurant industry and so we know the importance of good service and David is what all servers should strive to be. He was welcoming and professional and extremely knowledgeable. He showed us his picture of him with Gordon because my husband and I were very curious about the ""real"" Ramsay compared to what you see on television on HK. David had nothing but raving reviews about Gordon. Next we looked over the menu and couldn't decide what to order since it all looked so good. We decided to try the happy hour menu so that we could taste multiple items. Excellent prices as well! We ordered the kettle chip nachos, wings, truffle fries, and burger.  Everything we ordered was exactly what you'd expect to get from Gordon Ramsay. The nachos were to die for. Kettle chips and tender meats with the most velvety cheese sauce was like an explosion of flavors and textures in your mouth. The truffle fries come with the most addicting dipping sauce. Garlic fries don't stand a chance to these fries! My husband loves wings but I do not, that was until I tried these. WOW!!!! Just goes to prove that quality of food is truly key to successful dishes. We wanted happy hour cocktails but didn't know what to order so David recommend the Goodbye Blue Sky and The Pub Crawl. Perfectly pairs with our dishes. To make this experience even more fabulous and memorable, David presented us with it only one, but two, amazing desserts to help us celebrate our honeymoon. This was the first and only time during our stay in Vegas that we truly felt special regarding our honeymoon! We asked David about other spectacular activities to do while in Vegas and he had many suggestions.

Meat and potatoes. Very simple, very good. The sausage was perfectly cooked and the sauce\/gravy went well with the mashed potatoes that also tasted really good.

However....... was it worth 20 bucks? Probably not. 

The rest of our party had a bunch of various dishes. I remember the pub beef burger being a popular one among our group. No one really seemed blown away by it. Again 20 bucks. 

I got the notion that a burger at Smashburger might be around the same caliber as the ones my friends were eating judging by their reactions when eating.

The duck confit poutine was OK. It was interesting, but there was definitely a lot more fries and cheese than any duck. I wish there was more duck since it actually tasted decent.

The bottom line here: the food is 'good', but not really worth it. The ambiance is nice, but the service is also hit or miss. Pretend you're that guy at a busy bar trying to order a drink for you and your friends. It's hard to get the bartender's attention right?

We were shown to a comfortable booth and quickly introduced to our waiter Julio and placed a drink order, eager to try some of the authentic beer offerings. The menu's food offerings were all tempting and while waiting for our beers, we debated which we wanted to try. 

Julio returned with some bad news; neither of the beers we chose were immediately available, which made us turn back to the menu and we went for Gordon's favorite, Innis and Gunn. 

Shortly, we were introduced to Randy Goldich, the bar manager, who apologized for the unavailability of our original choices. We appreciated his candor and spent several minutes chatting before he left us to enjoy our drinks. 

Our waiter Julio and his partner David were quite attentive and soon we had our meal selections; I had the grilled lamb burger and my wife had the Pub Chopped Salad. We also had the sticky toffee pudding as well and what can I say, the food quality was Ramsay level, just as we expected. 

Despite it being early afternoon, we were treated to a visit as well from Hells Kitchen season 12 winner Scott Cummings who was friendly and engaging. Come to think of it, everyone we met there went out of their way to make us feel welcome and special.

Lettuce was wilted and rubbery. Ugh. Told the waitress that it was not acceptable and she took it away. Here comes the manager to apologize and to ensure that it will not happen on my next visit and he would remove it from the bill. Fine.
Now onto the BLT. This sandwich had a maple flavored bacon that just overpowered the sandwich. It was not good at all. The only thing I enjoyed was the cold pint of Heineken that I had with my meal.

I had fish and chips for my main. The fish was cooked well, but was a little bland. The chips were awful undercooked oversized potato wedges.

Imagine the sweet, liquefied caramel just running itself down the sides of a crispy toffee mounted inside ice cream, layered on top of one of the softest bread puddings you'll find. Every spoonful of this dessert is a touch of heaven's bliss.

1. Take a spoonful of that sticky toffee pudding
2. Then a good sip of the Innis and Gunn

4. Return to step 1 and repeat all steps again, until there is nothing left.

Bacchanal had a nearly 90 minute wait for a $53 brunch and we were denied at Mesa Grill because they had a dress code for lunch (screw you Flay). Our fallback was the more casual Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.

Anything with Ramsay's namesake should scream quality and consistency, but most of the plates fell short of expectations. We started off with the little piggy deviled eggs, which were presented with the yolk separated for self-serving. From there, I went with the shepherd's pie, which came lukewarm. The mashed potatoes had an unpleasant texture and I didn't get much of the cheddar cheese. The ground lamb and peas had no distinguishing flavor. The steak & ale pot pie came off as salty, but at least I enjoyed the crust. 

The sides we tried included the truffle fries and the lobster mac & cheese. The fries were far too similar to the regular fries and didn't have enough truffle oil. The lobster mac & cheese was worse than the Kraft blue box. While there was a generous helping of lobster meat, the mac & cheese itself was very watery and no crispy crust. We declined the popular sticky toffee pudding for next time.

I was less than impressed. I ordered the Spots (sliders) and the meat was not seasoned at all. It tasted like plain hamburger meat and the oily grease dripped down my hand as I took a bite. Furthermore, there was no sauce on the spot and cheese was no where to be found which made it very dry. :(

The truffle chips were good. It was served with ketchup and a truffle aioli sauce. Now the aioli, I could spread on almost anything and enjoy it. At the same time, condiments shouldn't taste better than the food itself.

Finally, we tried the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. A small container of caramel came on the side so we poured that over the bread-like substance. This dessert has to have been the best part of my dining experience here. Although it could do without the brittle that was placed in the ice cream. The brittle was not sweet and just tasted like nuts. I felt it didn't really belong in this dessert.  The rest of it though was so delicious!!!

I asked for a great wait-person and we got one.  Good start.  Bottles of wine marked up 4x retail, that's kind of steep, even for Vegas,  but it's OK if the meal is stellar.  My wife had the tomato soup, which was yummy and came out piping hot, just as she requested.  5 stars there.  The bread on the side was supposed to be a crostini, I guess, but the bread wasn't toasted, just warmed, so the topping and cheeses soaked right into the bread and created a bready mush.  That's just lousy work in the kitchen.

I had a Caesar salad, and our server asked if I liked anchovies, and as a matter of fact I do.  Usually a Caesar is made with tinned anchovies that have been cured.  The anchovies were fresh fish, fileted and lying on top of the salad.  None of the salty, cured taste of tinned anchovies.  The dressing was incredibly bland.  Hey!  There's supposed to be garlic, dried mustard, Worcestershire sauce and spicy goodness in there!  The kitchen made up for the lack of taste by liberally pouring the dressing all over the romaine lettuce.  The bottom leaves were floating in it.  Seriously, the worst Caesar I can remember having anywhere.  

Our filet came out just right, and the bearnaise sauce we ordered was very nice.  The asparagus that accompanied the filet was woody.  The stems should have been trimmed up nearly to the tips so that what we ate was just the best, so another bit of sloppy work in the back of the house.  We also ordered mashed potatoes and a side of mushrooms.  The potatoes were good, served nice and warm (not hot enough for my wife who likes these things super-hot).  The mushrooms were nothing special or bad, just standard button mushrooms cut thick and sauteed in butter.  

Then we had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  Oh, baby, was that good.  Super, super good.  5 stars and then some, so we ended the meal on a very happy note.   

Oh yeah, English pub decor as ""designed"" by a high schooler from Columbus, OH.  Maybe a step up from a TGI Fridays.  Music playing, 80s disco and such, was loud, loud, LOUD.  Loudest restaurant in Vegas.  Hostesses were wearing very unflattering dresses designed to look like the old newsprint that fish and chips were wrapped up in back in the day.  Cute idea, but the dresses were oddly cut so that all of the women looked four months pregnant, and none of them were!  Definitely the worst-dressed hostesses in Vegas.  :-(  

So... serious faults from a kitchen (supposedly) set up by Gordon Ramsay.  Half of the dishes would have earned F-bombs on his shows.  The other half were good.  So, three stars.  Would I go there again?  No, there are too many really good places to eat in Vegas.  Live and learn.",1,0,0

We wanted to try the duck confit poutine but unfortunately, they weren't available.  Such bad news.  So, we ordered truffle chips, short-rib and cheek sandwich, steak, pork belly, and cornish hen.  For dessert we had peanut butter and jelly, sticky toffee pudding, butterscotch pot de creme and potted triple chocolate trifle.  Nothing exciting about the truffle chips and the steak.  I mean, they were good...just nothing exciting.  Except for maybe, one tidbit about how they cook their chips\/fries 3 times: boiled, baked and fried.  

CORNISH HEN:
It came with veggies and I'm glad I ordered a side of English chips or I would've ended up hungry.  The skin was nice and crisp and full of flavor. 4\/5

PORK BELLY:
This was my favorite out of all the stuff we ordered. Fatty, crispy and delicious! 5\/5

SHORT-RIB AND CHEEK SANDWICH:
It was quite tasty.  Reminds me of a dish my mom made called mechado...but in a sandwich. 4\/5

PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY:
It has a hint of peanut butter and some blackberries.  I'm not a fan. 2\/5

STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING:
A classic.  It's warm, ooey-gooey and served with a scoop of ice cream and it was just perfect! 5\/5

BUTTERSCOTCH POT DE CREME:
It's got pumpkin and a hint of nutmeg with pumpkin seeds on top. Reminds me of fall\/Thanksgiving. 4\/5

TRIPLE CHOCOLATE TRIFLE:
I'm a chocoholic so I had to have this. Not the best chocolate dessert I've had but it's good. I finished my dessert without a problem. 4\/5

The food was good but the service needs to be improved.  Our food came one at a time and we normally wait until the last person gets her\/his food before we all start eating.  A few follow-ups later, the last person got her food and by the time, everyone's food already had gotten cold.  The manager came and talked to us so, our desserts were comped.  It took forever to get drink refills and if you ask for sweetener or anything at all...you might have to wait 30 minutes to get it.  So, overall, I'd give this place 3.5\/5 stars.  If I were Gordon Ramsay, I would tell the staff to ""f@*% off!",10,4,7

I just got done attending a function at Caesars and was craving a burger, I'm talking pregnancy cravings here, enter Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill. I sat in the bar area was immediately greeted by a server who fired off the specials and took my drink order. I went looking for the burgers on the pub menu and very surprised when I saw that there are only four burgers offered. I'm assuming he keeps the rest of these juicy treats at his other place. 

On recommendation from the server I went the Hell's Kitchen Burger. This spicy slab of beef comes topped with Ghost Pepper cheese, pickled jalapeños, avocado and a smoked tomato aioli. I love spice, flavor spice, not the ""light your hair on fire"", but the responsible and reserved use of heat when cooking. This burger was all that and more, the beef was cooked to a perfect medium, slightly pink and very juicy, so very food porny. The ghost pepper cheese had a slow burn and after a while it began to take hold, but not enough for me to stop. The smoked tomato aioli, pickled jalapenos and avocado were a flavor bomb of happiness that helped cool down my mouth with each bite. Seriously, call me a burger whore because I was all over this thing. 

The fries were good, but basic and I didn't really finish them, but the burger portion size was plenty big and filled me up fairly quick. The main thing that did bother me was my seat, I felt I was sinking the whole time and had to keep adjusting my seat and\/or style of sitting. This was a minor thing, but after a while it became annoying. I would have probably ordered another drink and allowed my food to settle, but I just couldn't get comfortable.  

$22 for a burger? I'm not surprised you ballsy MOFO, but I'm even more surprised you could back it up.",28,22,30

The food was very tasty and packed with flavor. We were quickly seated and the environment was that of a stylish English pub. I loved the setting as I was starving and there was amazing food along with a live collage football game. 

The appetizers we had were the Maine lobster and shrimp rolls. This has to be one of the best appetizers have had. The roll was crispy yet soft and buttery. The lobster and shrimp spread was to die for and I wanted to keep ordering more and more of it. I had the famous fish and chips with a large glass of beer. Best food to watch a game with. The fresh cod was perfectly cooked and battered.  The cod was tasty and moist. The fries were soo good and the bowl of mashed peas was something I will always remember. My wife had the Salmon with fennel. She said it was really tasty and she licked the plate clean. She normally does not like her salmon oven roasted but when Gordon Ramsey create a dish, somehow he has you living things you don't normally like eating.  We will definitely come here again. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because the service could improve. The waitress we had seemed overwhelmed and I had to ask twice for ketchup before I finally got it. She also would not look towards our table a couple of times when I needed her. But overall the service was good but could improve.  

We paid 131.62 for the appetizer, two dishes, large beer and a non alcoholic beverage.  Well worth the visit.",0,0,0

1. Sevice: This is the second of his restaurants I've visited. When I returned for a second go the waitstaff remembered me by name! :-)  They are all wonderfully entertaining and attentive gentlemen! I advocate eating at the bar.  They are talented, too! Describe the flavors you're craving and voila they will make or recommend something delicious.

2. Food: Need I even comment given my caveat? I have had the: Scotch egg, heirloom carrots, Queen Vic Curry crisps & the chocolate triffle.  

The heirloom vegetables are amazing, savory and just the right texture.  No floppy, flaccid carrots here!

The triffle is a snowballing surprise.  It is like consuming a chocolate cloud.  The tiny cookies served beside it hold multiple mysteries themselves.

As you can see I did not try an entree. I must share that a side and appetizer or a side and a dessert are plenty filling.  Plus,  I'd already been to BurGR so I wanted to try things that were new to me.  

3. Ambiance: Fun and relaxed even on busy evenings. I don't think any sourpusses are allowed in here! Furthermore, I found myself seated beside Englishmen who were endorsing my selections.

LUNCH -  It took so long to get our food during lunch. It was about 2pm and we all ordered salads and soups, only to have to wait about an hour to eat a morsel of food. The drink I ordered, The Pub Crawl, which was delicious, took at least 30 minutes to get. The server said that was normal cause it had 7 steps to making it. UMN, no its not normal. I think he had too many tables and not enough help - he was running around the whole time. 

DINNER - Loved the food so much we came back a couple days later for dinner. This time my drink, same one as before, took less than 10 minutes to get. We had great service, and were taken care of. The opening bread pretzel sticks with dips are a highlight of the meal, just don't eat too many cause they are filling! My shepards pie was the bomb.  I would get that again next time and highly recommend it.

We had a very large group about 15 people and they said we couldn't have so many. But they ended up putting tables together so I am happy they could do this. 
The food is unbelievably overpriced. That food is not worth the price. 
I got to taste a bunch of things from friends. 
The food took sooooo long. I was starving. I got a sprite. $4 for a sprite. That is insane. 
Then I ordered the Shepard pie. I only got it because it was recommended. I didn't think it was going to just be ground beef and mashed potatoes. That's worth less than 10 dollars and it was $22. Insane!!! It wasn't even that good. It was just okay. 
I also tasted the nachos and they were way better than the Shepard pie. Didn't have much cheese but the chips were good at least. 
I also tasted one of the burgers and it was the strangest burger I ever had. It wasn't good. It was also $20. None of that was worth it. 
I also tasted the cheesecake which was the best thing I had. I loved it but was still overpriced. And I tasted the toffee and it was yummy but not as great as everyone says. I liked the cheesecake a lot better. 
Then we had a huge problem with our bill. It took an entire hour so we could get separate bills. Everyone was so upset and just wanted to leave. They kept saying they couldn't split the bills until the manager was called and they finally fixed it. I don't recommend this place at all.

It is also expensive. 

Just blahhhh.

The whole Gordon Ramsey thing is just an act to sell overpriced food.

Instead we got potato blocks. The steak was just ok and that should be fairly easy to get right.

It's ironic that he has a tv show about bad restaurants, because his is not what I would call good. Even if the meal hadn't cost $500, it still wouldn't have been good.

Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill was a huge disappointment.  We had chosen to save this place for our last dinner before leaving Las Vegas. We ordered the Maine Lobster and Shrimp Roll Minis, NY strip steak dinner, Ribeye steak dinner, mashed potatoes, and Goodbye Blue Sky (one with and one without alcohol) for drinks.
The Maine Lobster and Shrimp Roll Minis were absolutely amazing. The Goodbye Blue Sky is the best drink I've ever had. The mashed potatoes were chunky (which is fine), but they lacked flavor. The asparagus stalks were so big they were very tough, and not edible. 
I could not believe the steaks, the ribeye had great texture, but zero in the flavor department. The NY steak was not so great texture wise, and it lacked flavor. 
I do need to say the server was totally awesome. He immediately brought the manager to our table upon learning of our disappointment.  We only intended to provide feedback for the manager to give the cook, but the manager promptly dismissed the cost of the steaks. He was very apologetic, and kind. He went as far as offering us complimentary dessert, but we didn't feel right accepting his offer.

I came to Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill twice during my recent travels - once just for drinks and snacks and once for dinner.

With that, I think this is a great pub and a great place to have a drink.  For dinner... I would suggest spending your money somewhere else.

I loved the atmosphere and the bartenders all had sexy Irish accents, so that was a nice touch.  The drink selection is great as well.  The whole restaurant has a very rustic and homey feel to it.

The one time we came here for dinner I was underwhelmed by the food.  Mainly, because one person in our party ordered the mussels and at least half a dozen hadn't opened.  Anyone who knows anything about seafood should know that un-opened mussels usually means they're no good and a good chef should never let those out of the kitchen.  When we pointed that out to the server, we just got a shrug of the shoulders. Umm... ok?!

Gordon Ramsay's pub features tasty Americanized pub grub.  It's too bad because the British classics are so much better.

The food.  Fish and chips.   Perfectly cooked, moist cod encased in a crisp crust.  Win!  The chips?  Excessively large, like fried baked potatoes.  They are fluffy and delicate in the middle.  Feminine chips!  A good, vegetal but sweet mushy peas complete the dish.

The Sheppard pie, Americanized.  The addition of beef to the traditional lamb mellows flavor.  The dish is no longer rustic and earthy.  The fat and grease (hey, its flavor) in the stew is gone.  It's been  replaced with a buttery potato crust.  Either way, it goes to your butt.  Tasty yes, but it leaves you yearning.

The pork belly roll is total pork heaven although much less fatty than the British counterpart.  Served simply in its own jus with roasted carrots and pea pure.  Done.

Finally, the beef short rib and cheek sandwich; TRY THIS!  Juicy, tender short rib is combined with the sweet goodness of braised beef cheeks.  Served on sourdough, accented by the very earthy flavors from the horseradish aioli, roasted pepper jam and onion marmalade. Win!

Passable selection of British beers that share space with butt wiper and the like.  High Vegas resort prices.

Came here on Sunday around 1pm because Serendipity was a half hour wait (we should have waited). Got seated ASAP after checking in with waters but it took our waitress forever to get my lemons which she did not bring and it even took a lot longer for our food to come out. Not sure if it was her fault or if the kitchen was backed up but at 1pm the place wasn't busy at all. 

I ordered this salmon puree appetizer and it came in a small jar with 6 thick slices of toasted white soft bread. Really good for less than $20 and it was very filling because I only ate about 3 slices of bread. The bread was really good, soft and crispy even when it cooled down it was still really good to eat with the salmon puree or by itself. I really enjoyed it because it reminded me a lot like a lox and bagel without the capers. 

My two girlfriends got the lamb burger which they devoured and loved. I didn't get to try it because I don't eat meat but I did get to try the fries that it came with. I love fries so I already knew I would like it but I didn't know I would love it! It wasn't overly salty or oily and it was a thicker slice with the right amount of salt. It was so good just plain and it didn't need the ketchup dip. 

Prices are reasonable and it's located in Cesar's hotel right across the casino by the Forum shops. Reasonable prizes and big portions! Just be sure to wait awhile.",6,0,3

Eclectically designed in pub fashion, its vibe and energy is right on point to what you'd imagine for a celebrity chef's venue. However, the menu choices and cooking execution is no where near what'd you imagine. 

Let's be real: it's a pub. And the menu greatly reflects that. I think I just hoped for a better culinary experience than traditional burgers and fries or a turkey pesto on wheat. 

I will say that it was extremely nice that they seated a group of 5 right away without a reservation, considering that's often a rarity on the Strip. But our food took over an hour and a half to come out, and our server seemed really flustered that we asked him to split the bill.

I had the shepherds pie, which was also really good.  But it was unbelievably hot (oven hot).  Came in a clay pot which maintained the heat.  A little over the top hot.

Celebrity restaurants in Vegas are definitely hit or miss and while there were aspects of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill that were excellent, the service left something to be desired. First off -- since the service is what is giving this review poor marks let me start out by saying that our server had zero personality and was seldom seen or heard from. Service is the hallmark of a great restaurant, so even with the best food you can mess it up quickly with bad service. Our server should definitely find employment elsewhere. Now, on to the better part of the review - the food. The food was overall good. The short rib was extremely tender and tasty as it should be and it was atop an amazing risotto and the pearl onions were a very nice touch. The cheddar cauliflower was also very nicely done. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my favorite desserts and theirs was amazing. Cocktails were also great. Prices were high for what it is.

With Yelp friends like Stefany, we can order and split items.  We decided on the Grilled Lamb Burger with fries, Lobster and shrimp rolls and Kettle Chip Nachos.  All delicious and tasty!  Here's the low down:  The kettle chip nachos had a decent amount of tender short ribs scatter about topped with an English cheddar cheese.  The house made kettle chip was delightfully crunchy and sturdy to hold the nacho toppings.  

The lobster & shrimp rolls were also a hit.  They had a light lemon zest already blended in the lobster & shrimp mix.  This little brioche sandwich is delectable.  

The Grilled Lamb Burger was probably the highlight for me.  Grilled perfectly, this burger was juicy and full of flavor.  The goat & feta cheese spread really clinched the blue ribbon.  BUT WAIT!

Hostess wasn't mean but not really friendly, doesn't seem to take much pleasure in her job.

We were a group of four seated at a very tight booth. We waited a good 10 minutes before anyone came. We were served water (tasted like tap) & told that our waitress would be right with us. ""Right with us"" really meant another 15 minutes before our waitress arrived. Our waitress apologized so we let it go but we were not enthusiastic about this experience anymore & we could tell our friends were getting annoyed but trying to keep it together since this was our first meet up.

My mother & I ordered the U.K. beer flight, fish & chips, & the British Ale Onion soup. Our friends ordered the fish & chips & beer flight as well. Food took about 20 minutes to arrive. The wait we could deal with but the actual food was a MAJOR disappointment. My soup was completely cold. It's winter... I wanted something that would warm me up... that obviously didn't happen. The fish & chips were cold too plus the chips were completely STALE. I have never been to a restaurant that has gotten fried potatoes wrong before... especially at the price of $30 per plate. It was a most unpleasant meal. My guess is that 
someone made it, they forgot about us, & the food was sitting there forever before the waitress was able to deliver it to us. I may have complained if we ever got a server to stop by. At the same time we were so over this experience that we just didn't even bother. 
Either way I don't feel like I should have to complain. 

I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay. I've seen him rip people a new a**hole over stuff like this on T.V. on many shows so I definitely expected much more from his restaurant. I still would like to give his other restaurants a chance & hope for a better experience but I won't be coming here ever again. Very sad.",0,0,0

I am a huge fan of Gorden Ramsey food shows and I was excited to try his restaurant. So I came here with high expectations. The environment is great and I loved the feel of this place. The hostesses and waiters were all dressed in new paper costumes. 

Food 
First thing that came out was the hand made soft pretzel. The presentation was great  and it was good. I am not a big fan of pretzels but it was quite good. It came with a tray of spicy horse radish melted cheese and pub mustard or was it some sort of butter. 

Pork Belly: 
This was surprisingly pretty good. The flavor was delicious it had a fatty, crispy, and just enough salty flavor. I recommend this dish for those who are not afraid of a fatty dish. 

I ordered the Beef Cheek Stew. The meat was very tender and it melted nicely as it was in my salivating mouth. It was a bit on the salty side and it came with only four pieces of potato fries. I wish there was a little more starch in here to help balance the saltness. 

Sticky Toffee Pudding: I read yelp reviews about this dessert and I am so glad that I ordered it because it was food orgasm in my mouth. It was a warm ooey gooeyyy toffee pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream YUMMAY. Highly recommend this. I would just come here just to eat this dessert again. 

Our server seemed to be tired or ready to clock out. He was not very attentive and did not really describe how to use the ipad to order drinks. Lucky, being computer  savvy we were able to figure it out. I also ordered their whiskey sour. It was eh okay. 
Overall, the experience was nice but I guess I expected more because it was THE Gorden Ramsey. At least the place is clean, food was not over or under cooked, and the environment was great.",1,1,2

I've always wanted to try one of Chef Ramsay's restaurants so I figured lets try the Pub and Grill. I must say I had very high expectations for this place because I always watch Chef Ramsay on TV, but I  was not too impressed with the food. 

I ordered the lamb burger as suggested by the waiter, and I could not get myself to think that it was better than any other lamb burgers I have had. It had all the good elements of a burger, but it was very similar to the burgers I've had in the past. The best part was that it had a nice balanced flavor and was well complimented with the sauce. Nothing special though. 
I also had some of the pan roasted airline chicken. My qualms with this dish is that the serving of chicken was really small. Also, the bed of white beans was all that was on the dish besides the chicken. The presentation was very bleh and the beans were flavorless. It became difficult to eat after awhile as it was very redundant especially because the chicken was quite flavorless as well. For the price, i thought it was the least appealing.

For the side, I decided to go with the mushrooms and poached egg. This was probably the best thing I had. It was the best poached egg I've ever tasted. Also, the mushrooms had a nice texture. 

I really think that this place is pretty good depending on what you get. My experience with some of the dishes were not altogether ""wow""ing but maybe it was because I hyped myself up because it was a restaurant owned by a world class chef. So, If you do go here, I recommend asking for the popular items, that way you can sort of filter out what is sought after, rather than waste your money on something you can go somewhere else for for cheaper;",0,0,0

Many rave that they have the best fish and chips in town or the best curry on their menu and all of them fail miserably at delivering to the high standards they hype the restaurants up to by serving frozen chips. That is, all of them but Gordon Ramsay's Pub. 

We started off our late lunch with the Lobster and Shrimp Rolls. Holy cow! These were the dog's bollocks! (For you Americans, that means they were BOMB!) Light and refreshing Maine lobster and shrimp served on a toasted roll. My friend and I both agreed we would be happy with just that every time we came. Then came the Sliders which were perfectly cooked and a decent size. 

Here's where we got a little greedy... Well, I got a little greedy. Back home I would always opt for either the fish and chips or the chicken curry and chips. Today, I opted for both... And shared reluctantly with my friend. Bloody hell, GR Pub know how to portion your food to feed you for a week. Let's start with the curry... The Butter Chicken Curry was served with basmati rice and a naan bread. The chicken was so tender it fell apart and melted in your mouth. Chef Otto Spohn came out to check on us and was saying they marinate the breast for a day in the curry base. This set the curry apart from other attempts to serve Indian in a pub in Las Vegas by miles. Normally I would do half and half (chips and rice) with my curry in England so I was looking forward to soaking my chips in the curry sauce. 

Now onto the fish and chips. This is where I am most critical. There's nothing like proper fish and chips from the chip shop or pub back home. I never order them in America because I'm always disappointed. Freshly cooked, they came out steaming hot with tartare sauce and mushy peas (a British staple side for fish and chips). The chips were not cut like a typical chip shop chip. They were miles better than the frozen chips or French fries every other venue serves up in America, but they just weren't what I was hoping for. They were bloody good, mind. Just not what I expected from a British guy's pub. The fish on the other hand was PERFECTION! Light, crispy, and huge pieces. I ended up with enough for lunch the next day as well. LOVED the recipe. 

We were celebrating my birthday and we were sent out two of the four desserts. The chocolate trifle which I had forgotten how much I loved back home. It was refreshing and delicious. The masterpiece however, was the good old fashioned Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh. My. God. I was in heaven!!!! This was THE best sticky toffee pudding I've ever had... Trust me, I've had a lot of them. 

The whole experience from start to end was bloody marvellous. Our waitress, Yanesy was bubbly, funny, and very attentive. I will be requesting her every time I'm back. The decor has a very posh British flair with fancy upholstery and excellent uses of the Union Jack, British landmarks, and of course the signature newspaper print typically associated with fish and chips.

4 for ambience\/decor
2 for the service!

Long story short, you can count on less than one finger on the number of times our server came to our table after taking our order--ZERO!  Not sure if a rude server coming frequently with a bad attitude would've been better lol.

But that's ok, didn't want to let him ruin our first meal deal after landing.  Since GR steakhouse and burgers were either sold out from Opentable or too late of a time, this was the next best thing, and I had to get my celebrity chef itch out of the way.

The good:

prime rib: super tender, big chunk, maybe even 16-18 ounces, and not too fatty either.  Yorkshire i've had better

mashed potatoes: ordered another full serving.

the average:

server said the fish and chips were popular, I've had better.

Staying with the server, the bus boy gave us better service, thus he deserved the 15% tip instead, which we gladly gave cash when we left lol.  Our server barely deserved his 5%!

For the entree, I was between Bangers and Mash and Beef Short Rib, and unfortunately, listened to our waitress' advice to take the short rib. The rib was cooked well enough, but had no flavor and lots of fat. Short rib is one of my favorite dishes, and I had much better versions at other places on multiple occasions. It was also served with some bland Barley Risotto which additionally dulled down the dish which was not great to begin with.

I ordered the chopped salad, Leo got the Shepard's pie and we share the pub chips. Everything was just OK. The chopped salad mentioned wood-grilled chicken, but what I got resembled shredded rotisserie chicken - pretty bland. And then midway through our meal, we got bread service - which made absolutely no sense. 

Leo ordered another beer and after our meal, we asked for the dessert menu. And watched our server schmooze with a larger party for 10 minutes before we could flag him down and ask again. Once we got the menu and picked out a dessert (Sticky Toffee Pudding, which was actually very good), we had to wait until another server tapped ours on the back to let him know we were waiting.

What I found most impressive was that they cater to everyone. If you're looking for a fine dining experience, get a bottle of meritage and the veal chop. If you want a beer and some fish and chips, they can do that too.

Speaking of fish and chips, they were phenomenal. Fat pieces of cod, seasoned perfectly, coated in boddingtons beer batter and fried to a perfect crispness. The homemade chips are tossed in herbs and Parmesan. Ask for a side of garlic aioli to dip them in. It's a revelation. But honestly, the best thing on that plate were the bright green and buttery mushy peas. They had such a beautiful freshness to them and really tasted like...well...peas! But the best peas you've ever had.

We also had the shepherds pie. Down home goodness with a British flair. The use of lamb along with beef adds such a depth of flavor. Also, instead of using ground meat, the chefs braise it, so you get a nice stew like texture and flavor galore. The potatoes were creamy and rich and the vegetables inside were a perfect al dente.

We finished this feast with the sticky toffee pudding. Just get it. You are missing something divine if you don't.

Our server, Elyse, was kind, quick witted and on top of it. She anticipated our every whim. And a huge shout out to Raul and the amazing bar staff for such genius cocktails. These guys know what they're doing.

Speaking to others that have dined here, it seems that your experience depends a lot on the server that you get. Both times the food was outstanding, but our first visit was somewhat dulled by the lackluster performance of our server.

Our first visit was a weekday afternoon. We arrived just before 5:00 and it wasn't that busy--plenty of empty seats. We were told it would be about 15 minutes--strange since there were plenty of tables available. The hostesses are dressed in some sort of strange\/tacky newsprint style dress that really isn't flattering. It seemed like everyone except the hostesses were busy--they were mostly standing around at the front kiosk chatting with each other.

It only took about 5 minutes to find us a table. The waiter stopped by after a few minutes, dropped off an iPad, and told us to order our drinks through it. No problem, except that it's for alcoholic drinks only and Brenda wanted an iced tea. BTW, you don't order off the iPad, you just browse--what a waste of a perfectly good paperweight. Brenda ordered the Braised Pork Belly with Sauteed Asparagus and I had the Filet Mixed Grill with sides of Creamed Spinach and Smashed Fingerling Potatoes. No starters, but we did snack on the delicious pretzel bread with butter and a cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was nothing spectacular, but the bread was warm and soft and went great with the English butter they brought out. 

From the time we placed our order until the food arrived was about 20 minutes.  Brenda's iced tea finally arrived after the meal was served. The pork belly was delicious--just the right amount of crispiness without being overdone. The asparagus was done to perfection as well. The lemon zest and thyme went perfectly with the sweetness of the asparagus. I had pork belly with my meal, but it just wasn't the same as Brenda's. It was a smaller piece and it seemed it was cooked just a bit too long. Still had the good flavor, but it was just a bit dry. The filet was OK, nothing to rave about, but at least when I ordered it mid-rare, it came that way. The shrimp weren't bad, but I just don't think you can get really fresh, good shrimp in Las Vegas. For me, the stars of the meal were the two sides. The creamed spinach with stilton cheese was perfectly seasoned and really complimented the flavor of the pork belly. The fingerling potatoes had black truffle with small chunks of British double cream. I could have eaten two servings of these. 

We finally got to see our waiter again when he brought us the check. He didn't ask if we wanted dessert or an after dinner drink. Small tip for this bozo. 
All in all, it wasn't a bad experience. The food was as good as we expected, but the front of house staff turned what should have been an enjoyable dining experience into a mediocre one.

Our second visit was much better than the first. We made reservations for 6:30 on a Friday evening to take our friends out for dinner. We were greeted warmly and waited less than a minute for the next available hostess to take us to our table.. It was a nice table away from the bustle of the casino with deep, comfortable chairs. Our waiter was there almost immediately and we were given the menus along with the useless iPad.  We placed our drink orders and before they were there our waiter was ready to take our order.

This visit we had two orders of the Braised Beef Cheek, one Fish and Chips, and I ordered the Grilled Rack of Lamb, replacing the olive oil crushed potatoes the great fingerling potatoes I had last time. Since we passed on starters, we continued snacking on the bread while we waited for the food to arrive. Very busy this night, but the staff didn't seem to be as disorganized as during our first visit. 
Like the last trip, the food was amazing and as before, Brenda picked the better meal. The beef cheeks simple melted in your mouth and the sauce was so rich and tasty, I wanted to dip some of my lamb rack into it. The plate of fish and chips was huge. The batter was crispy without overcooking the fish and the tarragon tartar sauce complimented it well. My lamb rack was cooked perfectly to a medium rare with a nice sear on the outside. The rosemary lamb sauce was tasty without having that overpowering rosemary flavor or odor. All during the dinner, the staff was attentive, refilling our drinks and water glasses. We definitely didn't suffer through the poor service we had the last time around.

This trip we all had dessert and each picked something different to try. Steph had the Potted Triple Chocolate Trifle which she enjoyed, but couldn't finish because of her large portion of fish and chips. Joe had the Spotted Dog (a bread pudding) which was tasty and quickly devoured. Brenda, who loves rhubarb, had the Rhubarb Cobbler. I had the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which I first had at GR Steak, and it was just as good and a few bucks cheaper.",2,1,1

Set in Caesars Palace, it's a bit of a walk to get here. I recommend you make reservations if you come during a busy time, especially on a weekend. I made a reservation and we were seated immediately. The decor is upscale and has a beautiful bar as well.

I've been here a couple times and have been pleased each time. This last time we started with the kettle chip nachos!! Omg!! They are the best. They make their own chips and it's topped with pieces of juicy tender beef short rib and drizzled with white English cheddar cheese sauce. I could eat a bowl of that alone  We asked our waiter to bring more sauce and she happily brought us more!
I then had their signature dish, the Shepherds pie! It's made with lamb and fresh veggies and topped with mashed potatoes. It was so delicious and seasoned perfectly! It is a large portion and very filling. It's the perfect comfort food. One person in our group had the lamb burger. It was juicy and cooked to his liking and  he ate every bite. We all tried the sticky pudding cake for dessert. (One is offered free on Yelp check-in). Winner winner... so good and huge enough to share. I loved everything we tried.

The one and only place I really wanted to go to was Gordon's Pub and Grill. We drove straight through the night from the Seattle area to be able to get there with enough time to enjoy all of the sights. Let me tell you that this was by far the biggest disappointment. I have watched EVERY show this man has EVER done and I am the biggest fan, all I wanted to do was taste his food. I ordered an 8oz steak medium rare and it was supposed to come with potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Well I got my steak and vegetables(no potatoes) my steak was rare and cold so I had to hunt down our waiter to put it back on the grill for a bit longer. He was very rude and said that I should have ordered it medium...uh no you should have just cooked it medium rare like I asked and delivered it warm not cold. When I did get it back I still had no potatoes but the steak was perfect. My waiter never did return, instead a runner named Chris brought my food out and was very nice. He even checked back with me to make sure it was good. Throughout the meal we had obviously drank all of our drinks but still no waiter. We ended up calling the manager over and he was gracious enough to comp my boyfriends meal. This only happened because he had only eaten a few bites because his burger was also under done but he didn't want to create even more of a scene than I had. All in all I would say that I wouldn't eat at this pub again do to the rudest service I had ever experienced(keep in mind that I eat in Seattle usually so I am used to larger cities and the fact that they get busy) At the end of our meal I finally found our waiter at a table filled with all women, I guess flirting was more of a priority.

We order the fish and chips  ($30). I've had better fish and chips at Long John Silvers and H Salt. The fish was dried out and crumbly. The French fries were soggy and limp.   For $30 definitely not worth it. 

The Mac and cheese with lobster ($28).  I've had better Mac and cheese out of a box, really!  The sauce was watery And the few tiny bits of lobster were not so tasty. 

The steak and ale pie. Basically it's a Shepard's pie made with beef instead of lamb.  The crust was soggy and the meat was so tasteless. 

I'd like to invite Gordon Ramsey to go and dine on some of this cuisine that bears his name. I don't think he'd approve.

So, here it goes, the Ramsay Pub and Grill review. :) knowing we were going to Vegas, we knew we wanted to try one of Ramsay's places.  We love his shows and wanted to try his food.  We decided on the Pub and Grill. We made reservations via Open Table. About a week before, we got a message on our home answering machine from the restaurant. We were being bumped, a VIP came in and bought out the restaurant for the night we were going to be there. They were very accommodating and worked to get us in while we were there. The evening finally arrived. We got there a little early and were seated immediately. This is where they lose the half star. I sat in a chair and felt like I was on the floor. My chin, literally scrapping the table?! What is up with the chairs? Our waitress and another staff were very helpful though to get us ""big people"" chairs. I quite literally needed a booster to reach the table appropriately. But the dinner got better. We started with drinks. I chose the blue sky, sweet and yummy! I am a sucker for a sweeter mixed drink. The hubby chose a beer on tap, all I know though is that it was a heffeweizen. It was delightful though. We picked apps. The beer nuts which come with a variety: sweet, salty, and spicy. I didn't try the spicy but the hubby liked them a lot. I tried the sweet and the salty. They were delicious. We also got the lobster roll app. Two small rolls filled with an awesomely good lobster roll filling. For our main dishes...the hubby got the fish and chips which comes with  mushy peas. I have never heard of mushy peas but wow...how interesting who would have thought that peas and mint would taste so good together. Wow! What flavors! I chose the Scottish salmon and this came with cauliflower. Wow! Best salmon ever! The skin tasted so good! And the fish cooked perfectly, flaking off, so fresh. Cauliflower was delightful too. Just a really good dinner. The food was just really quite good. I would visit again!",11,4,8

The GM contacted me to apologize, explained that he would be working with his staff to rectify my complaints and, offered to have me come back so he could  make my next experience a better one. I was taken a back and thoroughly impressed by this; it says a lot about this business and how they represent themselves. 

Almost 6 months since my contact with the GM, I reached out to see if the offer was still on the table. And on March 28 I had an amazing 40th birthday filled with great friends, incredible food, wonderful sevice and a restored, impressive experience at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grille! I went with no expectations and told my friends they might send out a special appetizer or dessert, but they went above and beyond my\/our expectations! Our server talked about the menu and
 answered our questions expertly, the drinks were delicious,  the appetizers and main cooarse were incredible (I suggest the lamb burger!!!!), and the dessert was UNBELIEVABLE; sticky toffee pudding with one of the most delicious house made caramel sauces all of us had ever had! Then to top off our experience we got to meet the winner of Last Year's Hell's Kitchen, Scott Commings! I'm embarrassed  to say I cried, I was so over joyed!

Aside, from all the generous things done for us, I have to say I cannot wait to go back to Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grille the next time I'm in Vegas. It truly is a great restaurant with traditional pub food that is made expertly with a presentation that sets them apart from many restaurants.

I think the only reason I can't give this four stars (I reserve five stars for places that blow my socks off) is due to the size of our appetizer and that while it was good, it wasn't as good as I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, pretzels with cheddar beer sauce is *AMAZING* and the sauce actually was everything I was hoping it would be, it was just that the pretzels were lacking a bit of something, although I can't say exactly what.

The mash was full of flavor and was perfect texture. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding for dessert and it was out of this world! 
My husband ordered the 14 oz ribeye and it was cooked to perfection and needed none of the sauce choices. He ordered his sauce on the side and never needed to touch it since the steak stood perfect alone.

Enter Ray Ray, the afternoon bartender at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill.  I was not only happy to be there, I hated to leave.  Ray Ray introduced me to new beers, and was not short of fun conversation.  Not to be outdone by Ray Ray, the bar manager Randy came by to personally make sure I was happy.

The drinks ( I had the 'God Save the Queen') and food (Fish and Chips) were outstanding.  If you plan to attend, it is indeed pub food.  They have a couple high end dishes. But this is the place you can come if you don't feel like changing out of your jeans or shorts.

I ordered a couple of German ales, and the beer was perfectly chilled.

[[Chicken, Kale & Bacon Pot Pie, $23]] For $23, I would expect a huge pot pie. Nope. It came out in this small bowl. I finished the thing in 10 minutes... It was good, yes, but nothing amazing or mind blowing.

[[Grilled Lamb Burger, $21]] My boyfriend ordered this, and he thought it was very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The burger came with fries on the side, but $21 isn't worth it.  

[[Truffle Chips, $12]] Basically some fries with truffle oil and a sprinkle of cheese on it. The fries itself wasn't too memorable, but the sauce it came with on the side was delicious. 

Service here is pretty good; our server was attentive and asked us every so often how everything was going. 

Would I dine here again? No. Prices are a tad outrageous (obviously, since it's Vegas, but c'mon now). Even if I was filthy rich I wouldn't. You're just not getting bang for your buck by eating here. You're just paying for the name.",2,2,1

We shared the lobster rolls, I had the New York strip, and he had the fish & chips.
The lobster rolls were so fresh and tangy, I was tempted to order more!
My steak was cooked just right and was very moist and flavorful and the roasted asparagus that came with it was perfect. My BF's fish and chips were well seasoned and delicious.

Service was great as well. We were a bit intimidated by what seemed like a line as we approached, but everyone was seated promptly. Our server was attentive and our food came out quickly. The only thing that I didn't like was our table. It was right next to another couple, so close it felt like a double date. I think I was sitting closer to the woman next to me than to my BF.

The first time was for dinner. We go the Bangers & Mash and Shepherd's Pie, two items that a pub should be known for. Both were good, but not great. This dishes are both around $25. We also had the English Ale Onion Soup for an appetizer. That was very good. 

The second time, we went for lunch and wanted to try the fish & chips. We had Calamari for an appetizer. This was good.  Please don't go by every ones recommendation on the fish & chips. We went there just for that and we both were very disappointed. $30 for fish & chips, they better be good, but they were not. You were given 2 not very big pieces of fish and not very tasty.  Go downtown at the Main Street Station at the 777 brewery that were 100 times better at better then half the cost.

Bottom line, not worth the cost of the items on the menu. Way overrated.  Really disappointed in a place with Ramsay's name on it, Seriously, walk 100 ft to Bobby Flay's Mesa grill in Caesar's to get a great dinner or lunch at pretty much at the same cost. It is not a pub, but his food is so much better and would rate it a 5 over this 2. If you are a Total Rewards person, be sure you tell them for that big $1 off per selection.

My assume husband enjoyed his meal as well as he did not even offer me a bite of his dinner. 
We definitely stuffed our faces during dinner and as embarrassing as this sounds, we did also end up ordering dessert, which was definitely unnecessary but extremely worth it. Their pudding cake is to die for. It is a must when visiting this restaurant.

Which brings me to the table: I was seated in an oversized barstool, a ridiculous piece of furniture for even a pub\/restaurant, making me wonder if Ramsey really did have anything whatsoever to do with setting up this restaurant.

If you're in Caesar's, don't bother with this place. Go to the Cheescake Factory instead. Better service and much more reasonably priced. And there's already salt on the table!

Ramsey, put this restaurant on your list for you own show!",0,1,0

They sat us in right away and I didnt even have to slip them a 20 to be first in line. There service was impeccable. We changed tables as many times as the color wheel from twister. The waitress gave us her recommendations and the lamb burger was to die for. The first bite I took was filled with creamy savory feta and carmalized onions that just make u think of being on vacation and remembering the first step u took out of the plane watching the sun set in the horizon. Yes it was like an oasis in my mouth accompanied by a savory but lean and juicy lamb patty that was perfectly spiced. The lamb was so delicious I had to buy the chef a shot of patron. Kudos chef ramsey. I was so stuffed that I couldn't make room for dessert. So I excused myself from the table and threw up in the restroom so i could have some of their world famous bread pudding.  I cant even begin to describe the bread pudding. Its consistency was more like a cake that crumbled as it touch my lips. The ice cream was light and whipped with crunchy peanut brittle that made me pause from reading shades of gray. Yes it was that good.  Chef ramsey left my loins on fire. Kudos!!!!,0,0,0

For a restaurant with this namesake, I expected a much better experience than what we got, especially if it's going to be $120 lunch.
After being seating by the hostess we waited for about 10 minutes for our waiter to greet us. Even then, I'm not sure he would have if he hadn't  noticed my girlfriend grab a glass bottle of water from a nearby bucket to at least start to quench our thirst. Then, when he came over, he stole the bottle of water from us, despite the fact we said we were very thirsty and needed lots of water. He seemed surprised and unprepared that we were ready to order, but took our order.
""We'll start with the mini lobster roll appetizer and then 2 orders of fish & chips please with an iced tea to drink."" He then disappeared again and about one minute (now they're fast?) later our delicious (5 stars) mini lobster rolls showed up via a stranger, not our waiter and were consumed. Our fish & chips came soon after, also delivered by a different stranger, and while not as good as the appetizer the fish and tartar were good (4 stars) the chips were burnt on the outside and raw inside ( NO STARS ). 
The waiter never checked on us and we felt inclined to ask the random people delivering food to us for help, which they did for some things. Even telling the waiter that we wanted to order dessert. ""Sticky Toffee Pudding"" (3 stars) and a double espresso (2 stars). Our bill for lunch was about $110 - we left only a $10 tip which I wish the random strangers would get not our absentee server.

For dinner I got the Sheppard's Pie, and our entrees took a long long time to arrive, I didn't time it, but it was very obvious.

Dessert we had Sticky Toffee pudding, a personal favorite of mine and it was the best part of the meal.  It was very delicious.  

My husband had the fish and chips, which he liked, but thought was overpriced ($30).  He also had the corn soup, which was very good he said.  

Overall, I would say go, but expect to be at dinner 2 plus hours, so if you have show tickets or somewhere to be, make an early reservation, because this place is slow.

To begin with, the entire restaurant is perfectly designed, down to the outfits worn by the hosts, waiters, bartenders. 

But of course the food is the real star. I ordered the fish and chips that was caught that morning, and it was absolutely divine. We also ordered the mushrooms which we could not get enough of. But then we met the top contender, the famous Toffee Pudding. 

The toffee pudding was absolutely to die for, and now tops my list of best desserts I've had in my life, and I'm a total foodie. It isn't really pudding at all, but a toffee cake with ice cream and hot toffee sauce. If you are in Vegas, you need to stop here JUST for this dessert.

The drinks are also incredible! I had the mocha cocktail (?) and it was delicious and worth the price.

The pepper debacle part II: Our waiter came by after I was told the restaurant ran out of pepper and I asked him if maybe I could get some pepper.  He disappeared and a while later I saw him and asked again.  He told me that the dispensers kept getting clogged and that's why they didn't give it to people.  Wait, so did you run out?  Or are the dispensers clogged?  If the dispensers are clogged I'd like to suggest the following... since they are essentially metal creamers with a hinged, unlatched top that has holes, just open, put some in a rammekin and bring some over.  

At the end of our meal we had to ask for our check several times.  When it came we gave two credit cards (not uncommon) and asked the bill to be split 60\/40.  Our waiter looked at us like he had no clue what that meant and then about ten minutes later came back and said, ""So, if I put 91 on one and 71 on the other is that right?""  WHAT?!  This is a very basic math problem.  And, in case math is not your forte, you can use the POS computer or a calculator (or a PENCIL) to figure out that it's $64.80 and $97.20.

My burger was not overwhelming or juicy or delicious. That's what I expected. The truffle chips were actually my favorite here. We did not order any of the British staples like fish n chips or shepherds pie, and that may have been what all the great reviews were for. All I know is I did some major walking and shopping at the Forum Shops in Ceasars so when I saw Gordon Ramseys pub I walked in. I had such a taste for a great burger which I did not get.

We went to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill this evening to watch the NBA Playoffs. Things started off well enough--we though the fish and chips were a bit greasy and way overpriced, and the french fries tasted burnt, but this was our first time at this restaurant, so we just thought that they were prepared strangely. When someone next to us was served the same dish, we realized that our french fries HAD been burned beyond all recognition.

We were having a fun time with the bartenders--lots of laughing and jokes. However, one of the bar backs, Antoine, followed my girlfriend when she went to the bathroom. Antoine, is a large, menacing character, and she was not comfortable with his aggressive behavior. When she came back from the bathroom, he came out from the back and handed her his phone number. Later, he said, ""You better not have thrown that number away. You better call me or you can't ever come in here again.""

At the end of the evening, one of the bartenders, Keith, put two drinks in front of us that we did not order, and said, ""Try this."" We assumed that he wanted us to try a new drink he was working out--we are very familiar with bars, and it wouldn't be the first time that a bartender had asked us to try his drink. I did not care for mine, so I wasn't drinking it. When Antoine came out again, he said, ""What's wrong?"" I said that I did not like it. Antoine then proceed to PICK UP MY DRINK, DRINK OUT OF THE STRAW, AND PUT THE DRINK BACK IN FRONT OF ME. I sat, mouth agape with incredulity astounded by his presumptuousness, and all I could manage to utter was, ""I don't want that."" He then took the drink and said, ""I can't drink this out here, but I will take it in the back. Thanks for the drink!"" I have never seen anything like this. As I type this, I still cannot fathom that a server (or any other human being) would drink out of a stranger's drink. IN WHAT WORLD IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?!?!? Especially in the context of a server and a customer. My head almost exploded. I supposed that it is fortuitous that I was intimidated by Antoine because that spared everyone from me causing a scene.

I called immediately after leaving the restaurant\/bar. When I asked to speak to the manager, the hostess who answered the phone said, ""Sure! What's your name, Hun?"" I am a doctor and a college professor. ""Hun?"" What year is this?

When I spoke the the manager, there was no greeting on the phone, he just said, ""Zeus."" It took a few seconds for me to understand that he was actually stating his name, and I wasn't transferred to the wrong number. When I told Zeus the story, his response was, ""So, I don't understand--are you saying that Antoine threatened you?"" Hopeless--these people are all so hopeless. Zeus assured me that he would take our last two drinks off of the bill and tell the regional manager about Antoine's behavior. I am not really sure how that is an appropriate response to this horrific situation. 

So, I guess we won't be returning to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, because my friend has no interest in calling Antoine--she couldn't afford to pay for all of his drinks all night anyway.",11,9,0

I never have been to a Gordon Ramsay eating establishment before. I watched him on TV however I didn't know what my expectations were. After eating here, this eatery met my expectations. Since this is an English pub it made sense to order the Shepherd's Pie. I'm not a big fan of meat pies as they tend to be heavy. This meat pie was hearty. I love the mashed potato covering on the pie as it had that outer crust. In addition the mashed potato was creamy and not heavy. Regarding the meat there is a contrasting texture with the minced beef and lamb that makes the dish very appetizing. Everyone mentions about the Sticky Toffee Dessert but for dessert I ordered the Spotted ""Dic"". I liked how the warm bread pudding meshed with the cold ice cream. I would have given a higher rating had it not been for the Truffle Chips. I expected the chips to be a thick cut chip. Instead the chips were the typical skinny cut.

S. so when we were planning our recent trip to Vegas, all I could hear in my head is Gordon yelling at me, ""You better eat at one of my restaurants, you f***ing donkey!""   

With those inspiring words resonating in my head, I booked our first dinner at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=P8fDK-wHe80_9pnT_mIrig ) for Thanksgiving dinner.  This also continued a recent tradition I like to call the ""Untraditional Thanksgiving.""   It started a few years ago with a trip to Big Bear for a Chinese Thanksgiving and since then we have done Hawaiian and now British cuisine.

One of the things I like right away was the vibe of the place ... I really felt comfortable and at home.  The attention to detail was extensive including a wall mural ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=0jogkV5ZH0-crkb0wzAzeQ ) , the table settings ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=7PjeahRWVg8XaSlaEYzKMQ ) and menus.  Even the mix matched furniture just felt right in this restaurant.  And if the staff needs a reminder of who they work for ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=mN8dmXYi9mLK3T9tu9vCzg ), you have Chef Ramsay staring at you every time you leave or enter the kitchen!

Once we were seated at a half booth table, our server came over, took our drink order and introduced us to the menu.  The menu consists of Table Starters, Soups & Salads, Sandwiches & Burgers, Seasonal Choices, Pies, Oak-Fired Grill Entrees, Classic Entrees, Sides and Desserts.

For my wife, her entrée was preordained weeks before the reservation and she chose the Classic Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=pLeX7KKtxHjHAVxFxtkWIg ) Substituting Mashed Potatoes with Chive Oil for the Chips, I decided to go with the Steak & Ale Pie ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=cxztqT6sQKUcvxwKCUb-dw ) and we split the Kettle Chip Nachos ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=3iew4HO_VJPYKtAeK9t_OA ) Starter item.

The Kettle Chip Nachos came to the table surprising hot and I think these were the first homemade chips that really impressed Laina.  Usually we would have some major complaints about the lack of short rib (very little) and corned beef (even less ... think nada), but the HP sauce (Tamarind based sauce with tomatoes, molasses and malt vinegar) really elevated the chips and there was a good amount of the other items.  Needless to say and to paraphrase Dr. Suess:  the one speck of food that we left on the plate was a crumb too small for a mouse to have ate!

Our entrees came out shortly after we had wolfed down the nachos.  Laina liked the fish and said she could taste the ale in the batter, but was more impressed with the dill tarter sauce and sides.  Opting out of the chips for mashed potatoes was an excellent choice as the potatoes were perfectly whipped and the chive oil was a great compliment.  Usually Laina will ask for extra butter with her mashed potatoes, but no butter was requested on this occasion.  Her only regret was there could have been more chive oil with the potatoes.  She was also a fan of the mushy peas and thought the vest of lemon was a great addition without being too acidic.

My steak and ale pie was a well balanced dish, just a bit on the small side.  The pastry was a perfect golden brown and flaky.  This is a very hearty entree and there was a good amount of tender steak, 'shrooms and root veggies.  I am just not sure the quality makes up for the lack of quantity when you consider the price tag ($24.00).  

For dessert, we selected the Potted Chocolate Triffle ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=4KSMWCaEumIG2DXwpsqF9A ) which came with two mini chocolate chocolate chip cookies.

Rohlinism:  It isn't Thanksgiving dinner without a fattening dessert!

Laina was basically full, but always manages to find extra room for chocolaty delicious desserts.  The triffle was topped with white chocolate shavings and round dark chocolate crisps.  The mixture of dark and milk chocolate was fantastic and the Chantilly cream put this dessert on another level!  Fantastic way to end the meal!

Service was really good for the most part.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were sat promptly at 7:00 pm (love that British punctuality).  Our server was efficient and answered all our questions (or asked someone who knew), but he could have benefited from a personality transplant.

It is a bit on the expensive side, but that is to be expected and you can get $1.00 off most items by joining Total Rewards.  Overall, I was impressed enough with the food to return in the future.",159,147,155

I had the steak pie and it was both salty and chewy. Thanks to a really great server he rushed out a chicken pot pie to substitute out. This was Bland， tasted like a marie calandar microwave special.

My good friend who dinned with me had a simple burger. Looked good but he tells me it was just plain. And generally disapointing.

Unfortunately, every single thing that could have gone wrong here - did. And we are not high maintenance guests.
The atmosphere is OK and they had our reservation so things looked alright starting out.
It took an eon for the waitress who was on planet Venus all night  to come by and bring us water. We were starving so we ordered right away - the scallops, steak and the soft and salty pretzels to start. We waited and waited and it was busy but not full.  It took forever for anyone to come back around with anything.
We got mixed veg side dish brought to us by another waiter. Not our starter. We stated that we had ordered pretzels and then our own server came over and looked like a deer in headlights. I gently reminded her, that she was the one that had recommended them to us and that we had said yes to them as our starter. Sheesh. Then finally, our main courses arrived. Then so did the pretzels which we had lost interest in. 3 tiny sticks for $8 with sickly liquid cheddar and mustard so hot to one's senses it was inedible. And I love hot.
The steak was vastly under seasoned. The scallops had a nice sear on them (4 for $32, yipes!)  but the chowder they were on was cold. Terrible thing to serve a chowder cold. The taste was there though. Too much $ for these plates.
We had to ask for a steak knife, spoon for the chowder, salt and pepper. Really?
No one came around to check on us.
To add insult to injury not only were those late, overrated pretzels on the bill, so was the mixed veg starter we never had nor ordered! 
Eventually these were taken off the bill after much waiting but I was surprised that a manager had not come by to rectify anything or see what they could do to improve.
We paid,  shook our heads and left knowing that the high turn around of customers\/tourists  will keep this place afloat but there is no organization here whatsoever, no one seems to give a rat's A$$ and we left a little dumbfounded.

Gordon, you better get back here and have your people retrained!!!

""I've had a phenomenal 10 years making 123 episodes, 12 seasons, shot across 2 continents, watched by tens of millions of people and sold to over 150 countries. It's been a blast but it's time to call it a day.""

DON'T STOP TOO SOON... you have one more restaurant to fix up... this one!

Worst Gordon Ramsay experience we've ever had (and the first bad experience so maybe that's why I'm taking it so hard).

1.  Our experience started as the hostess walked us through a reasonably open restaurant: past the ""patio"", past the bar, past the really nice booths, and all the way to the very back of the ""family room""... where one might imagine the staff eats.  What's up with that; do we not fit your preferred demographic or is there some other reason why you did this to my family?  I'm curious; really.

2.  Waitress seems to have trained at the local Denny's.  If you were here, Chef Ramsay you'd tell that 'fat cow"" to EffOff.  Ordered drinks and food.  Food got delivered (shockingly fast), then the drinks.  Not relaxing at all.

3.  Fish and chips... let's talk about this please.  I'm in no way qualified to tell you how to cook, but these fish and chips were fish and fries.  I've had plenty of fish and chips in the UK, both in pubs and from small shops... and once from a place so small they didn't even have electric refrigeration.  Really... fries pretending to be chips on a plate of fish and chips???  I've seen you rip people new a-holes for misrepresenting food like this.  Oh... and we never tasted the mushy peas.  The expeditor forgot them, the runner didn't notice that the expeditor forgot them, and the waitress... well she was out to pasture and didn't notice much of anything.

4.  Shepard's Pie... let's chat some more.  Served ""bare naked"" it was a disappointing sight from the moment it landed on the table.  Mash was barely browned and no garnish at all.  No visual appeal and no olfactory appeal either.  As I ate all I could hear was you saying ""season, season, season"" as you prepare to send a MasterChef contestant home for serving bland food.  Whoever the donkey is that cooked my pie... please ask him to return the apron and leave.  Please.  And those straight-sided dishes sure did make eating the mince and veg a frustrating experience.

5.  Manager was finally summoned.  I was unhappy.  He was polite and kind but had an ""excuse"" for almost everything.  Fries rather than chips: ""you can order real chips on the appetizer menu"" and when asked again ""well, this is a Ramsay-twist; Las Vegas twist on a pub.""  WTF does that mean... that you can call chips fries because we're not in the UK?  I think not.  He did the best he could to make things right and comp'd a couple of desserts to make up for the missing mushy peas.  But days later all I can remember is that we didn't have the kind of experience we should have had.

6.  Oh, and let me not forget to mention... the table next to us was set for guests, but there were chips -- errr... fries, I mean -- on the floor, presumably from the last diner.  EVERYONE walked past them, over them, and past them again.  I had the pleasure of looking at squished fries on the floor as I ate my meal.  I know, I know it is my own fault: I looked (and looked again).  Manager verified that they were fries and not chips... then took 15 minutes to get them cleaned up.  But cleaned up they were... eventually.

7.  Now that I've vented my spleen let me compliment a few things:  salmon was very good.  The fish on the fish-and-fries was good too.  Desserts were excellent.

Please forgive me, Chef, for having such an attitude but it is you who inspire me and you who keeps bleating ""standards""... and I totally agree.  Standards are everything and should be maintained at all times.  I only wish they were maintained for me during our visit to your PUB.",12,9,2

We made reservations, asked to be by the kitchen, and also mentioned it was a birthday dinner. They didn't relay any of that information when it came time to dine but at least they had our reservation on file. 

Service was awful during our visit. My brother in law ordered the Onion soup and they brought it out to him without a spoon. We had to flag down our waiter and ask for the spoon. They were also ""conveniently"" out of their house wine so we were forced to spend more money on wine with dinner. 

When it came time for the bill we had to wait about 10 minutes for him to bring it. 

If Gordon Ramsay knew how terrible the service was at this place he might make a visit and set them straight. At no point should the waiter tell me that $17 calamari is justified no matter the quality because we are in Caesars Palace. To be fair, the calamari was decent. 

I am only giving 2 stars because of the terrible service. The food was good, not great. I can get better at my local pub for a lot less money.",0,0,0

I have long been a fan of Gordon Ramsay not just through his American shows which are fairly insufferable, but his British ones in which you see that he is a person who practices what he preaches. Sadly, this Pub & Grill is the embodiment of the American cartoon version of Ramsay that so many people have embraced. The pretentious decor is overly busy and fatiguing from the design of the fake wall outside made from kegs to the ridiculous studded belts and Hot Topic shorts the waitstaff wear. Even if one were to enjoy the aesthetic, there are still several details that I doubt GR would approve of if he were actually on site. These include things like water being served from swing top bottles that still have sticker residue on them and wall paper that was peeling in the bathrooms. 

All of this would be forgivable if the food was stellar, but sadly it doesn't live up to he name here either. My steak and ale pie was served piping hot while my wife's bangers and mash were lukewarm. Additionally, while the sauce and crust of the pie were delicious, most of the steak was very tough and chewy. While there were two or three pieces of melt-in-your-mouth steak in there, they just made me more angry that they were the exception to the rule. 

So after $60 for two tiny entrees and water that were worse than the offerings from my local Irish pub, I couldn't help but wonder who this restaurant was for. It's too spendy for the regular pub crowd, but the food doesn't live up to the GR name. That leaves only diehard Hell's Kitchen fans who want to say they have visited a famous chef's restaurant. 

Vegas is a foodie Mecca. Skip this one.

P.S. Several pictures show bread being served with the meal but we were never offered any. I also didn't see it on the menu. That looks pretty great, would have been nice to try.",0,0,0

Maybe after having dinner at the London restaurant in West Hollywood, I expected more from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  We arrived a bit early to our reservation and the hostess treated us as if we had just slapped her mother.  When I sheepishly asked if we could get a drink at the bar while we waited, she flippantly said we could but that she wouldn't be assisting us with a table until our reservation time.  

So we got a drink.  2 Vodka Red Bulls, 1 Black & Tan, 1 Heineken and 1 Iced Tea...for $60?!?  Regardless, I realized we were going to a well named chef's restaurant and I tend to be prepared for inflation...but that was a rough way to start out.

Once it was time for our reservation, I went back to the hostess booth and was pleasantly surprised to find someone new.  Fortunately for us, this new girl didn't hate life in the same way and was kind enough to sit our group.

3 of our group ordered the Fish & Chips.  1 ordered the scallops and I, in an attempt to try as much as I could, ordered the Filet mixed grill.  As a starter, I ordered the corn soup and my wife the heirloom tomato salad.

The Starters...incredible.  My soup was fantastic and the tomato salad even better.  We loved the pretzel bread the brought out and all were very excited for our main courses.

Main courses...mine sucked...well I should say...the fish & chips DIDN'T suck.  My friend's scallops were good, but they were sitting in a bowl of broth.  There really wasn't much to the dish....except a $32 price tag.  Then came my mixed grill.  The shrimp were WAY over cooked.  Rubber Shrimp.  The Steak was cooked nicely and the Pork Belly had great flavor, but under all 3 items was a sauce...all of which were horrible.  The shrimp had a white puree that was completely pointless.  Under the pork belly was a horrible pea green baby food that didn't taste like much but made the food unappetizing.  Lastly under the filet was a poor rendition of a tomato based barbecue type sauce.  On top of it all, when I ordered my meal the server asked ""Ok and what side would you like""  which I assumed meant that I was supposed to choose.  I asked him his recommendation and ordered the asparagus.  Not only were they completely boiled and tasteless...they were only there to add $10 (Yes TEN DOLLARS for boiled asparagus.) Brutal.

All in all, I struggle to not give it 1 star, but the fish & chips were good and the appetizers were nice...so I'll give it 2.  Regardless of how many stars, we will not return to this restaurant.",4,0,0

Being a fan I was excited to try this place.  What to order?  this was the hardest question to answer since the ACT.  I wanted a burger but thought I should get out of my comfort zone and try something a bit more British, so I went with the pie sampler.  I thought this was a great idea so I could sample all the taste Gordon has to offer but it backfired a bit because it really is just an appetizer, so I was still a bit hungry afterwards.  Each meat pie was about as good as a meat pie can get, but that's not saying much.  Looking back I should have ordered either a whole pie or the burger, or maybe the sampler and a burger.

I like food, I like beer. Give me really good food with a really good beer spin that around with some really helpful service, and we are talking.  The secret to getting the best experience here is asking your server what are the specials and recommendations.  On multiple occasions, the server led me onto a tasty new adventure.  One of their highly recommended beers is the Scottish Innis and Gunn.  The server recommended this very crisp and refreshing ale to me.  It has become the centerpiece of what I am basing my dinner on.  Do not be afraid to ask them what they would pair your food with.  My servers on the occasions I have gone here, really sold the food choices by their descriptions.
One evening, I tried the Shepard's Pie.  Very flavorful, very moist.  It is lamb based, rather than ground beef.  The potatoes on top were just so soft and melted in my mouth.
Another one to try is the bacon cheeseburger.  Sounds simple enough, but that bacon is maple bacon...  The server told me that the bacon starts the day before.  It is cut up then soaked overnight in pure maple syrup.  It is then cooked with more syrup. I am telling you this right now, IT IS GOOD.  It is gooder than good. The chef that afternoon even came out to check on some tables.  I told him right there, ""Best thing I ever put in my mouth.""

I could make something that tasted like that at home for so much cheaper. The dish was $24. Not worth. Aside from that, it took 45 minutes to receive our food.

We were seated immediately, but there was a slow start to our service which was always rather harried and not particularly friendly.  We started with the warm pretzels ($8) with a white cheddar sauce and seedy English mustard.  The cup with three pretzel sticks were perfect - a nice crispy skin and tender interior.  The creamy and slightly sharp cheese sauce and the gourmet mustard were plentiful and great for dipping (separately and together).  This was a great prelude.

For our entrees, we split the wedge salad and the mixed vegetable salad ($15 and $16 each).  The wedge salad was quite good - baby iceberg was sweet and crisp and topped with grated hardboiled egg, bits of blue cheese and bacon and crispy onions and sat in a bed of creamy blue cheese dressing with a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette on the top.  It was a hearty salad that was at once rich, sweet, salty and tangy.  I would definitely get this again.  The mixed vegetable salad was a mélange of spring greens with shaved fennel, carrots and radishes and bits of cucumber and halved cherry tomatoes that were overdressed with a white balsamic vinaigrette and finished with some crunchy caramelized cashews.  Other than the excess dressing, this was a very good salad.

Let me start by saying that the quality of the food was very good, and truly that should be the important part right? The service however...ugh.
Husband and I came in Xmas Eve, dressed to the nines as we were going to a show that night...the hostess put us on a tiny crappy table stuck by a beverage cart and then she walked away without asking if it was ok...I don't like to make waves on a busy service night, so I didn't complain, but we had a reservation made over 10 days previous and it would have been nice to have a decent table when we were obviously dressed for a nice dinner.  Our server was then clueless to anything.  He was slow, did not have a good knowledge of the menu, and was not genuine in his approach to our questions.  When he asked us for our drink order  we were very specific in what we wanted.  I specifically asked him if he had a particular liquor,& I overhead him ask his co-worker about it,  and we could tell they had no idea. He then placed the order..?  Out of concern I then walked the 10 paces to the bar and found out myself that indeed they did NOT have what I wanted.  Low and behold, my drink arrives. The server tried to pawn off a drink as the one that I wanted....Furious. If someone is going to take initiative and ask me to try a drink in place of one that I want, I'm ok with that....However, to pretend to give me what I want, and pretend knowing otherwise angers me. These drinks are $20 bucks a piece, so I am pissed at this point and so is my husband.
Bartender to the rescue...I walk up there a second time and he looks sheepish. He knows already that the drink he made came to me after knowing full well that I did not want what was obviously given to me. He offered to look in the backroom for a replacement and ended up getting me exactly what I wanted from somewhere else.

Food: we had the mini trio of pot pies for appetizer, delicious, came out quick, but a little pricey for what you get. Prime rib entrée also very good, nice cut, well cooked. Caesar salad, simply delicious, homemade dressing with anchovies, yum! Grilled lamb burger on the brioche bun, soooo good, I loved it!  
Its so sad that an experience like we had could overshadow really good food. The food is served well, its creative, eye appealing and tastes great.

I've never had a problems with service, although for my first visit, I was seated at the bar.  It's not easy to get great service at a bar... Anyways, this last visit was by far the best.  I had the pretzels with the home made dijon, a bowl of the corn chowder with a basil creme fresh, and the heirloom tomato sandwich.  Let's break these bad boys down:

1) The pretzels weren't anything ridiculously amazing, but the dijon mustard is the star.  You can tell it's fresh.  It's a coarse-ground mustard that has plenty of heat.  If you put too much, it will clear out your sinuses, but wasn't retardedly\/annoyingly hot.  

2) I'd have to say that the corn chowder wasn't my favorite, but it had some good flavor combinations.  The chowder was sweet and had some crab meat placed in, which made it much more sweet that I usually go for.  I'd kind of like something sour (citrus\/lime juice possibly) to cut the sweetness.  But the creme fresh paired well to smooth the flavors out.  It cut into the sweetness a bit.  There was a bit of julienned basil to also help cut the sweetness.  Overall, pretty good.

3) The heirloom tomato sandwich is EXCELLENT.  Crispy bread with a citrusy aoli.  Perfectly rip tomatoes with thinly shaved parmessian on top.  Awesome.  I want another one for dinner.  Sh*t, I'd eat one for breakfast.  The freshness of the tomatoes work perfectly for a hot day.  And it was light enough not to weigh me doswn, unlike a shepherd's pie or a flat iron steak+fixin's.  No post-lunch naps required...

We came here as our consolation being too late to be seated soon for Bacchanal. The menu was pretty cool with a lot of grill favorites with a unique Ramsay twist. The servers were enthusiastic about the menu and all made reasonable recommendations. 

I got the lamb burger and french onion soup. The burger was pretty good I guess but the cheese really overpowered everything. As for the soup, I think it was fine as well.

We were all in the mood for some simple pub fare so after stepping off the elevators, we went straight to Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill.

It seems to be the perfect venue for sports fans as there were a myriad of TVs around the surrounding bar and dining room, with plenty of soccer (excuse me, ""football"") fans watching what seemed to be a fairly important match. Color me clueless because I can't watch a sport that doesn't count down to the end of a match or doesn't always end with a winner. But on to the food!

Warm Salty Pretzels [$8 \/ $7 Total Rewards]
Innis & Gunn Beer-Cheddar sauce, English granary mustard 

Make sure you get a Total Rewards card from Caesars because you get a dollar knocked off most menu items. We started off with the pretzels, which came warm and salty indeed. But fair warning, you only get three! The accompanying beer-cheddar sauce was nicely sharp with depth from the beer. The English granary mustard was great, with a sinus-clearing horseradish kick that was highly reminiscent of my favorite Holman's. 

Dublin Corned Beef Brisket Sandwich [$18 \/ $17 Total Rewards]
Dark caraway rye, Gruyere cheese, sauerkraut, pickled onion and cucumber dressing

The corned beef brisket sandwich featured great rye, with a nice heft of corned beef brisket that was balanced by the tangy sauerkraut and pickled onion and cucumber dressing within. The Guyere imparted a nice nuttiness that melded the flavors together nicely.

Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips [$30 \/ $29 Total Rewards] 
Cod, fresh dill tartar sauce, minted mushy peas, lemon

The fish and chips featured moist and flaky cod without its skin (luckily for the GF). The batter was crisp and light. The thick steak fried were not crisp, but came with more of a roasted texture. The minted mushy peas were light on mint and were a bit watery.

Grilled Lamb Burger [$21 \/ $20 Total Rewards]
8 oz, caramelized onions, goat cheese-feta spread, rosemary brioche bun

I went with the stellar lamb burger, which was cooked to a nice medium and housed within a perfectly proportioned brioche bun. The grassiness of the lamb was accented by the goat-cheese and feta spread, with the caramelized onions adding a nice richness to each bite.

Food is ok. Definitely not worth the price.

$30 for Fish & Chips?  Ridiculous, right?  After all, it's nearly 2x what I've ever paid even though it was super beautiful white fish; 2 smallish pieces with a generous amount of fries, and a very little ramekin filled with fresh peas (and a bit of mint).  The flavor of everything was great even though I didn't have one bite with both fish & coating -- it broke when cutting it.  (3.0 stars due to price)

$18 for Sandwich?   It was terrific, though.  Chicken pesto with roasted peppers, arugula, tomato, caramelized onions.  Cold chicken, but the toasted bread was so good, it made up for it.  British?  (4.5 stars)

$11 dessert?  Sticky Toffee Pudding (available at all Ramsay eateries) is to die for.  Served with sweet cream ice cream and warm caramel poured over before your very eyes.  Mmmmm.  (4.5 stars)

Service was slow to begin with, but when Daisy finally made it over, she was all over my dining partner and I.  Very responsive, fun, and efficient.  (4.5 stars)

It's a really excellent pub, with drafts (Boddington's, $11) but expensive\/costly\/pricey.  Beautifully constructed, painted (like a pool table), and many different rooms offering a little different feel depending on your desire.  But, it's really expensive.

I'll start by saying that I KNOW I'm not the target audience.  I'm a vegetarian (a real vegetarian - no meat of any kind) but my husband isn't.  For this reason, when we go to Vegas, I've taken him to Ramsay's Burger place, Pub, and Steak house.  I'm sure we'll visit the Fish and Chips place sooner than later.

This is my second time visiting the Pub & Grill.  We first went a few years ago, right after ""Scott"" won Hell's Kitchen.  I got the lobster mac & cheese without lobster and my husband got the Fish and Chips.  Shortly after, my husband got pretty sick but there wasn't a way to pinpoint if it was food-related or a delayed hangover, which we know he gets.  

We went for round two this trip.

We started with a flight of UK beers and a pint each of Innis and Gunn.  For those beer-fans out there, that was Bass, Boddingtons, I&G and New Castle.  The I&G is the ""original"" one and although the rum-cask is better, it's still delicious.

Then we went to order our food.  The prices have nearly doubled since it opened!  I bought my husband the exact same meal last time and now it's $30!  For Fish and Chips!

I got the beet salad for a whopping $18.  For beets, lettuce, and goat cheese.  I felt like it should have sat on a bet of poker chips.

I liked my salad and my husband loved his Fish and Chips.  We didn't over drink the night before and were totally healthy after our meal.

Because I've had it before and because it's amazing, we got the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  It's served with ice cream on top and not the ice cream butter stick you'll see at Gordon Ramsay Steak but lord is it delicious.

If the prices weren't so high, this would become a staple lunch place during our routine Vegas trip but I nearly dropped $100 on this meal and I literally had a salad and some beer.  I'm usually the cheap date since I don't eat meat but again... $18 for the salad.  

I'm sure Chef Ramsay is not hurting monetarily so it would be nice if the prices were only slightly ridiculous.  Then again... it's Vegas.

Note: The service was awesome.  Our waiter was great.

Caesars Palace is a busy place, and Pub & Grill's central location on the casino floor makes this restaurant a really busy place too. On a Tuesday evening around 8p, we were quoted a 45 minute wait for a party of two. Ugh. Too hungry for all that, we scoured the bar for a couple stools and luckily found a spot at the back end. We squeezed-in near the drink pickup station, so it was definitely a busy spot. Even though the restaurant was buzzing, we were promptly helped by both a bartender and server. Overall service was quick & friendly-enough.

The Maine Lobster Roll Minis are super tasty & ideal for sharing since they are plated in pairs. The Shrimp Cocktail's also great - six massive prawns perfectly poached and served with a delicious horseradish-spiked cocktail sauce.

I was seated at the bar, and unfortunately I wasn't in the mood for beer as they had a great selection of brews on tap. The bartender was quick to take my order and the wait staff were very friendly and appeared very much into providing a great experience.

I ordered the squash soup and it was serviceable but that's as much as I can say for it. It lacked the complexity I've had with squash soup at Mesa, Paley's Place, etc. Just a dollop of sour cream on top and served with garlic bread, so any crunch and extra flavor came from the bread.

I was truly looking forward to the sticky toffee pudding, as I LOVE sticky toffee pudding. The pudding part was perfect, a lovely dense cake. But the ""toffee"" lacked much flavor other than being sweet. I'm used to the toffee being much more, er, toffee-flavored. Also, the server brought it to me without a spoon and had to go look for one after pouring the toffee syrup over the cake. Ah, well, that will save me lots of calories in the future. If it had been as good as the ones I am used to, I would be dining here every meal while in Vegas. I'm happy others were pleased by it, but for me it was a complete disappointment.

This was my second time at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and both have been disappointing, just lacking in much flavor and everything could use a dash of salt.",0,0,0

Huge Ramsey shows fan. Was really excited to try one of his restaurants. I was rather disappointed. Food was only Ok. I was expecting my socks to be knocked off. I had the beef burger with bacon and the wife had the lamb burger. Both were decent but that's it. A decent burger isn't worth $20. Menu is super small, which is okay in one sense. Do fewer things but do them better. But these really aren't ""better"". I'd say a five-guys burger is better than this, and at only a quarter the price.

Located inside Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Ramsay's 'authentic english pub' sells overpriced, under-portioned food.  Seriously, $30 for fish and chips??  Same for bangers and mash??  Now, I realize that the overhead here must be tremendous but this food is overpriced and there isn't enough of it.  We ordered 1 bottled beer each (Heineken) and the fish and chips and banger and mash.  Our bill, with tip, came to just over $100!!  Crazy.

The mashed potatoes were not fresh, the bangers tasted like hot dogs.  The french fries were soggy and the battered fish looked like it had been frozen.  Such a disappointment. I'm certain that Gordon NEVER sets food inside this restaurant which is exploiting his name.  In fact, I'm not sure who's exploiting who here.  We had plans for a 'Gordon Ramsay Food Tour' but, based on this experience at The Pub, we cancelled our plans. I figured we would get stuck with a much, much higher food tab at the Steak House in the Paris hotel so ..... nah, not so much.

The ambiance of the restaurant is great--ranges from comfy sofas\/couches to booths and fancier tables. Dim lighting and cozy wooden kinda feel...with sports games to watch. Our waitress, Daisy, is absolutely amazing and I think our experience would not have been as awesome if not for her. She had a great sense of humor, top notch service, and was completely professional yet personal at the same time. 

We ordered:

Lamb shank: This actually brought my friend back to the days when his mother was still around and cooked him this as a young boy. The meat literally fell off the bone, and no knife was needed. An amazing dish, especially one that could trigger such nostalgic memories.

Fish and chips: I loved their thick steak fries--well seasoned and pairs GREAT with their house-made ketchup--trust me, this ain't no Heinz. The ketchup is AWESOME. Apparently they make all of their sauces and you really can taste the difference--the tartar sauce for the fish and chips was also very well done. The fish itself was tasty and yummy, though not our favorite (which is actually a gluten free dish located in Florida), but it still was a winning dish in our tummies.

Baby carrot side: This came with brussel sprouts and bacon lardon--I swear, bacon makes EVERYTHING taste good. This dish was simple and nice as far as veggies go, though I would have liked it cooked a minute or two more to get an even softer bite for the carrots. Still, not a bad side...though I might opt to try another side next time.

Forest mushroom with frisee: It's literally shrooms and frisee. Granted, the frisee is very lightly dressed--just the way I like it and very fresh. The shrooms are delicious and well cooked...but that's really all you should expect. Nothing else fancy thrown in there.

Overall, I really want to come back, say hi to our wonderful waitress, and to try their other goodies. Everything looks amazing...I've been to all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in Vegas, and  none of them have let me down yet!",5,2,5

Well our server was excellent but that was the last staff member that was.  The hostesses are in need of training.  We were promptly seated only to be told several minutes later that there was no server on duty of that table (despite tables all around us being handled).

After a quick wait (~5 minutes), we were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant. Atmosphere was nice, and what you'd expect from a British pub. 

Server was very attentive and provided us with some recommendations\/customer favorites. We ended up ordering the Calamari to start, which had just a hint of heat and was the highlight of the night. It was a perfect share for our group, as the portion size was quite big.

For entrees, three of us ordered the Butter Chicken Curry as it was pitched as the famous dish there. All I have to say is ""yikes"". The dish came with a very small portion of basmati rice, doughy, disgusting naan and bland chicken. It was incredibly underwhelming, particularly for $28.

Between us all, we tried a number of items. After being warned off the chicken salad sandwich by our waiter, we had a couple burgers, a couple tomato soups, a chicken pot pie, an chicken curry dish - by far the best, and a ny strip steak. Rather than go through item by item, suffice to say that the food lacked seasoning, was generally overcooked, and did little to distinguish itself beyond meeting the requirements of what we ordered. 

Between the ten of us, with a couple sodas, one beer (nine bucks) and a couple glasses of wine, the total came to three hundred bucks. While this was not intended to be a ""highlight"" meal for our trip, it was still disappointing. 

Finally, I don't know what horrible thing had happened to our waiter prior to his shift, but his attitude reeked of indifference to the happiness\/satisfaction of his table.

Enormous space packed with unsuspecting diners, a cautiously daring menu, an army of impersonal wait staff buzzing to and fro, European sports on surrounding flat screens--everything about this place feels like it was washed through a series of trend spotting gastro-bots. But at least you get to wait way too long for your food, and as a special feature it's all ridiculously over priced. A pint of bass will run you ten dollars. Ten. Dollars. For a pint. Of Bass. Let that sink in. Two of us ordered fish and chips and one went with hangar steak, all served with French fries. Thirty minutes later plates arrived with luke warm, flaccid fries and serviceable proteins. The fish is substantial yet flaky and comes with a tarragon tartar which is a nice touch, but the whole thing lacks any kind of contrast in flavor or texture. Hangar steak was cooked properly, end of story. Hardly deserving its thirty dollar price tag. The table shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert, which I have read much about. Moist cake, small scoop of generic vanilla ice cream, and standard warm toffee--enjoyable, but unexceptional. Overall, the ""pub"" fails miserably for how much it promises yet doesn't even attempt to deliver. More proof of the inherent evils of scaling ever upward.

Of course, it doesn't come anywhere close to Ramsey's original gastropubs, the Devonshire in Chiswick and the Narrow in Limehouse, London but that's not unexpected.

The menu is a delightful mix of classic British pub favorites and simple seasonal dishes seasoned with a sense of humor; so, if you expect to find fine or upscale dining, you'll likely be disappointed. While the service is an odd mix of attitude, amateurishness, and friendliness, we did enjoy the large selection on tap and some very decent food. I found it silly that they won't let you sub a side dish on a $60 prix-fix that features ordinary dishes from the regular menu but life's too short to worry about that. Also, I'm not a fan of casual restaurants where there's no salt and pepper on the table - even though I'm very unlikely to actually salt my food, I'd like to have the option should I ever wish to do so. This practice has nothing to do with the food or the guests, it's all about the chef's ego. On the bright side, I found it very comforting to have European soccer on and enjoyed some kick-ass music playing. 

All in all, be open minded, come to Ramsay's Pub & Grill, don't expect a fine dining experience but rather enjoy a decent casual dinner, have a pint and have a laugh. Also, give yourself a break and stop imagining what GR would or wouldn't do if he were there for you might find you actually enjoy the experience for what it is.

For years we watched Gordon Ramsay sweep into a restaurant, point out the inadequacies of the food and staff, whip everyone into shape and leave the owners and patrons happy.

Two salmon dishes came out first and by the time the other two dishes came out, the salmon was cold. Gone are the days when the server knows who ordered what, now it's like an auction. At this price point, with only 4 diners the food should arrive at the same time and the server should be able to figure out the orders. One member of our group ordered the shepherds pie, it was very hot around the edges but really cold in the middle. This is one of Ramsay's signature dishes and it should have come to the table properly cooked. We sat in a booth and the seats were too low for the table, which was uncomfortable. The white wine glasses were very small, not conducive to enjoying the wine...I felt like a child seated at the big table and given a kids glass of wine.

They send you a text when your table is ready which was better than having to sit around and wait or carry a pager, so we were able to play some slots while we waited.

The atmosphere is a little different, you feel more like you are in someone's house for dinner rather than a restaurant, it's a little odd, but it works. Something I have noticed in Gordon Ramsay's restaurants is that the servers all seem a little, under dressed, but our server was attentive and knew all about the menu.

We tried the pretzel bread that came before the meal and the cheese sauce it came with was great. A nice blend of cheese and spice, it really worked. We ordered the Shepard's pie and the mac and cheese which was not on the dinner menu, but if you ask for it, you can have it. Both dishes were delicious! My husband said it was the best Shepard's pie he ever had and the mac and cheese was amazing! It was creamy and had many levels of flavor, definitely the most complex mac and cheese that I had ever eaten. Also, don't be fooled by what appear to be small portion sizes, they are actually quite filling.

For dessert we had to try the much talked about sticky toffee pudding and it did not disappoint. The cake was warm and soft, paired perfectly with creamy ice cream and caramel. It was enough to share for two people.

The service overall wasn't quick, but it wasn't bad either. The couple behind us were waiting for their food when we got there and still didn't have it when we were done.

We chose the Pub because they had Shepard's Pie and also because it wasn't too fancy. 

The restaurant is located inside the Caesar's Palace casino right next to the Forum Shops and the Colosseum. I loved the decor as it really transported you to Great Britain. Our server was great and was quick and friendly. I ordered the Steak and Ale pie and my boyfriend had the Shepard's Pie- we shared a side of Green Beans. Everything was great! The flavors in my dish grew as I continued eating and though the portion doesn't look like much, I was stuffed!! We were so full but our server highly recommended the Sticky Toffee Bread Pudding, which was their specialty and since we were on vacation, we couldn't turn it down. It was delicious! It sounds super sweet, but it actually wasn't. I would definitely recommend it.

Common Gordon - whip these underling's butts into shape - please.

We started with the lobster-rolls for 21 bucks - for 2 small ones. And when I say SMALL --- they were essential common dinner rolls with a tablespoon of so-so lobster salad (or should I lobstery say celery salad) on top (not even in it). This would have been one of my grunge snacks in college when I was going to school in Boston, using left-overs from my dad's dinner visit the night before, and some hamburger bun from the pantry. Gordon! GORDON!

The best dish I had was the pea soup with crème fresh - a little watery but tasty. At least tasty in light of things.

My companion and I had hoped that things would go up from here - however - the truffle fries were oily, mushy and Luke warm (obviously left under a heat lamp for too long) ... the fish was over cooked and the breading fell off too easily (obviously under the same heat lamp no doubt). ... and the minted mashed peas were cold (I was really looking forward to these too).

Total bill for all this (a couple of appetizers and one main course to split) was around a hundred bucks.

SAD

Luckily I Bitched loudly - and the very nice manager gave me a discount on the bill, and a free dessert (a really tasty sticky toffee pudding - the best thing that we had here). So come here for dessert and get the pudding: it is served at room temperature and comes out of a big common pan - so no immediate cook-prep required. The theory - like in the army - keep things simple.

When I went to the bathroom (not because of the food) I noticed that there are hundreds of seats here - many of them full - and the food rushes out quickly to them all - so obviously the kitchen prepares their dishes more like TGI Friday's rather than Gordon Ramsay Steak: fast and finished quickly. But at TGI Friday' you get what you pay for.... and at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill: YOU DON'T.",11,11,6

I immediately asked her if we could be seated at a bigger table but she said that they had a limited waitstaff because they were closing in 45 minutes. OK, fine, I figured I could make it work. But no, the table was just way too small. I wish I had taken a picture of it because it was half the size of the other tables around us.

Our waiter, Chris, came by and introduced himself to us. I asked him right away if there's anything he could do about our table situation. He said he would have to ask the hostess. He came back right away and said we could move to a bigger table. THANK YOU, CHRIS!!!  BTW, the area where we were seated was kinda dark but I was happy for a bigger table.

My boyfriend and I both ordered the Shepard's Pie. He really enjoyed his but I thought it was kinda bland. It did not have much taste to it at all.

This review's a bit long, but trust me, it really hits its stride around paragraph eight.

My girlfriend and I wandered into the restaurant on Saturday, March 7th, lured in by a sign at the entrance advertising some pretty appealing happy hour deals. The deals were so enticing that we failed to notice the not-so-fine print indicating happy hour only occurred M-F. Oh well. 

We approached the host stand and were immediately greeted warmly by Randy Goldich, who we came to find out later is Bar Manager for GRP&G. Randy was a great host and was incredibly accommodating upon learning that my girlfriend was not only vegetarian, but also allergic to wheat. He brought us a gluten-free menu and even gave us happy hour pricing on our Angry Orchard cider\/Fireball shot combos (also known as Angry Balls...you gotta try). And that's where things started to fall apart...

I ordered the fish and chips, and the GF ordered the vegetarian blah blah whatever sandwich with gluten free bread. The food didn't arrive until the Angry Balls had already done a number on us, so we were ravenous. As I stuffed my face with fish I couldn't help but notice that my GF's gluten-free bread looked remarkably like...bread. We called our waitress Nini over, and she was incredibly apologetic and immediately took the sandwich back to the kitchen.

As we waited for the sandwich to be fixed, two more ciders were mistakenly delivered to our table (not a complaint), and suddenly it felt like we were in a rotating restaurant. But boy did we make friends with all the staff! We met waiter Marvin, who recently won Caesars employee of the year, and yukked it up with Tom Tom (or was it Ray Ray?), their award winning mixologist. We were practically falling off our stools by the time the replacement sandwich came, but it finally did: a beautiful vegetarian, gluten-free sandwich wrapped in lettuce and filled with...chicken.

By this time I was forced to relinquish my own hand-cut fries (apparently they call them ""chips"" in Vegas) due to the girlfriend's voracious state, and the potatoes did a good enough job of soaking up the fermented apple juice that we were ready to call it an afternoon. Randy was apparently tied up in the kitchen, so manager Michelle came by the table and let us know that our meal was free. She also sent us off with the correct order in a to-go container, 2 1\/2 hours after we had initially arrived for a light lunch.

Less than an hour after leaving the restaurant, I received a call on my cell phone from Randy, who apologized profusely and invited us back for dinner the following night as his guests. I was initially shocked as to how Randy had gotten my number, but then the GF reminded me of my tendency to hand out business cards to everyone I talk to after imbibing a few cocktails.

To say we were shocked at his offer would be an understatement. We're not high-rollers; we're not even the lint in Dean Martin's belly button. But if there was anything that we learned after chatting with our boy Randy, it's that the man takes a genuine vested interest in his customers' happiness. It's not about Yelp reviews or who can tip the most; it's about making every guest feel like they had a remarkable experience. It's an old-school approach to service and building customer relationships that seems to be lost on so many that work in hospitality nowadays. So obviously, we took him up on his offer for dinner.

We returned at 9:30 the following evening and came to figure out that even though Randy's scheduled shift had ended several hours earlier, he made it a point to stay until we were seated and served the meals we ordered. He put us under the tender loving care of waiter Roger, and introduced us to season 12 winner of Hell's Kitchen Scott Commings, who can whip up a meatless wedge salad like you wouldn't believe. Even after we declined dessert, Roger still brought us every single gluten-free dessert option on the menu! It turns out that vanilla ice cream was really the only option that fit the criteria, but we were impressed nonetheless.

After two experiences in two days with GRP&G, I was left with two very distinct lasting impressions: 1) Randy Goldich is a pretty incredible guy, and he and his staff will apparently do whatever it takes to make their guests happy, and 2) this is definitely the most awesome thing that has ever come from dating a gluten-free vegetarian. Because of our experience, we actively look forward to visiting Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill next time we visit Las Vegas.",1,2,2

We waited a minute or two and then proceeded to the table where our friends were.  They were the only occupied table in the restaurant.  There were a few guests at the bar.  Our friends  had put in an order for some appetizers and drinks for themselves before we arrived.  A server brought water to our table but said he could not take our order as he was not our waiter.  Eventually a waiter came and took our drink order and to make a long story short, that was the last time we saw him at our table.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to come with anything but it did not happen. To pass the uncomfortable time, my husband and I walked to the poker room thinking that when we got back our order would be on the table.  It wasn't.  My husband went up to the bar to place the order with the bartender instead.  BIG mistake.  The bartender rolled his eyes and made it clear that this was an imposition.  We ended up canceling our order and asked to speak to the manager.  He was less interested and as rude as the bartender.  Gordon Ramsay has a reputation for perfection.

It also brought back a bar set very high when it comes to food, service, atmosphere and everything that you should expect when dining in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. 
We had a 2pm reservation for fellow Elite Allison's birthday. She went with lunch for the group because it could be quite spendy depending on what you get. Well worth it for a celebration in my opinion. 
Between our group we had fish and chips, lobster mac and cheese, scallops, the pot pie trio, and a couple burgers. Also, deviled eggs, pretzel bread, and Caesar salad for starters. I was lucky enough to try the majority of this stuff, and what stood out the most was: 1. The scallops. Not even a scallop fan but these melted like butter in your mouth. I would think Chef Ramsay was standing over the cook calling him a bloody donkey to make sure they were correct. 2. The lobster mac. HUGE chunks of lobster and a cheese that didn't overtake the flavor, but wasn't too bland either. 3. The deviled eggs. You stuff them yourself, and they have bacon. Need I say more? 
Everything was delicious and I would order everything again. That says a lot. 
The negatives, not much but they should have complimentary bread. When a burger cost $20-25, you could start with a little something. 2. The service was EH. Our first initial guy Chris, was great. But he left mid lunch and our next guy wasn't nearly as attentive or funny. He did not seem to enjoy his job as much. I wish we had have given the tip to Chris before he bounced, he earned it. The hostess were also a little snooty. Like hello, you are pretty, you're working for a famous chef, and you get to wear a cute dress to work- SMILE it won't hurt.

The stew portion was very rich very condensed, but fine enough.  As a meal it failed, there was nothing to offset the sticky congealing potatoes and stew.  I felt like I was eating a stick of butter seasoned with potatoes.

In short in an effort to make a stand out shephards pie, Gordon and his crew have grossly over done it.

Gordon, go back to the UK tour some pubs and try some pie,  there are plenty them serving much better fare.  Sure some nasty pubs serve your idea  of shephards pie, but many serve pies that don't leave you feeling like you just ate a pound of butter.",0,0,0

As a Celiac I am always in search of SAFE dining experiences.  Boy was I ever HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED with both the service and the menu.  I was told by the hostess that they did indeed have a gluten free menu, however when I asked for the GF menu at the table I was told the gluten free menu was ""not up to date"" -- which in short meant ""non-existent"".  Food that should be ""clean and free of gluten"" had added gluten (the shrimp for shrimp cocktails is poached in beer).  The waiter pointed out in a snarky manner that I could eat ""most"" of the beef (steak) selections and salad; his attitude was visible wth slumped shoulders and short, snippy sentences.  Not one single chicken item was a safe choice.  I finally just stood up and said I could eat Salad ANYWHERE.  I left and I will not be back although I stay at Caesars 4-5 times per year. The waiter finally realized when I stood up that I was angry and I did make my comments heard by the surrounding tables.  I don't think Gordon Ramsay realizes that Celiacs AND THEIR FAMILIES will not dine where it is not safe for the entire family to eat.  We went directly to Mesa Grill where I was treated with respect and offered many appealing GF food items.  The chef and manager assured me in person that they knew what they were doing.  And the food was scrumptious.  

Bad, bad, bad experience--Celiacs and gluten sensitive folks beware of Gordon Ramsay establishments.",1,0,0

My steak was cooked perfectly and was melt in your mouth tender. It came with 4 stalks of asparagus, which were also cooked well.  The lobster mac and cheese, however, was the high point - eating it was a spiritual experience! My sister raved about her dish as well.

As HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans we had the goal of visiting all 4 of the Gordon Ramsay Vegas restaurants (Steak, Pub, Burgr, and Fish and Chips). Friday afternoon we chose to start our GR Tour of Vegas at the Pub and Grill. Upon arrival we were immediately greeted and seated. Within a few min we were introduced to our server Joe. For anyone reading this, please ask to sit in Joe's section. His friendliness, and knowledge of the menu was refreshing. He was able to make some suggestions that sounded amazing, however after seeing the nachos Gordon Ramsay posted on his Instagram we couldn't help but give them a try, and boy are we glad we did! They are out of this world! In addition to the nachos we enjoyed a chicken pesto sandwich. While the flavor was amazing I almost cracked a tooth about half way through on a chicken bone. I discreetly brought this to Joe's attention so he could give the chef a heads up for future sandwiches. What was impressive, is where most servers acknowledge and nothing ever comes of it, he immediately spoke to his manager Derek who came over to apologize and even went as far as offering us a dessert. To think I almost left needing dental work, but still feel compelled to give a 5 star rating should tell you how great Joe and Derek were! They both truly understand the meaning of customer service and I hope someone at the Gordon Ramsay Group reads this to provide them with the recognition they deserve!

Not that there is a lot of leeway on a small piece of ground meat, but the sliders were medium well or well done. Waitress didn't ask, so I would assume they'd come medium...no such luck. I mentioned this to the waitress, and she replied that she would ""tell the chef"". That was the end of the subject. No offer to take it back and refire, take it off the check or at least apologize. FAIL. 

The caesar salad was good, but drowning in dressing. Ordered without the anchovies, and it came with them, as I found out by accident when I ate them. FAIL. 

Joined the Caesar's loyalty club to save a couple bucks too, and they didn't apply correct pricing on the check. FAIL. After pointing this out, they finally corrected the bill.

Out the door, $35 for less than a quarter pound of burger with cheese and a caesar dressing salad with lettuce. Pretty embarassing, IMHO.

That said, this visit I sat at the bar and enjoyed Ray Ray the bartender's regular, but not obtrusive check ins. He personally checked the kitchen when the man's burger next to me was delayed. And by delayed, I mean free extra wine bc it was a long time and the kitchen refused to serve less than well-executed food.

I again, ordered the fish and chips. It's a pub and I wanted pub food. The fish was tasty, crunchy, slightly salty (in a good way), hot, flaky, moist, and HUGE. Plus, it was light and not greasy, beckoning additional bite after bite. and when my paced slowed, a little tangy, salty, texture-pleasing tartar sauce propelled me to finish every last bite.

So what no bread service at lunch. Not a deal breaker here and Ray did ask if we wanted dinner menus.

The chips were thicker, square fries, with crispy edges and hot, soft potato inside. The Parmesan and seasoning blend were delights and almost rendered the ketchup unnecessary. My husband finished his and started helping me on my portion.

My last time here I wondered why oh why, mushy peas? Now, these peas still retain enough texture to have some bite. They taste fresh. The savory, almost umami-like taste kept me going back bite after bite.

His pork belly sandwich delighted the palate with a nice blend of bitter, soft, crunchy, wet, sweet, and heat. He did request extra horseradish sauce but only offered me a single bite bc it was that good. He says he would order it again, and add a crispy or cheesy element. Still a hit in our books!

Best part, Ray-Ray excellences advised in a more-British tasting beer, and delivered my husband a Guinness and Dunn from Scotland. It perfectly complemented his sandwich.

Her onion soup and my tomato salad show up at about 8:40, along with the complimentary bread.  The soup and salad were outstanding.  We drink our beers, and talk, and wait, and wait, and wait and wait.  The waiter came by at 9:20, the only time he came by, to offer his apologize saying the kitchen was backed up due to large groups and our food was up next.  (My problem why?)  That was interesting considering the side of the restaurant we were on was half empty.  He did not offer to refill our nearly empty beers or water too.  At 9:45, I was ready to leave, but low and behold, our waiter reappears with our food.  My wife and I both ordered the Mix Fillet, with Yukon gold potatoes and sautéed mushrooms as the sides.  Well, the steak was lukewarm, the pork was room temperature, and the mushrooms were room temperature and the egg on top was not fully cooked.  But the potatoes were good and so were the two shrimp that come with the mixed fillet.  My wife and I were both ticked, asked a bus boy and another waitress to see the manger, who shows up 10 minutes later.  Mark the manager offers us a free desert, which we decline and I ask for the bill, letting him know this was the worst dining experience we have had in Las Vegas and will be telling all of our guest, friends, family, and coworkers about it.  He offers to comp us a dinner and asks if we want to make that reservation now.  We flatly say no; I don't want to waste another attempt at a meal at this place given all the great places to eat in Las Vegas.

The only cons in my opinion were 1) the price of beer, which is typical of restaurants in the casinos on the strip and 2) being seated right beside other patrons lacked privacy and was not seemingly necessary.

Gordon wouldn't be satisfied with the service I received either.
Nice theme in the restaurant and I know working in a themed environment could probably get old at times but the entire staff just seemed uninterested in their work.
I don't think it was an isolated incident either because last time the food was great but the service was bad 
this time food and service were just alright.

I can only muster the kindness to give this restaurant two stars.  I must admit, that were my rating based solely on my latest dining experience there, I would give the restaurant three stars, and, had I based my review solely on my first dining experience there, I would have given four stars.  I'm sure that you will ask, ""How does the average of 3 and 4 equal two?""  The answer: disappointment.

This will sound silly, but bear with me.  The reason I returned to P&G after my first visit is also the reason I will not return: potatoes.  Specifically, two potato dishes: the Potato Puree and the Pub Fries.  These were not ordinary mashed potatoes and French fries.  These were a demonstration of what a potato can taste  like if a fine-dining approach is taken when preparing ordinary dishes.  Every now and again you taste a dish and experience it for the first time all over again.  Such was my experience with the fries and mashed potatoes at P&G.  They made me feel that, as a foodstuff, potatoes have much more potential that I had previously imagined.  

The key to their french fries was the cooking technique: thick-cut potato planks, steamed, then lightly coated in seasoned flour, then deep-fried, then baked.  The result:  a hearty potato plank with a crispy outer crust that created the perfect seal to keep steam inside.  When you cut into them, you discovered a steamy, flaky potato meat.  These fries did not need any condiments whatsoever, and highlighted how good a potato can taste if treated properly 

The mashed potatoes had a beautiful flavor.  The fluffy peaks of this dish were topped off with a drizzle of a chive infused olive oil that exploded in your mouth, filling your entire palette with the aroma of garden-fresh chives.  The key to this explosion was temperature of the potatoes: served piping hot.

On my second visit, I ordered these two side dishes again.  This time, the Pub Fries were plain, old french fries, and slightly soggy at that.  The mashed potatoes were a salty, gluey concoction that someone had tried to repair by thinning it out with copious amounts of cream and butter.  They were served cold.  

Other highlights of the evening: arrived at 7:15pm and checked in for my 7:15pm reservation.  The hostess forgot to check me in, and when I made eye-contact with her every time she seated a walk-in customer before me, she quickly looked away and left the podium.  I approached a different hostess and was seated right away.  I ordered the seared scallops: scallops were seared on one side only. They were served in a bland seafood broth, with carrots, and artichoke hearts.  Not flavorful at all.  I ordered an espresso with dessert and it arrived cold.  The chocolate mousse trifle was sensational, though.

At any rate, I believe that what happened to this restaurant is not  so much carelessness on the part of its founder or staff.  It is a reaction to the caliber of the customer.  I spoke to the manager about the food, and he admitted that they had to change some recipes because their customers did not see the value in waiting extra time for french fries to be cooked three ways or for mashed potatoes to be prepared to order.  So, they have turned from their fine-dining philosophy to a food-mill philosophy: crank out orders.

And that is where the disappointment lies.  P&G once provided a fine-dining take on British pub fare.  It now caters to the lowest common denominator and provides tourists a place to grab a quick bite and gain some bragging rights: ""I went to Vegas and ate at Gordon Ramsay's.  You know?  That guy from TV?""

Sadly, the Gordon Ramsay on TV is no longer anywhere to be found at P&G.  The Gordon Ramsay on TV preaches fine ingredients,  food prepared to perfection, good seasoning, good service, consistency, and, above all, passion and pride.  Where is the pride to be found when you don't stand by your food, and, instead, you cut corners to ramp up production.

Sorry, that's not fine-dining.  That's a factory.  I'll gladly drop $20 at Applebee's for factory food.  Not $200 at Gordon Ramsay's.",8,0,2

Being that it was our wedding anniversary, my wife and i decided to try out the Pub and Grill. It was not up to par from what I expected it to be. I will start off with the server. First of all, he was not very friendly and I felt the attention was not there. Took 15 minutes to come back and ask us what we would like to order after he brought our drinks, considering there were only 2 other customers he was tending to. Once we received our meal I asked for a second beer, he replied he would get that for me..10 minutes later, I reminded him about my beer, his answer ""yes I know, I need to go get it"" Really? I am dropping at least $100 for our meal and you answer me like that? The burger was good but not excellent for being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.

The cheese deep looked like it just came out of the microwave and the mustard from the bottle. Not a very good start. The burger did not impress either. The meat, while very juicy, had no flavor, and I mean NONE. The fries are run of the mill.  I have had much, much better food at a local Red Robin, and it didn't cost me $36!!!!!!

I can't comment on the dishes here, but the ""Nachos"" we ordered were out of this world. I actually thought they were actual corn nachos, but they were in fact kettle fried potato chips (English style I guess) with a sour cream sauce, melted cheddar cheese, and red chillies on top.

I came for lunch and was seated right away. Again great service. Very attentive server. Explains to me everything about the pub, and drinks they have as well as the food. Now I'm a big Chef Ramsey fan and I've seen his dishes at the pub on his shows that he did in Europe and I was extremely excited to finally get to try it. 

I had his signature Shepard's pie. OMG! Amazing! The beef and lamb stew with the creamy potato layer on top was fantastic. The meet was very very tender and had so much flavor. I also tried his signature fish and chips. By far the best fish and chips I've had! Big tender flaky fish fried to perfection with a light crispy batter. The crunch on the outside was great. The batter was thin and lots of fish on the inside! Amazing! The fries were just as good. Any time you get fresh cut fries it's always good! For dessert again I got his signature sticky toffee pudding. This one is similar to his steak restaurant. Served hot but with out the brown butter ice cream like the the steakhouse restaurant. Came with a vanilla ice cream.

I must also say that we have very forgiving natures when it comes to restaurants, and that neither of us are food snobs; we simply like good food, whether it's from a proper gastro-pub or from a fine restaurant. This of course was neither. 

I ordered the little sliders (I forget already what they called them, having all day tried to repress the memories). I don't mind paying good money for good food or for good quantities. These sliders fit none of those descriptions. Each was as small as a silver dollar, greasier than anything from a proper pub, and to be quite honest flavourless save for the strong garlic butter the came with. A ""plate"" of three of them cost 14 dollars. The ""chips"" were greasier than a fast food place, were not crisp, and flavourless to match the sliders. These little greese-bars were nine dollars alone. 

My charming companion tried the shepherd's pie. Being the verbally generous thing she is, she could only say that the dish wasn't terrible. A 22 dollar bowl of tripe is not what you'd expect from a fancy chef's establishment. Having tasted the pie myself, I could not be so forgiving in my description as her, nor could I really come up with something intelligent and so instead made, I think, an awkward face upon tasting it. 

The one thing I will say was pleasant was the service. The hostess was very friendly, and the server was rather attentive and pleasant. This, combined with the fact we were terribly hungry when we arrived, was the only thing stopping us from walking out. 

Again, I must point out that I am not snobbish when it comes to food. This place was terrible for cheap food, let alone for something this expensive. In our time at Vegas, I have eaten fantastic burgers at ""I Heart Burger"", ""The Grand Lux Cafe"", and KGB (Kerry's Gourmet Burgers"" . . . Each of these phenomenal burgers were cheaper than my tiny little sliders and had flavors I cannot even describe. If you feel the need for a good burger, I would recommend any of those. 

I feel I must end this review on a positive remark . . . their little symbol of the Union Flag within an English Bulldog was cute.",2,0,2

Good was absolutely mediocre. I ordered the two mini burger side and fries (I have small portion size) and my boyfriend ordered chicken sandwich with kettle chips. My mini bacon cheeseburgers were a joke. The picture will show their ridiculous use of ingredients. I paid extra for that bacon. I get that it's a mini cheeseburger, but I think it deserved more cheese and bacon than that. The fries were soggy and not great at all. I had to dunk them in aioli to get decent flavor.

The quality of food rarely ever meets the expectation that comes with the famous talking head promoting it. Gordon Ramsay demands quality on screens worldwide, but when it comes to his restaurants you get what you pay for. High quality does necessarily not trickle down from the mega-bucks eateries these celebrity chefs own.  

After a decent wait - because these hot spots are always packed - my gf & I took a seat in the back. We were here at an odd hour late in the day, so we decided to just get a couple drinks and split some appetizers. That ""couple of drinks"" became one when we checked the menu and noticed each signature cocktail was $15 a pop. Now, yes, I know I could've just had something else but where's the fun in that? Still, there's no way in hell I'm going to try getting drunk on $15 drinks. I ordered a Pub Crawl, which was bourbon whiskey with ginger liqueur, lemon, and mint & black tea syrup. Tasted great, would've loved a few more... but not at that price. 

For the apps, we decided on a Scotch egg and the pot pie sampler, which included mini versions of their steak, chicken, and shepherd's pie. 

The Scotch egg was killer. I've had this exactly twice before in my life - the first time was very good, the second time it was two burnt lumps of sausage surrounding a medium-boiled egg. This blew both of those away. I would assume if they can make a Scotch egg great anywhere, it's going to be here. 

Now, the pot pie sampler shows up and it's tiny. Really tiny. Tyrion Lannister's little mitts would make these pies look small, and in my hands they looked like silver dollars. At $24 (which is $8\/each), you'd think the serving size would be double. Too bad, because the steak pie was delicious. Chicken pot pie is chicken pot pie, and this tasted like any other chicken pot pie. But the shepherd's pie was kinda rank. It smelled like dirty gym socks and didn't taste much better. WTF? I've had great shepherd's pie before and this was not even close. Lame. 

We grabbed the bill at this point and - HOLY SHIT - $72 and I'm not even full or drunk?!? I don't even have a mild buzz, and I'm already asking my gf where to eat next. If you feel like blowing twice that, go for dinner. Me, I'd rather fill up somewhere else just as good; a place that won't charge me for a fancy name.",2,2,1

I was so eager to eat at a celebrity restaurant, that we waited about 1\/2 for a table.  When we sat down, we had no silverware at the table and it took forever for the busperson to bring us silverware.  Turns out that the busperson that was cleaning the tables was upset at the waiter and I can see why.  He was the most jabber jaw, impersonal server that I have ever met.  Kept asking us personal questions and wouldn't let up until I stopped answering his questions.  His constant talking was making me very uncomfortable.

When he finally came around to taking our order, my girlfriend ordered a coffee along with dessert, an Apple & Rhubarb crumble while I ordered a tall Sierra Nevada and a Grilled Beef Burger, 9oz, cooked medium with Applewood bacon and fries.  My girlfriends dessert came before the coffee and my beer came when he, the server, brought the coffee to the table 5 minutes later.  After waiting 20 minutes, I finally got my burger.  It seems that there was something missing.  I took a bite out of it and it was good, but it turns out that the burger was not cooked to my order.  It was cooked medium rare, not medium as I requested.  Plus there was no bacon.

When the server came back to the table to see how things were, I told him that the burger was not cooked to what I had requested and that the bacon was not on the burger.  He took it back and said that he will get the chef to grill up a new one for me.  Now, a 9oz burger take approximately 4-5 minutes cooking time per side (depending on the fire temperature) to come out medium.  I got my burger in 4 minutes.  It seems that the burger that I received, less the bacon (again), was sitting on the serving table already and was not cooked medium, but more like medium well.  Yes, i do know the difference between ""Medium Rare"", ""Medium"" and ""Medium Well"". 

Well, since I was hungry and it felt useless talking to the server, I took a bite and told him it was OK.  I knew that it was not cooked fresh, but I wasn't about ready to wait 1 hour for a burger that I considered was not good.  Believe it or not, it also lacked seasoning.  At one point later on, I bit down on something in the burger and it turned out to be a bone.  Luckily I didn't chip a tooth.

I immediately stopped eating it and pushed it aside.  I was very disappointed.  The manager came to the table and I told him what happened and he didn't seem interested in wanting to correct the problem that I had.  So, I assumed that he would, but when we got the check, all the orders were on it and nothing was comped.  So much for excellent customer service from management.

I walked out of the place very disappointed.  I told my girlfriend how much Gordon Ramsay hates it when people return food from restaurants that he is helping in ""Kitchen Nightmares"", so I wonder how he would react when he learns that patrons are returning food from his own establishment.  Maybe someday, he'll read this review.

Overall, I give the following for overall performance:

I'm glad to have been proven wrong at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill in Caesar's Palace.

My friend and I were in there at around 2:00 on a Sunday.  The place was hoppin', but we found a couple of seats at the bar and were promptly greeted by a really friendly bartender.  I asked him a few questions about the beer selection, describing the flavor profiles that I like.  He brought me several samples and was able to speak knowledgeably about the vast array of beers on offer.  I know it's kind of lame, but in the end I decided to stick with Peroni.  Hey, it was 109 degrees out, I had just walked all over creation, and I wanted something on the lighter but flavorful side.  

My friend had a couple of mojitos, prepared by the same bartender.  She said they were amazing.

We both ordered the burger.  My friend ordered hers medium and I ordered mine medium well.  Both were cooked to perfection.  We both opted for the cheese and bacon toppings (because you just kind of have to, right?).  We both had gruyere.  It was melted, nutty, aromatic, and delicious.  The bacon, while thick, was still very crispy, and richly maple flavored.  It was a delicious meal with layer upon layer of fantastic flavors.  

My friend ordered dessert (some rhubarb tart) and she said it was delicious.  

My meal (burger, fries, two imperial pints) put me back $40.  Not bad at all.

Beer selection was out of this world. So many unique cool things to try. Menu was very different from anywhere else in town. 

Decor is VERY VERY COOL! Very Modern British PUB!

It seemed to me to be simply a very special place that is going to bud into an elite restaurant over this next year, being that it just opened. 

I've read some of the other reviews and find some of them quite funny. I don't know about you, but I don't go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant for the Coke? Or the pepper for that matter. LOL. 

The hostesses Maria and Karen, were sweet, one took the info and the other pleasantly showed me to the bar.

 I ate the Beef Cheek and Short Rib Sandwich. Hands down the best sandwich I have ever eaten at a restaurant. So tender it melted in my mouth. Good flavors and sauces. It was obviously carefully created by a top chef. The fries were ginormous, but it was fun for a change. Even fry addicts like me enjoy a variation once in a while. 

The service was great. Gene took really good care of me. He got my order right away despite having a near full bar. Food came out very fast. Gene seemed sincerely interested in giving me a great experience and frequently checked back. To ask how I liked it. He was quick with the beers and had a smile the whole time. 

The bar did seem a bit messy through-out. Piles of napkins and crumbs and what not. But not a big turn off but would expect it to be cleaner. 

A manager did stop by (Eva.. Evie..Eve) to kindly check up to make sure everything was good. It was nice because I did not expect it sitting at the bar. 

I plan to come back frequently to this place. Seems like a good spot to hang out. Prices all seemed reasonable to me. I will gladly pay more for better product (duh!).

We went to the pub last week for a nice, relaxing dinner. The restaurant was packed for a good reason, so we weren't able to get a reservation until 10:30PM. The reason why I was willing to wait was because when I went to the hostess stand and asked if they had a gluten free menu, the hostess pulled it out and it was full of GF happines. A pub with a gluten free menu? I never thought this was possible! Oh, but it was, and oh was it amazing.

We ordered their house chardonnay in a carafe. Very reasonably priced and went perfectly with all three of our dishes. It was a strong chardonnay, and I didn't want to stop drinking it.

We started off with the cauliflower soup with curry oil. I am very sensitive about curry. Curry is powerful and if used incorrectly, it can devastate or illuminate a dish. Since we shared the soup they split it into two bowls, no extra fee. The first sip? MIND BLOWING. The soup wasn't soup; it was so light and airy that it was actually like a foam. The curry brought a subtle smokiness to the dish and with the little saltiness from the bacon and sweetness of the caramelized onion, this became one of our top 3 soups. EVER.

Then we ordered their salmon and pork belly as entrees, both which are naturally gluten free. The salmon skin was like a potato chip and the salmon was cooked to perfection. Not too raw in the center and perfectly soft and flaky all throughout. The cream sauce was subtle, not heavy and not overwhelming so that salmon was still the star of the dish. It went beautifully with the mushrooms and other garnishing vegetables. 

My husband got the pork belly, the star of the night. Neither of us have ever had pork belly before, and I am now spoiled on pork belly and have very little hope that any restaurant will beat Ramsay's because this pork belly, even with all the fat, melted in my mouth and did not make me ill with greasiness. It was pork butter, and I could have eaten the entire dish had my husband not devour it before me. This pork belly was perfectly cooked and the sauce underneath was not rich was I LOVED because there is only so much my palette I can take before going into to overload. There is too much for me to say about this pork belly, so to avoid the novel, just eat it. You cannot go wrong. Also, grab a side of chips with fried truffle. Best chips my husband has had in the U.S.

Service was phenomenal, manager stopped by to see how we liked dinner, the environment and rhythm of the restaurant was smooth, sexy and upbeat and there is truly nothing I did not like about our experience here. We will absolutely go back VERY, very soon.

Mmmm,...pork butter...

It tastes so fresh and delicious I could just eat a plethora and not get tired of eating here.

 I had the braised pork belly. It was so soft, tender and juicy that I wanted more. The seasoning used on this was really delicious.

The pretzel was decent nothing out of this world. (and that all I have to say about that)

Entrees didn't disappoint either. The fish in the Yorkshire ale batter fish and chips were tender and flaky with a crispy, light exterior that provided a nice contrast.

The first time for lunch. as I approached the podium 4 women were talking and it took about 5 seconds for one of them who all had seen me approach them to ask can I help you.  Well yes you can I am hear for lunch okay lets seat him at table #, no put him at table are you kidding I was the only one in the restaurant at 11:45 others were eating in the bar.
I order the corned beef sandwich and the waiter Scott informed me that he would have to check to see if the bread is available. Scott returned and said you are in luck the bread is available, ""why should I be in luck for an item listed on the menu"". I wish the bread was not available and that I could have chosen something else, the bread was so soggy from being placed on the flat top to toast the bread that the sandwich fell apart.  I had to eat the sandwich with a fork.  Also the ends of the bread were so hard it was not a pleasant experience.

I returned to the restaurant again to give it a second chance. Normally I would not return but since it was located in the hotel I was staying at I decided to return.  It was dinner time and again I was disappointed. I sat at the bar this time to make the hostess job easy for them again 4 women standing at the podium. I witnessed the following from the bartender and others. The bartender after politely taking my order returned to the kitchen and returned with a cup of water melon as he ate it he did not was his hands that he used to stick it in his mouth. He also drank water from a huge water bottle at the bar. If that was not enough he continually checked his phone. As I waited for my food another employee stopped at the bar and informed the servers that the glass washer was not working. Some how he turned the conversation into I did not break the washer I washer I break hearts. Well this went on for a while and something I did not want to hear about after a long day sitting in a seminar.

Well not the food came and again it was very greasy, I order a burger and should be juicy but not to the point that the bun fell apart. I do not mind spending my hard earned money but $37 with a tip for a glass of Stella that was not cold and cheeseburger with fries is crazy. I also paid $35 for lunch which was below my expectations for the Great Gordon establishment.

There was a 15-20 min wait to get in, no big deal, & compared to the 2 hr Bacchanal wait this seemed super minor. Our server (Ricardo I think?) did a great job, was personable, offered great advice, & was knowledgeable of the menu. Zero complaints there. Ambiance was fine, comfy chairs, TVs conveniently placed for sports, with kind of a modern British pub feel\/layout.

We started off with the Devilishly Deviled Eggs, which are served with the deviled yolks in a separate bowl, and are amazing.  Super great flavor on the deviled yolks (is that bacon I taste??), great consistency, and an easy way to get some yolk with every bite. Next up were the Welsh Rarebit ham sandwich, and the Short Rib & Cheek sandwich.  Both had excellent flavor, were served hot, and were of more than adequate size.  My gf preferred her short rib\/cheek sandwich, while I preferred the taste of the ham\/rarebit cheese sauce, but we agreed both were very good.  We subbed out our fries for the mashed potatoes, and neither of us were disappointed.  I also got an imperial pint of Boddingtons, took maybe 7-10 minutes to be delivered (only real service delay), but was frosty cold when it arrived.  

We had no issues with waiting for food, service in general, or anything else that several reviewers have mentioned.  I guess this place might struggle for service consistency based on crowd load, and dinner sounds like it is the worst time for issues, but for lunch time, British pub-style comfort food (read: super when hungover), this place completely hit the spot!",3,0,0

Appetizers:
1\/2 dozen Lolli-pop chicken wings $12
Scotch Egg $11

Entrees:
Chopped salad $16
12 oz Grilled Ribeye $39
12 oz grilled NY Strip $37

Sides:
Forest Mushrooms $11
Sauteed Brussel Sprouts $11

Dessert:
Sticky Toffee Pudding $11

Drink
Innis & Gunn $8

This meal was probably one of the best meals I've had in vegas. The scotch egg appetizer was pretty good with a nice bbq sauce and it came with marinated vegas. The chicken wings were not actually wings but drumettes. The sauce was AMAZING! It tasted like a honey, bbq, sweet chili, and hot sauce all in one. This is probably the appetizer I've in vegas. I would have to put this in my top appetizer list with Carson Kitchen's Bacon Jam. 

Now to the entrees. My wife said her salad was good with a lot of texture going on with the chicken, chickpeas, avocados, shrimp, etc. My ribeye was perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium. I liked how there were 3 sauces you could choose from (i forgot the names) but the one I got tasted like an au jus. My uncle said his strip was great and he got a gravy looking sauce. The sides were great too. The pork belly that was sautéed with the brussel sprouts were melt in you mouth...so bad yet so good.

The sticky toffee pudding is Gordon Ramsay's signature dessert. That too was WINNAHS! (excuse my Hawaiian accent). It came with a toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream. It didn't taste as sweet as I thought it would be. I was so curious to know why that i actually researched it afterwards and found out that this dessert is made with dates and brown sugar. 

My uncle and I also tried the Innis $ Gunn beer. Our waiter, John, said its Gordon Ramsay's favorite beer. We both thought it was very smooth with a nice foam on top. It paired well with our meal.

Overal, I would definitely come back again. The ambience was great and we were lucky enough to sit next to the tvs. Kudos to our waiter John for the great service.

The decor in the place is pretty unique for this pub & grill. Nicely done. Since it was a busy week, the restaurant is integrated with OpenTable so you can reserve a table without calling in and waiting. 

Food wise, I ordered their lamb burger - medium well. It was nicely cooked with the center slightly pink so the burger was nice and tender. The toppings on the burger is flavourful. But the seasoning on the meat seems to be uneven. First bite it feels like it was not seasoned enough, but when I reach the end it seemed a little too salty. Expected them to mix the seasoning in the meat evenly considering it is Ramsy's restaurant. 

Service was a little slow but that might have been due to the CES volume of people.

The beet salad -- I ended up biting down on something hard that almost chipped my tooth see picture -- it was either a hard pine nut or something however not roasted nor edible I thought I was eating something other then a salad. Also the ridicule salad part ( mix with arugula ) was very sandy or harder then normal. However the beet part and the goat cheese part along with the dressing was nice. 


The order was beer battered fish -- cough 29.00$ I shure Gordon you don't offer that price in your England restaurants. was good 

My dad got a medium temp burger that was done on the rarer side - witch put him off . however ingredients mixed nicely. 

Mine well -- ( ale pie ) the filling was amazing however I was thinking it would be more like the shepherds pie with piped mashed potatoes like Gordon Ramsey always to have tips on his other then his hair lol. But the filling aspect was great however the mashed made it feel more like a meat chicken pot pie taste .. ( dont get me wrong it was good I am not shure the topping is wright. ) 

Spotted dc ( yes I abbreviated it ) lol . was great -- I know they stress on that.

I've always heard so much about Chef Ramsey and his food but boy, was I disappointed this time around. I had the NY Steak with a side of the Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes. My steak was chewy, hard to cut, and burnt on the outside. However, the inside was fine. Maybe if I had cut off the exterior entirely then I would've enjoyed it better. The mashed potatoes were bland. I guess that's good if you're sharing at a table of people with different taste buds - it gives you the choice to season it more on your own.

We had a reservation for 6pm on Wednesday but on arrival had to stand in line with people without reservations and had to wait to be seated by one of the 3 greeters.......these were young women who seemed to enjoy social chatter between themselves rather than helping the customer
Our waiter was average and showed no interest in the fact we were returning customers. Our fish and chips arrived quickly, but as mentioned by others the fish was soggy (certainly no where close to crispy batter) and the chips were similar...portions seemed smaller than before and the food served was simply unacceptable for the cost.
we only drank soda and as a result our waiter vanished and only returned with the bill. In my opinion the restaurant was not clean and my wife was surprised ( not in a good way) to find the ladies bathroom out of order
we will not be returning but do rec you try Burgr ( That's how it's spelt) for a good GR experience.....this is vastly superior in every area and surprisingly cheaper....a winning combination for us",0,0,0

Upon our return for additional drinks, we had the opportunity to meet & thank Chef Ramsay for a great experience. 

Saving the best for last... I will say that our bartender, Brandon, was beyond friendly, insightful, attentive, and gracious. He truly made time to make us feel welcome despite how busy he was.

Scallops - they were cooked decently, but surprised by how tasteless and bland they were
Mashed Potatoes - Very tasty and very lumpy, but in a charming way
Lobster Mac & Cheese - Not as tasty as I was hoping. Was even more disappointed when I CHOKED ON PIECES OF LOBSTER SHELL in my food.

I did notify the server about the shells who then spoke with one of her bosses not more than 5 feet from me who said they didn't shuck the lobster from the shell, but that it comes pre-done. Now there are 2 things that really bother me about this situation: 1) I paid $27 for Lobster Mac & Cheese and it appears that quality is not a priority for this restaurant. 2) The manager didn't even take the time to come and apologize to me.

(I think the waiter had tables scattered all over the place and not in one vicinity).  The food was a little pricey but I loved the display of the food, originality, and atmosphere.  From my experience, almost everything in Vegas is pricey (even more than NYC) unless you grab a burger from McDonalds.   

The drink and dessert menu was on an Ipad and gave you descriptions of the drink cocktails.  I got a drink that I can't remember the name but it had Guinness Cream, Boddingtons Ale, Jack Daniels Honey and something else...but all I know it was fantastic and I never drink Jack Daniels anything!  The cocktails were $15 each.  My bf got corned beef in a bread bowl that actually looked good (I never eat corn beef). I got the hamburger which was $19, with bacon would have been $23. All the french fries are 4 huge pieces of potato with a garlic seasoning that come with the meals.  

I was told Ramsay had checked in the day before with the restaurant and I saw the head chef walking around.  PLENTY of seats, right in the middle of Caesar's.  It's definitely worth checking out and having a more casual meal than a fancy one in LV.

I got the English beer sampler, four 4-ounce mini ""pints"" of beer, while my wife got a glass of house chardonnay. We were happy with both choices.

I started with the lobster rolls and my wife got the Caesar salad. The lobster rolls were subtly dressed and tasty, but two rolls the size of my fist for $18 seemed overpriced. The salad, on the other hand, was generously portioned; I wish the dressing had a more pronounced anchovy flavor, but it was very good (comparable to Macaroni Grill's dressing).

The main course blew us away. I got the The Dublin Corned Beef Brisket Sandwich, which looks like a standard fair reuben, but is better in every way from what you'd normally expect, from the bread to the quality of the meat to the phenomenal cucumber aioli. My wife got the Scottish Salmon, and I asked her why she was eating it so slowly. She told me that it was so delicious that she wanted to savor every bite.

The only misstep was the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which we got because we kept hearing how great it was. I really wish the server hadn't poured the insanely sweet toffee syrup over the top of it as part of the presentation. The tiny parts of the bread pudding that weren't soaked in the syrup were sweet and nicely balanced. Unfortunately, the sweetness of the syrup was so bad we couldn't eat more than a small nibble before having to take several gulps of coffee just to wash it down.

Briefly: The shepherd's pie was excellent, and my wife devoured her lamb burger with much love. We think the real highlights were the starters and desserts, though; the ""Pub Spots"" (sliders) were phenomenal, and we think well worth the price. We ordered 3 desserts to share (though it turned out to be too much by that point in the meal, and we left a little at the table) and while all were bliss-worthy treats, the sticky toffee pudding was the standout favorite (and the only one entirely finished).

A bit pricey, but more affordable for us than, say, Gordon Ramsay Steak and (we think) worth it. The service we received (it was relatively early; we arrived around 5:30PM for dinner) was excellent, and we never felt we were waiting long for anything--and there was always someone to hand to take a plate or refill a drink or whatever was needed. 

After watching Ramsay on TV for a few years, it was nice to be able to see that he really does run (or at least put his name on) well-run restaurants with great food and service. We probably won't return, but it'll be because we've saved up for Steak, next time we want to do Ramsay in Vegas!",2,0,1

Worst service I've encountered in a long time and I could have ate better food at a bar. First off there was 5 of us and the hostess said 30 minutes. 15 minutes later I went up and told her it will only be 4 people now so she said ok it will be 20 minutes more. My other friend came up to her at the 20 minute mark and said are we next it's 4 people and she said oh it's only 4 people okay give us 10 minutes. Finally, we got sat to a 7 top table and we said there's only 4 of us and she said oh opps sorry and we asked for a smaller table so we could actually communicate instead of yelling across from each other at the table. We ordered are appetizers and we got everything but our pretzels. It took 20 minutes for them to send out the pretzels. We ordered alcohol and one of the beers was not what we ordered and we wanted chilled glasses. It took another 20 minutes to get it and glasses weren't chilled. 45 minutes later we get our entrees and their luke warm not hot. I've never had such bad service of such plain jane food. Our server seemed lost but he was nice and actually admitted that he didn't provide great service but I give him credit for being honest. The only positive is the manager comped our meal and that was very kind of her. Hopefully they will work out the tweaks and maybe I will return since I do enjoy Gordan Ramsay steak at Paris.

This was my first time in a Ramsay restaurant and I was absolutely blown away. The decor is amazing, and the service and food is even better. 

I ordered a goodbye blue sky cocktail, which was delicious. My friend and I also ordered flat iron steaks ($39) and a side of truffle chips (i don't recall price). I've had my fair share of steaks, but this was absolutely amazing. So flavorful and the pub steak sauce made it even better.  Truffle fries were delicious as well!

I would like to give a special shoutout to our server that night, Sladjan. I noticed that a number of customers were really giving him a hard time. My friend used to be a server and even said some patrons were a bit much. Because of how busy he was, we got our drinks a bit later. However, sladjan was very professional and apologized to us promptly once he realized this. He came back to our table numerous times to make sure we were happy and doing well, and even shared some stories and jokes with us. I've never had such a pleasant experience with a server before. I'm sure he was very tired, but he never let that show. He was always smiling and very professional. When i return i will be sure to ask for him if he's working. His service was impeccable and because of him, my experience was even better than what it was before. He even took our picture with the ramsay picture, then joined us for one picture afterwards!

I'll definitely be back - great food, better service - if you haven't been here before, you should check it out. It is one of the more affordable ramsay options, but that doesn't mean it isn't as amazing as his other restaurants on the strip.",0,0,0

The first thing that struck me was how comically low the chairs are compared to the tables. My husband is 6-feet tall, and the table top lined up with his chest. I'm 5'1"" so you can imagine that I simply had to slide the food in a straight line directly from the plate to my mouth. 

We started with the Ramsay Tonic & a Moscow Mule. Both were just okay. My Moscow Mule tasted mostly of lime, and my husband didn't even finish his drink. The calamari was also just okay. It wasn't crispy, almost chewy, although it was seasoned well. And they served it with tartar sauce and ketchup. Ketchup...? 

Husband ordered the Fish & Chips, and I got the Braised Short Rib. The chips (or wedge fries) that came with his were seriously under-seasoned and slightly under-cooked. My Short Rib was the highlight--it nearly melted apart before my fork even touched it. The potato purée was tasty & smooth. Small sad face: the three carrots were still raw. Then came the Sticky Toffee Pudding. We've been obsessed with it ever since our first visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak. This one tasted great, but it didn't have the same sticky consistency I love about the one you can get at Steak. This was more like a cake.

The least desirable part of the whole experience was the service. The hostess was cold and didn't even look at me. However, the hostess assistant that sat us was friendly and engaging. Our server was fine but insincere. When he came to take our entree order, he just approached the table and stood there looking at us expectantly. I had to say, ""I think we're ready to order,"" just to break the awkward silence. Again, he was fine; I wouldn't classify it as rude. Just not attentive or warm.

Overall, we had a decent experience. Looking back, I would rather have spent our 7-year anniversary and hard earned money at Steak again because the pricing is nearly the same, and the experience at Steak is significantly better.",1,1,0

I was here for my birthday dinner, and was very excited to spend my birthday eating here. The evening got off to a very slow start by the poor service we received from the waiter. It took us about 15-20 minutes to even get the waiter over to the table to get our drink order (which was only an iced tea and a Diet Pepsi). 

Once we placed that order, and our food order at the same time, the waiting began. The food actually came out rather quickly...we decided on the fish and chips. Unfortunately, when we received the food, the french fries were damp and soggy, not sure if it was moisture from the fish or what, but we sent the food back because who wants to eat damp, wet french fries? By this point, we still didn't even have our drinks yet.

Finally the second batch of food came out, and although there was less moisture on the fries, they were still damp and not very good. We finally received our drinks, from this point on, we never saw our waiter again. Never came back to check on us, never offered refills, and therefore, we never offered a tip.

I understand that sometimes things happen, like a new cook who can't quite get the food right, being too busy, etc. However, the bad food, coupled with a waiter who didn't seem to care, have left a bad taste in our mouth and we won't be back to this pub.

The restaurant is unique with very interesting decor. From the table settings to the ambience, I can see chef Ramsay written all over it. We had their lobster rolls for the appetizers and ordered the chicken pot pie and the corned beef and brisket sandwich to share for our entrees. The sandwich was VERY good and flavorful. It is one of those messy eating sandwiches, but totally worth it to try. The chicken pot pie was really good as well, filled with chicken, kale, and other vegetables. the dough was nice and crisp, yet moist on the inside. The lobster roll had a lot of flavor in it as well with good chunks of lobster, but you can't taste the oceany lobster flavor as much because of other flavors.

The male servers still don what I'll always refer to as ""Hipster Lederhosen."" Some things don't change, but second impressions can certainly make up for a bitter first. Round 2: the food, service, the entire experience surpassed my expectations.

Appetizer - Calamari (not on the Restaurant Week menu): Perfectly breaded and fried, but chewy,

First Course - Appetizer - Chopped Salad: Lightly dressed, this had strips of salami, slices of chicken, shrimp, apples, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese -- held off on the chickpeas. Not a bad way to begin a three-course meal.

Second Course - Entree - Pan Seared Scottish Salmon: A solid piece of fish that was light and flaky. The caramelized cauliflower and herbed salad were delicious. I was concerned that the lemon fennel puree was going to have a strong fennel flavor, but fortunately it didn't.

Third Course - Dessert  - Sticky Toffee Pudding: This was my first time trying sticky toffee pudding, so I can't make any comparisons. All I can say is that it was an incredibly sweet dessert when the ice cream, moist cake, and caramel sauce are combined. 

Service - Terrific.

It did lead to some great conversation about if we though we could get away with stealing the Ipad...but, with 4 of us at the table, and only 1 Ipad, it was a rush job to look thru the 100+ beers separate onto different web pages by category.  In the interest of time, I just picked an old, well known favorite vs. something rare or reading up and trying something new.

...and finally, what killed the experience...the serving size.  Upon looking at all the dinners as they came out, my initial though was, 'they know we did not order of the kiddie menu, right?'  While my lamb chops were great, there was only 4 lil chops for a serious price.  By contrast, Firefly, a well known local tapas restaurant, offers a $10 tapas plate with 2-3 pieces, and while maybe not as awesomely seasoned, it's still very good over there.  My Irish buddy got the Sheppards pie, and while he admitted it might be better than what momma made him...the size of it was seriously laughable.  I was not surprised when I heard he picked up more to eat.

As for that drink Ipad...Our best idea was to list it on Craigslist and sell it for cheap for immediate cash only, with an exchange in the bathroom, and quickly paying the tab in cash...and defiantly not returning to Caesars on this trip.  I'm just saying, if you ever see it on craigslist, don't go buy an Ipad from a guy in the mens room of Ramsay's Pub & Grill, it might some other guy with a clever but flawed idea.",1,1,0

My son who is 12 years old is a huge Gordon Ramsey fan.  So we decided to eat at one of Ramsey's restaurants and we were deeply disappointed. 

The food here was okay.  My son appreciates food and loves to cook. He ordered the short ribs. My husband ordered the recommended fish and chips.  For the price it was descent but  would never order again.  Please see attached picture.  2 pieces of fish. You would think the presentation would be better at a Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.  My other son and myself ordered the burger.  bland bland bland..  nothing special.  
My son said the short ribs were okay ..  he has had better.  

We do not mind spending the money when it is a great or even a good dining experience and tasty food.  This was disappointing not only for the parents but for my sons!! We spent approximately $150.00 on lunch and we were still hungry.   We didn't order the desert. I was afraid it would be horrible. 

A tip for the restaurant - you need to assign less tables to a waitress or put more staff.  For a restaurant like Gordon Ramsey's we expect that waters are to be immediately refilled and the waitress to check up on a table not only when he\/she  takes the order but throughout the experience.  I had to flag her down to ask for more ketchup and tarter sauce. A customer doesn't need to flag a waitress down. 

Although we still left a tip because my husband is generous, I wanted to leave zero.  

Unfortunately, we won't be back- not sure if we will eat at another Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.  Disappointing that's all I can say.",0,0,0

I'm mildly obsessed with Gordon.  I watch everything of his that I'm able to, having access to only what's on Netflix and Hulu, so when I saw that he opened a pub here, I jumped at the chance to go...especially since its a lot more affordable than the steak house. (still dying to try that one.)

For starters, we had the Warm Salty Pretzels, with the beer cheddar and mustard spreads.  These were absolutely delicious.  Good thing we split them between four people, because I could have filled up on those alone.  

We each got a sandwich\/burger each:
Welsh Rarebit Ham Sandwich:  I hate ham.  I really do.  But I wanted to try a bite of this sandwich so that I could say that I was brave and ate ham JUST because it was at a GR restaurant.  It was reallly good.  Open faced sandwich with lots of flavor.  My only complaint is that my first bite fell into my beer. :(  that was totally my fault though. lol

Pub Lamb Burger:  The menu gives you the option of feta or goats cheese.  My friend opted for the goats cheese, and I think this is the perfect decision.  The lamb burger was just a touch on the dry side, so the feta might have taken away from the taste of the burger.  With the goats cheese, it was flavorful and pretty good.  I'd order it, but like it a little less well done.  

Pub Beef Burger:  This is the one I got.  Of course, I added the applewood smoked bacon. (duh.)  I loved it.  I thought it was the best tasting meal of the group.  Not only that, but the beer that I chose (Lucky Buddha) went with the burger perfectly.  It was a good size, very juicy, and perfectly cooked.  

I'm kind of ashamed to say right now that I might have gone too long in writing this review to remember the fourth sandwich.  I could have SWORN that my friend had a corned beef sandwich, but I'm not seeing it anywhere on the menu.  So it might have been the beef cheek one, but I'm not going to review because I don't recall.  Whatever it was, it was really flavorful. :D

I loved how the sandwiches were all served with REAL chips...they were perfect as well.  Not a single one was over cooked, and they were't super greasy either.

I will definitely be going back, and hope to save room to try the sticky toffee pudding next time.  

The staff was awesome, and I love the decor.  We were seated at a ""coffee table"" type setting with two love seats.  It was right in the middle of the restaurant, where I could watch the football matches in the other room (real football, not American.) :D  

I felt that the price was good for the quality of the food.  4 of us ate AND drank for about $100.  Not too shabby.  

Hm.  Maybe I'll go back this weekend... ;)  Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm getting hungry again. :D",0,1,0

I had never had fish and chips that good before!

After today, though, I don't know where I'd get those fish and chips again :( I went in today not knowing that just about 4 weeks ago, they changed the menu around and some of the recipes (I asked the waiters\/waitresses about it). The fish, which before were perfectly sized, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth goodness, was now giant, thick slabs that were dry and overcooked. The batter, which used to be crispy but flaky to the touch, were now thick and hard. The fries, which used to be thick but crunchy, were now dry and burnt-tasting.

I did have other dishes, but nothing that was better than average. The majority of the dishes I ordered last time were no longer on the menu after the menu change, so nothing to compare (those other dishes were GREAT the first time I visited, though!).

The waiters\/waitresses were quite nice though. To be fair, the place probably deserves a 2\/5 stars now, but after that overwhelmingly disappointing decision to change the recipes and menu so drastically, I had to give this 1\/5...I'm so sad.",0,0,0

We started with a calamari appetizer, and it was as good as calamari gets.  We had recently watched an episode of Kitchen Disasters where Ramsay was brutal on the chef that made greasy calamari, but this plate was perfect.

I followed that with the classic - fish and chips - and it was also as good as it gets.  My wife had the chicken Caesar salad, and was not disappointed.

Two thumbs down to our server whom, at times, made us feel like we weren't even there. He was so inattentive and disregarding - I'd like to say I forgot his name, but the dude didn't even introduce himself. He seemed focused on other people, giving the feeling of someone looking through you as if you ceased to exist. 

A mixed thumb up for their Beer Braised Short Ribs. Unreasonably priced and it wasn't as tender as one would expect - The flavor screamed & howled, 'Puuub'.. And rightfully so, 'cause we were in one. Nothing exciting here, it seemed to lack flavor all together. A tad chewy and bland would describe this dish best. What WAS good was the potato puree. It lasted all of 1 minute as did the vegetables which were just okay.  

Two thumbs down for the Crispy Calamari. It was more soggy and flimsy than crispy, which is disappointing when you want that snap and crunch. The fresh dill tartar sauce was actually tasty, just wish we had something other than the calamari to dip in it! 

Shared a wedge salad that was straightforward. They didn't overdose the thing with blue cheese nor vinaigrette and were rather generous w\/ the bacon. Fresh bites of this wedge salad overpowered the emotional depressant disguised as the Beer Braised Short Ribs. Sad, a salad won us over and it wasn't all that!

I came here expecting good pub food, and good service, after all that's what Mr Ramsay demands of others. 

We had a party of 10, and called at 8pm on a Thursday night, they couldn't fit us in until 9.45pm. OK so they're busy - a good sign I thought. We arrived at the appointed time, and there were about 20 people lined up for tables. Our table was ready so we went straight in.

Service was terrible! We struggled to get the attention of a waiter to order drinks, and food. Drinks were slow to come to the table (maybe within 30 mins of sitting down), and the food took over an hour and 15mins to arrive! They got some of the orders wrong too. The place was not full, almost empty by the time we got our food.

Within 5 minutes of our food arriving (by then 11.10pm) they turned the lights down, and down, all the way to almost complete darkness. We were eating in the dark! The waiters were using their iPhones flashlight just to see where they were going. We asked a passing waiter to turn the lights back on, he said he would have to ask his manager - eventually they turned them up a bit.

The food was hit and miss. Fish and Chips - great fish, light fluffy batter, but disappointing chips - giant slabs of potato that were not crunchy or flavorful. It came with ""house made tomato sauce"" which tasted *exactly* like Heinz Ketchup.

Kind of a disappointment. The beer, wine, and overall drink selection was nothing special. Average, at best. The food was just OK and definitely not worth the price.

Service was just okay. The staff was friendly, but slow and hard to flag down. We constantly felt like we were waiting. Waiting for drink orders, waiting for drinks, waiting for food orders, waiting for other drink orders, waiting for drinks we ordered that never showed up, and waiting for dessert. It was ridiculous.

I had a shot at a few beers, scallops, short rib, scotch egg, steak, and of course the sticky toffee.

The scallops were abysmal. I've paid half the cost and received twice as many, better prepared. Two people ordered scallops at our table and both orders were bad. They were so sandy that it felt like I threw a handful of sand in my mouth and started chewing. One order seemed overcooked. Would not have this again at this restaurant.

The short rib, while tender, seemed lackluster in flavor. As with the scallops, I have had much more flavorful short rib for a fraction of the price elsewhere. I would not order this again at this restaurant.

The steak was nothing special, honestly, and I felt was about twice as costly as necessary for what it was.

The scotch egg was actually very good. Probably one of the better\/best scotch eggs I've had. I would order this again.

The sticky toffee was great, and I would order it again. One of the best desserts I have ever had.

It had some on it when it came and the server stated that it wasn't supposed to be like that so he took it back.  This would have been fine, however, somehow my meal got ""lost"" due to our server needing to wait on a table that had a language barrier.

The fries are sooo good. I ordered a side since I got an appetizer and it was a huge side for one person. Keep that in mind...you can share. 

I requested Sara when I came back because she was so friendly! On my second visit I tried the Steak Cheek sandwich ($18) because the pictures on here looked yummy. It was completely different than anything I would normally order but it was very good. I would recommend putting some of their ""special mustard"" on it. It has horseradish and adds a nice taste.

For dessert I ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was absolutely delicious! It comes with caramel on the side...the more you add, the better it is.  This is a must!

My only complaint is $4 for a soda. I should be used to this by now but it just doesn't make sense why restaurants on the strip charge so much for soda when the food is already marked up.",1,0,0

They don't give you any bread, which for the price of basically $30 a plate I expected some. I got the salmon cooked ""medium"", but when it came, it was not only half the size of my palm but it was also raw. I felt like I was eating sushi. Not worth the price tag at all. My mom got a hamburger cooked ""well done"", but when it came, it was bloody and raw. When she sent it back, it came seared on the outside with the inside exactly the same. It was still raw and bloody. She sent it back a second time and told them not to bring it back. My brother got the scallops that were so flavorless he named it the worst he ever had. My dad's chicken was okay, but the mash potatoes he paid 11+ for were completely flavorless. 

The only halfway decent thing I had was some French fries that were supposed to be truffle fries but only had salt on them..... Couldn't properly enjoy them though because both my and my mothers ketchup had strange black pieces of god knows what in them.

We were a party of five and we immediately got seated in a beautiful set round table. The whole place has a very British vibe which isn't surprising considering the man who opened it. It felt very comfortable and intimate which I truly loved!

Our server 's name was Sarah and I really have to say she took the experience from a four star to a truly exceptional one! She was knowledgable about both the menu and the specialty drinks. She was so friendly and bubbly and she really went above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing time and that's something I can't praise enough! She made excellent drink recommendations which I am so glad I took! Because of her I tried the most decadent Strawberry Beer! Something I've never had the pleasure of trying. It was presented in a champagne glass and it was not only delicious but visually stunning!

We started with quite a few appetizers; Warm Pretzels, Calamari, Truffle Fries, And Lobster Rolls. ( Don't judge there were five of us and we all shared!)

All the apps were very tasty but the definite stand out were the Lobster Rolls! Big juicy pieces of tender lobster wonderfully paired with a beautiful sauce and some small bits of cucumber for a nice crunch!

For our main dishes two of us got the Brisket Sandwich and the other two of us got the Lamb Burgers.

The Brisket Sandwich was absolutely delicious and absolutely huge!! Like two hands, jaw unhinged huge! I ended up taking my other half home! My fiancé really loved the Lamb Burger, I sadly didn't get to taste it because I'm not the biggest fan of Blue Cheese, but both the guys finished theirs in a matter of minutes so it must have been tasty! I really like that all our entrees came with fries. I hate when everything is super pricey and al a carte. This really felt like you got what you paid for.

Lastly we got two orders of the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Please order this. I know you might be so full and you don't think you can make it one more bite but I promise you will be sorry if you don't!

Gordon Ramsay definitely did not disappoint! I can't wait to try some of his other restraints in Vegas!",13,9,12

So we were extremely excited to try his place out! The high prices didn't bother us and the food choices were different. I had the lobster mac-n-cheese and my fiance had the shepherd's pie.. well my mac-n-cheese was very mediocre it was a bland gritty cheese sauce (I can make a better sauce at home) and the few pieces of lobster sitting on top tasted like they have been sitting in an ice tub in the fridge. Come on Gordon I know you can do better. Infuse the cheese sauce with lobster or something.. $24 for a cup of cafeteria mac-n-cheese with some defrosted lobster bits on top.. Now for the shepherd's pie. My fiance got violently ill the next day! FOOD POISONING! Never in all the years that we have vacationed anywhere (several times in vegas) has anything like this happened. The day we were suppose to leave to go home and he can't stop.... we'll you know no need to be graphic. He was so bad that we had to stay an extra night in vegas cause he couldn't be in a moving car. An extra night in vegas is not great when you are taking care of a very ill person.

My aunt decided to visit me in sin city this past weekend and this was the first restaurant on her list that she wanted to try.  We arrived at about 3 on a Saturday afternoon and there was only about a 10 minutes wait.  We were seated by the very sweet host.   We were seated on the side near the walkway

Truffle Chips - They are huge!!  They are about 1in x 1in x 3in.  I heard they are boiled, baked, and deep fried to give it that wonderful consistency.  The Truffle Chips are special because they drizzle it with wonderful scrumptious truffle oil and top it off with truffle shavings.  There are also two dipping sauces one tomato based and the other has a creamier consistency

Pub Lamb Burger - This burger comes with a good sized lamb patty that is cooked to order.  Topped with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes.  It was wonderful!  You also get a side of their giant chips.  If you are a beer drinker I recommend pairing it with a bottle of Delirium :)

I took off one star because of the tight seating situation.  My aunt and I were seated near the edge of the restaurant and we could barely get in and out of seats.  I'm not sure if all parts of the restaurant are like this, but it was pretty uncomfortable.

I really enjoyed my experience (minus the seating issue).  I can see myself coming back in the future if I have more visitors, but I will be sure to try and sit in a different section. 

TIP: 
I recommend parking at the self parking near the Forum.  Once you come off the elevators turn right and you will run right into the Pub & Grill

It's really not conducive to locals visiting restaurants on the strip as we now pay for parking (we did valet) and still seems strip restaurants don't care about locals business. 

We went early on 12\/21\/16 at 530pm were sat right away and waiter came over with a bottle of water to fill out glasses. 

I have never seen a bottle just explode and come apart like this one did, I had water all over my leg and shirt and the table was flooded. Luckily the waiter did not get sliced. 

We were moved to another table as the floor was also soaked. Waiter apologized about five times and so did the lady assisting him. We saw them talking to the manager as well after. 

Food was very good we both had the Hell's Kitchen burger and truffle fries with one drink each. Service was spot on throughout and food was a solid four. 

What is amazing is the manager never bothered to come over and you would think one drink would be comped but nothing at all. Absolutely no customer service from the manager. I had cold water all over me and granted it was just water but we had to move tables and nothing was done by the manager. 

Honestly there is no reason to drive and pay for parking to get better service closer to home by places that want locals business. 

Gordon Ramsey really needs to get better management here, we had issues the first time we came and it seems management is the weak part of this operation. 

Food and waiter were very good so if you are close it's worth it but it's really not worth driving as a local when our business is not appreciated by management. 

Updated review from April 1 2017

Absolutely fantastic experience all around. We were seated promptly at our reservation and the food and service were terrific. I forgot our waitresses name but she was one of the best we have ever had anywhere. She made a terrific beer recommendation as well as the Prime rib special which was perfect. My wife had the Hells Kitchen burger and it is great. It is obvious management is trying very hard to get things right and it shows. We will be back again soon. We could find no fault with anything and you have to have the sticky toffee pudding for dessert trust me on this. 

I can honestly say this was one of the few Strip restaurants that made locals feel welcome. As I said it is obvious that management is working really hard and the issues we had in the past have been fixed.",1,0,0

Certainly he has become quite the star by informing chefs and restauranteurs in no uncertain terms why their food or dining establishment falls short of his professed high standards. So naturally on a recent visit to caesers I felt drawn to his namesake pub, to see how it was living up to those standards. 
I must sadly report that it fell way short. We were there for a happy hour so got to sample a variety of items, and not one of them was in any way noteworthy. I recall a dry as bones slider, a pastry wrapped ""toad in the hole"" sausage that can be best described as insipid, some very ordinary ""chips,"" or fries as we deem them west of the pond, and a few items than even now, just a few days later, have already faded from my gastro memory. 
Perhaps an earlier yelper was correct in stating that Ramsay himself should get in here and start yelling at people, but until he does I suggest you limit your patronage here to a couple of pints.",2,1,2

Unfortunately, the food was horrible. I got the chopped salad and it tasted like something you can get prepackaged at a hospital cafeteria. The lettuce was not fresh-it was wilted under a great deal of dressing. There was one piece of shrimp and 3 cubes of chicken. The meat was definitely not freshly grilled. The croutons were a disappointment as well (all three of them). The salad looked like it was made a week ago. I didn't finish it. And what's worse is how expensive the meal was.

So.. For our last night in Vegas we decided to try here.

After a 15 minute wait we were seated and ordered from our lovely server Jennifer. We ordered the mini burgers (6\/10) and lollipop chicken for starters. They both came out super quick (within a few minutes) and while the burgers were ok the bone on my chicken was a bit cold which was strange.. I should have taken that as a hint as I bit into my chicken and realised it had a bloody raw taste and when i spat it out.. I looked down to discover that it was indeed raw.. My poor partner had eaten 3 pieces and thought they tasted weird but did not want to spit them out and after looking over at my raw chicken leg, he really wished he had..

Another server brought our mains over in record time also and we showed him the raw chicken for which he was immediately apologetic and said he would speak to the chef and manager.

Our mains we had the New York Strip Steak (7\/10) and the Lamb stew shepherds pie. (7\/10) Both were good but it was quite difficult to truly enjoy our meals after being so worried eating raw chicken.. I could not wash that taste out of mouth no matter how many gulps of red wine I had! 

The server returned to inform us that the chicken would be removed from our bill (I think this is the least they could do because most likely.. We will both be sick on our 14 hour flight back to australia) and apologised once again.

Dessert was the sticky toffee pudding (8\/10) and the salted caramel sundae (8\/10). Both were delicious.

Unfortunately it was pretty difficult to recover from serving us raw chicken lollipops. The both of us including 2 pints of cider and a 250ml Pinot noir was $140 plus tips. 

So will we be coming back? No.. That's a 2\/2 fail rate for Gordon Ramsay's restaurant... Such a shame.",4,0,0

My friend nearly cracked her tooth on a piece of shell from the roll. I kept encountering small bits of shells in the lobster mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was meh. It was overly salty, watery, and not cheesy. The lobster in it was dry and tasted fishy. I had made a much better Costco take home mac n cheese for $10 that fed 15 people a week prior.  I tried the shepherd pie and it was ok....watery but not bad. I told our waiter about the shells and he seemed offended that I was complaining about my friend almost CRACKING\/SPLITTING her tooth from eating a small roll. I had only finished half my mac n cheese so I wanted to take it home to add my own cheese and recreate the entire dish. No point in wasting food when there are starving kids in the world. The server ended up throwing out my food. I assumed he was going to box it up since he asked us if we wanted to box up our food and we said yes, turns out he was only directly addressing two people and unfortunately in our group of 6, I was not one of them. He did offer to remake my food (of course begrudgingly and offended that we were inconveniencing him with the shell-bit food that he accidentally threw out).

The mad Russian had Mule's Hind Leg and I chose Goodbye Blue Sky. Both drinks were good and refreshing.
For food, we had a classic bar menu taste in our mouths and ordered Nachos, deviled eggs, and Fish and Chips. The food came out hot and was well presented. The order of nachos was large and the fish was well cooked. No complaints about either the food or the service.
All told, it was a good experience and we wouldn't shy away from coming back. Prices are a little steep, even for Vegas. $30 for fish and chips.... I don't mind spending money on a good meal, but let's keep it reasonable. Two drinks and bar food was $93.

When we first arrived we were seated immediately which was nice the hostess though did have some what of an attitude which was already a bad start to the experience. It took about 5 minutes then the bus boy came over and served us some waters. About another five or so minutes the waitress finally came around. She recommend appetizers and told us what entrees were the most popular which was nice she was also very friendly. 
We ordered the pigs in a blanket for the appetizer. As for the entrees I ordered the 14oz rib eye medium rare with a side of cream of spinach. My boyfriend ordered what was recommend by the waitress which was the shepherds pie, and our friend ordered the braised brisket i believe is what it was called it was also recommended.
The appetizer took probably around 30 minutes to come out, it came out about 2 min before our entrees came out. I will say the appetizer was pretty tasty it only came with 3 pieces though so one for every person. When our entrees came out the presentation was pretty good so i was excited to taste mine and everyone's at the table. My steak was cooked perfect and the flavor  was spot on no complaints on the steak. As for the cream of spinach it was okay i felt it lacked a lot of flavor. I'm not a fan of lamb but i did try the shepherds pie it was okay i definitely expected a lot better because it was so highly recommended. As for the braised beef that was probably the worst one it had absolutely no flavor almost tasted as if it was just boiled in plain water. Overall it was just a big disappointment especially for the price we paid i expect a lot better for high end food. I will say the desert we ordered i'm not sure the name but it was by far one of the best things iv ever tasted ever i would return here again only to eat that desert again it was amazing.

The decor with high ceilings and kegs stacked up.....meh, it's just alright.  The service was just fine unlike other reviewers' negative experiences, but I find some of these overly chipper servers' rehearsed theatrical presentation of the menu quite annoying.  It's fucking pub food mate....

The menu was stereotypical pub food, nothing too exciting, but I followed the recommendation from our server and I had lamb burger, medium, and wife had fish and chips.  

The food was decent, but it tasted just like I would have imagined it would taste like, nothing more, nothing less.  I've had fish and chips in many Irish and Enlish pubs, and this was fairly ordinary, which is OK with me, but $27 for fish and chips?  really?  

Lamb burger was juicy with good lamb flavor, but not anything I'd crave for anytime in the near future.  

All in all, I have to say that this place is A-ok.  Would I go back to hellish parking structure of Caesars Palace even if all of us locals know the back way from Dean Martin and pay for food that should cost 1\/2 as much?

First, the decor with all the kegs would lead you to believe that this place is a good place for beer. It is not. There's a fairly limited selection, and they are not exactly impressive beers to choose from.

We were seated at a table that I'm not sure was originally intended for dining. It was low to the ground with sofas on either side. It was incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and I had to adjust numerous times so that my legs would wake back up.

My burger wasn't bad, but had too much of a taste to it that I can't place. Maybe garlic? It kind of ruined it for me. I wished later I would have tried something else. The fries weren't exactly the greatest, either.

I'd give the restaurant three stars, but two things picked it back up for me.

First, the sticky toffee pudding was very good. I had not had it before, so I can't really give a comparison to any other sticky toffee puddings, but it was so good I was sad when it was gone.

Second, the service was very good. We didn't even know our dinner was delayed, and we got apologies from the waitress, the manager, and the person who brought out our food. Seems that there was an issue with getting it out from a ticket being closed when it shouldn't have, so they redid the entire meal. Our dessert was free as well, which was a nice touch.

This was my first trip to this 'restaurant' of yours. May I say if I wanted to feel like I wanted to be in one of your 'Kitchen Nightmare' shows this was it - at your very own restaurant. !! I am very disappointed Gordon.

 Arriving Thursday evening, four front of house lady restaurant hosts in their tight fitting 'London' dresses (just to remind you you were entering the land of british cuisine) sparring over seating arrangements on their seating\/reservation computer made for great amusement as the restaurant waiting line grew. 

Eventually getting to the front we asked whether we wanted to sit on the low tables or higher tables - we indicated lower. A few minutes later one of the other hosts took us to our higher table - we told her of what we had asked for - she seemed confused - however we told her we'd stay at the table she'd taken us to - communication a problem here ?
 
 After five to ten minutes waiting our waiter Ali D came along. A young chap who told me he had been educated at a college in Birmingham, UK and had attended business school but had come back to the States to waiter because the money was better 'waitering'. Taking my order of Shepard's Pie and a pint of Fullers he promply disappeared. Twenty five minutes passed and then the Shepard's Pie turned up.

Ali still no where in sight with the beer. The bowls for the Shepard's Pie are circa 7"" are smaller than what you think, however quality over quantity here as you are paying $23 for a tasting experience Ramsay style.  Asking this waiter about my drink - he promptly left and ten minutes later Ali turned up with the drink ! yeah ! - only 40 minutes to get a drink. !!

 Quality of the Shepard's Pie - packed with lamb and vegetables , it was not extraordinary in anyway , however what let it down considerably was the mash potato topping which was watery, singing to the fact this thing had just been microwaved - either that, or Gordon's mum had trained Gordon to make mashed potatoes this way - I think not.  

 After finishing this and waiting another ten minutes for Ali to come back, I decided to be brave and order the Sticky Toffee pudding. At this point , I had a further surprise - a bread basket appeared !! another first for me - isn't this suppose to appear at the start of the meal ? 

Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes , boy how long does it take to make this dessert ? Ali passed  us a number of times and no comment from him. Eventually I flagged down another waiter and told him I was 'pissed' and wanted to see my waiter. A few minutes later Ali turned up, telling him promply to cancel the dessert offering and get me the bill. No apologies or anything, he left the table. Bringing us the bill for, you've got it, for $122.00 !!! - instead of $32 - way to go Ali !! . 

 At this juncture, I think one of the other waiters must have summoned the attention of the evening manager Brian Ward. Brian was exemplary in apologizing
for the level of service I had received and invited me back to experience the restaurant one more time as I had a couple more days in town. He gave me his card and I thanked him for coming over to make amends. 

 Unfortunately Gordon, there are many other places in Vegas to eat and this is one restaurant of yours I shall not be returning to. This place is a disaster and I'd strongly urge you Gordon to get on the next flight here to shake things up as
this restaurant could be on the road to no where sooner than what you think.
Sorry to give you this news, but as a fellow Brit - I have to be honest.

If you want me to show your Chef there how to make Shepard's Pie - I'll gladly take the F Word challenge against him\/her and see who wins.",2,0,0

We were very pleased with Burgr at the Planet Hollywood and figured we would be equally pleased here.  Overall we really wanted to like the place but were disappointed and will not return, especially after the surreal experience towards the end of our stay.

We didn't have to wait to long to get in (30 minutes and my wife won some decent coin on the slots beforehand).  Our server was not very knowledgeable about the beer selection or other items on the menu (as we were about to find out).  My wife wanted to get a beer comparable to Stella Artois (something we could justify spending $10 on) but the server could not help us identify a similar beer since we were unfamiliar with some of the brands and figured he was.  We ended up ordering sodas and water instead.  Probably a wise choice considering the cost.

I ordered the bangers and mash and my wife ordered the onion soup and the mac and cheese.  I enjoyed the sausage links (made in-house) but felt the potatoes were a bit overdone with cream and butter.  My wife liked the onion soup but felt that there was only one tiny slice of french bread on the top and not the normal amount of bread usually served with this soup.  The taste of the mac and cheese was pretty good yet the noodles were very underdone.  They were about 3-4 minutes away from being al dente.  When my wife brought this up to our server (she has professional kitchen and culinary training), he said ""yes, the noodles are supposed to be al dente"", and that was it.  It was a weird exchange.  It was too bad the noodles were too gummy because the rest of it was pretty tasty.

I had never had rhubarb before, so my wife ordered the rhubarb cobbler from the menu.  After about 15 minutes, our server came to us and said the item had been 86'd from the menu but they were making some more ""downstairs"".  My wife (a former employee of Caesars\/Harrahs) asked about the other desserts and found that they come from the downstairs bakery that provides pastries for other eateries in the casino.  We were very disappointed with this news.  The desserts might be Ramsay's recipes or they might not be (it wasn't clear to us), but the fact that they were being mass-produced in the downstairs bakery rather than in-house upset us a little.  Nothing against the people who work in the bakery at Caesar's (they make some delicious pastry), but for a fine dining experience you would expect to get your dessert made in house at the prices being charged.  After 15 more minutes they delivered the cobbler, yet the cobbler they delivered was a peach cobbler.  She again notified our server, and this is where it got bizarre.  He argued that it was indeed rhubarb (a different kind of rhubarb at that) mixed with other fruits.  My wife was flabbergasted, as was I.  She knows the difference between a rhubarb and a peach and was offended that our server tried to convince us otherwise.  I have no experience with rhubarb myself, yet I know it is reddish-purple because I see it at the store.  I also know what a peach looks like, and it looked and tasted exactly like the fruit that was in the cobbler.  There wasn't a shred of red or purple anywhere in that cobbler, just straight up yellow.  After we left, I looked up a picture of rhubarb cobbler and it was bright red and purple.  We sent the cobbler back and they did not charge us for it.  Afterwards the manager came to us and apologized for the mix-up, yet still carried the viewpoint that it was a different kind of rhubarb.  I mean, enough already.  It was peach.  End of story.  

Long story short we wanted to like the place, but were disappointed and slightly offended that they kind of thought we were dum-dums in the great rhubarb\/peach debate.  Good thing Gordon Ramsay has a good burger place in town to fall back on.",4,2,2

My party and I were satisfied on NYE. The waitress was friendly and attentive and the food was incredible. However, my visit yesterday was mediocre at best. We had to ask twice to get out free pretzel\/bread basket and it wasn't delivered until well after we received our entrees. Also, the food was not all delivered at the same time. I ordered the fish and chips, which you would think was the fastest to make (compared to the lamb and sliders), but I had to wait three or four minutes for my dish after the others were delivered. There were no complaints about the food, but we felt neglected.

Tips:
- Make sure to make reservations on Open Table before hand
- If you have Total Rewards make sure to check the TR prices are charged on your bill. Both times I visited full price was charged. They also don't accept Ceasers TR F&B vouchers.
- I made the mistake of taking my parents here. The music was very loud, which I don't mind. However, it was difficult for my older parents to hear.
- As with most upscale restaurants, unless specified (eg Fish and Chips), the entrees don't include any sides. You have to order them separately.",4,0,0

Unfortunately, this place is dishonest in marketing. Signs everywhere in the hotel advertised happy hour Monday-Friday 2-5PM in the bar.

Just had dinner here tonight, and it was a completely awesome experience - I hardly know where to start!

THE DECOR\/AMBIANCE. Loved, loved, loved the decor, different sections\/seating areas and especially loved the bold,  colored stripes down the middle of the whole restaurant.  I'm a geek for great graphic design and this place kicked some major ass in that regard.

MENU. Not huge (2 large pages), which was totally fine by me because it tells me they are sticking with what they do best. Only 2 vegetarian options for my friend, but a few sides were vegetarian-friendly... just not called out on the menu as such.  As a carnivore, I had more than my share of choices. 

SERVICE. Everyone I spoke with (phone-for reservation) and met were very friendly and helpful. Adam Z. was our server, and he was awesome.  Adam was fun, engaging, had the menu details nailed (which greatly helped my friend pick her entree), and a real sweetheart of a guy who made our experience truly memorable.  When you go (when...  NOT if), be sure to ask for Adam Z!

Lastly, THE FOOD.  Ah the food.  Veggie Dish of the Day:  delish.  Bacon Cheeseburger:  excellent. Truffle Fries:  fantastic. (Didn't have the Fish and Chips, but the guy next to me did and they looked heavenly.)  STCKY TOFFEE PUDDING:  THE BEST FOOD (not just limited to desert) IVE EVER EATEN...  EVER!!!   No exaggeration, the sticky toffee pudding is hands down the best thing I've ever had - it's an absolute MUST-HAVE when you go.  I just finished eating and I'm stuffed, but I'm seriously already planning to go back tomorrow just for the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and the next night...

We stopped by for happy hour and started with the servers nacho recommendation.  Think midrange pub nachos with kettle chips, but kick it up a notch. The chips were flawless, cheese of good quality, meat not overcooked, and less greasy than expected. 

For drink, I tried the Moscow mule. It tasted great, but I really wanted it to come in a copper mug instead of glass. 

For main course, I tried the fish n chips. It came with two pieces of fish, wedge cut fries, and some mushy peas. For the price, I was hoping for a three piece, but the fish was well seasoned, tender, and flakey. Definitely some of the best fish n chips I've had. 

The fries were a big let down. I prefer mine crispy, while these were more on the soggy side. The mushy peas were made well, but weren't appealing to my palette.

Ordered the beef burger with bacon. The waitress even repeated it before leaving the table.

I look and no bacon and some white creamy sauce instead of bacon with chopped lettuce and cheddar.
So i call her over and ask if it's really the beef burger with bacon.
She says it looks like it but they forgot the bacon. (Put them side by side and you can easily tell by the topping that it's not).

3-4 minutes later i get a new burger with proper topping and bacon.
Cut it in half and notice it's quite pink but i did order medium instead of medium well as i figured the meat at a Gordon Ramsay should be top quality.

After a couple of bites, someone else comes to deliver my burger...yes, they sent two out !

So i eat half and only a couple of bites on the outside are good, the rest was too raw for me.
When i look into the second half of the burger you can clearly see it's very raw.

Show the waitress and she says she will talk to the manager.
A couple of minutes later i see him coming towards me but he walks by.
A minute or two later he comes over and says he went to the wrong table and started saying sorry to them about the burger, they said it was great why are you sorry ?

So he starts his i'm sorry speech and says it's on him. And asks that i try them again the next time i'm in town...right, with all the restaurants in a one mile radius, why would i bother taking the long trek into the abyss of Cesar's Palace for that ?

What a complete useless bunch ! I left a tip for the waitress, but now regret doing so, she doesn't know the difference in looks between the two meat burgers they serve ?!?

Hubby and I are not big turkey fans, so in recent years, we have taken to searching out non-traditional Thanksgiving locales.  Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay (a bit of a crush?!), his shows on t.v. and last visit loving Gordon Ramsay Burgr, hubby made dinner reservations with Open Table and we showed up at the appointed time.  Our half booth\/chair table was ready and we were sat almost immediately.

The decor and general vibe is a bit loud, a bit fun, large open area looking out into casino, with a mix of slightly different appointed areas of lighting, seating and various artwork.  The table settings were unique, including the flatware.  Service was efficient and friendly and our waiter would come back with answers to our questions without being prompted to.  

Appetizer:  4 stars for English style Nachos, delicious hot freshly cooked kettle chips with a terrific sharp English cheddar, a delicious English TP sauce and corned beef bits and tender short rib.  This could have been a 5 star contender but the chef was stingy on the meats.

Main Courses:  4 stars for Fish & Chips and 4 stars for Steak & Ale Pie. High end ingredients in both, tasty, tasty tasty. I opted out on the chips for chive truffle oil mashed potatoes and that was delicious.  The reason the 2 main courses didnt receive 5 stars are due to the fish batter could have been crispier and the steak & ale pie was a tad on the small size for a main course.

Did you save up room in your tummy?  I hope so because below was the only true worthy five stars!

Our server Kimberly knew we were extremely excited and she was very knowledgeable of everything on the menu (even though we knew exactly what he wanted because we looked at the menu so many times before going). She was extremely nice and had ties to Chicago. She was the one of the few people in the entire city of Las Vegas who did not have an attitude! lol, but she was spectacular to have around. Also, two members management were extremely attentive throughout dinner service, did not get their names but they were in suits so I can assume it could've been the GM and Assistant GM. 

Sidenote: *We were in a rush because we did not want to be late for the concert, we did not tell our server this because we also did not want to rush the experience of being at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. We ordered truffle fries as our appetizer and the 14 oz. Ribeye and the Salmon entree. The food arrived to our surprise so quickly! First the fries, then the entrees, at our table no less than 15-20 minutes cooked to PERFECTION! We both shared everything and was quite full!

Truffle Fries: truffle fries are huge in Chicago and we already knew that we loved them so we definitely wanted to give it a try, the fries were perfectly crispy and the truffle aioli was perfect! I don't usually care for the truffle aioli but this one was delicious!

14 oz Ribeye: Cooked to absolute perfection, our mouths melted, not the steak, our mouths did. That's how delicious this steak was. I've been to plenty of steakhouses before, but when I say that the quality of this beef gave it a flavor like no other paired with perfect seasoning, and seared to perfection. I wanted to cry, that's how good the steak was.

Salmon: With salmon, the trick is getting a crispy skin, a lot of times you get salmon from a restaurant that comes with an unnecessary slimy texture. Not here! I feel like I am repeating myself by saying everything was perfect, but it's been a week since I was here and I have not forgotten about it at all.

I had to tell the manager how amazing the entire experience was and he served us a English Toffee desert that was poured table side and was scrumptious!!!!! 

Chef Ramsay, OPEN A RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO! I BEG OF YOU! I personally thank you for this establishment and I 100000% recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas and to anyone who is a fan of Chef Ramsay's monopoly of cooking shows. This was definitely one of the highlights out of Vegas' amazing options and I will never forgot coming here! I couldn't have had a better eating experience!

We even got to meet Scott and take a picture with him!!!

As for the food, I had the lamb burger as the server mentioned it was one of their top sellers. I had it cooked medium rare but should have chosen medium. The patty had a mushy texture that did not appeal to me. The combination of the feta and goat cheese was probably my least favorite of that burger.

Our flight was delayed, causing my spouse and I to be about 30 minutes late for our reservation. Not a problem- they were able to seat us after a 10 minute wait.

They over charged us, and we didn't see it until we payed the bill and that's how we felt they did this cause we had a group of 7 and they thought we would not notice.  It took forever to get someone to give us attention. Management (randy)did not try to do anything to defuse the the situation. It was so bad my son got upset not only because of the charges but it was my birthday, then they called security, instead of fixing the situation they call security but then the check was still wrong and while security ( Michael) was there they agreed, the bill was wrong. The incompetent waitress was to separate the bill five guest on one check two on the other she didn't do that so what happened , they charged the bill completely for seven people with tax and  gratuities when it should've been for only five because the waitress didn't separate the bills.

Food: I got the Aline Chicken dish, the description sounded super flavourful but the dish fell flat.  Presentation was nice, when it came I was excited to try it, the chicken leg looked crispy, but it truly had no taste.  I've cooked tastier chicken myself.  The beans with parsnip as well lacked taste, so it was dry tasteless chicken on a lot of tastless beans with some chopped veggies for $29.  Not good value either.  My husband had the Sheppard's Pie, which he says was better than my dish but not amazing, $24.

Service: lacking in a sense, server did not recommend any ""most popular"" dishes, and maybe this is where the problem started because I may have ordered a so so dish to start.  What was annoying was we asked to split the bill, he forgot to, left, then started serving other ppl\/stuff and forgot about our bill, then finally came back and stood there while we were paying.   This is annoying as I would think most restaurants train their staff to not stare while you pay.

It seems like this restaurant tries to do too much with the menue, ranging from steak to burgers to sandwhiches to pub food (pies, etc.), fish n chips, etc.  Suggest they scale down the menue and focus on making what is on a condensed menue super tasty to live up to the Gordon Ramsy name.

I'll preface this review by saying I have not watched Gordon Ramsay's show, but have come to know if his rep via social media and news outlets.  Our family had dined at this location two years ago post Celine Dion show, and we looked forward to returning on our most recent Vegas vacation.

NOTE:  
Reservations made via Open Table.  Making a res proved to be good idea as the pub was quite busy when my mom and I arrived at five minutes to the hour. 

SETTING:
The restaurant is located on the casino level, LITERALLY across from the entrance to the Colosseum venue.  I'm sure one could not miss Chef Ramsay's name in bright lights (I'm sure he wouldn't have it any other way).  We checked in and briefly waited on the side for the hostess to show us to our seats.  The pub is simply decorated, and pays homage to its origins by way of a keg wall separating seating sections.  

FOOD:
Having studied the menu on the website, I knew I wanted to order the Shepard's Pie while my  mom chose the salmon.  We each ordered a cocktail as well; Goodbye Blue Sky for the lady, and the Mules Hind Leg (their version of the Moscow Mule) for myself.  I just loved the Shepard's Pie!  It was a perfectly sized portion and prepared well.  The top layer of potatoes is a bit deceiving of the dish, which is revealed brimming with filling as soon as you breach the surface.  A good dish indeed.  My mom absolutely loved her dinner entree.  She couldn't stop gushing about the salmon being prepared to her liking, as well as the numerous greens and vegetables on her plate.  

SERVICE:
Very outstanding.  Our server was an extremely nice, polite, and all around friendly guy.  He expertly answered our questions about the menu, and we appreciated his patience while we looked over the menu.  Needless to say, he truly made our evening a truly positive dining experience overall.

BOTTOM LINE:

I ordered the onion soup which was wonderful, not overly salty or oily and full of flavor. A great soup for the cold weather.

Our server was awesome. I don't recall her name, but she was so sweet and kind. She made our experience here worthwhile. 

My husband and I were starving and were looking forward to our dinner. We were both very pleased with the food. 

*Calamari was crispy and flavorful. It came with two sauces. My favorite was the cocktail sauce. 

*Lobster roll was amazing!! The bread was so buttery and perfectly toasted. This is the perfect dish to share. It comes in two small pieces, which was the perfect appetizer. 

*Chopped salad was fresh and light. I loved the dressing. It did not feel heavy nor unhealthy. It included tons of chicken\/salami and other fresh veggies. I'd definitely get this again. 

*Buttered Chicken Curry was what my husband got. He's a huge fan of Indian food, and it definitely did not disappoint. There was a good spicy kick to the curry, and it was served with rice and naan. 

*Sticky Toffee Pudding was SOOO amazing. It's FREE with a yelp check-in and SO worth the calories. My husband is not a big dessert guy, and he could not stop eating it. The bread was warm and not too sweet. The ice cream was the perfect complement to the bread.",2,1,2

We had the Devil eggs and they were out of this world!!! So tasty!! Very interesting way to serve them too. Serve the yolk as a spread rather than already inside of the hard boiled egg white is pretty brilliant.

I tried the lamb burger and it was really good. I asked for some mustard for the burger and the fries and I almost died. It is so spicy!!! Delicious!!

My bf had the fish and chips and the fish was cooked perfectly. Really flaky but crunchy on the outside. Exactly what I expected out of fish and chips.

The only bone I have to pick with this restaurant is the uniforms.....what on earth were those girls wearing?? There was some waitress well in her late 30s, early 40s wearing the trashiest little number ever! And trust me, it was definitely not age appropriate.

When my girlfriend said something about it the genius waiter went right into the classic al dente argument - nice. He offered to have it cooked more - baked more?

Would give it another try just because it's Gordon Ramsey's restaurant and the mac n cheese was SO good.",0,0,0

The first time I visited the menu was much more expansive, they had iPads with endless craft beer and wine selections and the food was delicious. When I came back a year later the iPads were gone, the menu items were different and there were less of them.

The food was greasy, bland, and spectacularly over priced for the quality. On my latest visit in July 2015 I ordered the short ribs, which turned out to be only one piece and boneless. Not what I expected, but at least it will taste good, right? Well actually, it didn't taste like anything at all. The meat was tender but had no flavor or sauce to help support it. The barley risotto had zero salt and was reminiscent of plain oatmeal. For a $40 plate I expected much more.

I gave my review two stars because the pretzels and cheese sauce were good enough, my glass of wine came in a small carafe so it felt like a generous amount for the price and the service was ok. Not enough positives to come back again, too bad.",0,0,0

Another 15 minutes passed and he woke up out if his stupor to again say, ""wow, your food still isn't out?!"" 2 minutes later it finally arrived. The salad was more a bowl of dressing with a few lettuce leaves. The burger and chips were extremely bland. It took another 10 minutes to flag down Ramon for the check. When it arrived we paid with 2 cards and cash. I wrote the payments down and even explained it. Well, Ramon pocketed the cash and charged my card double.

We have eaten at Gordon Ramsay's Pub on previous occasions and while not outstanding, we have never had the abysmal service that we experienced on Thursday 3\/26. I booked a month in advance for a party of 6, expecting a dining table or booth. Instead we were shown to a high top bar table with stools in a crowded, extremely (shouting to each other to talk) bar. Nothing else available we were told. Server took ten minutes to acknowledge us. Drinks were offered. Another ten minutes passed before we were able to order. While the appetizer of mildly hot and sweet wings was good, the rest of the meal went downhill. Two diners ordered Shepard's Pie, mediocre reviews. Lobster Mac & Cheese first course was over price at approx $22 ($24?) dollars and missing lobster. Two diners ordered the organic chicken dish. When dinner was served, after an almost 40 minute wait, the Organic chicken turned out to be Bangers and Mash. When this was called to our servers attention, he said (and I quote), ""Oh, the button for the Organic Chicken is beside the Bangers and Mash, I must have pushed the wrong button."" When we advised just to take the plates and we didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for our entree he offered to bring us a Shepards Pie (which they must have made ahead and keep ready under warmers?) Since neither of us eat red meat this was not an option. Our table asked for salt and pepper four times before it was brought, after dinner was essentially over. Our consolation for no dinner? Our server grudgingly offered dessert ""on him"". Incidentally, while no one could remember to bring condiments, they did manage to return to the table four times to refill drink orders from the bar, thus goosing up the check to the best of their ability. Terrible, terrible service and Chef should be appalled. No manager approached or offered apologies. I left a 10% tip, my husband, who is usually overgenerous with tips, wanted to leave nothing.

Just a note - we looked on the Caesar's website in detail at all of their restaurants to find one that wasn't too overpriced since we had a big weekend of eating at nice places in front of us.  I didn't even know Gordon Ramsay had a place in Caesar's, but to my delight, there it was on the list and it had two $$ in front of it, noting it as an average check price of $20 per person.  This was not the case.  An average cost for an entree appears to be about $28.

So I met up with my friends and ordered a dirty martini, which came out perfect.  We ordered our food and started chatting.  We noticed that 30 minutes had gone by and the waiter had not come back and our food had not arrived.  We waved him down and he said he would go check on it.  10 minutes later the food finally came out.  I had ordered the duck confit salad from the appetizer section.  The portion was almost an entree portion, but half the price!  It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  I finished the entire plate and was just full enough.  One of my friends ordered the roasted chicken, which looked like a tiny whole roasted chicken.  I didn't try any of it but he said it was great.  My other friend ordered the flank steak medium, and it came out medium rare.  She also said it was quite delicious.  We ordered the fingerling potatoes as a side, and those were BOMBtastic.  To my surprise, the side of brussel sprouts were okay (i HATE brussel sprouts).

The ambiance was classy, but not stuffy.  I liked it a lot.  It was fun and just the right amount of loud.  The service was fine, other than the food taking forever, but maybe that's just because it's so new they are still trying to work out all the kinks.  It's also a huge plus my duck confit was only $16 and was such a big portion.  I'd go here again and try the fish and chips.

Arriving at about 9:15, we only had a 20 minute wait. The decor was really neat, from the lighting to the eating utensils. Even the servers and hostesses uniforms were nicely done. We should've known after waiting 15 minutes before anyone greeted our table that our night was doomed. Of course we were getting anxious and ready to leave but we wanted to try this restaurant so badly and we didn't want to look around for another restaurant and have to possibly wait again. So finally our server arrived. I had seen this server the whole time taking care of the table next to us, so clearly he had seen us as well as another one of his tables that was seated one minute after us. Unfortunately we were not given drink menus when we were seated. The server had it with him on an ipad when he greeted us. This could've taken another five minutes to put our drink order in because he tried to leave it with us and walk away. Fortunately my husband and I immediately spotted a couple of beers on the first paged and ordered before he walked away. When our server returned with our beers five minutes later, he dropped them off and said he'd be right back after he dropped off a menu at another table. Another few minutes later he dropped off some bread and again said he'd be right back to take our order after he dropped off another table's bill. Either this guy had far too many tables to wait on or he was the world's biggest idiot. He was very nice, and tried very hard to crack jokes and make us forget about the past 25 minutes of horrible service. I actually felt really bad for the guy. My husband ordered the lamb burger which was only available on the bar menu but our server made it sound as if he would do us the huge favor and get it for him anyway. Turns out we saw lot's of burgers being delivered to tables. So I wonder why they don't just put the $20 burger on the full dining menu. Anyway, my husband didn't care much for the burger but we both agreed that the fries were outstanding. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and honest to God have never had a worse salad. I think there must have been some sort of mix up or error in the kitchen with my salad because it was so bad. The dressing must've been mayonnaise or something worse. My biggest regret is that I didn't say anything about it to the server. Normally I have no problem with speaking up about bad food but I was mentally exhausted and so completely over this dinner that it was too much effort to say anything. My next regret is that I actually ate it. What is my problem? I ate this disgusting salad and what does that say about me? Gross! I guess I was hungry. Our server obviously felt bad about the service because after we finished eating, he dropped off our check and told us he was deducting $10 from it. We smiled and thanked him. Nope, no deduction, just our full price bill. Again, too irritated and over the whole experience that we just paid and left. On a more positive note, they had a great selection of beer. Overpriced of course, but so is everything in Vegas so we can't fault them for that.",0,1,0

(Would have been nice to know.)  After waiting much too long our drinks arrived but we were certain the mojito was wrong-it was in a clear glass, no fresh mint to speak of.  My friend had a sip and she said it tasted like the pre-mixed drinks you can buy in the grocery store in a can.  That is where I suspected my greyhound came from as well judging by the taste-it was horrible.  But if you are going to charge $14 (?) for a mojito at least fake it by throwing in a spring of fresh mint...but mAybe that was too much work.  So, we ordered from the happy hour menu next thinking this was clearly not a mixed drink place-we should have paid attention to the keg-decor and impressive beer offering.  I happen to love IPAs and was excited to see Dog Fish Head on tap...but no...it was out.  It was only 4:00 or so!!  Okay, so I ordered  Stone IPA, also. Rey nice.  Strike two...

Firstly, the service was terrible. It seemed like you had to ask for every little thing (refills etc). Mostly importantly, we ordered 1 salad and 2 entrees. Over an hour later we finally get the salad and about 5-10 mins later we get the entrees. We noticed it was taking a long time and inquired but just got a passive ""it should be coming out real soon!"". We noticed from afar the manager (which we found out later) was peeking at us to see if we got our salad etc. It wasn't until I went to the hostess and asked the manager to come over that he finally did. He didn't introduce himself as the manager, just came over and said, sorry the salad took so long. He didn't even initially address why it was taking so long for the entrees. Also, we noticed tables around us getting their entrees way before us. Rather than trying to defuse the situation, the manager seemed to try to defend the poor service. ""I don't know what the people around you ordered"". ""Your entry is late because your salad was late and that caused your entree to be late"". He left the table and said he would subtract the salad. Finally, the entrees came and they were mediocre at best. The chicken pot pie was mostly gravy and hardly had any chicken in it. It also was rather smallish for the price (I'm not a huge eater either). The steak seemed like a poor quality cut and was overcooked and not tender at all. After everything was in the ditch, there was no follow-up. The management doesn't seem to understand ""writing the best last chapter"". Things WILL go wrong in the service industry, but it's how you handle it and how you send the customer away.

Gordon Ramsey needs to have more quality control. He needs to pay this place a visit and throw the book (soup?) at them. 

So my biggest gripe was the service followed by less than mediocre food. I might as well just went to the quick food place next door (Cypress?). They are located across from the Colosseum. I would never chance going to that restaurant before a show.

There are some awesome places to eat in Caesar's Palace but I would definitely skip this one.",1,0,0

I decided to take my sister here for a belated Christmas gift (she, like many others, is a Gordan Ramsey fan and aspires to also cook amazing food one day). Luckily, there was no need to physically stand in line - we placed our name on the waitlist and roamed around until the estimated time that that gave us to return, by which they had our table ready.

After we sat down, we had to wait several minutes before the server came to us, but the staff and food more than made up for it. Our waitress, Elyse, was very sociable when she arrived, chatting with us for a while before taking our order. Because of our time constraint, my sister decided to settle for dessert only.
We were debating between the sticky toffee pudding and potted triple chocolate trifle (both $9-10) and Elyse highly recommended the sticky toffee pudding, so we decided to go with that. Not disappointed with the overall selection at all!

Sticky Toffee Pudding: The combination of toffee ""pudding"" (it's actually a cake in Britain) with toffee syrup (wasn't too sweet, which balances out the cake), and vanilla bean ice cream (made fresh daily and gives a nice balance between hot and cold) is heavenly!

Stopped by for an unplanned meal.  There wasn't a wait so we decided to check it out.  The ambiance and decor are very unique - it's a neat place to go for drinks and food.  

Our main goal was to try the sticky toffee pudding, but needed a little something else first.  Wife and I split and burger.  On the positive, the burger came out cut in half with two plates making it easy and a nice presentation for splitting a meal.  The downside was that the burger was a bit overcooked.  The medium we ordered was definitely towards the well done side.  Not a big deal for me, but wife wasn't digging it.  It did taste good though - it wasn't a bad burger, except for the over charred parts.  And the fries were good.

Finally got to the sticky toffee pudding and it was pretty darn good.  My friend called it life changing... I wouldn't go that far, but it was tasty.  I wouldn't turn my back on it.

The employees seemed friendly and our server definitely was.  She was really nice and attentive.  Bonus points for how many beers I saw her carrying out on one tray.

We soon decided to order the Shepard pie, braised beef(forgot the full name) and lamb burger(medium with goat cheese). Check around the drink menu I then decided to have a glass of organic apple cider to go with my lamb burger, which turned out to be a perfect pair. Friend ordered the pear cider and was pretty good as well, for $9\/glass there were no complains. 

After ordering our foods and drinks, my friend noticed that the other tables received their complimentary breads which i thought we have to place an order on but should be giving first thing as seated along with waters, we then call the waiter once again, and he responded to us like he knew exactly what we were going to ask before we even said anything.... that was weird to me, if he knew what we've been waiting, how come we were still seeing tables after tables came in after us getting their breads before we even did. I believe that's when a table got totally left out and poor coordination with the front house. Not to mention there were this suited guy who seemed to be the manager that's warmly welcoming the other tables and have couple eye contacts with me but never crossed his mind that he might want to check on our table and see if there are anything he can help us with. 

I've been as a waitress once, I understand the struggle working as one as a start-up and if that's what happened on that day on the guy who served us, I'm more than understandable, but seemed to me, there are really little support by the management around the front house anyway, that's a shame as my first GR's dining experience.

The part with foods were great, all of the orders were wonderful except my lamb burger tasted burned a bit, and it was too dark in the dining room that I wasn't able to identify the surface of the burger before my first bite. As I made my complain to the waiter, he told me this is grilled and can't avoid the burn on top of the surface. I told him I'm fully aware of that but this is just too burned for me to bare. He accepted the plate and turn it back to the kitchen. I have not gotten the order until everyone else finished with their orders, but it was worth the wait, second time's a charmed... I loved everything about that lamb burger and the goat cheese has given the burger even better flavor than it already were.

Shepard pie was satisfying, my boy friend was aiming for this order before we came and was pleased. Braised beef was cooked beautifully and flawless, any more words would be over analyzed.

They bring fresh rye bread and pretzel sticks to the table with a cheese dipping sauce. I was disappointed in the sauce due to some sort of horseradish taste to it. I didnt even really get to taste them because before you knew it the food was out at the table. 

Ordered fish and chips..you definitely get a good portion of fish which I thought was good.T he potatoes were ok . I prefer smaller fries these were 4 giant ones with a little parm on em. Again all dipping sauces included horseradish. YUCK!

So, right off the bat, looking at the menu, I knew there was no way I was going to pay 27$ for fish and chips. Maybe they're really good, but like most things in Vegas I'm sure they're not worth the price. And the same can be said for most of the menu, like 22$ for bangers and mash or for a chicken pot pie. I don't think so. 

So we went for less expensive items: Deviled eggs, Mac & cheese and Duck confit poutine. The deviled eggs (2) we're tasty, but not worth the 8$. They were my idea; my girlfriend didn't see anything special about them. She enjoyed her mac & cheese but it was too salty. Now the duck confit poutine, oh boy... First off, my poutine had very little of everything, very little duck, very little cheese, and very little sauce in the little cup on the side. So, it's mostly just 12$ for fries with a bit of toppings on them. The fries themselves? Not even very good, a good fry you can taste the potato still, not these. They didn't even seem homemade. 

Mr. Ramsay, if you're going to serve poutine in one of your restaurants, I'd suggest coming here, to Québec City, and seeing what real poutine is. I can take you to a few dozen places, easily, that serve better poutine, and I'm talking anything from little shacks on the side of the road serving the traditionnal kind, to french bistros with a delicious twist on this classic. In fact, I could take you about an hour and a half outside QC city, to a small roadside restaurant where a culinary trained couple is doing lobster poutine, bison burgers, and more, oh and the best duck confit poutine anywhere. Tons of really good duck, tons of very fresh cheese curds, an amazing sauce and some of the best fries you'll ever eat. And it's definitely less than 12$US. Of course, for us the drive there ends up raising the price of that poutine somewhat, still worth every penny though. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I sincerely doubt you can get your money's worth for anything there.",0,0,0

Time passed. More time passed. After 1 hour, 20 mins we asked where our food was. The server finally went to see and they came out with our food a while later. Come to find out later, they lost the ticket for our table and had to rush an order. Beef wellington typically takes 30-60 mins to make. The right thing for them to do would have been to come out and tell us what happened and ask if we wanted to wait for another hour for them to make it properly or give us the option of ordering something else. Did they do that? No. Instead, they rushed the order and overcooked the Beef Wellington. If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten it. It didn't have much flavor and it was really disappointing. Even the mashed potatoes was luke warm.

They ended up giving us 20% off and the manager came out and apologized. It wasn't enough to make up for it though.

Service - Solid.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgable.  The staff was attentive to our needs with regard to keeping water full and table clear.  My only complaint would be the drink menu.  I can dig conserving paper and flashy electronics, but passing a couple iPads around to place drink orders was a bit of a hassle.

Ambiance - I liked it.  I wouldn't call it a traditional pub, but the feel is there.  The noise level is moderate, with an eclectic mix of British rock\/pop on the playlist.  The uniforms fit with the theme.  I work with beer for a living and I am without a doubt overly anal retentive with regards to it.  So, a wall made of kegs in a British themed pub didn't sit right with me.  Casks would have been much more appropriate.  Speaking of casks . . .

Beverages - Admittedly, we were all looking at beer, it's a pub after all.  For everyday beer selection, I'd give it a big thumbs up.  Lots of imported and expected domestic draft options, and a more craft friendly bottle selection.  I got a Union Jack, brother got a Sculpin, mom got a SNPA.  Their's was fresh, mine wasn't.  Que Sera, at least the options were there.  I would say this is more disappointing after visiting BURGR this afternoon and being offered a much more impressive beer list.  Lastly, it is a Pub, how is there nothing on cask?  If you are an avid beer advocate temper your expectations.

Food - Not one of the 8 off us left disappointed or hungry.  Between the 8 of us we tried the Pork and Lamb Rillettes appetizer, Lamb T-bone, Shepard's Pie, Brick Pressed Cornish Hen, Clams and Mussels, Pork Belly and sides of Brusselspouts and Fingerling Potatoes.

Bread and starters: The bread, holy geez the bread.  A selection of pretzel breads and a beer roll served with Devonshire butter and a Welsh cheddar spread with horseradish.  I can't believe they don't charge for this, it is easily one of the best things that was put on our table.  The Rillettes were excellent as well.  I favored the pork over the duck, which admittedly was a bit bland for duck.  It comes with a fabulous horseradish infused mustard, crispy acidic house made pickles of carrot and radish.

Mains - I am going to jump right to it.  Everything was at least good, but the Shepard's Pie is absolutely astounding and I would say the best thing we had on the table.  The pork belly, which I ordered was very good, crispy and fatty just as it should be.  It has a pea purée with it that is hardly noticeable and tiny chippolini(sp?) onions for sweetness.  All together great dish I wouldn't hesitate to order again.  I did not try a clam, but the mussels were great.  They were massive and came swimming in a delicious broth and a few heels of bread to drag through it.  The hen we a little dry but, my goodness, was the skin crispy.  The lamb was well prepared, perfectly cooked.  It is topped with Stilton, which I find to be a relatively medium flavored blue cheese, but in this situation it surprisingly dominated the lamb.  It was good to be sure, but could be better.

Sides:  The brusselsprouts were outstanding, simply prepared with bacon and apples.  Cooked perfectly, flavorful and a great compliment to the fatty pork.  The potatoes were potatoes.  They are tough to screw up and were not here.

Overall - For the 8 of us it came to just under $50\/person, but I'd say that is a comfortable number for the experience we had. I wouldn't hesitate to come back.",2,0,0

The bartender out did himself by being even more rude to my family! Very disrespectful. 

When we asked to speak with the manager it took him over 5-10 minutes to come speak with us. He had an inadequate response. 

We ordered simple appetizers, truffle fries and nachos. The fries were not acceptable in any way to serve. There was an excessive amount of oil on the fries (a puddle) even the manager didn't think it was edible.

And it's mostly disappointment emerging from the food menu, which pretty much doesn't have very many vegetarian options. You really have to be a hardcore meat eater to enjoy items listed on the menu. Sure, they will modify whatever they can to make it vegetarian friendly, but the best option you really have is well, the beer.
We walked in for lunch and the seating hostess seated us at the farthest table possible, which was closest to the kitchen. That just seemed very odd when there was a plethora of empty pub tables and tables with comfy chairs on the walk over. I asked that we be seated elsewhere because I did not want to smell of food. She made a face, but f*ck that. When I fork money on the food at a restaurant (and I am not cheap by any means), I expect to be seated where I deem I would be most comfortable.
Once we were seated and handed our menus, the server came by almost instantly. He made recommendations on beers, but given that most beers lately are on the hoppiest side with the IPAs and such, barring your quintessential Coors, Stella, my only option was Boddingtons. Which wasn't bad (more like an amber ale), but come on, I can buy these at the store. My husband opted for a combination of Guiness and Stella, which he rather liked.
We also ended up ordering an order of the Warm Salty pretzels and the mini pub sliders (minus the bacon). Here is where food math fails me - there's 2 of us, but there are 3 pretzel sticks in the order. Am I supposed to break one in half to share it 50-50 with my husband!? That said, they were soft and the mustard that came with was great! We requested that the meat be well done on our burgers, but they were medium at best. Flavorful, nonetheless. The order was fulfilling. But nothing spectacular. Our server was great. But this will probably be the only time I visit here.",3,1,3

The baby vegetable salad was ... uh ... AMAZING!  Nice and light, nicely coated with a light je-ne-sais-quoi that went perfectly!  Couldn't get enough of it!  I've had the (mis)fortune to have eaten a gazillion shepherd's pies, so while this one was certainly delicious and a large portion, it doesn't stand out as particularly remarkable.

But the sticky toffee pudding was most certainly NOT normal.  It was just incredible.  More of an upside down muffin than I guess what Yanks think of as pudding (jello) ... light, fluffy, TASTY, drenched in caramel sauce with just a little salt and a scoop of fresh made ice cream that melts in the warm sauce.  Nice.

The four of us were sat on these couches that looked cool but were ultimately impractical and grew highly uncomfortable over the evening. 

The service was spotty at best with much of the menu unavailable, some of which we didn't discover until after the order was put in. There were also no towels in the men's bathroom over the course of the meal which was especially disconcerting since the menu is mostly comprised of finger foods. 

I was foolhardy enough to order the $30 fish and chips which paled against the dive-iest pub food in London or the US. No seasoning on the fish, chips undercooked to the point of hardness, and a price point that made each bite taste of regret and the feeling of being taken advantage of.

Boy were we wrong. Some of the food were pretty good, I'd give that 3 stars, our server was awesome - I give her 5 stars, everybody and everything  else 0 stars... 

First of all, we went at 5:45 to get a table for 3 - with lots of empty tables in the restaurant they tell us, they can't accommodate us until 9:45 that night. We weren't that hungry so we decided to take the 9:45 reservation. When we got there again, we had to wait to be seated because it seemed like they didn't even know which tables were available. 

We finally got seated at approximately 10:15 and the hostess gave us ONE menu for a party of three. Okay, you might be busy and ran out of menus for the moment, but you should give us two additional menus ASAP. She never came back, and every other party around us had a menu for per person in their party. My friend saw a hostess with extra menus in her hands so she flagged her down to give us the menus. She had the nerve to say, ""I'm sorry, we usually only give ONE MENU PER TABLE."" - really?! That's a ridiculous excuse...if you can't think of something better, just say sorry and hide behind the counter or something. Oh yeah they ran out of water as they were filling our glasses so one of them was half full and they never came back to give us more...

We finally placed our order probably at 10:30. We ordered pub crisps (pretty good, might be a little too oily), mini sliders (I tried one that was overcooked, the meat was so dry), duck confit poutine (best dish of the night), a burger, and fish and chips (if I had read the review that all fish dishes were crap, I wouldn't have ordered this) and two drinks. During the 1+ hour that we were waiting for our food, we decided to order desserts ahead of time because we were afraid that would take another hour. We ordered the sticky toffee pudding and triple chocolate trifle - both were very good. We also got the peanut butter and jelly but that was too sweet for our taste buds. 

We ordered at the same time as this table of two girls that the bald manager guy snuck in after we were seated. But their food and drinks came way earlier than ours. 

We finally got our drinks at 10:45 and we didn't get any of our food until 11:44. That's over an hour after we placed our order, and people who were seated after us got their food, one table even paid and left already. Our food didn't even come in the order that the food should arrive, we got appetizers and entrees at the same time. At least they didn't bring us the dessert too. 

A different manager came with the people serving our food. My friend just started to complain about the poor service that we had all night. (Aside from our server - we didn't quite catch her name but she acknowledged us, she keeps coming back to tell us she had already asked the kitchen to hurry up and get us our food; she was very attentive and nice to us while we were waiting.) So the manager was apologizing, saying sorry that we had such a bad experience, yada yada ya. And they ended up giving us a free meal. 

If we had to pay, I would say the food is slightly overpriced. Portions are small but depending on what you order, the food was pretty good. (DON'T ORDER FISH!!) Unless they fix how they run the restaurant (kitchen and everybody else minus that one server), I wouldn't come back...even if I loved the duck confit poutine, sticky toffee pudding and the potted triple chocolate trifle -_- But they just opened recently, so I might give it one more try (after careful screening of fellow yelp reviewers comments) in the future or if it is still around...

They have pretty judgmental people working there, if you want better, quicker service, then dress up. There was this other table near us, they received the same kind of crap service when it came to food, drinks, and all. They had to wait just as long as we did, if not longer.

Probably you can get a better quality food in any casino buffet. This is the place to go if you are full and just want to show off that you ate at Gordon Ramsey's!!",0,0,0
