Total came out to be 140$ for two nights Killer deal!!! If you split the cost with 4 girls I feel like it's an awesome deal

The lady who checked us in was very nice and accommodating. It was really nice I loved the giant tub in the bathroom area. Although we did ask for a view and was told we'd get one, but actually did not, it's ok no big deal. The walls were very thick and quite sound proof which I loved, other than the sound of music we could hear faintly from the strip, we rather enjoyed it. 

The bell hops and valet are also super nice here, unlike most hotels. The only disappointment was that valet costed $18 per night. Most hotels only charge once for the whole stay, but again, not a big deal. 

One thing that was pretty annoying is the morning of our check out, some girl opened our door without warning and stuck her head in our room. She said she was doing a ""room check"" which was pretty inappropriate, because we could have been naked when she did so. Especially since it was only 8am and obviously not check out time yet, she really had no business sticking her head in our room.",1,1,0

The only positive about this hotel is the location. It's conveniently located right in the center of the strip, making most of the other hotels within a comfortable walking distance.  Other than that, Ballys fucking sucks. 

The customer service here was terrible. My party arrived early, was told the suites were not ready, so we can pay the fee, or come back anytime after 3pm, and we'll be set. 
That is not what happened. We came back about a quarter to 5, and Ballys gave our suite away!!! The manager had to figure out where to put us, because the newer tower was overbooked. Finally we get placed into two FILTHY rooms. God forbid, if you have asthma, are allergic to dust, or dust mite, walking into those rooms. They looked like they weren't cleaned for the last decade. One of the rooms had mold on the carpet. Wtf!? 

We expressed our dissatisfaction with the situation, and then was placed in another FILTHY room. This one now reeking of smoke. The hotel was booked until the morning, so the party had to endure it. However, the manager allowed us to change rooms again. This time on two separate floors. The knee slapper about that, one of the two rooms wasn't ready, and it became the first situation all over again. We left for the day, and came back with our room given away. After 2 days of dealing with this nonsense, everything finally got settled. 

Seriously speaking, this hotel needs to get it together. It's too dated, the casino included to have such shitty customer service. 

However, after this experience, a lesson was learned. Never ever ever again. Save yourself the headache, and book elsewhere!",3,2,0

The rest of the hotel could stand for a bit of a makeover, but since it is attached to Paris and a stop on the Monorail, it gets a lot of traffic. 

The other table games were tough, but I did end up winning a few dollars over all. The food court area and shops are less than desirable, but considering some of the other dumps we strolled through, we were happy to spend time here.",3,1,2

If you are a Harrah's property loyalist like me, you know that Bally's is definitely not on the high end of the company's charts, that is not to say, however, that Bally's is a dump.

I had a quick weekend in town last month and wanted to be central to all of the properties, and figured I would give Bally's a try. 

Once I sprinted out of the airport Friday night in hopes of beating the cab-line rush, I had little wait and began the short ride to the strip. While I am not usually a huge fan of arriving late at night, it was nice to have no one in front of me at the check-in desk. The whole process of checking-in took maybe 5 minutes, and I was on my way to luck!

The room was an upgraded room in the south tower, so a bit bigger than the standard, but nothing crazy impressive. 

My stay was problem-free, with my only complaint being the cost of wifi ($13.95 per day), but that is not a Bally's specific issue...

The food on property was good, especially with Paris being connected. I strongly recommend getting the Buffet of Buffets if you go, it is 7 buffets across Harrah's properties for $44.. for 24 hours of unlimited access. My belt is reminding me that I definitely got my money's worth right now, actually...

I would stay again if I was looking in a cheaper price range.",1,0,0

Here's the deal: If you are going to operate a hotel\/casino as the property that time forgot, and do basically nothing to upgrade\/modernize, then fine. But at LEAST either loosen up your gaming OR offer a killer, cheap buffet. Bally's really doesn't do ANYTHING. 

Going to Vegas once in your life and staying at Bally's and then writing an amazing review on it is like going to McDonald's once in your life and then writing a review about how it has the best cheeseburgers, ever, when you've never even had another cheeseburger. 

Seriously - read the reviews. People don't enjoy Bally's. They enjoy the proximity to everything ELSE. 

Of all the stuff to complain about (I could go on, even with the comped room), I thought at least the game floor would be fun. But it's terrible. Everything is from 20 years ago, including the band. We'll never stay here again, even on a comp.",5,0,0

The location is excellent.....as all other reviewers stated, they are located next to Paris, Bellagio, and Caesars.  You are right in the center of the strip.

Didn't spend much time in the room...hey, you are in Vegas....

Do you REALLY need to pay oodles of cash to lay your head considering you'll be spending most of your time not in your room, but out and about and probably getting yourself into some sort of  ""mischief"". 

Bally's is one of the ""older"" hotels that's located in the middle of strip. So, if you're the type to hoof it, this hotel's location will suit you just fine. 

Considering the room was comped (thanks D-Block), I don't know how much we paid, but for the price of free, ninety free, it was perfect. The basic rooms are just that, basic. It reminded me a lot like Best Western's or Motel 6's I've stayed at before. So, if you don't mind that kind of decor, then I don't see a problem staying here. If you're more for the modern decor, glitzier bathrooms, the other, more modern hotels would be a wiser choice.

Overall, the rooms were good for what they were (considering we probably we only in them for 10 hours of the entire weekend). This is the kind of hotel I would go with my friends and not worry about trying to ""wow"" them. So if you want to have more of a blast spending your money on gambling, clubs, and alcohol, book here and save yourself some change and use it towards fun!",8,8,7

Room was really tired and outdated, rough, poor quality towels, no coffee in the room, basically a motel 6 in a hotel setting. Wifi was also very spotty and front desk seemed amazed that it was and offered no solution. $35 bucks well spent. NOT! Also a real hike from the Paris parking lot which Ballys uses.

It is definitely time to tear this one down and start over.  Other than a perfect location there is nothing to recommend it.  Rooms are old and run down, breakfast buffet for 11.95 did not include coffee of juice and consisted of one very short line of nothing really special.  So $32.00 later I would recommend just getting a bagel.  The on line check out did not work so I could not view my bill without standing in line again with all the people who were checking in when I am checking out.  I am having to call and fight to get one because my charges don't look right at all.  They charge $3.00 per day for use of the in-room safe of you can believe it.  Was told the daily resort fee included the Internet connection but the instructions were so bad I had to go to the front desk for an explanation.  By that time I didn't really need it I just waited until I got outside to use my phone.  The resort fee is a joke because the Spa is so far away from the South Tower who on earth would want to wander through the Casino to get there.  I know everyone charges one so why don't they just include it as part of the cost of the room I ask?  The dealers were mostly friendly but blackjack games were somewhat limited and the show was good but there are much, much better hotels there for not so much more money.  My husband and I really stayed for the tennis courts but next time we will stay at Caesars and walk across the street.

I didn't want to book this hotel be sue it is old but because im so happy I did. Three days and two nights for $130 total.. Split among ten girls..$13 person. I was afraid that the room might be small, but it wasnt... 450 square feet of awesomeness.

I got a deluxe room with two queen size beds (non smoking). We got a view of flamingo and a bit of mirage and caesars palace. We fitted ten girls in this room with extra spaces for clothes, purses, shoes, and bags.  So there you have it.. It's very spacious. 

Pros: 
Spacious
Comes with a bar area and fridge
Restroom is nice and big: I like this type of restroom because it is split into two rooms. One is for vanity and the other one is for showering and doing number one and two. 
Mirrors: mostly good for girls cuz we all need to get ready for clubbing and we can all have own area
Price
Ask for as many blankets, shampoos, lotions, conditioners, soap and pillows without the people getting annoyed

Cons:
Cheap toilet papers make my ass hurts a bit. I'm used to charmin double quilted
No free toothbrush ( my friend wants me to say that cuz she forgot hers

Casino: quite small, but seems like a lot of people are having fun. All I'm looking for is the craps and pai gow table and also craps machine but I don't see it.

I feel like I'm at Disneyland going through that horizontal escalator. Kinda cool... If you run on that escalator, you'll feel like a cheetah.

Well when we check in later to the room it's a view of the construction which was horrible. When the bell person delivered our stuff I asked why the view was so shitty.

I walked up to the check-inn desk where I was greeted by a black guy named Elvis. I gave him whatever he wanted; id, credit card, name. He began violently flicking the keyboard for awhile. And after awhile I started to wonder wtf is going on? ""Don't lean over the desk"" he said. Then continuing to move at crack speed he walked into a back room then came back. Minutes later of waiting patiently I got the keys to my room. I think Elvis upgraded us to the north tower. Thanks buddy. 

The rooms aren't bad BUT THERE ARE NO FRICKIN REFRIGERATORS!! That is a huge pain in the ass. Not to mention no free wifi, no local or toll free calls, but then there are no resort fees either.

Ive stayed at multiple hotels on the strip & Bally's has been good to me! No complaints. I usually stay at Planet Hollywood for its convenience and location. However, the past few trips to Vegas I've stayed at Bally's. My friends and I took a chance, and I'm glad we did!

It's center to the strip, cheap, with decent hotel rooms. Its walking distance to Elis Island Casino where you'll find the best prime rib and steak for under $15. You can find the cheapest deals online for Bally's, and I usually slip the staff a $20 at check in (between my ID & CC) for an upgraded room. 

The food court isn't open 24 hours. That's a bummer. The closest option for food would be Paris. If you have the drunkies and crave tacos or burgers, you'll find no such luck. Theres a 24 hour Johnny Rockets in the Flamingo Casino. 

If you happen to find the cheapest deal online, & slip a $20; you'll find yourself in the newly renovated jubilee towers. It's upgraded with a mini fridge, a view of the Linq Ferris wheel, but located so far from the elevators & ice machine. We stayed in room 6636.

Although, there isn't a 24 hour food court available at Bally's; it's not a deal breaker. The money I save on the hotel, is extra spending money to do everything else in Vegas aside from sleeping. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a cheap, centrally located, decent place to stay on the strip.",4,0,0

I asked the front desk, when I checked in, to have A roll away bed sent to my room, as I had a friend that lived in Vegas that was staying with me for the night. The front desk told me they would set up the bed while we were out visiting Las Vegas..  When I went to the room, I was blown away by the size and the luxury of the room. My view was AMAZING! The bed was firm but comfortable and the feeling of being a high-roller was there! When got back to the room, no bed. I called trying to find out about the bed. They stated they are going charge me for a roll away bed. I told them there was no mention of that when I checked on and requested it and then the front desk begin to argue with me. I asked to speak to a manger. They put me on hold and then hung up on me. I was mad! Called back and asked for a manger, was told I needed to explain myself, again . They also told me to come down to the check in to explain myself. Really???!Is that what you call service?!?? Holy crap! Finally got a manger and they fixed it, and stated it would be at no cost.
I thought that was the only issue, then the reality of a dated hotel set in. I went to take a shower in the separate shower from the tub and discovered mold in the corner of the shower. I recieved a call about 2:30 from the housekeeping supervisor, Roberta, asking when I wanted my room cleaned. I told her 3:00 will work for me, as I was heading out. I requested someone to ""bleach"" the shower to get rid of the mold. She informed me to call her should I have anymore requests or problems. I headed out for the day and came back to the the smell of bleach in my room. Yeah!, I thought super clean shower. Not so much. It was a half ass job, that there was still mold there. I called to speak with Roberta and the front desk answered. I asked for Roberta the Housekeeping Manager.  They asked ""is that a manager?"" WHAT?!? Do you not know who are the managers on call for dept? The front desk asked if they could help. I told her the issue and at least could you also send me an extra blanket and refrigerator. ( side note, what kind of a suite, does not have a fridge) I was informed it would cost $15.00 EXTRA a day. WHAT? I'm in a suite?!?! I was so tired of the petty crap that was going on, I agreed. Somehow, they got a fridge that I was charged for, right up. But, I had to argue for a extra bed I was promised. I had asked if they could put food that I got from one of the restaurants in the fridge when it arrived. I was informed. No one could touch my stuff, to do so. Really??!!!?? Housekeeping was touching my stuff everyday, ( supposedly, when they clean). FINE! WHATEVER?!??
Then next day, I realized how much, they really do not clean. When I came back after room service, there was rings from glasses that were sitting in areas, I never put a glass. There were other items, but I will leave it there.

Finally, there was a gorgeous tub in the middle of my room. ( please see pictures). I actually was excited to take a long bath my last day. Needless to say, that did not happen. When so started to fill the tub with water, there was hair and not just long hair, but hair, like someone had shaved...a lot!!! Grosser than gross.

Finally we got our rooms and they were very dated and they smelled like smoke! Part of the drama at registration was that we wanted NON-smoking but somehow the booking site put us down for smoking. We had to pay EXTRA for non smoking and it smelled!!! We asked for a different room already irritated with all the issues. We got a handicapped room (as she called it) and had no bathtub! We were looking forward to a nice relaxing bath but now we were screwed! We had no view and our overall experience just wasn't great.

As far as being in the middle of the action this hotel is definitely right where you want to be, you go up one escalator and you're in the bazaar area straight across from the Bellagio fountains next to the ""hot spots "" so to speak. Another advantage is location is once you go up the escalator and you're in the bazaar area there are tons of people handing out drink coupons for buy one get one free which will save you a ton of money overall, you're also in the immediate area of all the escalators that will take you up to the Bridges since in Vegas in the Georgia Street will not let you cross at street level so that step alone will save you quite a bit of walking and detours. As for the hotel itself it is definitely a solid three. When we checked in we had booked a standard room and they said ""oh you get a free upgrade to a suite"". That sure sounded exciting but once we got to our room if it was not exciting at all. There was a gorgeous balcony with a view of the parking garage, we were not able to open the balcony doors or go out which is very common for Vegas. But at least at night it was kind of a nice view rather than nothing I guess. Our suite upgrade also included his and her closets and there was a very large in room Jacuzzi that neither of us were willing to use because it look like it had not been cleaned since being originally installed in the 70's. The Jacuzzi liner was peeling and there was green around all the water sources. The room itself was frozen in time, it had this really weird wallpaper that looked like faded circus stripes, it was covering a lot of water damage that had been poorly repaired years ago, there was no vent in the shower or toilet area which just makes romance almost impossible. The shower light also did not work, you had to flip the switch several times to make it actually turn on so you could see in the shower. They do offer room service, at first the prices seemed extremely high until we actually ate out on the strip and realize room service probably would save you a small fortune here and their menu seem quite expensive but we did not take advantage of this. The hotel staff as far as checking in and the housekeeping was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The floor staff in the casino area was another story, everybody knows you drink for ""free"" in Vegas but the servers were incredibly snobby and rude and even downright sarcastic towards you if you did not tip every single time. My work around this is to order two drinks from one server don't tip if they are being snotty and move to the next section so you don't have to constantly put up with their attitude while you're losing hundreds possibly thousands of dollars. We had one nice server on the casino floor that we did tip well, we all are Service workers and we all get what we give and to expect anything without actually working for it it's kind of insulting since we are there spending money we worked incredibly hard for. 
There is a pretty significant resort fee charged here that is not included in your booking, we stayed three nights and a resort fee was over $100 and we actually did not use any of the resort facilities such as swimming, spa or gym. Make sure if you are a booking a hotel and not planning on using resort offerings be sure to book somewhere with less amenities or you just want your money away.

I will admit that I can be a degenerate gambler at times and lose more than I care to mention so I have always stayed comped here. This is a nice, no frills hotel. Mostly people stay here because it is one of the cheaper options when it comes to casinos on the Strip. I find it laughable however when people openly state they come here because it's the cheapest place available but then complain that the amenities aren't on par when compared to Aria or Bellagio. This is a friendly reminder that you get what you pay for. 

The entrance here is a little tricky because you enter from the Strip and everyone knows that pedestrians here aren't considerate to cars. However, once you valet, the check in desk is an easy walk from the entrance. The line can look long sometimes but the wait is really short since both times I've been here the desk clerks have been really efficient.

The one good tip I can give here is to slip a $20 bill between your credit card and ID and ask about any available upgrades. Both times I went from a standard room in the south tower (older tower) to the north tower (refurbished tower) in whatever suite they have available. This trip our upgraded room was a junior suite.

The casino floor here is on the smaller side. Not as small as Imperial Palace but not set up in a maze like Caesar's Palace is. If you want a bigger casino, Bally's in connected via inside walkway to Paris. However, since the hotel is basically in the center to the strip, you won't have too far of a walk to any other casino you wish to go to.

If you aren't a fan of walking, there is a monorail station in the back of the casino. You have to go down the escalator and make the hike there. It's right next to the pool entrance. 

There is a 24 hour Sbarro downstairs and a tequila bar in the casino that stays open late. I don't know much about other food options because those are the only two I've tried.",14,4,2

My husband planned a trip last minute since we werent sure if we could go since I had Jury Duty the week before. Since I was able to be excused and my husbands birthday is on st. Pattys day with my mother in law in town to watch the girls.. we decided to drive out to vegas for two nights and booked our rooms two days before our stay.

We booked for two nights and a king sized bed for our stay. Cost came out to about 125 a night + the site we used gave us a 25 dollar voucher for food or drinks. Arrived at around midnight but the guy at check in told us all the king sized bedrooms were taken. I asked if theres anything special they do for birthdays because my husbands birthday was that day since its midnight. The guy said since he can only get us a queen sized bed for the night, he told us we will be doing a room change in the afternoon to get our king sized bed the next night. Because of the inconvience he upgraded us to the jacuzzi suite. So that night we had a jr suite and the night after we got a jacuzzi suite.

We were a bit excited for the room upgrade but in the end it didnt really make a big difference. The first night in our jr. Suite.. i loved how spacious the room was.. but that bed was not a queen sized bed. Let a lone a standard queen sized bed. Our bed was more like a FULL sized bed if anything...

Room change was between 12-1pm. So after having brunch we headed back to the hotel to do the change. Super inconvienent since it takes up our day to come back and move rooms before heading out again. The jacuzzi suite on the 14th floor looked very nice. Sweet upgrade for the moment of walking in. No view btw but a jacuzzi is sweet enough. Very spacious and luxurious but probably would have been unsafe for my kids to run around since the jacuzzi had some sharp corners on that thing.

After our long venture out..  i had went to Lush and bought some bath bombs for the jacuzzi. After turning on the water.. there was a ton of bubbles coming up in the water. Im guessing its bubbles are from the previous use and it wasnt cleaned by the house keeper. So obviously a bit disgusted.. i filled it with water and rinsed it out before using it. After that... i couldnt find the button to turn on the jacuzzi so i called house keeping for help. They werent any help at all. Sounded like they didnt give a crap about it and told me to just press the black button and that was that....

Well.. first off.. house keeping stated its a button with a P on it. Its not btw... thats just the logo of the brand of the tub. I eventually figured out where this black button was... its on the side. But its jammed in and doesnt work. So i pretty much just had a big tub to lay in after throwing in my bath bomb. I have one of these at home so im not missing out just i expected better from a hotel in vegas u know.

Overall i wasnt happy about the inconvience and the broken jacuzzi... but i liked the location. It made it very easy to walk around on either ends of the strip since we were right in the middle.

Negative: Like previously stated, no wifi and if you want it it's 14 bucks a day, no coffee, bad service, old cocktail waitresses and guests. The parking was also really far from the rooms. It was such a bitch to have to walk back and forth everyday.

 I have to say, the customer service here was pretty fucking HORRIBLE. We came at almost 12pm for check in, but we couldn't get into our room until after 4pm, so we had to wait around for 4 hours. During check in, we were trying to see if we could get into the newer tower instead of the old one, since we heard bad things about the old one. We probably asked the woman about 5 times which tower we would be in, but she completely ignored us every time, it seemed like she was in so much of a rush to get us out of there, that she didnt even bother listening to what we were saying, and I know we were asking her loud and clear. So we pretty much had to find out what tower we were  when we got into the room.  

At 4pm, when we went to pick up our room key, we decided to report the issue to management. We went up to the check in counter to another person and explained the problem to him. He pretty much got offensive right off the bat, completely ignoring what we were even saying. Then he called the woman we had a problem with up to the desk and told us to tell her the problem ourselves. Who the fuck does that!? We just asked him to get the manager out so we can explain it to him, but he wasn't much help either. It's like, all we were trying to tell them is that they should have their employees listen to the customers more and ask them if they have any questions. No wonder non of them do that! The manager sets a horrible example himself. They were making it seem like we had a huge problem with our room and what they gave us, but that wasn't it at all. So they kept saying ""you got what you want, so what's the problem"" and we'd try to tell them and they'd just cut us off. This had to be the WORST EXPERIENCE at a Vegas hotel that I've ever had, and I've lived here for the past 10 years!

After staying at Cosmo\/Aria\/Caesars\/higher end hotels, we decided to save money and stay at Bally's instead. My parents love this place and I always wonder why, since it looks so outdated on the outside. Now I know why: you get a huge bang for your buck and its a great place to gamble for non high rollers. I heard they're renovating? Upon entering it looked like a regular casino. The reception area was very clean, it looked new and shiny. Our double queen bed room was SPACIOUS. Probably the most spacious double bed room I've seen on the strip thus far. And it was super cheap! With total rewards, it came to less than $100 on a weekend night. Such a steal for such a huge room.

The rooms were clean and we were very impressed at the pretty beds. Very clean and well kept room. The bathroom was very clean. I have no complaints AT ALL. The room was actually better than Planet Hollywood\/Palazzo because nothing fell apart or looked run down (yes things fell apart on me at other hotels, so bad)! 

A great place to gamble! My bf and parents love gambling here because its just affordable. The servers are VERY friendly. Not the prettiest in Vegas but they are very quick with the free drinks and friendly. I sat at the slot machine for at least an hour, and usually only 1 waitress would pass by me during that amount of time in other hotels. However at bally's, a server passed by me several times asking me if I needed anything. 

We will definitely stay here since it's cheap and we don't spend that much time in the rooms anyways, always out and about. I love how they have 24 hours food joints open up for all the drunk munchies we had. Nosh got the job done and their chicken noodle soup was very good.",2,1,3

After nearly avoiding a fist fight we both went down stairs to complain. I calmly advised the the lady at reception what happened and was treated like I inconvenienced her. That combined with the naked man who was in my room it was time for a manager. He was decent and at least apologized. I was switched to a new room which was nice except the 3 wet spots on the floor the size of basketballs. I get it though it was the New Years weekend so back downstairs I went wet socks and all.... I was surprised however that after all this and 3 hours later there was no comp. no offer of a discount meal.... No nothing just lots of words of regret.

Since it's right in the middle, next to Paris, and across from Caesar's and Bellagio, it can make getting around Vegas pretty easy, especially if you're there during the Summer.

The hotel room we got was pretty bare bones.  2 beds, bathroom, TV, that's it.  I was hoping to get a fridge, but guess not.  Since I'm not in Vegas to sleep, it really didn't make a big difference.  Since it was a free room due to a gambling habit, I really don't have much to complain about. LOL.  We did get a great view of the strip and Vegas as usual, is a blast.  The Casino itself is pretty mediocre, nothing really that stands out except for the cheap blinds at the Hold 'em tables if I wanted to waste a few hours at the Poker table.

Parking here kind of blows. They make you feel second rate from the get-go. You can self-park and when you get to the elevator, you have to walk through Paris (not a bad thing really, but time consuming) to get to the Bally's registration area, which always seems to have long queues. 

We stayed in the newly renovated North Tower, deluxe room. Averaging $77 a night for Monday and Tuesday nights, I feel like the hotel could have averaged $30 a night had we stayed longer. The luck I had in Vegas made me rue the day a bit.

That said, the deluxe room just seemed to lack the amenities I had taken for granted as a guest at Mandalay Bay and the Palms in the past.

I did a 30 minute bed bug check around the bed and room and found the following:

1. They do not clean\/vacuum under the beds or around the headboard. It was extremely dusty and dirty. 
2. Travelers should put their luggage in the bathroom to avoid getting bed bugs. When I entered the bathroom, there was hair on the floor. Not mine.

The added shops near the Boulevard on the former wasted space in front is very impressive and the upgrades in the food court area downstairs is coming along. Hard to find or even be aware of unless you are heading to the monorail but open 24hrs if you get any late night cravings.

Now the room. They are clean, bathroom has nice fixtures and tiling. Furniture is modern minus the bedding and love seat. In my room you can feel every spring in the mattress which the label says was manufactured in 2001.

For value, weekday value is reasonable but don't expect the same for the weekend.  You may be disappointed. Check in a bit slow but average for Las Vegas. Expect a line almost any time of the day. 

I will be back in another month so for now I will give the benefit of a doubt that perhaps this room is the exception more than the rule and a work in progress.",5,0,0

Cons:
- Poor communication. I got an attempted charge of $15 early check-in fee without an explanation. I got one bed after I specified two. No clear explanation of the mandatory resort fee of $18 which is also taxed to a total of $20.16. Was told I would be charged at check-in, when actually the charge was at check out so I spent a lot of time trying to clear all of this up.
- This new mandatory resort fee of $20.16 includes everything that you were offered before with the exception of free wifi for one device. You can't refuse this fee.
- Broken elevator
- Many many broken slot machines, including the huge one exiting the casino to Paris
- Escalators were off the entire stay
- The entrance outside was dirty with a lot of old cigarette butts on the floor
- Generally unhappy looking staff the majority of my stay

Pros:
- Clean room

Some personnel are terrific, like the folks that work at the pool, very skilled in customer service with patience and a super friendly attitude. Then there are others, like the ladies at the desk of the spa which is the gateway to the workout room. Rude doesn't begin to describe it. Since it connects to the spa, Bally's requires a photo ID for everybody and charges $22 for additions people over two from each room. Ok, but how about telling us that before we get there and don't have our wallets? Then, how about saying ""sorry"". It's kinda that way all across the experience, and the bad exchanges ruin what great employees do well.

Its not as cool as the other hotels or as new but for the price, it was great.
I love the locations, Practically in the middle of the strip. You're right across from Caesars and Bellagio. The pool area could be a little fancier like other Vegas pools but it gets the job done. The Bar by the pool makes really great drinks. The rooms were clean and we did get a decent upgrade. The staff was great. My friend got really drunk and threw up all over the carpet and they did a great job cleaning it, poor ladies. The bathroom was pretty nice. Our room was spacious.

Considering it takes like 10 minutes just to get from room to lobby in the Bellagio, I was quite pleased not to waste time. The side exit makes the trip to Ellis Island even faster!

Minor complaint is that the shower head sucked, it was all misty (whaa!) and you can't really control the temperature of the room.

I have stayed at Bally's around 5 times.  Never had a bad experience.  I believe I've always stayed in a 2 queen bed standard room.  Very nice rooms and of course because this is Vegas it's a nicer room than other standard rooms.  Never had any issues.  Casino isn't the newest on the strip, but, has everything you need.  Plus, if you are in Vegas, you will be walking around everywhere.  Rooms are good priced.  I usually fly and get a deal from one of those travel sites.  I don't think I ever paid more than $100 a night (probably less) with flight\/hotel deal.  Nice price and just fine hotel.  

They allow pets also!  On a roadtrip cross country from Chicago to San Diego my friend, cousin, 2 dogs & a cat stopped in Vegas.  Now, we aren't planners.  We knew our end point (San Diego, then back to Chicago area), but, we didn't plan hotels in advance.  We stayed mostly at La Quinta's due to their free pet policy.  In Vegas we had some issues finding a pet friendly hotel.  There wasn't a La Quinta close by so I think it was the middle of the night, maybe around 4am and we were calling around to find a pet friendly hotel on the strip.  Bally's had a pet friendly room available.  Now, it was a bit costly last minute.  Just a normal 2 queen bed room and it was multiple hundred (I forget the exact price, but it was up there.  I want to say like $700 for 2 nights if I remember correctly).  We went in late August 2014, so I don't think it was like a huge tourist time.  We needed a place to stay and we had been on the road for over 15 hours so we split the cost and stayed here.  I docked one star because I feel the price was a bit on the high side.  But, overall, still a great room and great time!  To get to the outside dog area we had to take an elevator and walk through some shops and food court.  Nobody bothered us with our dogs.  If you need a pet friendly hotel, give them a call; but, be sure to book earlier to hopefully get a better price!

Another great thing in this hotel is the Sterling Brunch!  WOW.  I wish I still had pictures of this.  It was again a bit pricey, but, well worth it.  I think around $80 a person.  But, you got unlimited champagne and food.  They had a buffet of high quality meats and seafoods, but, you could also order select items such as eggs benedict, caviar, and some other choices made to order.  Tons of dessert options as well.  Well worth it if you have some extra cash to spend on an amazing brunch and you have some time to spend as well (so you can make use of the free champagne)!  We got so many different food options, champagne, and like 4 dishes of caviar; I think we got our moneys worth!",0,0,0

This is especially true when using the monorail since there's a station attached. ""Who uses the monorail in Vegas?!"" I do - it works.

I also like the table games at Bally's. They're usually cheaper and don't have hardcore players at them. I found a $5 Texas Hold'em table that was a blast, especially for those who aren't serious poker players but want to play (the tournament rooms on the other hand are too intense). There's also sports betting and cheap food options in-house.

He proceeded to ask me if we had checked our car out at any time last night.
We made it clear we did not, we brought it in around 730p the night before and it wasn't until now we are showing up to get the car.
He had us wait for over 20 min and nor he or the other guy they called for had any idea where my car was.
Turns out, the guy that ""checked"" in my car the night before never really checked in the vehicle in the system, used the same ticket number for another vehicle, registered that vehicle and it showed in the system that my car was gone.
I was livid.
Finally, after another 10 min wait, they realized there were some tickets on the ledge of the window that had gone unregistered and of course my ticket was there.

Here is why, my dear players: did you notice that delightful party pit with the shiny lights and pop music?  Hard to miss, right?  

All that glitz has a dark secret.....6 to 5 blackjack payout on a six deck shoe.  Okay, I admit I'm dramatic, and that Bally's does post the odds.  But, the only payout acceptable in blackjack with a shoe are 3 to 2.  6 to 5 are reserved for single deck only.  They are hoping you don't notice and\/or don't care.

Okay, on to the more hurtful part.  These BAD odds are reserved for the lower level (10 dollar) tables.  If you'd like to bet more than that, you are buying the better odds.  Is this the gambling equivalent to ""trickle down economics""?

So, in the tradition of all things grass roots - please demand tables with the fair odds.  You do have a choice, so vote with your dollar.

They have a soft poker room (which is little more than a cordoned-off area of the pit), and some cheaper table games than you'll find elsewhere.  At night, they have a great cover band at the Indigo lounge.  

Bally's also has an underground mall area with inexpensive fast-food type restaurants and shops.  Their sports book is also located down there, and although it feels like you're walking through a mall in 1986 with the reflective silver surface motif they have.

There's plenty of parking in the lot that's shared with Bally's sister property Paris.  It can be a little tricky to find at first, but I've never had a problem parking there in my five or six visits.  Bally's is my home casino when I'm not travelling with the fiancee.

There is no resort fee, but that also means no internet access.  If you really need it, they have a few kiosks, and you can buy time in five minute increments. I've never tried the pool, as I usually like to come off-season to avoid the famous Vegas heat (which is what kills you, not the humidity).  

A budget-tier hotel is never going to get five stars from me.  But as far as your options are concerned, steer clear of the Luxors and Imperial Palaces of the world and stay in the heart of everything.",2,0,0

The shower was absolutely gross and the bathtub in the middle of the room was totally visible to other hotels facing your room. The shower is also surrounded by mirrors so if more than 2 people stay in your room, they'll see you showering or coming out of the shower.

The casino is pretty old and run-down. There aren't many amenities nor is there any good food. The best thing about the casino is that they comp'ed us so we got the room for free. I would personally choose the Venetian\/Palazzo\/Wynn over this hotel. 

If you need to stay within budget, imperial palace is just as dirty, but the location is much better. MGM\/Mandalay are similar in price also, but farther away from all the action.",1,1,0

First time was 2 years ago and it sucked. I have to say the hotel upgraded a lot and cleaned up well.

Room- room was compt from my friends Player's comps. We got the jubilee tower suite which was a big room I would say about 950 square feet. More then enough space to hold a party or a room of drinks.
My only issue with the room was the AC. The room was to big for the AC to keep the room cool. Bathroom was kind of small for a suite. But decor was nice, and close to elevators, and a view of the north strip. The elevators were a nightmare. Only 3 elevators for the top 12 floors. One of the elevators was out of order so leaving 2 elevators in service. Sometimes we waiting as long as ten mins to get to the room, and cramed in the elevator. 

Casino-is nice and cleaned up well from the last time I stayed. Hotel doesn't smell old. Casino is not as big as the other hotels but it's also not crowded which makes it pleasant to gamble. 

Downstairs 24hr daily deli was awesome. 

Hotel-staff is extra nice and attentive and polite. They don't have sticks up their asses like some of the higher end hotels. Maid turn down service was fast and I honestly didn't notice she was in the room cleaning. She even brought us more water and ice and towels. Extra tip to her

Granted I was only a teenager at the time, I had a buddy along so we walked up and down the strip to Circus Circus everyday.  Through the years, the Strip has changed but the hotel hasn't.

I've stayed at Bally's a few times after that and the rooms have had minor upgrades here and there, nothing major.  The rooms are spacious and every room we were in always had a sofa, which was nice.  The beds are dated and sagging but I've slept on far worse beds.  They still have tube TV's but hopefully that'll change.  One thing that I hope will change are their popcorn ceilings.  The bathroom was spacious but when the toilet flushed, it was loud, you know, that public restroom SWOOSH kind of loud.  Also, the shower head was some type of water saver so the stream of water wasn't quite strong for my taste.  There are no resort fees, which the hotel really touts but, they charge $13.95 for internet access, what a rip!

The casino has remained the same over the years and their little shopping area has slowly deteriorated.  I remember the pool was always fun, but it's been a few years since I've been there.

Several family members have told us to try out the Sterling Brunch on Sundays but warned us on this trip to probably skip it as the quality has gone down.  Well for $85 per, I'll take their word for it.

Overall, Bally's is an okay place to stay, it's in the center of the Strip so you don't have to drive out, it's connected to Paris and within a short walking distance to the other casinos.  Honestly, you can get one hell of a deal on your stay here!  It's not my first choice to stay when in Vegas but it's not the last!",2,3,2

We were in the older tower, but since we were also celebrating our anniversary, they gave us a free upgrade to a suite on one of the top floors, and it was really nice, with a great view!

The room was large, the bed was huge, the bathroom was really nice and all new with marble counter tops , etc. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.

The pool was closed in winter, but Bally's guests could use the Paris pool and jacuzzis. which was beautiful and open in winter! The 2 hotels are owned by the same company, and also share the same parking garage.

The main thing I didn't like, which is what brings my review down to 3 stars instead of 4, is that the casino and lobby area were incredibly smokey. You just walk through and you end up smelling like smoke. I could not imagine working in that area, it would be like smoking 5 packs a day. It was just awful. It's probably because it's an old building and old ventilation systems, and has the old-school low ceilings in the casino. That ruined it for me and my wife, we could not sit in that casino and gamble, we had to go to Paris because the smoke was no where near as bad there. (Though I should add, everything at the Paris is way overpriced!) 

What I did love about Bally's is that it is connected to the Paris. I was attending a convention at the Paris and it was just a hop skip and a jump down a hallway from our room to the Paris convention hall. Bally's is also cheaper than Paris, and they say the rooms are bigger.",5,2,0

Last month I stayed here for the first time while on a business trip. Bally's is one of the older casino hotels in Vegas but has a prime location on the strip, is attached to the Paris, and also is a monorail stop location. Think of it as a no-frills hotel going in and you will be fine, as it does offer some of the most affordable room rates around.

The casino floor and rooms are decent but showing it's age. Yeah, it can use a renovation and brought into the modern era. Overall clean, and the casino floor is laid out so it is easy to maneuver. A nice mix of old and new games. Low limits can be found on table games. You still get that feel of the old Las Vegas vibe here. More than enough spots to eat but nothing to rave about. Their Blu Pool is actually quite nice and a great spot to hang out at during the day. They have a terrific gym that is well stocked with free weights and machines. All the staff I came in contact with were fairly nice.

The downstairs level houses the shopping area which has a nice little selection of stores, a terrific sports book, and a small food court. You also have to pass through here to get to the monorail. Feels like a mall out of the '80's.

Now, I must have said the right thing to the front desk attendant as she hooked me up royally! I was joking around with her about getting the Presidential suite and she actually did put me in a high roller suite! Even funnier is that this was the kind of suite that you could imagine Sinatra and the Rat Pack hanging out in. It was old school cool. It was huge. Full bar, old style tv's and furniture, sunk-in Jacuzzi tub, large step up open bathroom and dual vanity area, floor to ceiling windows with an amazing view at night, and even a bidet! This room must have been the bomb back in the day. Well kept but a little worn round the edges from age and use. I could not believe I was staying here for about $40 a night. Crazy.

As with most casinos you have to pay a daily fee for internet access which sucks. Also, it's close to In-N-Out Burger with a few minutes cab ride!

I stayed at Bally's and the customer service was outstanding so kudos to the front desk people and all other staff - I was impressed.  I stayed in the North Tower where the rooms have been updated but I believe the less expensive South Tower rooms have yet to be updated. Either way, the rooms are large and so affordable compared to most cities that it is hard to complain - great value!

So why the 2 star rating? Three things. 

One, no free wireless. Come on! This is 2009. Worse, they charge you $14 PER DAY!!!!!  Highway robbery and it might sound petty but for this single reason I would not come to Bally's again. It's principle. 

Secondly, no coffee in the room. Again, come on. Go ahead and charge me an extra few bucks a day but please don't make me have to go to the lobby or call room service just for a cup of coffee. That's nuts.

Finally, the Spa and swimming pool, aside from being like a mile walk from the rooms, close at 6pm!  Again, what's up? After a full day of meetings I like to work out and take a leisurely swim. When I called the desk asking why they closed so early they told me it was the off season. Off season? We're in a desert. Is swimming ever not in season?

I'm just going to post that article right there. I am a pretty avid Pokémon player, morning Facebook\/Instagram\/Snapchat user. It helps me wake up and allow my boyfriend and others to sleep in. I had noticed quickly I did not get great cell phone service inside the hotel. Not until I got completely away from the hotel. Meaning, not even under the side entrance roof. My uber map was a block away. Thankfully I called my uber driver before any problems happened. I'm fully believing this hotel blocks your cell service, so you get so impatient on waiting for things to load (correctly) that you end up buying the WiFi here. It's free within 24 hours for TWO devices. So if you have 4 people\/guests in one room, you have to draw sticks to figure out who gets internet. 

FYI Bally's. I wouldn't be surprised if someone came and served you with documents soon. 

Cons: No bathroom fan, or broken?
AC isn't as cold is should be. May be broken. It was about 70 outside, AC at 60 degrees and the room was still hot. The beds were worn, comforter was flat. Extra comforter thankfully in closet.

Anyway. Didn't eat here just stayed in the room which was nice.

The Story: when I left Bally's after seeing one of the funniest and entertaining shows on the strip (Miss Behave #MBGS- more on that in that review) we went to the Valet to pick up our car. If you park for more than four hours you are charged $18. Under four hours you are charged $13. FYI- No local is happy with this new parking regime and things need to change as this mechanic \/ cash grab is not the way to garner additional business. We arrived at 7:35pm for an 8pm show time and we left at 10:15pm. We went to the kiosk to read the ticket to ""call for the car and pay"". The kiosk read $18 and I didn't think anything of it as it's a computer and way smarter than me so I paid using my CC. After I received my receipt and was standing in front of the sign that states $13!!!!! the bells starting going off (or it could have been my mother yelling ""what did you just pay for parking!!!""). I approached the booth and asked how long the machines have been stealing from locals and other customers and in turn got a supervisor to come by and discuss the situation. He agreed the machine was at fault for charging $18 vs $13 but said they have no ability to refund the over charge as they are maintained by a third party (as an IC). I was informed to call the Valet Supervisor and will do so tomorrow. Just wanted to give everyone the heads up that the kiosk are no bueno. You always hear people use the old adage ""if I had a penny for every time...."" well looks like Bally Valet's third party vendor has plenty of other people's pennies.",4,2,0

Cons: Checking in took us just over an hour of standing in a very long line. That's ridiculous. We got to our room and it wasn't in great condition. There was a hole in the bathroom wall, many marks on other walls, odd (and gross) stains throughout the room, torn curtains, and they hadn't vacuumed underneath the tv stand in at least 6 months (it was off the ground and easy to access). All of this is forgivable if they make it right.  Called the front desk. No other rooms available. Not able to offer any compensation. Have to go to the front desk (where we had just waited for over an hour) to speak to the desk manager. Went there. Waited another hour. He never showed up. 

Upon checkout, I expressed our frustration in the nicest possible way to the person checking us out. She said sorry, but you didn't talk to the manager so nothing can be done.

That's why we decided to book the cheapest rooms in a classy hotel--kind of a cheap but great value combo deal. 

Bally's was the perfect choice. We paid around $80 for a couple of nights, but we booked early. It is a fantastic hotel that is decked out with everything Vegas,i.e. lots of shiny things, a casino, respectable rooms, a giant slot machine, etc...

Best of all, it is directly linked to ""Paris"" and thus offers tons of choices for dinner, shopping, and excessive gambling. It also served as a great home-base in the middle of the strip to visit the best bars, clubs, casinos, and the like.

I'd go here again for sure.

He upgraded us to a room that was on the 23rd floor, and sadly, it was terrible. We stayed 4 days and were so glad to leave. 
The smoking in the foyer nearly killed us every time we went down there, so much so that we would take the elevator to the basement and go out to the street the back way. 

The room was spacious, and the tv was decent sized. The sliding door did not open (it had been screwed shut), and there was no windows, making fresh air impossible. 
The walls seem paper thin and we were woken up at 3am every night by party goers in the next room. 

The buffet breakfast we had downstairs was TERRIBLE. Scrambled eggs was all I managed to force down and I left. 
Limited range of food, staff rude and it was $16.95! 

I went for a massage at the Ballys Spa and again, the front counter staff were quite rude. I had a coupon that I had received in my room and I handed it over but was still charged full price. When I queried them, it was like I had just stolen their last dollar. Eventually though, they did give a refund. 

My masseur was good with his technique but the constant coughing and sniffling was horrible. He was clearly quite sick with a cold or flu and should not have been at work. 
The massage went for 10 minutes shorter than what it should have.

I argued that the roomm WAS READY and it didnt cost them anything to let me drop my luggage in the room, but they didnt seem to care.

There were stains on the carpet, walls, and furniture.  Everywhere you looked there was something that made you cringe.  The sheets on the bed actually did appear to be clean so we were thankful for that.  

Our suite consisted of two massive rooms with floor to ceiling windows in each room.  It really had the potential to be amazing but it was impossible to ignore the lack of cleanliness everywhere.

The suite was so massive that my first thought was that it'd be perfect for a big group of friends.  Unfortunately, even if you could ignore the stains on the couches, they weren't exactly sleepable.  All three of the couches were rounded and wouldn't be comfortable to sleep on at all.  There was plenty of floor space, probably enough to fit 10 or more air mattresses so that's an option but I'm not sure I'd ever want to stay here again, even for free.

It basically seemed like they weren't really trying.  There were large stains on the carpet which made walking around barefoot an adventure.  You could tell that the corners hadn't been vacuumed in a long time.  The cleaning person actually left a dirty rag on one of our counters and there were chunks of something (use your imagination) in the sink behind the bar.  The couches and armchairs were the worst.  I have never seen anything like this before and I've stayed at some questionable places.  There were stains everywhere - these were large vomit or spilled drink stains and it was so bad that we never once sat down anywhere other than the bed.

This room was disgusting.  I could go on and on about a number of other issues but I'd rather not think about it.  I don't recommend Ballys to anyone.  There is the possibility that they have nicer\/newer rooms but I wouldn't chance it.  I understand that the larger suites like this are usually used by groups of party-animals so stains are more likely but this was extreme.  The carpet and upholstered furniture is past the point of cleaning and needs to be replaced.  I don't even think Good Will would accept some of the pieces.",3,0,1

May 24-26, 2017:

My 1-year old daughter and I stayed here for a few days while we met up with our family who flew in from Hawaii.  Most of them stayed at Bally's so they suggested that it would be better that we all stayed at the same hotel.  My hotel of choice when staying in Vegas is The Stratosphere because it is farthest from The Strip, yet still close enough.

The king size bed was just ok.  It was getting worn down and should've been replaced by now, I'd say.  The room appears clean to the eyes, that is, until my daughter started crawling around the room and found a piece of dirty toenail, picked it up and put it in her mouth.  I asked her what she was chewing on and I almost died when she showed it to me.

I don't know if they even vacuum these floors every time a guest checks out.  I don't even want to know what else they don't clean.  Never staying at Bally's again...",24,16,15

Our suite was pretty nice but I for one have always hated how hotels smell. Reminds me of stale hospitals.. Bally's actually wasn't too bad and the smell quickly went away after I turned the AC on a little higher. The AC was already on.. tsk tsk for wasting! 

Room service did a great job knocking three times and carefully entering the room. We were too tired to get up until she came up. After she saw me, she apologized even though it was our fault for not making a peep to let her know we were still in our room.

We ordered room service the first night. I got the turkey club sandwich and my friend got the fish and chips. Fish was  okay.. it usually is to me. The chips aka fries were better. My turkey club was off the hook. The bread was well toasted, filled with good quality turkey, clean iceberg lettuce, sliced tomatoes, a smear of mayo and avocado! Loved!! Also came with a pickle which was great. Wish they gave two because I was rationing it out for the entire sandwich which btw was quite a pleasant stomach full!

I would stay here again since the location is good but not the best. It's definitely a walk or a cab fare that adds up to get to the newer casino\/hotels other than Caesars and the Bellagio.",1,0,0

My  wife checked in online from Hoover Dam and picked up the room keys quickly at the front desk.  They have WiFi and the room was clean, but with a terrible view of the roof.  The remote was missing its battery cover.  

The Players Club really doesn't offer any good freebies.  There is a nice sports book by the pool with lots of tvs.  This casino does have keno, which we played for several hours but lost.  They have four craps tables, although the minimum bet is a little high, $10.  I was happy with the vibe at the craps table and was able to win $153 in a few hours with my wife.  By the way, the casino waitresses are awesome, tip them well.  I swear they were coming by every five minutes while we were playing craps and keno.

This hotel does have a small pool and they do give out free towels.  No diving.  Get there early for a deck chair in the shade.  

If you get a chance, visit Tequila Taquiria, on the casino floor.  This little gem has $2 càrnita  tacos (which are delicious) and a $20 pitcher of margaritas (from scratch, no bottle mixers) for happy  hour.  Sit at the bar, the service is great and the bartenders friendly.  

The location of this hotel casino is one of the best.  It is centrally located and right across the street from the Bellagio Fountains.  Also, it is one of the stops of the monorail.  Just in front of Bally's are the Bazaar Shops, which include Starbucks and Half Price Show tickets vendor.",3,0,0

Here are the basics:

Pros:
- Rooms are clean, spacious enough with good sized closet space, desk workspace and vanity. Bathrooms were clean and functional as well. 
- Room service is prompt and comes by often so that whenever we came back from breakfast or an AM outing, we always found our rooms cleaned. Room service also responds quickly to calls about needing extra towels, light bulbs, etc. 
- Blu Pool has plenty of seating and nice little ledges to sit on while you chill. Half of the pool is 3-5ft and the other side is 11ft+ for people who want to really swim. Tasty drinks and PBJ sandwiches were also on the menu.
- Online check out was quick and easy!
- Low betting minimums (compared to other hotels on the strip) for gambling.
- Ramen-ya  (located in their Grand Bazaar -- misleading name as it is not that huge) had some seriously yummy ramen!

Cons:
- No coffeemaker in the room. Really? It's 2015. Even the not-so-nice hotels back home have a coffeemaker.
- Check-in line was the slowest line I've stood in for a while. 
- Not much to do within the hotel. Not a lot to see. Paris has some stuff, but it's not super amazing either. What do you expect for the price?
- Tequila Taqueria. So bad it deserved its own review.
- Their salon. Jesus Christ. My friend had a question about whether they had experience doing black hair. Waited forever and a day for a staff member to finally come out and answer her question. And for those who are curious, she never directly answered, she just said ""it's okay, it's just flat ironing."" A red flag for anyone who knows and takes hair seriously.",5,4,2

Most of the people that I came in contact with were wonderful, helpful, and well trained. The only negative was the room service experience. Not only do they NOT serve dinner, but the lunch that I ordered arrived well past the promised delivery time and the telephone person was rude.

Pero si se preguntan por el hotel en sí, debo decir que las habitaciones son hermosas y mega cómodas, son súper grandes, la cama es enorme y genial, lo mismo el baño y el espacio físico en sí. En nuestro caso tuvimos una genial vista de The Strip desde el enorme ventanal, hasta se podían observar las Fuentes del Bellagio.

Puede que el Bally's les resulte un tanto caótico por toda la gente que transita por el lugar y lo enorme que es, pero Las Vegas y los casinos son así, al rato te acostumbras y ya te pones en sintonía con tal limado y genial universo.

El hotel en sí está muy bien ubicado, sobre The Strip y a pocos minutos en auto del Aeropuerto y cerca de todas las grandes atracciones de Las Vegas.

The man at the front desk was nice and told us to make sure that none of our phones were nearby when we were swiping to get into our room, because that would mess up the magnetic settings of the room key. We went back upstairs to our room and made sure all of our phones were far away and yet, none of the keys worked properly still :( (some of the keys would work after swiping it ten, twelve times). So we decided to go down AGAIN and see what they could do about our keys. We waited in line, they gave us new keys, the manager apologized and offered us complimentary water bottles (although idk how water would make us feel better after we'd spent 2 hours on this key problem and were super frustrated), and told us he'd send a locksmith to our room if it still did not work. We went back up to our room and the keys did not work until we swiped multiple times and by this point, we just decided to deal with sucky hotel keys .... We were all  just super annoyed because we had just wanted to get to our hotel room and rest for the night, but instead spent so long getting the situation fixed :\/ 
Another problem we encountered was when we called the front lobby from our room and requested extra blankets. We waited for a while and no one came, so we called again to check on the status of our blankets. The lady at the front desk said that we had a ""do not disturb"" sign on our door and for that reason, they did not knock to give us the blankets. However, we checked our door and there was definitely no sign on it so we told the lady. She then continued to say ""Well, if you would like your blankets, please take down your 'do not disturb' sign so we can make sure you get them"", even after we told her it was certain we did not have that sign up..... 
For these reasons, I'm not sure whether I would stay at this hotel again.",1,1,0

Room Service: A bit pricier than what I remember, but hey, drag your lazy behind out to the mini-strip mall they have or to strip if you want to pay less.

Casino: They have a good amount of games but I feel that the clientele at this establishment tend to be a bit more geriatric; definitely not a place to mack on the lay-days.

Location:  Location is good, it's surrounded by tons of good eateries and other hotels (paris is connected) and it has a free shuttle to the Rio that runs every half-hour.

Overall: If you're just going to be here for a weekend or you're hardly going to be in your room, this is the place for you.Bally's rates are also ridiculously cheap for being a hotel in the middle of the strip so you can't really lose here (unless you're looking for luxury).

I've stayed here once before and had a decent experience, but this last one (which happens to also be my bachelorette wkend) was definitely my last. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS. I was looking for a hotel that had adjoining rooms in Vegas. I knew we were going to book about 4 rooms and I wanted all the girls to be together. I spoke with a couple of hotel reps and the ones who worked for Bally's said they had ALL adjoining rooms (meaning all connecting) - OK, let's go with Bally's then. They said they charge extra for adjoining rooms and I said fine. It's worth it. The charge was going to be $165 extra for 4 rooms, 3 nights. Cool, done. My OCD took over and a month before our trip. I decided to call in just to make sure the rooms were the way I wanted them to be. They said they were not completely adjoined, that they dont have rooms designed that way, but two sets would be adjoined. WHAT???? Why did I chose you over other nicer hotels then?!?!?!?!? I was FUMING ... but everything was already paid for so I accepted it and moved on.

The day we get there, it was super busy (it was Memorial day wkend). We waited in line for half an hour and the lady took about 45 minutes to process our rooms because it was a ""complicated"" one. I asked her if the rooms were adjoining, meaning two sets connected and she said yes. Guess what? We go all the way up to our rooms and they ARE NOT adjoining. There were no doors to connect them!!!! OKAY, pretty angry at this point. We go all the way back downstairs and spoke with the same lady who helped us. What was her explanation? She said she ASSUMED the rooms were connected. Well, you know what happens when we assume right?  It took her something like two hours to try to figure this out, and in the end, I couldn't get the connected rooms because they were all full. Who's fault is that? I CALLED months ahead of time to ensure the room structure, I PAID months ahead of time to make sure things go as planned and this is what I get? By this time, our girls were hungry and we had plans at 5pm that night, so they were getting ready and doing their makeup in the hallway. How inconvenient is that??? The rooms we ended up getting were in the same hallway, they were not connected, not even right next to each other. They didnt end up charging me for the adjoining rooms (better!) and also gave us $50 for room service. Still didn't think that was enough. 

It's been two weeks since this happened and thinking back on it still makes me angry.",6,2,3

The sportsbook could use a makeover and there is no buffet in the hotel.  The ceilings are low and my friend referred to the hotel as ""Smoke Ballys"" but to tell you the truth, I think they all stink the same.  Fast checkin and housekeeping was good.

Not the worst thing in the world, but still a hassle and required a trip down to the front desk where we were told they simply goofed and said the word adjoining but they don't actually have any adjoining rooms available then they simply brushed us off. 

We go back upstairs and our keys don't work to get into one of the rooms. Finally, after a lot of attempts, we get into the room to find that we only have 3 towels for our 4 people. So back to the hotel lobby for towels. The next day, we tried to use the keys in the afternoon and they didn't work. So we went back down to the front desk for new keys then back upstairs only to have the keys not work yet again.

Was able to get a room at Ballys. Big mistake. The room was advertised at a fair price but when it was time to actually check out and finalized the reservation the price went up like 30% I could have stayed at a much nicer hotel for the same price.

My initial reaction is it is a dirty old hotel worh mold amd cracking decaying ceiling in the bathroom.  

The staff and customer service was mean to my family and I and was a poor representation of what a nice hotel on the strip should be. Not sure why the staff seemed so miserable but the service suffered heavily. We ordered and extra roll away bed and did not show up until 2:30 am after checking in earlier that day. 

Ate at a restaurant in the hotel, it was medicare and again way overpriced compared to other similar restaurants. Usually I give alot of slack for businesses and always give good reviews but this one seem to screw up every contact with customers. Not just small stuff like a grumpy staff member but real major issues like mold and no beds, 20th floor even looks like the building has shifted and the floor is leaning.

Checkout took along time and it seemed like they didn't have the ac on so by the time we got up to the room we had to take a shower lol.

I had gotten an email about being able to skip the lines & check in online but was unable to figure out how to do that once logged into the website.  Check in went smoothly & quickly once we got up to the desk.  The pool closes early at 8 pm, so we weren't able to check it out the first night, and the second night we spent 15 minutes walking from our room to the pool only to find out it closed 2 hours early that night because all the piercers apparently had it reserved.  This was a big bummer for me because the pool was actually nice and heated, and we spent all the time walking over to it only to have to get up and leave after 10 minutes to walk over to Paris where they do not have a heated pool.  It is nice you can use the pool at Paris, and planet Hollywood as well but I think the one at Ballys was nice since it was heated, it felt cold in the other pool because of it being so hot outside.  Other than that we had a good experience and everyone was nice and ready to assist you if you had questions.

I was mostly concerned about the smoke smell people mentioned. Maybe it's true in other towers, but I am extremely sensitive to smoke and this room was fine. The casino is just like all the other casinos here in Vegas, there are smokers. But I wouldn't call it any worse than the others.

The check in was fine, but the kiosks available for speedy check in wouldn't work for us. We still got checked in easily, so whatever.

But, in Las Vegas you have a lot better hotels for greater prices e.g. Bellagio!. But who needs that? I did not come to Las Vegas to stay in my room! 

we ended up staying an extra night! thats how happy we were...

A few facts:

1. Next to Bellagio with the free water show and famous O
2. Next to Treasure Island with the free pirate show
3. Connected walkway to Paris hotel!
4. Connected to the Monorail that takes you all around the main action in Vegas!",0,0,0

My friend i went with was also watching her money a little more so for the price this was the perfect fit.

When we got there early i ask about getting a newer room, hoping they would offer us one. The front desk lady told me that for 20 more a night we could check in early and get a new room. We decided no and hung around for an hour  till we could pick up our keys... when we checked in the nice man said he upgraded us :) Yet, we were still in the older rooms or should i say ""original tower"" as the room-keeper referred to it. So possibly it was a re-modeled room? Or maybe he was just full of crap.

They made our beds every-night we were there. But only actually took the initiative to clean once. And when they actually did clean they threw things like shopping bags and papers away. Which scared me. Nothing i needed - but what if i had a important receipt crumpled and it got pitched?

Pool was nice. No where near as nice as surrounding pools. But clean, spacious , nice cocktail servers. They offer yummy froxen drinks in big 32oz cups for $18. Not sure how buzzed i was, but sooo tasty!

Our room was clean and spacious. Updated but not modern. Tv was old, with broken buttons and a hard to work remote, minimal channels... but who watches much tv when you're in vegas.
Pro's:
- in a perfect place. We could see the Bellagio fountain from our room. And Caesars is right there too.
- Monorail stop at the hotel.
- on the way to the monorail and pool there is a small underground shopping mall. With some food court places and convenience shops.

Cons:
- a very plain hotel. Neither of the 2 restaurants that i saw inside seemed appealing enough to try. The mexican one had $1 tacos and beers though! May have given that a try but other places just seemed better.
- the walk to the hotel elevators is alllll the way in the back of the hotel. So just your walk from your room to the strip is exhausting even though it seems like its RIGHT THERE, lol. But so is it with everything in vegas.

I've stayed at Bally's a number of times. I find it a good value for the rates they charge. It's not the most glamorous of casinos, nor the fanciest. But the rooms are big and clean, and Bally's is conveniently located next door to Paris and across the street from the Bellagio, Flamingo, and Ceasers Palace. The Venetian, Mirage, Treasure Island and Planet Hollywood are all walking distance. Bally's is connected to Paris so you can go back and forth easily. 

The only restaurant we ate at was the Burger Brasserie in the connection walkway to Paris. I'm not a fan of most of the restaurants in the walk way over to Paris. Our room was on the 12th floor with no real view, but it was quiet, no street noise. If we looked to the right we could get a glimpse of the fountains at Bellagio which are quite loud when they erupt (sounds like gunshots or fireworks) but it didn't disturb us. Room had an ironing board, safe, no bottled water, no mini-bar, standard amenities in the bathroom, hair dryer (a small one but it worked). Water pressure is low like most hotels in Vegas (it's the desert after all), but temperature was fine. AC worked fine and kept the room at the temp we wanted.

The Indigo lounge is now closed and under construction so there is no entertainment in the hotel beyond the shows. There is a lounge with a band and dancing in the walkway to Paris. 

I utilized the self-parking (enter off Flamingo) and had no problems finding a space. The garage is shared with Paris and when you enter,  you'll find yourself in the walkway between the two. Turn right to go to Bally's, left to go to Paris. 

Pros: Good value, large and clean room, location, friendly staff, room was quiet (12th floor), easy self parking
Cons: No buffet that I saw, no good lounge for relaxing

So, overall I'd say this is a solid option and a step up from some of the cheaper strip hotels like Luxor, Circus Circus, Excalibur, etc. I'd stay here again.

Note, the South Tower has been gutted and fully remodeled so should be much nicer than the North Tower we stayed in. They offered us an upgrade to a jacuzzi suite for $50 per night which I declined. 

Tip: Always ask for a high room, away from the elevators and vending machines. Cut's down on the noise level tremendously in any hotel!",6,1,1

We came on a budget, so much of this review will be from a penny pinchers perspective.  Things started off a little rough, as the check-in line was horrendous.  Our flight was delayed, so we were quite ready to start our evening only to wait a half an hour in line.  I would recommend grabbing an adult beverage for the wait.  But once at the counter, I did the sandwich trick and was given an awesome ""complimentary upgrade"" to a jacuzzi suite in the Indigo Tower.  Mood elevated.

After ooogling the insane suite, we wandered down and out to visit the CVS just outside of the hotel to grab beer for the fridge and gatorade for the morning.  In view were the following casinos: Paris, Bellagio, the Cromwell, Caesars. 

As for the casino itself, I hit big on the Flinstones machine and the girlfriend hit on Wizard of Oz.  Plus, drinks were comp'd without question, something we had issues with at other casinos, even if we were gambling.  For example, we were charged $16 at Caesars for 2 drinks after gambling at the bar.  We got to know a bartender at the bar at Bally's near the Indigo Towers elevators named Hollie, she took great care with us all weekend. 

The pool is adequate, nothing special, but it was relaxing on a hot day.  The drink prices are outrageous, considering no outside drinks are allowed.  $36 for a bucket of 5 beers and $16 for a small blended drink.  Needless to say we didn't spend while swimming.

The food court is also adequate.  Hot dogs, Asian food, pizzas.  I got a pizza one night and it was $15.  We only ate at 1 restaurant in ballys, the Tequila Taqueria.  We thought it was happy hour, but apparently it was only during the weekday.  Got an order of Carne Asada Tacos and they were really good.  Expensive at $15, but they hit the spot.  There weren't any happy hours at the nice restaurants during the weekend, so we ate elsewhere.

We visited many other hotel and casinos in walking distance.  The Paris is attached to Bally's and we had great experiences there as well. Walked to the Miracle Mile inside Planet Hollywood for gifts, cheap drinks, and great food during happy hours.  We watched the fountains at the Bellagio, which was right across the street.

Overall, it was a great first experience.  From the upgraded room to the great service from Hollie. We'll be staying at Bally's during our next visit.  It was very affordable and the location is awesome.",1,0,0

How could this review not be excellent especially when we arrived, everyone was nice and friendly. We requested a room in the Jubilee Tower and got it. The atmosphere was full of jubilation. Everyone was ready for a new year to come and we were going to ring in a New Year too. The countdown started in the Paris Ballroom with dinner and dancing at 9:00PM. Waiters were smiling and joyful as they served the Curried Jumbo Prawns, Beef Filet with Lobster Medallions and the Delicious Dessert. The wine and champagne was outstanding too, even the surprising entertainment: The Righteous Brothers at their best.

I tried to get a room close to my friends since we were here for the same wedding. I came in pretty late, but  the front desk person was pretty accommodating. She found me a room on the same floor, but looked sad as all they had were junior suites which would be an upgrade fee. So for three nights, the cost was 56 bucks. Total. For a suite with a fridge and a lot more space than a normal room. I was fine with that. I went through Priceline anyway, so I got a pretty good deal that I already paid for. 

The room had nice enough beds, but they seemed a little small for queens. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean and the shower had water pressure. I was pretty happy about that. 

Bally's is connected to the Paris so basically you have access to the same stuff as the Paris for a lot less. I was fine with that.  Lots of restaurants on the way to the Paris that are tasty and I've reviewed them

There is also a food court downstairs on the pool level that includes pizza, hot dogs and stuff that kids and adults would like. 

The Casino is a bit smokey for my taste, but Vegas is pretty smokey.

Tip. No resort fees. I know that sounds lame, but those add up. Remember that with any of the Harrah's properties. 

Tip#2. There are better buffets than the one at the Bally's.

Bally's is close to a lot of places on the Strip so it makes it a very good location for the price.

The rooms are in desperate need of some upgrades like new BEDS to start with. You can feel the springs underneath you - so not comfy. Everything about it feels old. However, I think the convenient location deserves 4 stars in itself.

I would never actually rent a room there, so Bally's is the next best place to stay.

There is an Evening Call located within Bally's, which is a bar that serves those giant margarita yard sticks. They are open late and very convenient. They also have a bar that serves $3 beers all day\/night!

My boyfriend and I were unexpectedly upgraded to a suite upon check-in, but the excitement wore off once we actually entered the room.

We had some friends that decided to do a Vegas wedding at Caesars. It took place during the memorial day weekend and the prices were jacked really high. We didn't feel like paying them and thought that staying nearby for a third of the price would be sufficient. Bally's offers easy access to Caesars by one the over-the-street bridges. It also has free shuttle service to the Rio and is a stop on the Vegas monorail if you don't feel like wearing down your feet. It's also connected to Paris, where you can up in the pseudo Eiffel tower.

The casino itself is quite nice, with plenty of table games and a somewhat lively atmosphere. They also host the show ""Jubilee""'. Where the women wear the feathers and put on a classic Vegas style show. They have a newly renovated spa and gym and cheap and quick restaurants for those on the go.

Now let's talk about the accommodations. We got a room with two queen sized beds. It was huge, but very dated. I would venture to say that it would be a suite at most other hotels. It was very clean and had your basic amenities like an iron with board and toiletries. The tv was still a 25"" tube, there were two seat-couches, a table and a dresser. The bathroom was a little bigger than normal and had a full sized mirror, which was a plus. I was a little disappointed at the lack of a coffee maker, but I could do without it.

I placed a $20 bill between the license and credit card and asked if there were any complimentary upgrades. I don't think she saw the $20 but when she did, she acted a little surprised and gave a little ""Oh!"". She asked what type of upgrade were looking for. I was specifically looking for a room with a fridge which isn't standard at Bally's. She placed us in a room on the north tower which was part of a connecting suite. It was one room, but larger (she said 500 sq ft) and had a mini-bar. It had a sofa, coffee table, and a couple other chairs along with a small dining room table and chairs. It also had a flat screen TV, which the south tower doesn't appear to have. You could see doors on each side to the connecting rooms. What was unusual was it was a murphy bed! I have to admit, the bed wasn't very comfortable.  I also found their pillows thin and firm so I always bring my own from home (we drive from California). Regardless, since the room was already comped for 3 nights, throwing $20 in for a little better room was nice. 

We went to the Sidewalk Cafe again for breakfast and had a pretty basic breakfast.  Before paying $11.99 for the breakfast buffet, check it out.  It's a mini buffet so their selection might be a little sparse.  I ordered from the menu this time.

Finally revolting we just walked up to the next agent who was very friendly bit explained they are required to help those guests first despite that we had been waiting longer than the people that just got in line for mail\/key pickup.",0,0,0

Expedia had an offer for as low as $36 a night! I mean.. that's a whole lot of money to put towards alcohol or gambling instead.

Bally's is the perfect location. Located somewhat in the middle of the strip, pretty much everything is walking distance. For me, even in platform heels.

We all know this is an old hotel at the strip...and given that fact....do not even attempt to compare it to the newer ones out there.... The beds aren't as luscious. the bathroom doesn't have a seperate tub with waterjet whatsoever... or a him\/her sinks...none of that....

But im happy they have a blow dryer.

Service is pretty decent. They called in paramedics and security for a bee that stung me by their pool area.

The newly renovated Jubilee Tower is totally awesome and is much appreciated, especially with a veteran property on The Strip such as Bally's.

I was only expecting a Jubilee Suite with maybe a regular connecting room with two Queen beds, but opening the door to the living room of the Celebrity Suite was a huge surprise for us. With the two combined suites, we had two bedrooms with a King in each, 2.5 bathrooms, two whirlpool tubs, a bar with sink & fridge, an additional fridge in each bedroom for a total of three, a nice 55"" television in the living room (no HD unfortunately), a 36"" or 42"" in each bedroom, a free safe in each bedroom that they don't charge for anymore, and a dining table for six people. We had a fifth friend join us for Friday night and there was more than enough room for the roll-away bed I had brought up for him. Another friend complained that the amount of space was way too much for only five (mostly four) guys for the weekend, making it feel like we were split into two groups isolated in each of the bedrooms at times.

I've been in other comped suites at Bally's, Paris, and Caesars over the years, but this was the best room I've ever had in Vegas so far. I can't emphasize the room being comped enough, for these two suites were valued at around $3700-3800 total for the four nights we stayed (Thursday-Monday).

The reasons why I decided to not give these guys 5 stars is because of the extremely long waiting time to catch an elevator. They have one elevator bay with 6 separate elevator cars in total for the entire tower while the Indigo Tower (formerly North Tower) has two separate bays of 6 for a total of 12 elevators to access its 26 floors. In the Jubilee Tower, three go to the lower half of the tower while the other three go to the upper half, so the wait could get quite ugly with only three elevators accessing 12-15 floors. The lights in our half-bathroom in the living room also went out on the second night there and I never called maintenance to come fix them, but I guess I can only blame myself for that one. 

Our southward view of Paris and the Fountains of Bellagio all the way down to Mandalay Bay was pretty cool, too.

Waiting for a taxi was a breeze since my Total Rewards ""Diamond"" card allowed us to bypass the que and hop into one of the next three cabs.

The walk from the parking garage behind Paris to check-in then to the Jubilee Tower kinda sucks, but it isn't nearly as bad as the walk from the parking garage to check-in at Caesars Palace.

We went to Rehab at Hard Rock, so we never used the pool on the property. It does have a deep end reaching a depth of 12-13', something that is completely lacking at most Las Vegas properties, if not all. I used to love their pool as a child.

One of my friends kept asking what some weird hissing noise was during our stay. I finally realized on Sunday that it was a steam vent\/pipe coming from the north wall of Paris next door. The noise wasn't constant, but the hiss would occur all day and night for maybe up to 30 seconds at intermittent times. I got used to it after the second day.

Lastly, the sandwiches and hot dogs at the Nosh in the casino at the bottom of the Jubilee Tower were 100x better than what they now serve at the Sidewalk Cafe. This is very sad, for I used to always stay at Bally's through my childhood years and really enjoyed their meals when they used to be much better.

I highly recommend the newly renovated Jubilee Tower rooms and suites, and would gladly stay in them again for my birthday next year. I would never stay at Bally's again if it wasn't a new Jubilee Tower room. Customer service at Caesars Entertainment properties has always been excellent for as long as I can remember, as well. I had to be sure to mention that.

If you're a Vegas visitor who actually pays for their rooms, the nightly rates at Bally's will never break the bank and they possess some prime real estate at a prime location at the corner of Flamingo & The Strip. Sure, the property has been around for decades and has been showing its age for years, but you sure as Hell could do a lot worse than Bally's.",1,0,0

It took us over 50 minutes to check-in to the hotel on a Sunday night.  The front desk was clearly understaffed, and after calling their hotel management office to suggest they send additional people up to help with the enormous line, was told that there was no one else to send.  You would imagine that with the number of reservations in the system that they could have forecasted the check-in needs of their guests.  They obviously didn't, so the first hour of our stay was spent standing in the lobby.

After finally reaching the check-in associate at the front desk, I was informed that I was in a smoking room.  My reservation was clearly made for non-smoking, as it always is every single time I travel.  They said they could gladly change me over into a non-smoking room... for $20 on each night of my reservation!  Class.

I tried to request a late-checkout and was routed to three different people, who eventually gave me an outside number to call to deal with the request! How can that not be handled by your front desk or someone in the hotel?? That one was beyond me.

Finally, I checked out via the ""express"" method, which involved filling out a card in the lobby and dropping it into a box, at which point my bill was to be emailed to me.  Why they still require an actual checkout, as opposed to just leaving an invoice under the door like every other hotel on earth does these days, is also a strange one.  Regardless, its been over a week and I haven't received a copy of my invoice to submit for travel expenses.

Overall, the hotel is run down but that could be easily overlooked with top notch service.  Unfortunately that's not the case here.  First and last time staying here.  If you choose to, I would make sure your nightly rate includes all the additional add-ons like $28 a night for internet access, and your choice of smoking or non-smoking room fees.

Sure it's not one of those high end hotels that you see on the strip. But believe me, you will be quite surprised by the convenience Bally's serves for their customers. 

What I like about this hotel is three things: 

1) Location, Location, Location!! 
It is right dead center of a lot of popular hotels that people go to, such as Bellagio (as well as the fountains), Paris, Planet Hollywood, Caesar's Palace, and even Cosmopolitan. You don't need a car to go to different hotels, just walk. 

2) Cheap and Decent
I used a promo (aka discount) and end up splitting the cost with the people who stayed with me. It was actually not that bad. And on top of that, I booked the classic room (located in the south tower), and it was actually SPACIOUS!! The bathroom had a lot of space and as well as the bedrooms. As for the view...I was LUCKY enough to see Caesar's Palace and part of the Bellagio Fountains. It was awesome. 

3) Connected to the Paris Hotel
If there are any places I want to see or dine for food, why not go to Paris Hotel? I was very lucky to try their famous restaurant Mon Ami Gabi and it was absolutely delicious. Plus, I managed to gamble in the casinos and be near Sugar Factory. 

Overall, the service was really good when checking in. They handle things really well. Although the room may need somewhat of an upgrade, you don't need to worry about it. After all, you will be our and about in Las Vegas partying and walking on the strip. :)

Why? It's all about preference and there are just some hotels that cater to people for different reasons. This review is strictly based on the ambiance of the hotel and casino. I came here for a special YELP party and had sometime to kill. I love to play a few hands of blackjack every now and then! Throw a few bucks into the slot machines and see what kind of luck is floating around. The self parking of this place is sort of tricky and if you ask me it's in a very odd place for entrance I literally feel like it's a safety hazard for the walking tourist. I can't imagine how many people have almost been or been hit while trying to cross as somebody is turning in! Anyways after figuring out the parking I noticed that they are another hotel that will join MGM properties in charging for parking! Yikes! Another reason I will most likely not frequent this hotel because I would have to pay to park. As a local I just REFUSE to pay for parking! At least with the MGM properties I will be grandfathered into no parking fee's due to my membership level. Once I parked and made my way inside I thought to myself he it looks a little better than what I had anticipated.

I have been booking reservations for a friend of mine who is a retired social worker. He is also African American. He is very put together and what one would call a snappy dresser. He has enjoyed his October visits to Las Vegas for the last ten years. On this visit, while in Bally's casino, he was approached by an employee who, asked him his name, why he was in the casino, where was he from, had he been there before, and then requested to see his ID. He was just walking around looking for the right machine to enjoy??? He is not a big gambler, and again, a 72 year old retired social worker. After that, no explanation and not even an apology! How dare that happen! Has anyone else experienced this at Bally's? Could Bally's please explain this? Lucky it wasn't me, it would not have ended so nicely. He let it go however, this is simply not acceptable!

From the outside, it looks dated and compared to all the shiny new hotels on the strip, it doesn't look appealing at all. But, I was surprised how large the room I stayed in was and how well the bathroom looked. The room I stayed in had two queen beds and the usual tv cabinet, desk and plush love seat. The bathroom had wall-to-wall granite, under-mount sink and an elongated toilet - all very well done. Only thing staying here is that isn't much a view of the Strip but I don't really mind since I'd rather be on the Strip then looking over it. 

Bally's is connected to Paris by a tunnel from the casino floor. This is great, if you are like me who thinks a change of scenery will magically bring good luck!

The best part of staying at Bally's is the fact that walking out you are greeted by the Fountains of Ballagio. It is also a short walk to City Center, the newest hotels (as of this writing) on the Strip to the south. It is also a short walk to The Venetian and Caesars Palace to the north. 

If you don't really care that it looks a bit dated, but want to be close to all the action of the Strip and a relatively short stumble back from a great night out, I think Bally's a great choice!",3,0,0

The room was a little dirty.  We found misc things from the past patrons that occupied the room.  We had to pay a Resort fee to use the Wifi and pool (which was closed for renovation as well).  The catch with the Wifi was that you could only use one device.  Never of that before.

The good: Upgraded rooms are nice but I don't think they purchased new mattresses as mine was lumpy and sagged in the middle. 

The bad:  Room service only operates from 6am-1pm.  That's right, no late night breakfast after being out gambling until 2am.

The really bad: The upgraded rooms on the south side of the tower are subjected to the noise from the Chateau night club at the Paris. Generally hotels will let you know this at check-in but they failed to and on my second night there, VERY loud until after 3am. 

In the end, the Front Desk Manager, Ronin, took care of a few of our room charges for the trouble.

I booked a two night stay via the Total Rewards website for a Classic Guest Room for 25\/night. We took a chance on this hotel, being this was the first time we were going to stay here. We loved the location, practically the middle of the strip, the pool, and the service we received at check-in. We were comp'ed a free upgrade after making conversation at the check-in counter. We usually try the ""$20 sandwich"" trick, but there was no need for it this time. The upgrade was great; even though it was in the outdated south tower, I couldn't believe I paid 50 bucks for a suite facing the strip with all the amenities the room had. It worked out since we were 5 deep. Overall, I wouldn't mind staying here again. For the price, you cant beat it. I recommend signing-up for the Total Rewards membership, we got a 45% discount off compared to other websites and if you sign-up online, you can get your card at the TR desk and get $10 playing credit.  

GF Review: Mid 20's

Pros:
Price + awesome free upgrade 
Spacious room (HUGE)!!! Mini Fridge was perfect
Location, Location, location!
Pool was great and spacious! Kid friendly 
White sheets ( Was a little worried because I hate those old red sheets in pics)
5 minutes to check in\/ checked out by using the TV (no wait)

Cons:
Needs a little interior makeover into the 21st century- it honestly just needs flat screens instead of big tubes! But hey VH1 & Espn kept us HAPPY!

Walk to Pool is a little far but worth it! WIsh they had outside showers to wash off
Would stay here again

Not many food options. The food court downstairs only has a few restaurants (stay away from the Nathan's!! Got a nasty stomach virus!). The best choice for a quick bite is the sandwich shop off the casino floor. Cocktail service can be slow (best bring your own).

----------SHORT VERSION:----------
December 2013. Stayed at North Tower
Monorail was being renovated or something, couldn't use that.
Pool also being renovated!
Fire alarm testing at 10am, for maybe 20 minutes straight?
Toilet leaking and LOUD when flushing, had to move rooms it was so bad.
Walls are VERY VERY thin. Could hear the TV from the other room and the obnoxious laughter following.
Room was very far from the elevator, you think they would have the elevator in the middle, but no, just at the far end. *(sucks when you are in heels all night then have to walk through the dirty halls for an extra 10 minutes just to get to your room) *
NO FRIDGE and\/or MICROWAVE
Customer service? HORRIBLE.
NOT worth the extra 18 dollars a day.
No one specified what it was for when we asked. Found out later we could've used it for wi-fi. UH WHY DIDNT THEY TELL US? 
Buffet at Flamingo was overpriced and small -kind of unrelated but since it was total rewards you got a ""discount"" from Ballys when you check in- not worth it at all.
-----------------------------------
Long Version::

We had booked a hotel room online, using the total rewards system. We had comped rooms except for 2 days. We had paid for a reserved room @ the amount of 188 dollars. We received a confirmation email and my boyfriend's card was charged that amount.
However, when we arrived at the casino, the receptionist asked for a card. We assumed it was for any additional charges, such as room service and such. He didn't specify anything about the rate changing, or anything. He seemed to have difficulty looking something up. He couldn't find a price, or something, and had to use a calculator for something. I assumed it was for a deposit on the room that we would get back at the end of our trip, so long as we didn't break anything. (as most hotels do, as I had been to Vegas before and we had a 120 deposit fee we received back. ) Again, nothing was clarified, no receipt or anything was given to us, so I assumed the card was only used as a hold.Later on, when my boyfriend checked his credit card statement, he found out that Bally's had charged him $200.
Unfortunately, that credit card was our extra funds for the weekend. Our funds to get us taxis, possibly splurge on the variety of food Las Vegas had to offer, watch some shows, and pay for our baggage on the way home. 
We went to the receptionist downstairs (a different one) and she stated that when you reserve a room online, you are not charged resort fees and that is why we paid more. However, on the website, it shows that we were charged resort fees of $126. It shows it is added to your reservation and you are thus charged. Our room was comped for 5 days; our trip was 7 days, so we had paid for the 2 days.  The receptionist stated that we weren't charged resort fees when we reserved a room online. I stated we had been, our rooms were comped and that was basically all we were paying for. I showed her the breakdown of prices on my confirmation screenshot. Then she said that the online price we had paid was not finalized. if it wasn't finalized, why was the card charged for 188. We were not told that our rate had changed. Why was it not brought to our attention and why would the check in clerk not be able to find it on the computer, and thus do it on a calculator (which he had to clear multiple times) and charge us an obscure amount?
They didn't care to explain any charges or break it down for us. They basically had an attitude of ""too bad, so sad""
The walls are T-H-I-N!!!! You can hear EVERYTHING from the next room. We had VERY noisy loud laughing neighbors. ALSO Ballys decided to have some random fire alarm test at like 10am on Sunday? WORST way to wake up! And It went on for like 15 minutes. 
Our toilet made horrible screeching sounds and was leaking. They told us they could fix it, which would inconvenience us as we had plans that night, or they could move us to a new room. The latter was less inconvenient, so we quickly packed our 7 days worth of items and moved to a room. There was no ""sorry for your inconvenience"" or anything. Again, a ""too bad, so sad"" attitude.
Our new room ALSO had a very loud toilet. We tried to complain about that but they only offered another room. No comp for the horrible experience or anything.
We are loyal total rewards members and we were treated like trash. Maybe because we look young and irresponsible? we're 24, so we're fairly young, but we had big boy jobs and cars and bills just like everyone else working there.
Bally's had no intention of making our trip better, and only made it worse.
I cannot recommend that anyone stay at Bally's, and I would not have any future business with them",2,0,0

The lady went over some of the details with me.  I like places that have wifi but to tell me that only two devices can connect to wifi is beyond lame.  I pay this much and only get a limited amount?  What kind of service is that? When I got to the hotel, the TV was already on.  A little creepy or is it always on when new guests come?  The remote was not working.  Had to call for help and that took about 30 minutes.  One of the lamps on the night stand did not work. I didn't even bother to call because it wasn't even worth it.  There were only a few lights in the room so it was super dark and dimmed.  Not enough light to take pictures in the room.  The doorknob was really hard to open.  You really have to yank on it to open the door.  Even the guy who came to change the battery had a hard time.  He really had to put effort into loosening the door.  The shower head was super weak.  That's about it.  The ventilation of the hotel is really bad.  I smelled like smoke and wasn't even downstairs for that long.  My family and I stayed here for one night only.  I made sure that only two devices were on the wifi.  The next day, I was about to check out through email.  I opened it to see that I got charged a $14 fee for internet.  How is that possible?  I went down to the lobby to ask them.  The lady was also confused as to why I was charged so she kindly removed it.  That was nice of her but still, I had to make a trip downstairs to take care of it.  All in all, I probably  would not come back here again.  It was a place to sleep and that was that.",5,4,4

The elevators are fast.

Beyond that, leaves much to be desired. Bally's gives impression of being a class establishment, but it isn't. I thought it was a 4-star hotel, feels like 2.5 to 3 most of the time.

Checkin is a total pain. They never have enough clerks working the desk. When I got there, at least 30 people in line and only 3 clerks. Later on I walked by, at least 60 people in line and maybe 5 clerks. Saw what had to be 100 people at one point and maybe 7 clerks. I've never seen such lousy coverage at any hotel. Wouldn't be so bad if they processed the checkin quickly, which they don't do.

They charge you for EVERYTHING. I realize this is Vegas, but some of it was just plain stupid. Worst thing: had to pay $5 to print a boarding pass (after the machine charged me 6 times to print 1 page). I've stayed at motor inns that have a free boarding pass station.

The casino smells like smoke. Yes, it does allow smoking, but the eaters need to be upgraded or the floors cleaned more often or something.

If there was a bellhop or concierge in the lobby I couldn't find it. And the guest services station was never staffed.

I know Vegas is in the desert, but charging $3.50 for a water is nuts.

Booked 2 rooms using EasyClickTravel (highly recommend) for $47\/night and got a free upgrade to a view room.  (Although, it wasn't ready for a few more hours but nothing a little gambling and eating couldn't handle!)  If you decide to upgrade or ask for one, make sure to say you want a view of the fountain show.  We got a view of North of the Strip with a corner view of the water show, which was fine but not exactly what I was hoping for.  

Ok, STORY TIME!

My mom surprised me shitless by wanting to play roulette.  It was my first time actually playing (I always observe and get free drinks) so I decided to play just a few rounds.  $10 min and I put in $30.  Had some cool kids playing at the table, so was feeling good, feeling alright, yeah.  Ok, so the next round, I'm thinking about where to put my last few chips and as I'm placing them down, the dealer waves his hand over the board to signal the end of betting.  He explains that I can't bet anymore (even though I hadn't put down the required minimum) so I apologize and wait for the ball to hit my numbers.  The dealer puts the marker on #33.  No chips on #33....we're all sad... 

JUST THEN..

The guy to my left announces that the ball actually landed on #28!  We all look at the wheel, then at our dealer, who turns pale white because he cleared all the chips off the table.  There's a pause... 

Dealer calls over his supervisor and explains the situation, throwing in the fact that I apparently distracted him and he didn't clearly see that the ball was on 28.  I ask the guy to my right if I messed up and he reassures me that it wasn't my fault.  So we wait for them to review the surveillance cameras.  

THE RESULTS:

YES!  I had a chip on the half mark on #28 and the guy to my right had several chips ON #28 AND a pile of chips on the color.  We high-fived and cheered as I explained to my mom in broken Korean what happened.  After that, I ended up losing my money but it was quite an experience.  

Next day, we decide to play again and go to a random table.  The dealer from the other day gets swapped at the table next to ours and he waves at me, coyly.  Our convo:

Me: ""Aw, man! I want to play at your table!!""
Dealer: ""Why are you over there? Come play here!""
Current Dealer: ""Hey, whats wrong with my table?!?""
Me: ""Nothing!  But he's just awesome!!""

Then, I look across and see the same guys that were playing with me the day before.  Awesome.... I won $35 and would have played more if my mom hadn't lost confidence and suggested we leave immediately.  

I have so many more stories but I'll leave it at one.  Bally's is the bomb diggs.",2,4,1

Checked in around 3:00pm Sunday and the front desk lady Sooso was super patient getting all our family members' 6 rooms on the same floor with 4 of them adjoining. 
Rooms (North Tower Deluxe room) weren't fancy at all, but were very spacious.  
The parking wasn't a crazy far walk from the room like some other LV hotels. 
The pool was a bit of a walk, but it was a good size for swimming laps.
Conveniently connected to the Paris Hotel, so you can easitly walk to it without going outside.

Only 2 minor complaint were:
1) that even though we were on a non-smoking floor (8th), parts of the hallway smelled like someone was smoking
2) the free hotel shuttle to the associated Rio Hotel only runs every 30 minutes and may not fit all those waiting in line, so you may end up waiting close to an hour in the summer heat [not worth it -- just drive!]",2,0,0

I went to the counter, did my $20 tip trick and got upgraded from South to North Tower, w\/ view of the strip and fountain. Huge room for my GF and I, not that we really spent too much time there.

Disclaimer - I've never stayed here.  However, I did, ahem, take a room for a test drive.  Ahem.

Anywhoooo!  The layout of the public areas can be a bit confusing, but I think that's on purpose.  The beds are nice and comfy, and the bathrooms have that posh - we're not in Kansas anymore feel.  They have excellent black out curtains for mid day napping.

We saw the most HILARIOUS thing while waiting for a cab.  A guy on his bachelor party fell out of a cab.  At first we thought he had been hit by something because the sound was so loud.  He was loudly thanking all his boys for coming to Vegas with him.  Gravity was his enemy.  At one point, one of the less drunk pals tossed the groom over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes to try to get him into the hotel.

Oh, but that wasn't really the WORST part of my friends and I's experience at Bally's.
We checked in from 6\/16 and originally supposed to check out at 6\/19. We called to ask them if they can comp us for an extra day and they GLADLY agreed to! So it was Monday and we're all very tired from EDC weekend and we're expecting to just relax in our room for one more night and we get a call asking if we have checked out..
Really? We just double checked with the front desk that we were comped for another day. 
SOOOO long story short they declined our comp to stay another day and so we had to pay $99 to stay one more night when it was clear as day that they agreed to comp us. Then they sent SECURITY to come up to our room and get our payment ASAP when they literally said it was due at CHECKOUT. How are you going to say it's due at check out and then right after we get off the phone and come back from speaking to you guys at the front desk you guys send security to our room to collect payment? 
Then your security has the nerves to just keep the door open when we said we'll be right out. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL IN ALL ASPECTS. 
THEN WE HAD ALL THESE CHARGES ON MY BF'S CARD THAT WASNT EVEN EXPLAINED AT ALL AND THEY DECIDED TO JUST CHARGE IT WITHOUT EXPLAINING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING!
When we were checking out my friends had called a bell person to bring their stuff down and sent another one to load it in their car.

It was a master room with a jacuzzi, king bed and a full bathroom, then a living room with a sofa pull out (and bathroom), and then regular room with two full sized beds (and another bathroom). The rooms weren't updated, but they were nice. They had the sheet comforters (the kind where the blanket that touches your face is washed every time a new guest stays the night). 

Ballys location is perfect too- right in the middle of the strip. I'm not sure how much we paid for our suite, but we comfortably fit 10 people (and that's with only 2 people in the master suite).

The pool was great too. There were plenty of seats and the pool was fun- low key, with small groups of people and not too wild. There was a dj at the pool too. Here are my critiques about the pool though- we had a cabana and reservations were a nightmare. My sister confirmed the cabana multiple times on the phone and in person when she got there on Friday. On Saturday morning, they ""lost"" the reservation again and we were bumped to another cabana, so definitely get there early. The pool servers include gratuity on their checks- just be aware so you don't double tip. And there are two food menus- don't order off the pool menu- my husband ordered chicken quinoa (because everything else was sold out at 11:30 am), and there was no chicken. However, if you order the room service menu, then you have to pay a $5 delivery fee for the first item (and it goes up depending on what you order) on top of gratuity (which isn't really worth it when you don't order a lot).

Anyways, upon checking in they needed some deposit so I covered it. They of course tacked on some ""resort"" fee. I'm trying not to worry about it because I'm on vacation. We got their total rewards card and the woman told us that since we were new sign ups we qualified for a free buffet. Now I'm fucking stoked. Like I'm looking forward to this buffet more than anything else. More than potentially winning the jackpot, to me this IS the jackpot. Alas, the next day when went to redeem this invaluable gift they informed us that we needed 50 points (equivalent to $200) on our cards. I'm devastated and go indulge in 20 Long Island ice teas to ease the pain. So that sucked. 

I was kind of looking forward to checking out the pool area but it small and crowded.  I mean I'm expecting a pool that turns into a bar, water park, and the Bahamas all at the same time, so yeah I'm disappointed. 

On to our actual room. First off, it was literally 2376448292 miles away from the elevator. I had to take an uber just to get from the fucking elevator to the room. Why would there only be one area of elevators when the rooms are so far away? I'm hungover and don't want to walk!!!! 

The room was really large. I mean like 5000 square feet. The problem with all of this space? Why don't we make the room smaller and put more money into a quality bed. That bed felt like I was sleeping on a bed of nails. I mean I appreciate  the Kings table in our room but I'd much rather have a comfortable bed.  Oh and the balcony door didn't open so I didn't have the option of getting  naked and flailing off the building during a drunken delusion of grandeur. 

Anyways, at the very end we had some confusion with the bill but for 3 days it came out to about $500 and we stayed during the week. Overpriced for what it was. I'll happily return to The Scabies Inn next time, at least I'm not expecting much there!!!",4,21,2

I booked directly through the hotel, as all of the ""discount"" websites offered higher prices when you add on the resort fee. 

We got to the hotel about 2pm on a weekday and were greeted by what we thought were concierge workers (wydham timeshare sellers) and they talked us into taking a ""tour"" the next day... more on that later... anyway, we went to the self check in kiosk and checked in. Now, I have stayed at rooms around the country and practicality is #1 with me, along with cleanliness. This room was great for both of these things. The only thing I wish they had was a coffee maker in the room. I loved that it had a bath tub, a couch and plenty of towels\/toiletries. 

What i didnt like was the fact that they stated that internet was free (lie), they charged me for calling them (1.25 each call), and for parking ($10 a day). One of the suggestions someone had on here was to add parking to your room (totally do it!). 

The biggest issue I had was not being able to add an extra night easily and for the same price. After the Wyndham tour (all 5 hours, not 2 like they said), we decided to stay an extra night since it was our honeymoon. I spent about 2 hours on the phone and we offered to switch rooms, or hotels (apparently Wyndham owns Ballys, Linq, Flamingo, and a whole bunch of other hotels), so we didnt think it would be a problem. We ended up having to pay $40 more than what we paid for 2 nights and we were moved to the Linq. I will post a review about the Linq on their page, but that was um... interesting. 

I guess overall, I was surprised that Wyndham wasnt more accomodating. I know we stayed in the Indigo tower, but our money is just as good as anyone else's. 

I'm glad we were in the middle of the strip because we bought bus passes and took it everywhere, so staying at Ballys was wonderful for that. 

One more thing they offered us and we didnt use (and it states that if you dont use it, they wont charge you, but they did charge us), was for the high roller. The deal was $20 total for 2 people for a daytime ride. ""Daytime"" is 11:30am-7pm (not daytime in my opinion). I was still charged. 

While gambling in the casino, we had drinks offered to us constantly and a great few cocktail waitreses. I didnt win anything, as it seemed like the machines were tight. 

We checked out pretty good with the app, but my only complaint about the app is that the confirmation number is on the front page and unless you write it down, when you turn to the next page you have to type it in. 

Overall, we had a great time and we would stay at Bally's again, but I would fight the extra\/unnecessary charges (I might still give them a call). It was quiet, clean, and practical. Again, see the continuation of our stay on the Linq page where we had to move to.",2,0,0

Alrighty, here goes:

Rooms:

Bally's could've really had waaaaaay more people manning the check-in counter on Saturday night of Labor Day weekend.  They, literally, had 3 people working...while a line of a billion people stared angrily at the employees.  I mean, c'mon...you'd expect crowds, right?

AA Vacations someone effed up our reservations and the Bally's employee taking care of us at  check-in was a complete b*tch.  (However, the other employee who we spoke with after our reservation was cleared up was a total sweetheart who completely hooked my friends up with an awesome, awesome room!  Props to her!)

The rooms are decent - old and had no good airflow, but whatever.  It'd do for two nights. The view of the Strip is nice, though!  

Food Options:
The restaurant\/cafe here is pretty good.  They have a $11 express breakfast buffet lunch (which seems like a good deal).  $5 mimosas available.

The tequila\/Mexican bar next to it offers up $1 margaritas ($2 if you want strawberry) and they are preetttty strong for the price!  Down a couple of those and you're pretty much set.

If you go to the lower level, there's a couple shops, the sports lounge and a food court!  There's a 24 hour Sbarro's for your reference...'cuz we didn't know about it until our second night there.

The sports lounge's bar serves up mimosas for $6 and these were, by far, the best mimosas of the trip!  Our bartender was awesome!

Valet:
Pretty fast!   I was impressed, considering we were there on a holiday weekend.  Nice job!

FYI - Bally's is also connected to Paris and offers a shuttle to Rio.",2,0,0

I met friends here for a girls weekend. I was originally booked into the Indigo Tower at a lower rate. But my friends had rooms in the Jubilee Tower so I upgraded my room. The front desk person was helpful and got me a room as close to my friends as possible. I was told that the normal up charge was $50 per night, but she was only going to charge me $30. My room faced the Paris Eiffel Tower and Bellagio fountains. The view from 6905 could not have been better. My friends had rooms farther from the elevators and they all commented on the loud music from the fountains. I think that it stops at midnight. I use the White Noise app for sleep and I never heard anything from the fountains, people above, to the side or in the hall while using the app. The room was gorgeous, just like the photos.  Plenty of towels, a hairdryer, a small fridge (and not a minibar) and for the first time I have ever experienced in Vegas, a coffee maker!!!!!! I left housekeeping $5 each day and always had the coffee restocked.  Check in lines are lengthy, casino is relatively small and slots are tight. Paris and Bally's share a parking garage and are connected underground which greatly expands dining and gambling options. The sports book is terrible so if that is important to you, realize that you are going to go elsewhere to watch your games. I only ate at one food court place so I cannot comment on their restaurants. They have Lagunitas on tap. I was holding a glass, normally, and it shattered in my hand. The staff was highly attentive. No injuries, but I was told that this was not the first time that had happened. I was able to get my iPhone hooked up to the wifi, but not my iPad.

Plus we got a 4-night package including flight from SFO for $400 for two!

PROS:
- our room was clean and HUGE (twice the size of an average room) with floor to ceiling windows
- bed was decent
- request for a high-floor (above 16) room was granted, no need to upgrade to the Jubilee Tower for extra fee
- half price ticket booth for shows and restaurants was right in front of Bally's
- check out online from the room was fast and easy
- fast wifi included with daily resort fee

CONS:
- casino 1st floor was dark and dreary.
- garage is a long walk from the hotel lobby.
- restaurants too pricey (and empty)
- service for reasonably priced Mexican taqueria was REAL slow.
- beware there's a resort fee ($32\/day) attached to your total room cost.
- do not drink the water! Get ice from the filtered ice machine and let it melt.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Le Cafe in Paris Hotel (through the tunnel connection from Bally's) was reasonably priced and served large portions.
- Bakery in Paris was great for a danish and coffee in the morning.
- Shake Shack (like In-N-Out, but better) was delicious, especially the frozen custard.
- Wicked Spoon for brunch (buffet for dinner would put us in a food coma for the shows).
- Bouchon Brasserie - gotta order the burger, skip their beignets - too cakey & dense.
- Serendipity 3 was good for desserts (pricey), but skip the food - very salty. The frozen hot chocolate was overrated.
- Shows: Michael Jackson One, Mat Franco (illusionist), Terry Fator (ventriloquist). I liked the last two the best, both were winners of America's Got Talent.",0,0,0

I finally realized that the space is left vacant so guests can request roll away beds via housekeeping. Genius!

In addition to a great view, our room came with mini fridge and fully stocked coffee maker. Right outside our room was the ice machine and 

The location is perfect as it's right across from Cromwell's \/ Drai's Beach Club, Caesars and Bellagio. A few minutes walk away from great shopping and my favorite pizza at the Cosmo.

We stayed in a Jubilee king room. The side we were on, was next to Paris, so it was just a little loud on the weekend evenings. Not a big deal, just closed the drapes, and was able to go away in a nice slumber.

The room was huge. I like the decor and vibe of the design. It was upbeat and fun, but not Austin-Tacious or austere. The only downside to the room  that I could find was that it didn't have a bathtub and only had a large shower. However, the shower was very nice. Sort of a rainfall style shower head. And the bathroom, that was really big once again.
The king bed was comfortable and the pillows were great. Four pillows to the bed, each one of us had a chance to use one and hold one so we could sleep comfortably. The room was able to be temperature gage on our own as well. Which was great, when it got cold at night we could turn the heat up a little, and in the day when it was much warmer, turn it down.
The staff that we encountered at the hotel, from the front desk to the chambermaids, where pleasant and accommodating. Much more than I have found in some of the other hotels. They all seemed like they really enjoyed the job that they had. Everyone said hello and was generally interested in what we had to say. Or so it seemed.

We didn't have a chance to play anything in the casino, although it seems a little small, I'm okay with that. I don't really go to Las Vegas to gamble. 
The valet out front was easy to use, and your car would arrive in about two minutes. Even on the weekend evenings.

All in all, I would come here again and have decided to make this our home hotel when we stay in Las Vegas moving forward.",7,0,0

I was so excited to stay at the Bally's Hotel in Vegas for a huge birthday celebration but trying to contact the hotel was a disaster. They outsource their reservation staff so they know absolutely nothing about the hotel. I booked a huge penthouse for the weekend and I wanted to know the specific amenities included with the room. They had no idea. They said there should be iPod hookups and a fridge. But they kept me waiting on the phone while they called the hotel to check. They were still unclear. 

When we showed up the room was huge and gorgeous but hadn't been updated in years. It was still all 70's looking with the old white leather couches and mirrored roll up tables. The bar area was old and small and had a HUGE tape recorder\/CD sound system. No iPod hookups or anything and then the hotel had nothing to offer us to play music for all of our guests in this huge suite. 

A ceiling access door was also open and I called to have it shut twice and no one ever showed. There was also no ice machine on our floor...no idea why, but we had to go down a floor to get ice each time. 

We paid so much for this room for a huge birthday and it seemed like they hadn't really taken the time to update the rooms that need to be updated the most.

The real gag moment was the pool area. The floater barrier has the most disgusting ring of filth around each floatie thing and the tile border is crumbling, also with its layer of scum and filth. There are hundreds of lounge chairs, a huge pool and ONE SHOWER. If they at least advertised the ONE SHOWER or installed more I'm sure people could rinse off their tanning oil before making the pool worse. On that note, I did enjoy the pool (even with the floating cockroach in it), didn't mind the loud constant passing monorail, and got my tan on.

The rooms were disgusting... Smelled musty\/smokey and there were cigarette burns\/holes in the furniture (this was a non-smoking room). The paint was peeing everywhere, and the wall that held the closet doors was not even connected to the floor or ceiling. Our bathroom did not have a ventilation fan which cause it to smell moldy, and the shower curtain was old, and I believe it never had been washed ever. 

Yes... In Vegas you are paying for a place to sleep and that is pretty much it - but I would rather not sleep in an ashtray every night and bathe in a scum shower. Every other hotel\/casino figured out the concept of ventilation and we never really smelled any smoke.

It has a great location on the strip (dead center) but I would rather spend $10-20 more and stay at the Luxor, Flamingo, or anywhere else for that matter.

I was a little apprehensive about staying here based on the reviews, but I would stay here again! 
I'm writing a review on the hotel itself from the perspective of someone who wanted to stay at a more affordable location. We also didn't gamble for more than one night. 

Location: unbeatable! There's a CVS a block away, and so many great hotels are close by for Vegas. Everything is a bit further away because the hotels are so huge, but Bally's was right next to Bellagio, The LINQ, Caesars palace, etc. 

Room: our stay was in a room in the Jubilee Tower. The 20 dollar trick worked for us to get us from the Indigo Tower to jubilee, and the room was great! Clean, didn't smell like smoke, decent view. 

Service: waiting at the front desk took 15 minutes ish each time, but we could have used the electronic kiosks if we had wanted to. Front desk was pretty unhelpful when we called late at night, but we weren't too picky because our requests were trivial.
We chose not to get our room cleaned during our stay just to be safe! Some comments said they had gotten their things stolen, so we chose to tidy after ourselves to reduce that risk. 

That sums up our stay I think. I would do it again! PS we also did the Take A Break thing if anyone has any questions about that.

- Our ""suite"" was old, outdated, and dirty.  Carpet faded, stained, pulling up in the middle.  Popcorn ceiling falling down in places.  Shower head and knob falling out of the wall.  Worn and frayed chairs.  Furniture at least 25 years old.
- Found a used tampon applicator in the bathroom upon check-in.  Took an hour and two phone calls to maintenance\/housekeeping for a housekeeping manager and housekeeper to come check out the situation.  Had to explicitly ask them to sanitize all surfaces (some of which had water stains that would have obviously come up had they been cleaned properly the first time).  Had to ask a second time when the housekeeper tried to leave after removing the tampon and sanitizing the bathroom

Flew into Vegas relatively late on Thanksgiving Day to go see The Grand Canyon with the family, so needed a quick inexpensive hotel.  Bally's had online rates of $40 per night, so I thought I'd get 2 rooms.  Ok, that's where the good ended.
The bad:
   - They charge $30 extra per person, per night, for occupants more than 2 per room.
   - They add $35 per night, per room, on as a ""resort fee"" which gives you high speed internet, access to the pool and gym
   - The high speed internet isn't very high speed, but they are happy to charge you more for ""higher speed"" internet
   - There were food crumbs on the floor when we checked into the room, so not the greatest at keeping the rooms clean
   - The beds SUCKED, they we old and hard
   - You can't get the room dark - the lights on the hotel are like the sun, and the curtains don't close all the way
   -  The alarm clock was set to go off in the middle of the night
   - The self parking is a million miles away from check-in (you should consider dropping bags off at hotel entrance before parking the distance is so long)
   - Probably, like other Vegas casinos, you have to walk through the smoke-filled casino to get from the check-in desk to the elevators up to the rooms.
   - quick food was outrageously priced, poor service and quality.  The lady who made the steak subs could not have moved any slower.

If you are price conscience, stay here, but just expect to always walk to nearby hotels for beautiful scenery, shopping, etc.  If it were a special occasion or I'm showing someone Vegas, I would not go to Ballys.  If it was for myself, I'd stay here.

Pros
- Location - right in the middle of the strip, across from Bellagio, walkable to forum shops, walkable to anywhere, it's in the middle.
- Price - Sign up for a Total Rewards card and you can get free nights during weekdays and cheap rates for weekends (~$70)
- Lower limits - Relatively lower limits, it's $5 usually until about 8pm then it goes to $10-15
- Free Shuttle to Rio - Feeling a Seafood Buffet? There is a free shuttle to Rio
- Hotel Staff - Extremely Extremely friendly front desk.  Ashlyn at the front desk made every statement like a slot machine win

Cons
- Security - There is no guard to make sure you have a room key to get up to your room.  I had prostitutes approach me in my hotel room hallway and I also saw a guy trying a room key on every door.  I guess he must've found it on the floor.  Good luck trying every room in the hotel.  I got at least two pizza togo flyers shoved under the door.  Again, if there was security, this wouldn't have happened.
- Phone Connectivity - My AT&T LTE suffered a lot here.  It just didn't work.  I couldn't check email or chat in the casino.  In the hotel room, it worked.
- Internet Speed - You pay $13.99\/day and the internet is HORRIBLE.  We're talking pages that don't load and youtube video that stops loading.  Speedtest shows 2.68mbps download \/ 0.36 upload (at least when it's working)
- Hotel Noise - Yes, you can hear loud people walking through the hall and you can hear people in their rooms, but I didn't have problems with people waking me up in the morning
- Homeless People - Yes, there are homeless people on the side of the entry.
- Patrons - These are people staying in Vegas at a budget.  People are usually dressed in polo shirts or regular sweaters and it kind of takes away from the Vegas image
- Bar - Usually you play a card game at the bar and they give you the drinks on tip.  Ballys does not.  You pay for your drinks.  Some guy was confused when he gave $1 and the worker said ""we don't accept tips.""  It's because they want you to pay $6 for the beers.
- Front Desk is unavailable - I'm being picky here, but I called twice to front desk from my room, once on a Tuesday and once on a Saturday morning, both times I had to wait for someone to become available.

Other Notes
- Rooms - You can't compare these to Wynn or Venetian or Cosmo, etc.  The rooms work just fine.  Yes, you can hear loud people in the hallway and they can hear you ""talking"" if you know what I mean

Tip
- Try asking for an upgrade for the room.  I just asked nicely and they bumped me up to North Towers",5,3,0

Take a look at how cozy it was (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1HAT4kU).  What you don't see on the pic is the rest of the table with 3 more chairs, a sink and small fridge next to my bed, and a sectioned bathroom. That fridge was a huge bonus since I had a lot drinks I bought from Walgreens and ABC Stores and it kept them nice and cold.  

And though it wasn't a Strip view out my window, it was still pretty nice to look at at night (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1AqdUkd).  This was very pleasing to the eye when I took my occasional time-out from the Strip.

When we checked into Bally's, we were automatically upgraded to junior suite. One spacious suite with california king size bed, pretty big bathroom, a vanity room with a sink, and walk-out balcony.

-The bars in the casino, the ones with slots at the bar -- warning! Their wine is the lowest quality alcohol ever...so awful. Amazing. Stick to spirits if you are there. wow...

ROOM EXPERIENCE (we had a standard size room):
-Numerous room lights did not work.
-Cheapo lamps are really tacky
-No vent in bathroom so it's a real steam room after a shower, unless door is left completely open.
-Towels need replacing - getting Motel. 6-thin!

-Hairdryer in bathroom was super tiny and had a short cord, real piece of junk

OTHER:

I'd say the only bummer is the parking structure is shared with Paris so it's a small walk through Paris through the casino then to check in but Paris and ballys are connected\/sister hotels so you're all inside once you leave the structure.

The reason I am giving 3 stars is because right outside our room there was some construction going on which isn't a big deal for us.

This was a nice enough hotel, though checking in did take forever. I don't blame the hotel staff though, they had a tour bus of non-natives trying to check in, so there was some confusion.

After getting through that, we checked out our hotel room. It was nice and clean, though admittedly a bit dated. Still, enough for us to work as a resting point when we weren't in the casinos or walking the boardwalk.",3,1,0

Being able to duck into a\/c after a hot block-long walk (more intense than it sounds, given the size of a Vegas block), would make Bally's A-OK on its own.

There are a few useful or noteworthy things here.  First, is the free shuttle out to the Rio Hotel.  Use this.  Do not make the mistake I did of thinking you can walk to the Rio because you're a good walker.  Second, there's an internal connecting passage to one of my favorite hotels, Paris.  Third, there is a monorail stop, and a pedestrian bridge across to either Bill's or Bellagio.  Fourth, there is a stand just past the connecting walkway to Paris which sells slushy booze drinks.

Gambling here, I've had moderate success, but I don't find the casino particularly compelling, and there are no worthy restaurant options that I know of.  Mostly, I seem to stop by when I'm on my way to somewhere else.",3,2,2

Review #2:
Bally's = well, I thought I would hate this place, but you know, it's alright; I think it defines ""average"" and ""mid-scale"" as far as Las Vegas goes, but it would be a pretty nice place in a smaller town; it's literally attached to Paris, which is a solid step upwards vs. Bally's; a decided lack of good dining options - other than the steakhouse, everything is lower-end; the dealer women (not hot chicks) have to wear god-awful uniforms or ugly Hawaiian-style shirts; there's a gay nightclub here, which seems strange in such a non-hip casino; the 26th floor has some mostly empty big conference rooms with good views of The Strip; best craft brew bet = um, not good...maybe get a Rogue Dead Guy ale from the casino sundries shop.",2,2,0

As we arrived in the hotel, we went to the front desk and they gave us our room. I won't mention the room number here.  When we went up to our room, we noticed 2 queen beds and a very strong cigarette smell. We wanted a king bed and a non-smoking room.  It is a non-smoking room but i smelled like cigarette.

We called the front desk and asked if we could be transferred to a room with a king size bed. They been told us that there were no other rooms available. So we decided to settle in. As we were checking out the room we noticed that the air conditioner does not turn on. The actual thermostat control has no power at all. It was hot inside the room. We also noticed that the smoke alarm was dangling on the ceiling. We called the front desk again and told them about the non-working things and they said they were going to send someone to our room. We decided to wait but after an hour we called the front desk again and told them that no one came to our room to fix the air conditioner and the smoke detector. They told us someone was going to come.

After two hours we called the front desk again and they said the maintenance person will come to our room next. We arrived the hotel at around 8 o'clock and went up to our room around 830. At this time it was already 1030 and we have not eaten dinner yet. We called the front desk again and told them that we are so hungry and cannot wait any longer for the maintenance person to just come in a room and repair the air-conditioner and return the dangling smoke detector.

We left our room and had dinner then came back and everything was working. That night, I took a shower and noticed that the water wasn't going down the drain. It went up and up and up. Basically the shower was not working.

Considering that this hotel was recently renovated, this room where we were was very crappy and people at the front desk did not seem to care about our needs. Will I go back to this hotel? No.",0,0,0

The highlight of the first visit was that my folks got their two separate rooms upgraded to a suite because they mentioned it was a family reunion (and also insisted on non-smoking), so that would've been 4 stars easily.

As for this visit, we got a 2-bed place on the 18th floor, which apparently was a free upgrade of some sort for us as we had already paid for the room beforehand and were insistent on having a non-smoking room. It was reasonable, I guess - better than my previous recent stays and Stratosphere and Circus Circus, respectively - but the TV size location in the recessed armoire was kinda crappy because I couldn't see it clearly from all around the room. And before you laugh at me for watching so much TV, well, if you don't choose to gamble much and you're tired after walking around the Strip all day, you might be in your room watching TV as well. Oh, and the room was as far from the elevators as you can get - yay, sore feet!

Still, the location was quite awesome, as we were within easy walking distance of all the good casinos - Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood, the City Center hotels, etc. Since you can get a reasonable rate here compared to those other places, I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a reasonable deal at the heart of the Strip.",1,0,1

I have had the opportunity to stay at most of the hotels on The Vegas Strip, and Ballys at first glance looks like a tired old man at a rave.  It was ""renovated"" in 1981, but it honestly looks like it hasn't been touched since it opened in 1967.

The location itself of Bally's Hotel & Casino is fabulous.  It is mere minutes walking distance from all the new big attractions on the strip.

The staff at the registration desk were quite nice, and apologetic for the 20 minute line I had the joyous opportunity to wait in.

My booking was thankfully for the newly renovated Jubilee! Tower, which I was able to upgrade to a suite for a mere $20 more.  Since the hotel ""convenience charge"" was $16 a day, it was really only $4 a night to upgrade.

The Jubliee! Rooms are brand new.  I mean, literally they were opened formally a few days before my arrival.  The rooms were pristine, everything was brand new, and I couldn't possibly come up with a problem if there was a gun pointed to my head.

Some of my colleagues were not so lucky.  One in particular was originally put in the old tower and upon entering his room immediately had an allergy attack because of the mold levels.  His quick search found mold deposits throughout the bathroom from leaking pipes that appeared to be at least a year left untouched.  After calling to the front desk he was immediately upgraded to a suite in the Jubilee! Tower at no additional cost.

I spent the majority of my time in the convention center upstairs.  I must admit, it was a welcome change to be on the top floor for meetings rather than in the basement (most hotels everywhere).  This is where the 70's was very apparent.  The long hallway to the meeting rooms was encased with large patio doors that were welded shut and clad in window coverings that reminded me of staying at my grandmother's house.  According to a staff member they had to weld the doors to the multitude of tiny patios shut due to overwhelming suicides in the 80's.  Charming.

The décor was straight out of American Hustle.  Tired design, old carpets, fading paint, and wall sconces right out of Elvis' Graceland.  The meeting rooms themselves were no different.

The Casino at Bally's Hotel & Casino was average.  It wasn't as updated as Aria, but it was nowhere near Eliis Island.  There are only two bars (technically 1.5) and they are extremely hard to find.  The styling of the casino floor needs an interior decorator under the age of 49, as everything has this old uncle style going on.

The gym was decent.  If it wasn't for the fiasco of what was required for entry I wouldn't have had a problem.  I called the front desk before I departed, and they advised I only needed my key card for entry.  After walking the 15 minutes to the gym, I was advised differently and had to walk 15 minutes back to my room, only to walk 15 minutes back to the gym.  Yes, it actually is a loooong walk.  By the time I got into the gym, I had no time for a workout.

All in all, if you arte able to get into the Jubilee! Rooms it's a cheap way to get yourself in the center of The Strip so you can enjoy yourself outside of Ballys.",5,1,0

Positives:
1. Cheap - you can probably get rates from $40 on weekdays to as cheap as $100-150 for weekends

2. Location - smack dab in the middle of the strip, right across from Caesars \/ Bellagio 

3. New recent add ons - I have not been to ballys in about two years but they added a food court and sports book at the back and all these shops out front. 

4. Table mins - if you aren't a big gambler this is probably a good place to start. Table mins are as low as $5 during the day and $10 at night

Negatives:
1. Room felt smoky \/ dirty. Ceiling was stained. Potential leaks from the floor? 

2. Dealers - most seem to hate life. One poker dealer got in an altercation with a player. Expect tips on every win or they hate you. 

3. Smaller casino \/ only about 1 or 2 poker tables going on. Not that much action, so this might be your place if you like that. I guess this was a positive for me since I had a positive couple poker sessions.

It's connected to Paris so you get two casinos and double the restaurants and shops without every having to step foot outdoors. Then when you do go outside you have an outdoor strip right at the door step! It's just a few steps from the Bellagio (which I could see the fountains from my room) and all the other hotel\/casinos in that area. We were able to walk a few mins to shows in Planet Hollywood and have drinks at the Cosmo. For a first timer on a budget I chose right! The actual restaurants in the hotel we didn't try as they seemed pretty mediocre but with everything so close it didn't matter. The staff was very nice and accommodating while we were there though we didn't need them much. The rooms are spacious and clean and that's all that really matters for me when I stay in a hotel.

My family and I come to Vegas every Christmas. This time, he had a business trip and wanted to take us. He chose Bally's because of its location and the prices was reasonable. This is the first time we have stayed here so here I go....

The walk from the garage to the check-in desk, don't care. It can be far for other people but we didn't mind. The check-in was hassle free. My husband asked for an upgrade. The front desk agent said, if we didn't like the room, to come down and he can upgrade us. Cool! Finding the elevators was a bit confusing but we found it. I noticed right away, the elevators were dirty. Just trash inside of them and fingerprints and marks all over the mirrors. Not a good sign. And I was right.

We found our room. Right next to our hotel room door was a bag full of trash. I guess the cleaning service set it there and forgot? That was sign #2. We went inside the hotel room and I didn't want to say anything to my husband but when he finally mentioned it was filthy....thank God it wasn't just me. There was tape on the ceilings, it looked like no one ever dusted the place, there was trash inside the dressers, the toilet was bubbling with foam (no joke!) ...I felt like I was catching a disease just standing there. I could go on but I attached pictures instead.

My husband went down to the front desk and asked for a different room. He tried showing the front desk agent the pictures of the room and he didn't want to see them. We did get a bigger and ""cleaner"" room. 

I know Bally's has been around forever but if what we stayed in was an upgraded room, they need to upgrade again. Maybe do some serious training on cleanliness.

Duration: 5 Nights (8\/1-8\/6)
Room Type: 2 Queen Beds, Indigo Tower

For this being my very first visit to Las Vegas ever (outside of a 3 hour lay over I had when I was a kid), Bally's Hotel made a terrible impression on me. Thankfully the convention and events I partook in helped to reverse my feelings!

CHECK-IN:
Checking in was an absolute nightmare, until I got to the counter. I flew in from the Bay Area where the weather was in the 70's, so when I stepped off the plane, and it was 106, I wasn't the happiest guy, but I still kept an open mind.

Now when I got to the hotel, thankfully there was AC blasting, but I had to wait in line for 30-40 minutes just to get checked in. There were only 2 people checking guests in, with 1 person down at the Mail & Keys line (which was empty), and 2 people at the Platinum Member Registration check-in (which was also empty). I got to the Hotel and into the line at 2:40PM , however I didn't get checked in until 3:15PM - 3:20PM. I could have done the Kiosk Express check-in but I have heard bad stories regarding the express check-in.

Thankfully the lady at the counter was super nice and funny, and was able to put a smile on my face.


STAY \/ DURATION:
I was the first of my party to check-in and was tired from both the heat, which I'm not used to, and traveling in general. So I wanted to relax in my room, where I could blast the AC, and maybe get some room service as all I had for food that day was a small lunch before my flight (a bagel sandwich). Now here's where I really got irritated. Bally's does not have Room Service past 1PM. They have a breakfast service from 6AM - 11AM and then a lunch service from 11AM - 1PM. That's right, absolutely no dinner service. I understand the idea of being in Vegas is for you to explore the strip, but I still think it's crap they don't provide a dinner or late night service.

Next was the Wifi. There is only one option available from what I saw and that was the ""Basic Plan."" If you pay the resort fee \/ have the resort package, which I did, it's included in said fee. If you don't have a package or pay said fee, it's $14.99 per 24 hours. Now, that's not too bad, but the service absolutely sucked! Not only did it take an average of 5 minutes for my device to connect, when it did, the download speed was horrid! Most of the time I couldn't do anything on my phone. More so, my reception sucked, even when I had 4\/5 bars. As a guy who works in IT, seemed like they have some type of ""net"" that disrupts your data usage when you're not on their wifi, but I can't be 100% sure.

The one positive thing, however, was the housekeeping. They were always on time, and I mean extremely prompt, and wonderful when we exchanged pleasantries. Additionally, I love pillows and I needed more than 3. The guy I talked to at housekeeping was able to get my room 4 extra pillows when supposedly the extra limit is only 2. THANK YOU HOUSEKEEPING!


CHECK-OUT:
Check was probably the easiest out of everything my party and I went through. Had payed all fees up front, so all we had to do was hand in our keys, get a paper saying everything had already been paid in full, and we were out.


CONCLUSION:
For my first time being in Vegas, outside of the airport at least, I was severely disappointed. My friend and I have already decided on a few other places we would much rather stay, even if we have to pay 2-4 times what we did at Bally's. Won't be coming back.",1,0,0

First, we stayed in the Jubilee Tower, in a Jubilee King Non-Smoking room. It was fantastic!

Our room measured more than 430 square feet with a desk, lounge furniture, and very comfortable pillow-top king size bed. The décor was very modern and everything was very clean. The bathroom was awesome too. Our room featured an upgraded marble bathroom with a huge shower. Everything seemed like-new and the staff kept everything very clean. 

The room also came equipped with a refrigerator, iDevice docking station, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, clock radio, wireless internet access (which is included in the resort fee), USB charging ports, a flat-screen TV with cable, and in-room movies.

Our room had a Las Vegas Strip view, looking right out onto the Paris Eiffel Tower and we could just see the Bellagio fountains as well. The view really made the experience so amazing! We kept our curtains open almost the entire time. It was so beautiful day or night. 

In addition to loving our room at Bally's we also enjoyed the casino. Plus, Bally's is so conveniently located. It's connected to Paris, so you can walk through the tunnel\/hall from Bally's casino straight into Paris, which was awesome! Plus, it's in the middle of the strip, so you can *very* easily walk to The Linq, The Flamingo, Paris, Planet Hollywood, The Bellagio, etc. On top of all of that, there are tons of shops around! Bally's actually has its own shopping plaza, which was awesome, and the Miracle Mile shops are also within walking distance. There are also plenty of cheap food spots around and a Walgreens that's easily within walkable distance, in case you need to pick up cheap travel supplies or alcohol. 

I honestly couldn't recommend Bally's more. This was our first Vegas trip, so the next time we go we may end up staying somewhere else, just for the experience. But, I can tell you now, if the next place we stay doesn't beat Bally's then we'll be back for the following visit, because we loved it!",21,1,5

I was staying at this property for a conference and educational series so I didn't have much choice about where to stay - it was part of the package.  Anyway, it was a forced upgrade into the Jubilee Tower which was fine since the rooms were supposed to be renovated. The first issue was the elevators - I found out that there were problems with the elevators and only one was working.  It took forever (literally 10-15 minutes) every time we wanted to go up or down, stopping at every single floor and it was always packed.  Then I walked into the room, and that was the first negative.  I don't know what was supposed to have been upgraded, but it felt and smelled old and cheap.  Whatever, it is what it is and I settled in.  

Then came the the bad part.  

Halfway through my stay, I came back to my room to find that the door had been left unlatched and it swung open easily.  I had only been out for about an hour and housekeeping had been in to clean in the meantime so I assumed it was them.  I immediately contacted the front desk who called housekeeping, who then referred me to security.  No one wanted to take responsibility for assisting me and I kept getting transferred.  Well, finally someone an EMT came up to fill out the report.  In addition to being scared that my room was not secured, I also saw that my belongings had been tampered with and $370 in cash vouchers had been stolen.  My room was changed - no one offered to come and help me carry the 3 suitcases that I was dragging across the hotel.   I was also given a paper for Risk Management and was told that someone would contact me regarding the stolen items. 

No one did contact me and I left several messages over several days before finally calling the Paris office and having someone direct transfer me.  This was after I had just called the same number and no one picked up.  Seems like they only answer their own calls.  Anyway, the woman who answered was rude and said that they have an insurance company reviewing it.  

I spoke to the insurance company and they told me that my claim was denied because housekeeping filled out a statement saying she didn't take the money, it was confirmed that the locks were working, that the door had not been tampered with and there were no security cameras in that area.  Um, ok, so a couple things here.  What person admits to stealing money??  What casino\/hotel does not have cameras everywhere?  Isn't Bally's liable even if the housekeeper left the door open for someone else to steal from my room?? 

I asked for a lock report as to what keys has been used to enter if the locks were working.  They confirmed that they had a report, but refused to answer that one and told me to get a subpoena.  Yeah, so you can answer all the questions that make you look like you investigated, but can't answer the one that would definitely say whether I used my key (or if the room was open)  to get back into the room to call security?  

They told me that as far as they were concerned the case was closed, Bally's was not liable and to sue them if I thought I had a case.  

All in all a horrible experience.  As a woman traveling alone for work, I would NEVER stay here again, even if were offered free.  It is UNSAFE, UNCLEAN and the WORST customer service I have ever received.  I ended up leaving a day early because I just could not take it anymore - it was that bad.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",10,0,1

It was our first time staying here. The reason we chose Bally's was it was less expensive. Don't know why this particular weekend was so expensive but this fell in our budget. 

We drove from Los Angeles straight to the hotel. Got there on a Friday at 4pm (check in time) Valet was a breeze. The attendant was helpful and quick. Check in process was quick and smooth. They have kiosks to electronically retrieve your room info and keys. We got up to the room and surprisingly it was very spacious! The most modern? No... But spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable as could be!

Casino floor isn't huge but not small by any means. My wife and I enjoyed the casino and the prompt service of the waitresses that you don't receive at the ""fancier"" hotels. Even though we had our vehicle. I didn't even get it from valet until we checked out. Because of it's central location, we were in quick easy walking distance to everything!

I think the answer has so many facets, all need to be touched upon even if only for a sentance or quicker mention.  The Room: well appointed with a refrigerator, internet if you pay an additional hotel fee, (free or less costly would be a welcome implimentation) a nice view of the Bellagio fountain, not enough water pressure in the modern, glass enclosed shower.
 The Gaming: Great Bloody Mary's at the sports book, projectors for big screens are looking grainy, may need updating soon. Beaten up floor in the main casino, pit bosses and dealers were polished and helpful.
 The Restaurants: SEA was atrocious, the breakfast joint by the escalator is worth stopping in for a meal or two. Nosh is also good for a quick breakfadt bite.
  Shopping: The downstairs mall is not good for gamblers that want to get to the sports book as merchants are constantly badgering you to sell their wares.  
 Staff: Hit and miss, the ""free show"" lobby pitch was really getting under my skin as it was a constant in my day, everyday, multiple times a day with poor attitudes to boot.
 Valet were chock full of information, bartenders lacked in personality and appearance, housekeeping was top shelf with personality and work eithic.

Left NYC at 6am so by the time we landing in LV it was very early. We did early check in for $20. Thought that was great because it wouldve been so long to wait for checkin.
Location is awesome, you are right in the middle of everything. They have a food court with lots of food options. The hotel is connected to the Paris, which has a yummy buffet and good food options. 
No problems with the room. It was spacious and the bathroom spacious nice and clean!
Pool was big & i remember any ladies walking around doing drink service. The monorail runs above and right next to the pool, no biggie but might bother some
People. Never had a problem getting a chair at the pool , they do allow kids in the pool.
One thing that did bother me: they did not check if you were a hotel guest to go into the pool & this happened on more then one day i was there.

Upon check in, the agent was soft spoken and I had to try hard to listen over all the casino noise but it was a very smooth process. I was glad to be able to check in early around noon but there were maybe only 3 agents working. Since it was a comp stay, a credit card was not required for incidentals unless I was going to use the internet or make phone calls. I am glad the agent gave us that option rather than requiring a credit card. The room was nice and clean and so was the bathroom. It went through renovations, but the TV was still old school. Nothing spectacular to report about but no complaints either.

I absolutely love the perks of being in a convenient location that Bally's offers. Located smack dab on the middle of the strip. I love that Bally's is connected to Paris and you instantly feel like you are in another country walking through the shops and making that transition. I also like how they have a complimentary shuttle to the Rio which is their sister property. The strip is easily accessible as well with the escalators and moving sidewalks.  

Catching a cab from Bally's was not a great experience. Standing in a line in the Las Vegas heat is never fun, but hey, what else can you do, right?! The line was not too long but cabs do not frequent Bally's so there is no flow of vehicles. The doorman openly chews gum and holds his tips in a nice open stack in his hand. He asks where you are going but does not tell the cab driver. Tip for nothing! This guy needs a lesson on service!

One night, I was stuck in traffic in a taxi and asked to get dropped off at Paris instead of Bally's since I could just walk through the casino and the cab driver made a joke: ""You realized that it's gonna charge you a million dollars plus an arm and a leg to get dropped off at Ballys in this traffic, but then you'd have to pay for your French visas and all that to enter Paris!""

Like ""we should go to Jollibee"" kinda laughter.  If you don't know about Jollibee check out my review of the since closed Mira Mesa location. 

I digress

We saw that Ballys had rooms for $29 plus report fee and decided to give it a try, especially since all the M-Life hotels have decided to tack on a parking fee in addition to all of their ridiculousness that they already charge for. Ballys does not so they got the nod!

I seriously couldn't believe what a good week we had at Ballys. The rooms are not going to be like Mandalay Bay or whatever. There is not going to be a high end club and the rest of it is pretty average. But it was definitely solid. The rooms are in good shape and have the basics. The pool is nice. If you're looking for a pool with party style music wtc this is not the scene for you. There was music but it wasn't overpowering the scene. The vibe in the pool was pretty chill. Perfect scene for day drinking and relaxing. 

The best part?  Location!  You're literally in the center of the strip. You can't beat it. Whatever you want to do its right there.

To be clear, Ballys is not the heart of the party scene. It's conveniently located to get you to the party scene. Plus for $29 it can't be beat. 

I took one star off because everyday while we were at the pool the lifeguards decided that when cleaning up the pool chairs they would try throwing them on top of each other and needless to say my passed out self did not appreciate being woken up to the sound of crashing chairs. Seriously?!? Wtf is the point of smashing the chairs into each other? Simmer down there Mr Hulkamaniac. This isn't Wrestlemania 247 or something.",9,8,3

The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is how much the lobby does not match the outside.  It's almost as if you're transported to another casino.  Granted, it's no Bellagio, but I would say that it's on par with other casinos such as Paris or New York, New York but without the themepark feel.  Plus, if you like to gamble, there are plenty of tables and slots to play at.

I can't really comment on the food here.  The truth is, you don't have to.  Paris is right next door, you don't even have to step outside to get there, Caesars and Bellagio are right across the street, and the monorail can get you to othe casinos (although if you're with friends, it'll probably be cheaper to split a cab).

The rooms were nice.  We paid $99 a night for a full-sized bathroom, a bed, a sofa bed, and a sad excuse for a minibar with a small fridge that comes in handy when you actually have a doggy bag worth revisiting and an extra sink.  You'll notice just a touch of wear along the edges of the furniture, but in all honesty, that's a little nitpicky considering the fact that you're in the middle of the Strip.

When all's said and done, Bally's is a great deal for the money.  But the reason I have to give it three stars are the comps: I've been offered free rooms at more upscale casinos.  With that option available every now and then, do you really want to stay here?",8,2,5

The second room had a nice view, so I was disappointed to see dirt particles in the sheets. This was very surprising as the Jubilee tower has been renovated, so we assumed it would be clean.

First off, our check in with Elvis, was as simple and friendly as can be. Good start.

The Evening Call slushy bar employees were all friendly and patient and the alcoholic slushies were good. 

The room, was alright, great view of the Ferris wheel in Indigo Tower. BUT.... The white comforter has noticeable stains on it, the pillows and sheets were clean. The mattress is probably the hardest mattress I've ever slept on. The bathroom fan doesn't work [edit: retract fan doesn't work, Indigo tower bathrooms have vents no fans, Only Jubilee tower bathrooms have fans so far.]. The remote for the TV doesn't work.

The check-in staff has always been fast and friendly (even this last weekend being Halloween weekend, it took us less than 15 minutes to get checked into two rooms).

Love you, but your TVs are tiny). They have safes in the room as well, which is really nice. The bathrooms are pretty roomy, and my friend and I were more than comfortable having both of us getting ready for Halloween adventures on The Strip all weekend.

I mostly love that Bally's is always pretty affordable, and has a prime, mid-Strip location. It's almost in the very middle of the nearly 2-mile stretch of where the action all happens on the Strip. The Grand Bazaar outside of Bally's is pretty cool too. They have some great little food and boutique shops set up there. Parking here is free, which is nice.

The casino at this hotel must have the worst ventilation system because I did not encounter this issue at any of the other major hotels on the strip despite there being a similar number of smokers present. 

Also, none of the moving belts were ever functioning. 

The water here is heavy chlorinated and disgusting. Do not drink! 

The pool is also very mediocre and atmosphere slightly creepy. We ended up visiting a friend at another hotel and had a much better time lounging by that pool. 

I did not bother with any of the shows or restaurants here since there were much better options elsewhere. 

Overall, Bally's is a decent place to sleep on a budget but that is about it.",1,0,0

We stayed here for Cinco De Mayo weekend and I have to say that It was just a whatever experience. The second we walked in, we were hounded by two ladies asking if my friend and I want to get married this weekend. This happened to us 3 more times walking through the hotel this weekend. So annoying and weird. The room was not too bad. Very spacious and lots of chairs, tables, mirrors. The bed and pillows were so uncomfortable but the bathroom was pretty nice. The casino was so so very sad. First of all, from the farthest side of the casino, I can see the other end. This casino is smaller than my gym! And it really wasn't that busy. We didn't gamble here, we didn't eat here. We got some goodies form the cafe in the lobby and of course she packed my back with the wrong dessert. -_- Overall, this was a cheap weekend away, so I guess you get what you pay for.",0,0,0

I was thrilled that the room didn't reek of cigarette smoke, the bathroom was spotless, the towels were soft, and my room didn't look like some of the unflattering photos I saw on yelp. The floors, however, were questionable.They were pretty sticky, and I stepped on a few hard\/crusty spots.  It's definitely nothing a pair of flip flops can't handle, but the tactile memory of crusty\/sticky floors is forever engrained in the trauma center of my brain---so I had to take off a star for that. Just make sure to bring a pair of flip flops with you if you plan to stay at Balley's, and this won't be a problem you have to face :)  I also visited Vegas during the hottest time of the year and it just so happened to be 115 degrees outside when I arrived. To say I was extremely excited to cool down at the pool was an under-statement; however, my excitement quickly dissipated when I approached a murky pool that felt more like a jacuzzi. So because it felt hotter to be in the pool than it was to be out of the pool, I had to take away another star.  They did have a few outdoor showers that helped me beat the heat, but don't count on the pool to do the trick. The great thing about this place is that it is centrally located on the strip, and you can easily walk to day clubs and night clubs.",2,2,2

It's relatively affordable and right on the strip which is FANTASTIC!!!! but the casino itself is very small and they do have a small outdoor pool with a standard bar but not much more to offer beyond that. The rooms were pretty good-furnished with a few couches, tables and standing lamps with a nice spacious bedroom area equipped with a good view of The Linq and strip below. We stayed on the 23rd floor and the patio doors are locked shut permanently. I slept nearby the windows with the curtains opened so I could see the view of the city lights below; it was a beautiful view to fall asleep to. Also, this may be random and weird but we kept hearing knocking (like knuckle knocking) from the patio windows at night (a couple of knocks every 15-30 mins or so); but who knows it's probably just some strong wind!! Moreover, I LOVE that the Paris casino & resort is literally right down the hall, so worry not! beautiful and breathless views and delicious food is only a few footsteps away!!  ;)  From Balley's, you can access the skyway directly to the Bellagio and there's a TON of stores right outside of the Balleys hotel itself, including Walgreens, LUSH, ramen\/food\/clothing shops, bar stands, etc! It's also not too far from Planet Hollywood (GO BSB!!!) But it is quite a walk from The Cosmopolitan, Luxor, etc!

After browsing through many hotels to fit in our budget of 5 guys, Bally's came out a victor! It was conveniently located within walking distance to places where we wanted to eat and gamble.

Since we had a late check in time, we took our sweet time driving down from the Bay Area. The room was nicely prepared upon our walk-in. It was spacious to and had a nice view over looking a partial part of the Vegas strip.

As for the casino area, well what would you expect to happen during a couple of major events happening over this weekend? Table limits are up and celebrity sightings are bound to happen. While walking back to my room at 3am, I spotted Bay Area Legend rapper Too $hort with his body guard talking with some groupies. Too bad my phone battery died.

So I really can't complain.

It's pretty clean, even if the decor and furnishings are a bit outdated, and this with somewhat a renovation. Glad that there's not really a bad ciggie smell that's associated with some of the more budget friendly hotels. 

Bally's is right next to Paris, across from the Bellagio, right in the heart of Las Vegas. Valet - free as usual, wherever you stay. Just don't forget to tip!!! hehe.

There's a casino, filled with smoke (sigh). I just want them to have a ciggie free casino. Please? :) But the good thing is that the tables are pretty decent - some at $5, some at $10 minimum - as compared to some of the other premium hotels that start at $15.

In my 5-year-old brain, I imagined Bally's to be a regal, gold-plated home for the rich and famous on vacation, be-decked in disco balls and cash that floated down from mirrored ceiling tiles trimmed in diamonds.  

As it turns out, the Atlantic City Bally's of my 1980s mind and the Bally's of Las Vegas reality, circa 2015 are not exactly the same. SHOCKING, I know. That being said, what I thought (as a charmingly cynical 35-year-old) would be the scum of the Strip, ended up being quite nice.  Actually, I have zero complaints.  Okay - not ZERO; but relative to the price, my complaints are basically nil.  And about that price - man, is it cheap.  Not that Vegas hotels are THAT expensive, but still - for central-Strip over Valentine's Day weekend, Bally's is probably as low as they go.  At just over $400 for four nights, I'll take it!  The casino is decent enough, the rooms are better than Hooters and it's connectivity to Paris offers you any other amenity you may need well within reach. The gym and foodcourt are scary and reminiscent of Pittsburgh's finest Parkway Center Mall, but who goes to Vegas for the gym and foodcourt anyway?  Give it a try.

Bally's has a food court (Johnny Rockets, Nathan's Hotdog, Subway, a Chinese fast food and more). They also had a few in house restaurants on the premises.

We booked a room in the newly renovated Jubilee Tower.  Check in was smooth and painless and we quickly found our way to the elevators.  NOTE:  We stayed before and had to walk on past the front desk, through the casino and back to the rear tower elevators...the Jubilee towers are in the front, meaning the elevators are just to the right of the front doors when you walk in, SUPER convenient.

Upon entering the room we were shocked with a TON of space, a nice king bed, huge HDTV, 2 lounge chair things (sorry, not a decor kind of person), nice open fridge, separate sink serving as a 'kitchenette', huge bathroom which included a nice sitting area for doing the whole make up thing (with make up mirror), and big shower with big sized shower head...and...a full view of the Eiffel Tower and partial view of the Bellagio fountains.  On top of everything else...it was super clean!

I'd say the only drawback to staying in the Jubilee tower is the fact that if you go to the pool, you have to walk through the ENTIRE casino to get to the stairs, which take you down past the shops and food court to get to the pool.  Fine for us guys but if you are female, make sure you take a cover up or you might feel a bit awkward.

As far as the casino itself, the table minimums are great (we had $5 minimums our whole stay), the drink service was spot on, the dealers were very nice and the overall vibe was awesome.  Couple that with a great location on the strip (right in the middle) and you really have a fantastic place to stay.

There are also cheaper options that are just too far away or don't have the same amenities or atmosphere as Ballys so you kind of pay for what you get with those situations.

We had two people from our party go to the bathroom, and since we had kids, we didn't want to stand on the floor. So, what did we do? We took the kids off the carpet, into a side area, off the carpet, behind a big fountain, next to a lady selling kids toys. Safe right? We are a solid 30 feet from the closest table and a good 15 feet off the carpeted gambling floor! WRONG! This guy comes over, tells us to move back another 20 feet up and over these stairs. My wife explains that we have 2 people in the bathroom and he says, ""they will have to find you, you need to move now."" I asked him if he would be requiring the other 3 families with kids to do the same, which I did not get a response. Instead, we were escorted out of the area by this individual. I was sure to let him know that their policies were not appreciated, and to be honest, they lost my business over this. 

We are planning a big bash next year, and were looking to stay here, but I am not giving my business to a place that encourages employees to go about and mean-mug people. I know that my one not staying here will change nothing, but nonetheless, if you have kids and are looking for a hotel, this is probably not the place, with rude staff and unequal policies.",4,1,0

It has an 90's AM\/FM radio with a CD player and RCA auxiliary cords, so bring your own bluetooth speaker. 

The absolute ""never again"" for me, was that they don't have room service at night, it ends at 1pm.

When we first got there, the check in line was insane. I was glad they had kiosks for us to check in. It saved a lot of time and as a bonus they allowed us to check in about an hour early. From this point the rest of the experience went downhill.

When we entered the room, it initially looked fine. We walked around the room and were pretty happy so we put our stuff down and kicked on the ac and took off our shoes to kick back. At one point we walked over to the bathroom and the carpet was soaked. It wasn't just damp, there was a puddle and as I leaned down to see what it was the smell of mold hit me hard. The ac seemed to be leaking which was the only thing I can think was the reason why there was a puddle in our room. So we packed our stuff back up and headed downstairs to talk to the staff.

While we did get a room credit for the inconvenience, it still wasn't enough to offset how terrible the new room was. The new room didn't have the wet carpet and the bathroom didn't smell funky but man the room was destroyed. The bathroom cabinets had paint chipped off, the tiles were cracked and not holding together, and the ceiling in the shower was cracked and sagging. It did look like someone patched it at one point and thought it was fine.

As we stayed in the room for the weekend, every time we came back to the room from something, it always had a funky sewage smell. If we kicked on the AC for long enough, the smell would eventually go away. 

With that being said, I would not come back to Ballys unless it was renovated.",0,0,0

Ok the hotel gets 4\/5 stars. It was very nice. Check-in was quick and easy. The room was great. We had a jr. suite, which was clean and very roomy. Had a large bathroom and a separate vanity area, so my girlfriend and I could get ready at the same time with out getting in each other's way. We ordered room service a few times when we were too tired or drunk to go downstairs. It was reasonably priced (for room service) and was there pretty quick. The steak and shrimp special was just as good as the steakhouse downstairs but about 1\/4 of the price. All the staff was very nice, without being overly nice or fake. The only complaint I had (and it's barely a complaint) was that we didn't have a ""do not disturb"" sign. I asked a maid on the first day we were there and she said she would get one for us, but we never got one. I didn't ask again because it really wasn't important. The funny thing was that when we left to check-out, there was a sign on our door. It just made me laugh, and in no way affected our stay. It was nice having the walkway to Paris, and the monorail station downstairs. 

Now for the casino, I'd give it about 2-3 stars. It's not one of the fancier casinos, but they at least try. Table games were nice, and 2 or 3 of the dealers were very nice and funny, but the rest didn't seem to care. The slots were ok, many of them were broken though. They are also kinda scattered around. You have to kinda search for the ones you want. My biggest complaint here was the drinks. I mean the best part of gambling is the free drinks, but the waitresses were no where to be found! I had to wait a long time for anyone to come by, and a long time to get my drink after I ordered it. I can understand when it's busy, but even during the day service was slow. When playing the tables immediately adjacent to the bar, we got plenty of service, but the waitress was very old and couldn't here well. She constantly brought us the wrong drinks. My girlfriend would order a mudslide and she'd get either a bud light or a mai tahi. Very annoying. 

In conclusion, if you are looking for a cheap place to stay on the strip without the hotel being sketchy, go to Bally's. Just gamble somewhere else. Paris is next door and a great casino.",0,0,0

So, booking early I got a GREAT deal for the room.  Needless to say this was the ONLY positive I got out of this trip.  I get there early about 10am before the stated check in time, and notice there was a line for early check in.  I come to Vegas at least once a year, so I know there is an extra charge for early check in at some if not most hotels.  So, no problem.  I'm in my 30's, so I'm no obnoxious 21 year old who stumbles in looking to check in early.  I approach the counter and the lady instantly tells me ""There is an early check in fee.""  No ""Welcome To Bally's"" No ""Good Morning"" nothing. I had an excellent flight that morning and was with a friend, so I shrugged it off no big deal, but in my mind it definitely rubbed me the wrong way.  I end up using my Debit card for incidentals and the lady made it a point ""Are you sure you have enough funds, because you're not going to be refunded for 7-10 days?""  I wanted to say to her, ""Are you kidding me?"" But, I didn't.  I was not rude at one moment with her, but really didn't understand why she made it like I was cheap or something.  So, customer service at the start of my stay EXTREMELY POOR.

I get to my room and instantly check out the view.  Nice view of the new ferris wheel and Drais, so I liked it until I looked at the seal and the windows.  The paint was chipping and the seal was rusted.  Again, no big deal to me, but I know some clean freaks that would've been urked at the sight.  

Began to get ready and jumped in the shower.  Bathroom was comfortable, amenities were fully stocked, but halfway through my shower, the drain wouldn't drain so I'm knee deep in soap water.  Call the front desk and they tell me they're going to send someone up.  Maintenance guy comes and explains to me he can snake the drain and its going to take 15 minutes he needs to get his equipment.  While I'm waiting, 5 minutes later front desk calls my room and rudely says to me ""You need to open your door, the maintenance guy is waiting"" I opened the door and see a completely different maintenance guy asking ""What's the problem?""  Utterly confused I call the front desk and ask for a new room.  As I get off the phone, now there's two more maintenance guys trying to drain 1 tub.  This entire time, from the front desk to now this situation I attempted to remain calm, but now it just got ridiculous.  So, my grade for the room...EXTREMELY POOR (and by the way they did NOT give me another room after my request for one).

My trip was Sat-Mon and all of this happened on a Saturday morning.  I wanted to stay away as much as I could from the hotel which I did, some of the good things about this hotel were the buffet was decent, the elevators were fast and the beds did provide a good sleep.  Taxis and shuttles just like any other hotel were a little tough to get a hold of, but another tip spend an extra couple bucks and get one of those SUV\/shuttles that aren't taxis but charge a flat rate rather than a timed rate.  

My last comment on why I'm rating this a terrible experience, when I checked out Monday morning I am pleasantly greeted by the lady at the front desk (ironic right?) asks for the card I paid for incidentals.  She swipes my card and says ""You should see your refund in the next day or two"" I couldn't believe it, but by the time I got back home Monday afternoon, I see the refund waiting in my account.  So, what was the first lady talking about I had to wait 7-10 days, then this lady tells me 24-48 hours?  Very poor overall experience.  I will NEVER stay at Bally's Las Vegas ever again.",2,2,1

I never go to Vegas on the idea that I will be spending lots of time in the hotel as there is so much to do, and I did not spend a lot of time in my room as I had a wedding to be prepared for. And even then, I managed to get the worst of Bally's. 

All of ridiculousness took place at the registration line. The first time checking in, the staff member that was helping me had a ""hate my job"" type attitude. I didn't get a smile or any enthusiasm or a welcome, while the guest next to me received complementary water bottles. Keep in mind, I booked 5 rooms with Bally's. 

The next time I had to check in (for a guest that came a day later), I was told that the room was not ready, even though I received an email reminder to check-in. It wouldn't had been so bad, except I waited 15 minutes in line. There were only two other guests in front of me, but we all waited 15 minutes because only three staff members were present to check-in guests. I basically wasted 15 minutes standing in line with a bunch of other angry guests, just to have to come back a few hours later. 

So the third time that I had to go to the registration line to pick up that key, I was on the phone with the wedding planner talking details because the wedding was in an hour. I approached the registration desk and gave the gentleman my ID and credit card and told him I was checking in and picking up my key. I figure that this should be straightforward. The gentleman kept asking me for a room number and while I was on the phone, I told him that I didn't know the room number to a room in which I don't have the key for. Ummmm? Then he had the nerve to turn me away and tell me to come back when I'm off the phone. At that point, I had to hang up on the wedding planner to school this gentleman on how to do his job. I had to explain to him that the computer system shows which rooms I already checked in to, so the key that I need would be the only room that shows up as not checked-in.

I thought I could deal with that long, long automated walkway that never works. I thought I could deal with the extremely poor floor plans with the ridiculous up escalator to bring you inside the hotel, then another ridiculous down escalator to bring you to the hotel lobby. It's definitely a pain to leave the hotel, I was too discouraged to return to my room other than to sleep a few hours. 

They do have a lot of table games in terms of variety, not just blackjack and more blackjack. I must say they didn't have as many cocktail waitresses on shift as other casinos. Not too bad on the slots either, I just wish they have more than just 4 of the motion activated chair ones. 

Their rooms remind me of Best Western with the ugly patterned bedding. I guess not a lot of people pay for the safe, so it has a $3 charge per day unless you're a higher tier player then it's comped like everything else you do in Vegas. Luckily more electrical outlets than Planet Hollywood rooms. Somewhat overly normal looking bathroom that doesn't give off the extravagance of Vegas but quite practical with the number of shelves available for storage of toiletries especially for a girl. Their pillows are terrible, so flat and small, I felt like I'm not sleeping on much. Other than all of the above, the room is safe to sleep in.",1,0,0

Ballys was Vegas strip centralized with the atmosphere of an elegant and flashy Vegas styled hotel. Parking is located for free in the garage next door. It shares the same garage as another hotel so just make sure you're parking in the correct area. After that, you make your way to some elevators that will take you to this main shopping area\/casino. Make your way through the casino and the front desk is located right there. The lobby really set that first impression bar high, til we saw the check in line with at least 10 families waiting. This was about 4 hours after normal check in time, which was at 4pm. Like what? All these people are trying to check in at 8pm too?

We felt relived after finally being called to the front desk after about 20 minutes or so. This really put a damper on our stay because we only had that night in Vegas and waiting in line for our hotel room was not something we really planned for or got excited about. 

The front desk associate was very friendly and did some crazy trick flips with his pen while he was checking us in. I felt like a cat starring at a fuzzy toy watching him shoot this pen around. Wasn't expecting that but I was totally impressed, haha. After a few jokes and questions later we were on our way up to our room feeling a-whole-lot better then we were 20 min prior. We also had no idea about the surprise that we were about to step into when we finally found our room door. 

I don't remember our room door number but I do remember that there were 2 of the same, except one of the room numbers had the letter A after it. An example would be 145 and 145A. I can't remember if ours had the A on it or not but I believe that's the one I tried to open, we entered the key in the slot and the light turned green. We opened the door and bam, long hallway. No sight of a thing else in the room. This made me instantly nervous, right then and there I knew this wasn't an ordinary room. Then I thought back to how the front desk associate Asked us about our ""one night"" stay in Vegas and realized we were from NY, not just down the street either.

Continuing on down the hallway the room suddenly opened up and we were greeted by an enormous hotel room complete with a king sized bed, mini living room area, huge whirlpool, his and her sinks including a make up chair\/table, endless amounts of closet space....Jeez. I was blown away. We also had wall to wall Windows so we could actually see a majority of the street and strip. 

That front desk clerk really hooked us up. I later did some research and found out these types of rooms can only be requested and that there were only a couple on every floor. We felt lucky. We also wish we could stay for more than just one night. 

The whirlpool is big enough for 2 but if you don't want to use it, there's a shower located right behind the wall next to the toilet room. I loved the make up table and chair, it was perfect to use while getting ready. The bed was super comfortable along with the couches in the living room area. We really couldn't get enough of this room. It was amazing. Apparently there was a pool but we didn't have time to use it. 

Check out the next morning was very easy, we just called the front desk and then we were good to go. 

In a nutshell... I highly recommend this hotel because of location, comfort and cleanliness. We had no issues, were upgraded for free, and we're just steps away from the Vegas strip snd Caesars Palace was across the street! Parking was included for free too! Ah !",3,4,2

I've also stayed there once, and the room was so basic that it reminded me of Imperial Palace. Eep! 

All in all, Ballys has a lot of other cool amenities that make it a definite stop on any Vegas trip:
-EveningCall frozen daquiri bar at the end of the casino
-Central location
-Low table limits
-Shuttle to Rio (which sometimes takes forever)
-Bar

First off, we were welcomed by a $28 a night resort fee in addition to the 4 nights we had already pre-paid for when we checked in.

I know this is a fee that's getting more and more common but we were not in Vegas to use the gym or hang out by the pool with temperatures around 70 degrees. So we basically paid $112 for the ""free"" WiFi that only works on two devices at a time.

We stayed on the 12th floor and for some reason it was significantly colder than the rest of the hotel so I'm sure there were some ghosts or possibly a broken thermostat present. 

Although spacious, our room felt dirty with suspicious stains on the furniture and what looked like a blood stain that someone had tried to burn off on the carpet. 

At night we could smell cigarette smoke in our room despite staying on a non-smoking floor and according to the Internet that is how you can tell you're sharing a room with a chain smoking guest that checked out but never left. 
 
Bally's is apparently one of the most haunted places in Las Vegas which could explain why the casino floor too is really smoky compared to other casinos on the strip... or it could be due to poor ventilation but what do I know?

We tried to call front desk about the smell and the stain but gave up after listening to the same recorded message while on hold for 25 minutes. 

When nobody from front desk is answering when you call about smoking ghosts it leaves you wondering: who you gonna call?

We tried to take a shower to feel somewhat clean before bed but with water pressure like an eerie dripping faucet we felt neither clean nor satisfied so we just went to bed.

The next few days we did get to enjoy some of the positive aspects of Bally's; like the central location on the strip, the nicest housekeeping staff we've ever encountered and we did win some money in the casino.

When we checked out we tried to tell front desk about the problems during our stay after standing in line for 15 minutes but the lady cut us off, handed us the receipt and called for the next guest in line.

Bally's might be an old casino in what used to be MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's facilities but I think they might be better off laying both this haunted building and the lost souls of its former residents to rest.",4,4,0

My favorite casino on the strip.  Why?  Because they are who they are and they're not trying to be something they're not.  They're not shiny or new.  The Cosmopolitan this is not.  The waitresses are a bit rough around the edges and look like they probably work a second shift at some seedy dive bar off the strip.  They can't pull off the tight revealing uniforms that you see the much younger girls wearing at the newer casinos.  And that's ok, well at least for me it is.  I don't care what you look like as long as you keep the (free) drinks coming.  I went here early one day, maybe around 11am and our waitress was so on the ball.  She'd plomp a drink down in front of me and be back in less than 5 minutes to ask if I needed another one.  My drink was as full as when she left it but gotta love that initiative!

Another biggie is that they're one of the few casinos that do $10 minimums as opposed to $15.  This can make a huge difference.

Also, wut up to Michelle at the roulette table.  She was awesome and I had the quintessential beginner's luck gambling experience at her table.  I think I had at least a 20+ win streak going on and it was the best time ever.  My first time ever gambling in Vegas and I walked with $240 that night.  Not bad for a rookie.",7,4,4

We arrived to Vegas at 9am. Check-in isn't until 4pm, but they will hold your bags for you for free if you arrive early. Watch for timeshare solicitors right when you walk in. If you want some free tickets, have 3-4 hours to spare, and can give a firm no, you could talk to them. If not, avoid wasting your time.

You can get a mini-fridge for the room if you ask when checking in. We upgraded our room for $50\/night, but we didn't really need it considering we never really spent time in our room. In retrospect, it was a waste (though might be something others would want). Room was clean and spacious. Safe was included (someone else wrote that they had to pay extra?)

I love this hotel!  The rooms are spacious, they're neat and I've always had a great view whenever I've stayed here.  The room is not out of date, they always keep up with the times and the hotel staff likes to make sure that their guests are properly taken care of.

We had the opportunity to stay at the new wing recently and wowza!!!  The rooms are even more spacious and grand than they have been in the past!  

The pool wasn't as nice as I remembered it being.  They have 3 separate pools, which I think is now open to the public (for a price - but free for hotel guests).  It looked a little out-dated and not as nice as some of the other Vegas hotel pools that I've stayed at.
The neat thing about the pool grounds is that the place has tennis courts and little shops that surround that area.  They made it into a recreational are where you can play tennis and take a dip in the pool at your own leisure!  Pretty sweet!  They have a bar where they serve all sorts of drinks and snacks, and they have cabanas that surround the pools.

One of the things that I enjoy the most is getting room service and relaxing in the room.  The room service at this hotel is great because I believe it's 24 hour dining!  They have a wide variety of items to choose from on the menu - some of them have time constraints, but the items on the 24 hour menu are still good.  They have a pretty healthy wine list to add to their menu as well!

They have a bunch of stores where you can buy things from chips to something exquisite like a diamond ring.  The thing that irritated me the most was that none of the stores sold cotton balls!  Not one!  I thought that was kind of odd.

I had a wake-up call set for my conference (at which I also am sitting for an exam for certification) that was never made this morning, so I definitely do not recommend relying on the wake-up call. I was late for my exam and the whole purpose of my (very expensive) trip could have been ruined. When I called this afternoon to ask why I didn't receive the call, I was told that the call was made, even though it definitely was not. After my conference this afternoon I wanted to go to the gym, but there are no signs or maps in the hotel room to show where it is. So I called the front desk and sat on hold for over 10 minutes for someone to simply pick up so that I could ask where the gym is. I was so annoyed with the wait time and with my wake-up call experience this morning that I asked to speak with a manager. A manager named Sunquat (not sure of spelling) answered and I explained my experiences. He quickly apologized and gave me directions to the gym, thanked me, and hung up. I dressed for the gym and walked down to the area that he described and saw no signs for a gym. I asked an employee at the spa where the gym is and she said it is within the spa but it was closed, it closes at 6pm! The manager made no note of this on the phone! I went (in person) to the front desk and requested the manager. Sunquat came to speak with me and said, ""you just asked where the gym was, I didn't know you were going now."" I expressed my frustration, he apologized but seemed less than sympathetic. He also told me that he spoke with the wake-up call dept who told him that any unanswered wake up call gets a knock on the door from security (that definitely did not happen, either). ""For my troubles"", he gave me a $25 food and beverage credit to my room (which will cover about a ham sandwich and a diet coke in this place). I have also learned by reading the other reviews on yelp here that the gym is not free\/included!? This was also definitely not mentioned by the manager!!
I will be discussing these issues with the administrators of my conference and highly recommending that they find a new location for our conference next year, otherwise I will not be attending.

In my recent visit, I stayed in their new Jubilee Tower which allows you to see the North and South sides of the strip. On the North side, you've got a view of Caesar's and Cromwell corner as well as the beautiful lit rooftop display of their Bally's new shopping area below. On the South side, you are literally have a perfect view of Paris' Eiffel Tower and somewhat of a view of the Cosmo. Also on this side, you have a peak of the Bellagio fountains and if you leave the window open you'll be able to hear it going off! Staying at the Jubilee Tower you are furthest away from the parking structure on the back side of Bally's but it does give you the convenience of walking out onto the strip straight away. 

A few things haven't changed with Bally's though. The upstairs entrance room above the valet is still unusually hot as it has always been all year round. They really need to get that changed before summer rolls around if they are on a renovating trend. The older towers are still the same, they have that outdated Vegas feel to them.

If you are offered that room type, check it before you move in, you will smell it as soon as you go through the door.

It really pays to be nice and courteous to the folks who check you in, joke with them, because I think if they like you, they'll hook you up with a nice room.  I felt like they took care of us, gave us a decent suite.  It was fine, didn't hear any neighbors screaming or partying, no dogs barking at night, nothing too rough and we were able to sleep well.  The pool was decent, finding out what all you can get when you book a room in Vegas.  Think this and The Flamingo are the budget casinos for this area of the strip.  Room was in good condition, a little hanging wallpaper, but big whoop on that.  Some of the things I didn't like, I can't blame on Bally's, it's just the fact that Vegas is going to nickel and dime you to death and gauge you at every possible opportunity.  Vegas reminded me of kinda being trapped in a large airport lounge.  Expect everything to be marked up out the wazoo.  Then of course, that old ""resort fee"" which is an additional charge or tax, call it what you will but I'm sure all the casinos colluded to bring this about.  I didn't like not being able to have an internet connection without paying 20 bucks. Printing out boarding passes cost five bucks for like 11 minutes.  I think we were in room 2376, the view was looking straight over at the Hilton.  Location was nice as others have mentioned, walk across to the Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan, Aria, Paris, The Flamingo is right next door.  There was a decent little bar downstairs that sold small margaritas and 16 oz. beers for two bucks, not bad.  The Casino was nothing to write home about, seemed small and rather pedestrian to me.  All in all, pretty pleased with the room and the price and the experience.  Didn't have any problems at all, would certainly consider staying here again.",0,0,0

Bally's is in a prime location, it's across from Ceasar's and connected to Paris.  You can go downstairs and have Crepe's!!  It isn't the same feel as like the Palazzo or The Hotel, but if there's a nice occasion we will splurge and go there but otherwise, Bally's has been great to us.

because hannah s & i did not want to shove into a ROOM with 6 other grls at ceasars palace we decided to look for another room on the strip that wouldnt break our wallets. 

so after lookin & weeding out the good (ceasars, wynn, mandalay ..to $$$$ for the weekend!!) the bad ( stratosphere, planet hollywood) the ugly (circus circus, rio) on lasvegas.com we ended up with either monte carlo or ballys...then since ballys was closer to ceasars (the other girls) it was cheaper, & they were giving 2 free tickets to jubilee,thehumanshow, or ??? we took ballys for $430 (wtf !) for 17-19th 2 bed, nonsmoking..

so we ended up in the regular ol' room in the South Tower. the reviews made the s.tower sound super grungy!! i was scared to be honest...but luckily satisfied 

wen i went to check in 
the lady said:""ONE BED SMOKING?!"" 
mia: wtheck??? noo...... 
the lady said: ""ONE BED nonsmoking? or SMOKING with 2 BEDS""
mia: uhm..neither...i requested 2 beds NON smoking
the lady said : ""OOH OKAY! we got non smoking 2 bed but its next to an elevator and ur room will shake and u will hear LOUD rumbling""
mia: ""wtf??????? ""
the lady said: ""OOOOOH wait i got one!! here ya go! theres no bathtub but a shower
mia: thats fine..

okay so hannah s, dee h, & i go up the elevator and we get to our floor... and we enter the first room to our right...(is this the elevator room?!?!) 
 the room is nice & big. the beds are clean no dirty stains like the gross blood stains i found at Paris....the room has a view of buffalo bills & i can see the people goin down the escalator to the street towards ceasars.

we got a big tv no plasma buts its alright and a nice table we use to eat all our late nite meals...

but um yes...so this ""SHOWER"" i thought she meant no seperate bathtub i wasnt expecting a HANDICAP bathroom with a seat in the shower area & where there is not actual SHOWER space but just a curtain seperating the shower from the toilet & sink so wen we shower the water flows throughout the entire bathroom with their lil drain holes throughout....we ended up having to lay out multiple towels to try to keep it from overflowing everywhere...it was gross...waking up groggy in the mornin runnin to the toilet and stepping on a LOVELY extra moist towel that squished water out all over ur calves....ICK!!!!!

however....the room was good all in all i just like big space & clean beds....nice views are great but we went for cheap this trip...

whats lame is that they dont have their own 24 hour cafe or nething just the one in paris so we ended up there twice haha...

Several family members and friends were here over the past weekend to attend my son's wedding.  I will NEVER EVER recommend this place nor will I EVER step foot in the casino because of the experience my daughter in law and son had even before they checked in. 

The so-called wedding coordinator was pretty much non-existent. Why should a bride have to make calls (that go unanswered for days) to insure that everything is falling in to place? The suite which was pre-paid MONTHS AGO became mysteriously ""unavailable "" so they were stuck with a standard room on Thursday until very late the NEXT NIGHT! Then, staff who helped with the room change misplaced two tuxedos  (one belonging to my son. THE GROOM) and the room key the night before the wedding! That's not the end of the debacle folks. ...

On the morning of the wedding, the bridesmaids discovered on their way to check out the reception venue that NOTHING was set up!!!  So consequently,  they ran late before they were due to appear for wedding pictures because they had to decorate nine tables along with decorating the rest of the venue and purchase the seating cards AND have printed out in the business office!

I'm quite sure there are other stories I'm unaware of.   So, needless to say without ANY apologies from ANY ONE or compensation from Caesars Entertainment management the experience that was supposed to be a relatively stress-free event was nothing but STRESS AND FRUSTRATION!

Ballys as a place to stay is decent. its centralized position on the north strip makes it ideal and bang for the buck. I've stayed in both the south and north towers.

Lose or win we were going to sleep afterward.

Anyways, what I did was I waited for the dealer to drop the ball and then I put $200 on top of black and just stared at it the entire time. When the ball stopped, it stopped on black and my friends high fived each other. Then when I looked back at the table, the dealer took his hand and hit my money off the black and was like ""cash dont play."" I was like, what do you mean? He looked at me with a rude ass tone of voice and was like...""I said cash dont play!"". I was pretty mad. I asked him, why didnt you tell me when I put my money down, why did you wait for the ball to fall on black and have that end before you said anything. He told me that he did hit my money out and he did say something but thats complete BS. Even everyone at the table was in awe by it. I called the pit boss over and he basically tol me the same thing but thats complete BULLSHIT! This is the first time anyone has ever said that to me and even if it was true, he had all the time in the world to exchange the cash that I put down for chips. I hate to think that if it did fall on red, that the dealer would have taken my money. So....lesson learned.",0,0,0

The Rooms:

One time I had an ok view from my room, and the other times the views were pretty terrible.  I have stayed in both the smoking and non-smoking rooms.  I like that getting to the rooms is relatively easy, and that you don't have to go through a maze to get to the elevators like in other casinos.

The local food vendors are not that great.  I have tried a few of them, and they are just ""ok.""  The Tequila bar is a place I frequent often due to their late hours of operation--very useful!

I stayed at Ballys because my infrequent TR play in Baltimore accrued enough points to comp my room for a Mon-Thurs stay in winter - which is totally fair because that's the off of the off-season. I still had to pay the resort fee of $85 total, but for 3 days, that's a steal. 

The customer service was on point: I got an email the morning before I flew out that offered me a self check-in so that my keys would be ready when I arrived. Sure enough, we marched up to the concierge who not only had our keys ready, but even moved me to a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains upon request. I forget the gentleman's name, but he was awesome. 

The room was clearly renovated and fairly swanky. Nice beds and nice decor when compared to older Strip hotels that haven't renovated since the 90s. The only problem with the room was that the water pressure was pretty bad - the shower was very weak - but other than that I really can't complain for what was basically a FREE room. Even if I were paying the regular going rate of I think $50\/night or so, I'd still be pleased with the value here.

My general consensus is, while sadly TR does not compensate table players very well when compared to MGM, TR has the better hotel value. MGM has cheap hotels like Excalibur but they're in more remote locations and drop the ball in several places, or they have great hotels like Aria and Bellagio right across from Ballys, but you'll pay handsomely for them unless you come in on a Learjet with your name on it. TR casinos aren't bad, but I didn't play at Ballys due to the points system. Anyway, I'd recommend this place for people loyal to either company.",5,0,1

I know that there are a ton of fancier hotels on the strip, but for being on the strip, Bally's is a great alternative if you don't wanna pay up the wazoo for a couple nights in Vegas.

I was surprised at how spacious the rooms were.  We had two large beds, an ample seating area with another table, a vanity area, and of course the restroom.  The colors were very warm, which was nice and inviting as well.

Every person we interacted with was super friendly and helpful.  When we were leaving, they asked us if we needed help with directions.  The valet guy also suggested Pho Kim Long for us to go eat at, which was pretty dang tasty.

On our way out, we were asking about where to get gas so we could drive back to LA.  The valet guy told us not to go to the gas station right around the corner, but instead head on the 15 and get off at Blue Mountain Road (right after Bass Fishing Shops).  He said that Mobile Gas Station had the cheapest gas in all of Vegas.

The only thing I wish were that it had more food affordable food options with some sort of food court.

Find another place where you are still in ""Classic Vegas,"" and have that ABSOLUTE direct access to every other awesome spot on the strip...

Centered at the heart of the strip, on the corner of Flamingo Rd. and Las Vegas Blvd. sits Bally's which has remained classic for the last 20+ years... sure it's older, but it's still fun, clean, historic and most of all a classy place... and again -- centered in the middle of all the action on the foremost corner on the strip, right across from Caesar's (my favorite place to play!).

If you're going to Vegas with a few friends or for a day or two, sure blow your wad and pile into a nice room at the Wynn, The Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, etc... but if you're the type that likes to lay back and really do Vegas for a few days or a week... and the type that likes to be able to relax when it's time to turn in at the end of an 18hr day that included some severe table games, smoking premium cigars at Casa Fuente, chatting it up with tourists, hitting the sports book, dancing, eating at buffets, shopping, drinking drinking drinking, and walking up and down the strip and playing at EVERY CASINO... then opt for Ballys. 

Hey, it's quaint, and there's not a lot of frills or gorgeous giant golden chandeliers with rubies and emeralds hanging from it, or even those nifty water spouts that shoot water into holes carved out into the wall across the room, but again, IT'S CLASSIC VEGAS and priced amazingly for the amount of accessibility, the cleanliness, and awesome location on the strip. And did I mention, the employees and front desk has always been helpful and sweet to me?

I usually enjoy saving that extra three to eight hundred bucks (depending on length of stay) over the other high-end spots on the strip (which are sometimes placed in less-desirable locations IMHO), and then using that cash as much-needed spending money for: big tips, fun table games, classy drinks, random shopping (have to shop in Vegas!), and of course the delicious eats + cab fare... 

Most of the folks kicking 1-3 stars to Ballys should stick to The Cosmo and the Wynn, where they can go to The Marquee and hit up XS, respectively... or maybe pile into a suite at the Hard Rock where they can blow their allowance at some densely packed and over-tanned pool party... but for true old school cats like myself who fancy a nice sitting at the Galleria Bar @ Caesar's and hitting up some Chinese dinner on the waterfront @ The Bellagio... along with some great seats to an awesome show, well, I'm beyond-fine with laying my head here at Ballys at the end of the night (morning)... especially at the rates for Total Rewards members.

*I should note, I don't play a lot at Ballys, and I've only stayed in the rooms in the newer North Tower, haven't seen the older ones, so definitely opt for an upgrade if you can. I also consider myself lucky, because I've never received anything but great service from the front desk and have often been upgraded to rooms facing the strip, right over all the neon walkways with watershow views... for the same rate. In this town, a little respect goes a long ways :)

Thanks Ballys",9,4,7

It's conveniently located on the strip right next to Paris, which is also connected to, and accessible from Bally's. I had a renovated room with 2 queen beds, a desk, a TV, and modern-looking furniture and accoutrements. The electrical outlets could have been more conveniently placed, the pillows weren't fantastic, and I could have used an extra blanket, but otherwise, the room was fine. I recommend requesting one of the newly renovated rooms though. Most of my co-workers were in older rooms and would have offered a 2 or 3 star based on complaints. 

There is a Buca de Beppo in Bally's and also a Tequila Taqueria. We tried the latter, but I wouldn't recommend it. We ate at HEXX bar in Paris, which was located right across the street from the Bellagio and had a great view of the fountain show. Check out Battista's Hole in the Wall right across the street though. That was my favorite restaurant out of all the places I ate during my stay. The Sands Expo Convention Center connected to the Venetian is easily accessible from Bally's especially if you take the short cut that leads you right by the Ferris Wheel. If you don't mind walking, Bally's is close enough to walk to the MGM Grand, New York, Cosmopolitan, Caesar's Palace, and Planet Hollywood.

I've never stayed at Bally's before so I had very low expectations.  Come on...I just came from The Hotel and Bellagio...

This is my rating and review:
- 3 stars: Rooms were large, and you can tell they recently remodeled.  It was pretty clean but I didn't get the spacious bathrooms I'm used to having. (NOTE: this room only applies to the new tower.  I don't understand why they'd remodel one tower but not the other)  I guess we got lucky and got the free room upgrade 
- 2 stars:  ceilings are low and smoky, but it's an older casino so this is expected
-4 stars: it's in the middle of the strip so it has easy access to everything you need.  Bellagio and Caesars are just across the way, and cabbing is not necessary so it saves you a ton of money.

Only stayed here cause the rooms were free and when we got there at 11 at night after our flight was delayed, the front desk girl told me that even though I reserved a smoking 2 bed room, they gave away all the 2 bed rooms so they were giving me a 1 bed room and a roll away and we could switch rooms the next day. So we still had to be out by check out time the next morning so we could switch rooms and thankfully there was a 2 bedroom ready. Really shitty start for a vacation with all the hassle and attitude they gave us. When I pointed out that I had reserved a 2 bedroom room the chick at the desk told me that reservations are merely a ""suggestion"".
Blu Pool is okay but definitely a lot of people who aren't appealing to the eye and A LOT of creepy old guys. I'd pay the extra $ to go to Ceasar's pool or a pool party like Wet Republic or Marquee Day Club which is what we did the next 2 days because that first day was pretty bad. Definitely the B-Squad working this pool. They have a DJ playing Top 40 hits and some throwbacks on Friday, Saturday, Sunday. The pool itself was slimy from everyone's lotions and oils. Be careful when walking into the pool as the steps were the most slippery.
The Ichiban Sushi Restaurant next to the pool is AMAZINGLY fresh fish for a decent price- see my separate review for them.
The Bellagio fountains which are across the road are REALLY LOUD and can be hear and seen from most rooms at Ballys\/Paris from 11am to nighttime. Bring binder clips to close the blinds as ours didn't like to stay shut. We had a balcony on our room but the handle was taken off the door because we weren't allowed out. I never understood this- when we stayed at the Cosmopolitan hotel we had a room with a wrap around balcony that we were allowed to hang out on. It was awesome. Old school Vegas hotels really need to catchup to the new places like Aria and Cosmo. 
The resort fee was $15\/day and included internet access for 1 device and gym access. The fee was unavoidable- when I was at Ceasars they comped my fees so....",1,0,0

Okay, to be fair, all of the hotels\/casinos allow smoking - as annoying as it is.  But I get it.  Gamblers smoke.  However, I walked through most of the casinos on the strip, and none of them had the stench of Bally's.  They all had either some sort of air fresheners to mask the smell, or at the very least better ventilation.  Bally's simply stunk.  And pretty bad.  They definitely need better ventilation in the casino\/lobby.  Secondly, the entire time I was playing the games over three days, NOT ONE cocktail waitress offered me a drink.  I was under the impression that as long as you are gambling, drinks are on the house.  In fact, the one or two waitresses I did see were not accepting anything more than tips for the drinks.  I don't know why I was ignored.  My room was very nice, and extremely big.  I did, however, have to put the heat on 80 degrees to get it warm (I happened to visit Vegas on the coldest days of the year).  The hotel\/casino was nice, but comparatively speaking, not nearly as nice as the others I saw on the strip, for similar prices.  Next time I go to Vegas I'm staying elsewhere.",1,0,0

NEVER have I experienced such disruption at Ballys.  Room service for some reason is not available in the evening any more -- seems they got rid of the Sidewalk Cafe and replaced it with something else.  I don't typically use room service, but I always check out the menu just in case...well, this was a just in case moment as we were not feeling well and could not go out for dinner as planned.

When we arrived late at the counter there was a long line. Service was slow. Only three people were working on a busy night. So it took awhile to checkin, but the front desk chick was friendly. 

Our stay on the side of the 8th floor we had a view: the ""Linq"" strip mall sign, liquor store, the monorail tracks was close so we see it pass by every 30 minutes, Cromwell hotel, the Flamingo hotel and some lights from ""The Strip"". 

The comfort level was good because of how spacious our room was. The bath was decent and clean. Our room was non-smoking and didn't stink. The queen bed we slept in was just okay. 

The kinks:

- Hole on the bed sheet 
- Room AC sounded like a bathroom fan
- Electrical outlets are out of place 

We were told that the newer rooms are on the front of the hotel. Before my stay here I always wondered the theme of this hotel. Is Bally's a Tomorrow-land theme?

We were the last ones to book our room, and ended up booking here so we would be at the same hotel as the rest of our party. Wow, that was a huge mistake.

We tried to valet, but it was full throughout the entire weekend, so we had to self park our vehicle in BFE at the Paris, and then walk through the entire Paris hotel before finally arriving at our lovely motel.

Fellow Yelpers, if your time is worth any amount of money, avoid staying at Bally's at any cost since you will be held captive in their check in line for about an hour. I came during a Wed night but I can only imagine the frustration during a weekend... (There is also a line for Diamond and Platinum members but even that line was 7 people deep with 1 check in agent). In addition, if your reservation was made on the same day you won't be able to use their mobile online checkin. This is 2016, not 1999... get with it Bally's!

In any case, obviously the hotel doesn't have their best interest at heart. The faster they check people in, the faster they will be on the casino floor, eating in the restaurants or spending money in a variety of other ways rather than waiting in line for check-in. If you are considering Bally's due to the low price, I'd highly suggest Paris instead since they have a row of automated check in kiosks so you are in and out and are able to enjoy your time in Vegas starting on right note.

Rest assured, Ballys will not disappoint. I do recommend upgrading to the newer Tower which I believe is the Jubilee. Sure, maybe my experience would have been different if I was in the older Tower, but the bottom line is Bally's did not disappoint. Yes it is one of the older casinos on the strip. However the room was great(Comfortable bed, fridge included), the view is amazing, and the service was awesome.

Trip overview:

I came with my wife, my brother, and his wife. My brother had booked the Jubilee Tower, we had actually booked the older Tower because it was a little bit cheaper. When my brother checked in he simply asked if there were any free upgrades so we could all be together and sure enough they booked me into the Jubilee tower right across from his room at no additional charge. 

Also, you must sign up for the Total Rewards program. The benefits are great. This was my first time using the total rewards program and already just a few days later I already have comped rooms available. Sure you pay the resort fee, but that's a lot less than you would pay otherwise.

Lastly, Ballys truly is in a great spot, it does not take long to walk down to the Mirage, or up to Planet Hollywood, and has easy connected access to Paris.

The view from my brother's room could see the Eiffel Tower, as well as the fountain show at the Bellagio, which was a great at night. The view from my room was also nice, which included the new linq attraction, and also looked especially cool at night.

We all had a blast! I look forward to coming back soon.",7,0,5

The good things are the location and free, accessible parking.  Right in the middle of everything, although if you want to go to Luxor and Excalibur it's a little far.  But it's connected to Paris, which I like because we usually go to Vegas when it's really hot or really cold.  So you can stay indoors for a little extra.  It's also relatively close to Planet Hollywood, which has a lot of my favorite spots.

The biggest issue was the ridiculous check in time.  We were in line for at least 40 minutes.  Think about that.  You just finished a long drive or flight with all of your bags and you have to stand in line for that long just to check in.  That wait was bad enough that I would consider at least trying another hotel out of fear that the check-in at Bally's would be the same.

On top of that, we were given the rooms furthest from the elevator.  Well, technically there was one room further than ours, but at that point what difference does it make.

When we came back later the tub was still leaking, so went down to the front desk who told us we were put in for a new room.  I'm glad we went down to the front desk because otherwise we would never have known this.  Our second room smelled like someone had just smoked weed, so we called down and she granted us a third room.  She first tried to see if the housekeeper could just go in and  spray the room.  We politely declined that offer as we didnt want to sit in a room tht smelled like weed and floral spray.  Well, the third room had a sink that didn't quite work, but by this time we were done moving rooms so we didn't even bother telling them.  The minute you walk in the casino it wreaks like cigarette smoke. Some other hotels are better able to control it.  I feel as thought cig smoke is something you can't get away from in Vegas.  I will say that for most part the front desk was very helpful with the room situation.  The first girl I spoke to the night we checked in seemed a little annoyed I called, but all the others were very sweet. If it wasn't for the room situation I probably would have given higher stars.  The room altogether looked outdated, old, and not really that clean. On the  bright side the hotel has a good breakfast buffet and cafeteria area in the basement.

I arrived at 8:40 pm. It did not look like it would be too long, after all there were 6 workers there.  Unfortunately, 2 were exclusively for the priority guests (there was no line for them, and usually no guest either so they must've been attending to other things, because they helped very few customers.  Every other employee at check in was for us average folk.  Four windows said ""available"", but only 2 were handling the line, and very slowly at that.  The other 4 workers I have no idea what they were doing, certainly not helping to check people in or interacting with anyone.

Frankly, it made me feel bent out of shape after a very bumpy and stressful flight, rude airport information providers and gossiping co-workers at the Shuttle booths who didn't want to help me figure out the shuttle situation so they directed me to the booth next to them, which was closed because those ladies were hanging out in that first booth. Followed by an unattentive shuttle driver who left me standing in front of his locked van for 15 minutes in 108 degree heat at night.  I am a woman, travelling alone and in a foreign city... it was getting to be too much. It's okay, call me weak, but I was so ready to cry or scream at someone.  (I didn't though, so way to go, girl!)  I wasn't off to a great start in Vegas, but that was not the hotel's fault.  I simply wished the desk staff could have been considerate enough to flip their signs from Available to Closed being that they really were not available at all.  

Now, things get better, Thank Goodness!  Once I got to the counter everything went quickly for me.  The lady was friendly and efficient.  I had reserved a king sized bed yet was told I was booked into a 2  queen sized bedroom.  I asked her if she could find me one, she did, in the Indigo Tower, ""except, "" she said, ""it is on the 6th floor.""  I did not understand why this was important. It was my first time in Vegas and I was annoyed and tired and just wanted to drop my bags in my room, use the toilet and find something to eat!  I told her, rather grumply, that I didn't care what floor it was on.  So she sent me to the 6th floor.  

It's a strange layout, this hotel, lots of winding corridors with mirrors on the walls (so you are looking into infinity).  But I liked the feel of it.  I am not a big hotel amenity user, though this is Vegas and I was there to see the sights, lights, people and toss a few pennies at the slots.  So to me what would be important would be the bedroom because it would be where I would catch some downtime, sleep, eat.

The room was very large and I liked how it was set up.  The art could have been better certainly, but then some drunk might decide to steal it so best to keep it kinda 3rd Class ugly.  The bathroom was very clean and well stocked. There were multiple light settings so it could be very bright or at night when I soaked I could dim it to a more relaxing state.  Downside:  water tasted soapy\/chemically and was always too hot.

The closet was big enough for two people and held a safe within it.  What the room was missing was a small fridge, a microwave or coffeepot.  I brought a lot of my own food with me to save money and have more to play with,  Thankfully none of it needed to be refrigerated, but it was inconvenient to have to walk through the labyrinth of the 6th floor to get to a Soda or snack machine & the ice machine (not that I'd want an ice machine in my room!)  The floor was extremely quiet.  In fact, it was so quiet that sometimes when I needed a break from the CHAOS that is Las Vegas I would get a book from my room and take it to the sitting area on the floor (it was roomier, less cluttered and warmer).

The bed was wonderfully perfect.  We both loved it, very comfy and the pillows were great too.  Very clean.  There was no real blanket on the bed, maybe something that resembled a throw.  Whatever it was, it wasn't enough.  I have no idea why we never asked housekeeping for an extra one.  Perhaps it was just too convenient of an excuse for spooning.  

Room's downside:  The thermostat could not seem to cooperate with our desires. It was pretty much always freezing in there, until it wasn't.  The fan would blow all night, right across the bed.  You could actually feel the breeze & without a real blanket it was sometimes difficult to sleep (5 days\/4 nights).  And yes, I did come to discover the mystery as to why the 6th floor was undesirable... no view.  Yep, that's right, our room looked over a roof with giant ventilation fans and blue lights that shown straight into the windows at night if we had not closed the heavy drapes.

Negatives: Slow check-in, thermostat broken, oh and wi-fi... it only worked about 20 min the entire trip. And the guy who was sent to repair it was rude, said I should invest in a real computer.  Like, I'd travel with a desk top computer!",0,0,0

I would never recommend anyone staying in the Ballys, unless in the future they did deep cleaning, update the sheets, curtains, mattress, pillows...basically they need to renovate or move the hotel to the South end of the strip in the vacant spot next to Circus Circus! 

Upon the first night we arrived, out heat was broke! It was December....how is the heat in the hotel room broke? So just like out of some funny comedy starring Jack Black, the maintenance man arrives in a gray suit, greasy and chubby. I almost couldn't contain my laughter. 

Other crazy unmentionables....I'm a fanatic about clean sheets and to my amazement, there were no duvets, not top blankets...nada. The sheets served as your top cover. Umm...but its winter, its 50 degrees outside, and no blanket! I also got a chance to peek at the mattress. It was yellow, dingy, and raggedy...it literally belonged in the dumpster. 

Talk about getting what you pay for....in my opinion, I still paid too much for that!",1,0,1

The Thai restaurant had good tasting food but ridiculously overpriced and blew me out.  Mattresses were super cheap and uncomfortable.  $5 for a brewed coffee and you have to go all the way to the other end of the casino in the morning.  Do not stay here for any reason.

1. Location.  Bally's is pretty much center strip.  It is attached to Paris, just down from Planet Hollywood, and across the street from Ceasar's, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and City Center. 
2. Total Rewards property.  Bally's, Ceasar's, Harrah's, Rio, Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, and Imperial Palace are all owned by the same company and on the same rewards system.  So you can get points for gambling at any of those casinos and sometimes this gets you free rooms. :) 
3. Free shuttle to Rio. No taxi fare!

Heydey no longer, more and more properties both new and renovated are creeping past Bally's as the decades roll along. Even then, Bally's remains a solid choice for the ever changing face of The Strip.

As a part of the Caesars Entertainment family, Bally's is a part of the largest gaming corporation in the world. Total Rewards lovers can earn and spend their points here where the comps are easier to utilize than higher end properties. The casino itself is rather average by today's standards with a solid array of slot machines and just under 100 tables. I'm pleased to report Spanish 21 is available here and a beefed up a poker room is available for hold 'em lovers.

The resort itself is as massive as it looks. Home to nearly 3,000 rooms, there is a good shot that there will be rooms here than a lot of the smaller places that sell out quickly. While the room rates will always fluctuate, the retail side of the hotel is reasonable for Vegas standards, especially when considering the middle of the Strip location.

Hotel dwellers take note: If you're going to be situated in the North Tower, be prepared for Las Vegas circa 1995 rooms. If at all possible, try to get a Jubilee room, the equivalent of the GO series at the Flamingo. It's contemporary, modern, and a true surprise for Bally's visitors. Concierge is on point as always, a huge plus considering the grade of the resort.

The best part of Bally's is also the most surprising: Major upgrades on the food front. Once considered the boring laughing stock of the local culinary scene, Bally's is now boasting one of the better steakhouses in the mid strip in Bally's Steakhouse (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/ballys-steakhouse-las-vegas). Adding to the meat is their renovated buffet, the classic Sterling Brunch (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/sterling-brunch-las-vegas) which has upgraded furiously not just in price ($40+ per person) but in the abundance of luxurious choices (especially on the sea food front) as well. BLT is set to come in sometime in the next few months and other quick bite businesses (::coughs:: chains!) will likely surface their lots come 2014.

What's next for Bally's? Who knows. A face lift is most likely given the overhaul of Caesars property renovations but something tells me it'll all start from the inside out first. Be sure to enjoy Bally's before another classic Las Vegas property joins the present.",14,2,8

Push the ""up"" button & BING! ""going up!""  Up to the top floor we ride.  

Then down we go....to the 23rd floor! Apparently, the only way to get down from the 23rd floor is via up. But not always. That's Vegas, baby. 

So, the elevator was a joke, but worse was the staff's reaction. I will hand it to everyone from ""the suit"" in the elevator (we reported it to him directly in real-time and he questioned our credibility.) Hilarious. Absolutely not confident in him, we stopped at the (not terribly) friendly faces behind the front desk...everyone seemed consistently not too concerned about this elevator situation. 

They do respond more swiftly when your room has no heat though. That was the first night's entertainment. The heater repair guy made it quickly up though and even gave a nice play by play as to the problem. And just for your own laugh - I now understand the sensory effect of both cold and warm BO. I bet they run this guy ragged. 

This is sounding pretty two-star-ish, isn't it!? But no...

HIGH ROLLER all night long. I'd ridden the high roller my previous trip to Vegas and that was a ""once and done"" experience for me. Eh. 

I was over the High Roller but it wasn't done with me! Little did I realize upon checking in to Bally's that I'd be soon staring that baby in the eye from the 23rd floor. ""How do you like me now?"" that amazing wheel wanted to know. I was challenged but still undecided. 

Go out to eat and return...WOW!! Beautiful! Softly turning and the lights! And so, the High Roller lit my night. World's Best. It won me over. 

For the price (I think it was like $180 on a premium night, short notice - Expedia) and the view\/location and the comfy bed...I had fun with the elevator situation, loved the roller, and all-around would stay here again if dictated by necessity. Note: this was late Nov. 2014)",25,23,20

Only reason bunked here for new years 2014 is got comped off father-in-laws' degenerate slot play on my total rewards card.
Only good thing is that you can hop over to MGM or paris intra-hotel. Really a souped up ghetto casino and pad. Havent stayed here since 1998, and even though they remodeled rooms, mine had stained walls, very dusty, dust filled room, terrible beds and linens, and the cheapest towels this side of wal-mart. I have NEVER felt a cheaper towel it was almost like bathroom sandpaper awful. Room reeked of smoke at nights as halls were laid waste to by smokers, as cancer crept underneath our front door. Not even a minibar or fridge in the room. Were talking cookie-cutter, no frills shit.  And great color choices there team management, off-orange tones... PUKE. Room had a safe with big chipped paint spot and the inside was gross, like a lint filled dryer filter as the base. Felt like your putting your valuables on top of a dead animal or road kill.
Casino? Besides being easily navigational (because its small and straight), table games are the utmost joke...they literally had ONE or TWO single\/double deck tables COMBINED, maybe 5-6 total blackjack tables in the ENTIRE casino. All the rest bullshit mississippi stud\/texas hold em poker those stupid retard-fuck games.
Even their casino cage sucks...max 2 open sometimes wait 5-10 minutes just to cash in your shitty ass leftovers from the wack-ass selection of games you were forced to play.
On top of it all, the main entrance (escalator through those cool blue rings at night) completely shut down, construction all around it. 
The only thing I liked here was the sportsbook which is sweet, and...thats about it. Also best property to get to the las vegas pinball hall of fame, which me and my son love each time to visit. I dont think they even have a cafe anymore, pretty pathetic vegas strip joint.
Must say, Larry at check in is a cool dude though. (black middle aged with glasses)
Machines are a dismal joke good luck I had none.
And needless to say, not even close to an upscale clientele or vegas property. If ghetto-slumming is your idea of a good vegas stay, a good choice. And their jubilee show that I saw a few years back has some ugly-ass 40+ bitchez running crazy with naked titties. Please change them and your rooms again.

Could not even get one to give me a drink, and the lady next to me did not even have a chance to tip her.",2,2,2

The check in experience was pretty bad. We arrived on a Friday afternoon, peak time for check in at a hotel on the strip on any given Friday but this was Nascar weekend so it was even busier than normal. They only had 3 windows open for check in, 3. Oh excuse me, there was a 4th but that was exclusively for platinum members so we mere peasants weren't even allowed to glance in the direction of that window. So we wait patiently for our turn, which took forever because it seems every group that went to check in had some special request or another. Then there were the two chicks who didn't seem to understand what a line was, who kept pacing back and forth in front of the check in windows waiting to make eye contact with one of the check in clerks to ask whatever their ridiculous question was. No one took the bait and they ended up wandering off eventually.

The rooms themselves were ok. Not great, just ok. I agree with another yelper about the condition of the windows, they were really dirty. And the views are not great from any of the rooms. The room was clean, but they seem to have problems with burned out light bulbs because both rooms that our group had had at least one lamp that didn't work.

One night we decided to get dessert from room service. Ok because, their ""24 hour"" cafe is closed after 2pm!! WTF????  Anyway, not wanting to schlep down the strip for a slice of pie we opted for room service. They told us it would take 30-40 minutes for a couple slices of pie and some coffee. They lied. After 50 minutes we called and were told our order was on the way up. Again, they lied because it was another 15 minutes before it came. I will say it was some good dessert but my goodness it took forever.

The casino is pretty small but they do seem to have plenty of tables and definitely enough slots to go around. My only complaint about the casino is the live music they have every night. I enjoy live music, don't get me wrong, but in such a small place having a live band basically in the middle of the casino is a bit much. I prefer to enjoy the music and then be able to step away and do something else after awhile, but due to the location of the stage in the casino you're pretty limited on where to go to escape it.

The Steakhouse: If this review was only for the steakhouse it would be 5's across the board. You have to know that the restaurant is there, it's tucked pretty far back in the corner. Without a doubt, one of the best dining experiences in recent memory. Our server was on top of it but not in our face. The food was perfectly prepared. It is on the pricey side, everything is ala carte, but if you go in knowing that there won't be any surprises when you look and the menu or the bill. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. One had halibut, which looked scrumptious. One had pork chops, one had filet mignon and one had prime rib. Then we ordered a dessert which was spectacular. I highly recommend the Steakhouse at Bally's.

Would I stay here again? Probably. As I said at the beginning, for the price you can't beat the location. It's not Bellagio or Wynn, but it also doesn't carry the same price tag. Basically, you get what you pay for at Bally's.",0,0,0

We are here for a dance competition and we go out to the pool. My cooler got stolen. The people giving towels as you walk in tell me there's nothing they can do. The security guard is rude. Yells at me when I made a mistake and mixed up the colors of my luggage so. Instead of two blue and a black I reversed it. Sorry that I was all upset about me stuff. I'm human. 

Tells me they check room keys to everyone walking in but the three times I had gone to the pool not once was I check. Make me feel like I'm wrong. They tell me the police is the only one who can review videos but then tell the police there are none. What is that about. 

My camera, phone, team uniform all get stole and I don't even get as much as an apology from security or the manager. The ones who were at all sympathetic were the valet guys. Whats that about that they won't even check security cameras.  I'm left with no credit cards and no money and they didn't even offer a free comped meal. They comp all the time.

My daughter team wins first place and I can't even celebrate because of the treatment I received. I know my stuff is gone but they could at least pretend to care about the guests. I have not felt at all as if they care.

I've stayed here twice (once with family and another time this past weekend with my friends) and it's been a pleasure staying here because it is located in the middle of the strip and it's not a confusing hotel to find your room.

Our room was nice and clean with a view of the strip looking toward Palms. The bathroom was big and everything was organized neatly.

Only downfall about Bally's is it doesn't have an nightclubs or dayclubs.

Bally's has been one of my go-to hotels. The rooms are very clean and you get a lot for the low price. I've been on floor 20 & floor 25, the rooms were different from each other (one had a sofa, the other had a chair thing) but both had a lot more room than I had expected.

My shower\/bath were combined, there was no mold. Everything was very clean. The layout of the hotel is nice and pretty easy to navigate. Parking is included with your resort fee, as is wifi. (It does explain this one the paper you get with your room keys, but the way it's set up online it makes it look like it's going to charge you an additional 14.99 for wifi. If you've paid the resort fee, you've paid for 2 devices on the wifi and will not be charged extra.)

I was able to pay cash for my resort fees, which was nice as I had recently lost my debit card and wasn't sure how that was going to work.

Customer service was always great. Friendly, polite, straight to the point. At a lot of hotels I've found that their customer service has been extremely lacking or it always seems like you're a hassle to be checked in\/out.

They've redone the outside of the entrance to include a bunch of ""box shops"" and a Starbucks to make the long walk not so boring. Good move on their part! Decent view!

The cons?
1. The cable is horrible at this hotel. You get 1 channel that someone between the age of 20-30 would watch, VH1. (I don't even watch that channel, but that was all there was) The rest are in Chinese? They definitely need to upgrade that because on a hot day, sometimes you just want to go, relax and watch some decent TV. Can't do that here. If you have 3 flat-screens in the suite and bad cable, what is the point? 
2. The rooms are awkwardly set up. We got upgraded to a suite but it was SO large and the AC only worked on the bedroom side of the room. You have a nice seating area and a huge dining table to eat at, but the tiniest fridge and nothing else. In most of the other suites I've been in, if you have a dining room, you at least have SOME kitchen utensils or a mini-kitchen to cook a little at. Not the case here.

Bally's does not have the same name recognition and prestige as Caesar's Palace, the Venetian, or the Bellagio; however, you have to consider what you are looking for. Please note this review is long. 

LOCATION: The hotel is in a prime location, right in the middle of The Strip and near many other major hotels. Bally's is connected to the Paris Las Vegas Hotel--go through the casino (past the poker tables) and you'll see the path to Le Boulevard. Planet Hollywood Hotel, the Miracle Mile Shopping Complex, the Cosmopolitan, ARIA, the Cromwell, the Flamingo, Nobu, the Bellagio, and Caesar's Palace are all accessible with a pretty short walk. The latter two are accessible by taking the bridge in front of Bally's, which leads to Via Bellagio--inside, you turn left\/straight to reach the Bellagio and right for Caesar's. Other hotels are not too far away either--you just need to walk a little bit further. Food (casual and upscale), booze, boobs, and casinos are all within walking distance. There is a CVS right next to Bally's (at the S Las Vegas Blvd entrance).

PRICE: If you just want a regular hotel room at a relatively low price, Ballys is a great option. I paid an average $92\/day albeit with an ID.me discount for four nights ($102 without it), and it came with a ""Strip view"" (no extra charge--facing the Eiffel Tower Restaurant with other hotel towers visible). The large ""resort fee"" covers the different services and amenities offered, i.e., wi-fi. If you're looking for something a little more romantic, you might want to keep searching. 

CROWD: It's mixed. There are single guests, couples, larger families, smokers, and non-smokers of all age groups among others. I didn't have any problem with loud and rowdy guests on my floor, but that is based on my recent experience. 

ROOMS: My room was in the Jubilee Tower. Unlike other hotels I've stayed at, it was actually pretty quiet. My room was clean (enough), came with a fridge (not all rooms have one), complementary toiletries, iron\/ironing board, towels, and coffee among others. Housekeeping does a pretty solid job. Keep in mind they don't clean rooms after 5pm. If they skip your room and it's not 5pm yet, just head to the Hotel Services room on your floor and request for it. The shower's water pressure is weak, while the ""hot"" water is more on the ""moderately warm"" side. You could order room service, but you might as well eat outside; you *are* in Vegas, after all. There is also a food court at the basement level of the hotel; take the stairs\/escalator located near the last row of slot machines in the back. The ""Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner"" sign on the wall is your landmark.

CASINO\/GRAND BAZAAR: The first thing you see when you enter the hotel is the check-in counter (left side) and the casino (right\/middle). High stakes poker tables are next to Nosh\/near the path leading to the Jubilee Towers, while the regular poker tables are in the middle; the slot machines go past them. The Grand Bazaar is home to small shops and eateries accessible by taking the escalator on your left (near the entrance). It is also a shorter way to access the bridge leading to the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace.

There is always a line of taxis (cars, vans, and MPVs) parked near the entrance, so no need to call for one. If you want an attractive hotel ""with a name,"" I can't blame you; I personally like the Bellagio. However, Bally's is a very solid option on The Strip.",10,1,1

The first night (thurs) we were upgraded to a resort-like suite; it was two stories - personally, I was really excited for this because I've never stayed in a hotel room with STAIRS. If we ever get this again, I'd love to bring one of those two story-long beer bongs that starts from the second floor so u can chug from the first. Yeah buddy.
Second and third nights we stayed in the diamond room, two large beds and we were able to ask for 2 more rolling beds. 

I'll just jot down some quick Cliff Notes:
1) Not super glamorous like the Wynn\/encore\/ph\/cosmo, but definitely not shabby\/rundown. Just simple and clean-cut, which I'm more than happy with.
2) Great location - pretty much middle of the strip.
3) Right across the street (flamingo) there's a liquor store. So if you run out of your pre-gaming equipment like we did, you can just walk on over and buy a few bottles\/chasers at affordable prices, no problemo. 
4) About a 5 minute walk from Ellis Island - an offshore dated casino that has awesome $4.99 steak & eggs and amazing beers (read my review on Ellis Island).
5) Only negative I can think of: the TV's were very, very outdated. But uh, who watches TV in Vegas?",5,4,3

Bally's would definitely not be my first choice of hotels in vegas, but when someone is paying for your lodging, you shut up and be thankful!

After cracking open a couple of beers in the lobby, my group waited for about 45 minutes for the front counter to check us in. It was a ridiculous amount of party time lost, and frankly unacceptable. They had two chicks working the counter and none of them were at all working in a fast pace. Luckily we had beers to hold us down during the excruciating wait.

Rooms: 

They were pretty standard, two queen size beds, a tv, bathroom with tons of mirrors. It was a comfortable size, but the stench of musk, inconsistent flow of hot water, and very persistent housekeeping turned me off very quickly. 

One of the guys in our group got the executive suite, which was a lot nicer! It housed two large and very comfortable seating area not including the bar! The bedroom was huge with a even larger size bathroom with jacuzzi, shower, 2 1\/2 bathrooms. Surely, this is the pre-game\/party room!

Pool:

Thank god for the dessert weather! San Francisco spring weather will never compete with vegas'. The pool was nothing spectacular, but it accommodated a good amount of people , had really loud top 40 music and yes, guittos and guidette - it wasn't a pool party without them! There is also a bar within the vicinity which serves HUGE & STRONG margaritas for 18 dollars a pop.

Service:

Aside, from the persistent housekeepers and slow front desk peeps, everyone else was really helpful. The security guards encouraged our heavy drinking (they gave us 2 or 1 drink coupons!!!) and belligerent dancing. very cool! 

Location:

The thing about Bally's is their easy access location right smack center of the strip. It's very convenient to head over to Caesar's, the Bellagio or even any other hotel on the strip . This makes taking the cab virtually useless saving you some bucks for alcohol!

No, definitely not. 

Is it the best? Well, maybe. If you're from Shawnee, Oklahoma and are a chain smoking alcoholic 78 year-old, you will probably find nirvana within the confines of this place. 

We stayed here for part of our trip because we pretty much stayed for free during March Madness, a very busy time in Vegas. 

The good:

1. location - it's dead center of the strip. If you like to casino hop, this is great for you. I've been to Vegas many times and always rent a car. I rarely, if ever, walk to other casinos nearby. But just in case you do...you're in luck. 

2. There are hot bitches everywhere. Like 88 year-old hot bitches with a cig strapped on their acrylic nails. 

3. The rooms are very, very quiet and this is coming from a noise sensitive person. 

4. The housekeeping staff was extremely nice and very efficient. 

the bad:

1. smoke. everywhere. Our floor was non-smoking, yet it always smelled like a chimney. 

2. Tube televisions. Even my broke ass has had a flat screen for five years. A billion dollar corporation can't upgrade? 

3. no restaurants at which I would dine within the hotel. yuk. 

4. While the room was clean and bathroom was surprisingly nice, the entire hotel just felt dated and dirty. If I were the owners, I'd tear it down. It so reminds me of the dumps where I stayed in Daytona Beach at spring break in 1992.

They have guest parking in the parking lot next door which is actually rather far and inconvenient for guest of the hotel.

The bathroom was typical nothing special but very large shower and tub. housekeeping was also on top of keeping room clean they called twice to ask if I wanted my room cleaned becuase I was late getting up.

The only thing negative I would have to say is the windows do need some washing on the outside and the furniture in the room is a little dated.

Bally's is one of the older Vegas casinos that is conveniently located near the middle of the strip.  Its an easy walk to Paris and Bellagio for starters, and they also have a monorail station if you need to go farther. I had fond memories of Bally's since I used to stay here when I was a tournament chess player in the mid 90's.  My last hotel stay was in 2012 I believe for a technical conference for work.  Funny thing was they had the National Tattoo and Body Piercing Convention at the same time.

Fast forward today.  I took my parents for a gaming run to Bally's since they are one of the very few casinos on the Strip that have half-dozen or so Ultimate Hold'em tables for $5.  Most casinos have just one table and usually have $10 limits.  The Blackjack is also decent here but you'll need to spot for a 3:2 shoe game for $10.  They have the dreaded 6:5 games too.  Another downside is during the evenings, they often bump the Blackjack table limits from $10 to $15.  

Conclusion: Play here if you love Ultimate Hold'em.",6,3,3

No groups of people walking by your room all drunk and loud. 

Also, Bally's is connected to Paris so if you're headed toward Planet Hollywood\/Cosmo, you can cut through there and avoid the heat outside. We ended up walking through Paris hotel more than Bally's itself ha.

I could not believe that my room had been recently remodeled...it still seemed old. I probably got suckered into the upgrade so the hotel could make more money. The room is very big...there was also a powder room and a large bathroom. I could have probably lived in the bathroom, if I wanted too. I really did not need the powder room but if my wife was with me she would have definitely enjoyed this. 

My iron was complete broken...it looked like someone cracked the metal and the water was leaking out of it. I called down to housekeeping and received a brand new iron...that made me feel special. 

Also someone Australian Guy left his money, air travel documents and passport in my safe.

The employees were very nice and helpful. Even the maid staff said, ""hello"" or ""good morning"" almost every time we walked by them. 

The parking situation was pretty good and there was plenty of parking,  however, the parking is shared with the Paris Hotel. The garage elevators stink, they're dirty and rather questionable, but they take you down to the casino floor. Once downstairs, go right for Bally's, go left for Paris. CAREFUL: there are sales folk that will push you to buy stuff, offer ""deals"" and many WILL follow you two steps too long. If you're into that thing, go ahead and enjoy the waste of time and your new best friend, other than that...RUN!! 

Once you go right, keep going straight to the tiled\/main floor, turn left, walk a bit and the registration is on your right. We arrived mid-afternoon and there was a long line. Although, it only took us 20 minutes to see someone (this may vary though). You have paperwork in order, it shouldn't take long. Turn to the right, get on the carpet, follow the ""runway"" and depending on what tower you're in, the elevators will be on your left. Plenty of elevators (8 per tower) and they were overall decent. 

We stayed in the Indigo Tower and although it needs a major facelift, we were happy with the spacious ""smoking"" King bed room. Bed was a little firm, but not cement like. Nice little work station table, a couch, coffee table, a couple of chairs, and another small table and plenty of room.,You get four small pillows and a refrigerator is an extra $15\/day charge (no thank you). The water pressure in he shower could be a little better, but definitely doable. Oh, no fan in the bathroom. It wasn't too noisy, but you may hear occasional voices as people walk by. Another thing, there is one of those doors that lead into the adjoining room. It's locked, keep it locked, put an extra chair against the door and you're good. 

In order to get out to the main strip area (remember where you registered?). Turn left from where you registered, go up the escalators. Just follow through and beyond the covered walkway, down the escalators and your down in your bazaar area. Check out the little bar to your left. Haven't checked it out, but the sign they have displayed outside seems enticing with good deal drinks.There are plenty of outlet type of shops out front and again, many sales folk trying to entice you to try this, or try that (meet new best friends). A few little eatery places and your bus stop is to the left, street side, out in front of Paris. There is construction  going on at this time, so be careful. 

Bally's is a great location and the rooms are reasonably priced, which is why we chose here. We've always stayed at New York and we're done with New York. If you're into gambling, the slots here were definitely more ""friendly"" than at New York. I just didn't like the fact they continued to keep the crap tables at $10 minimum (yes, I'm a cheap ass, but I prefer the $5 minimum. They DID have the five bucks, but not that often). 

Plenty of shops that take you out from Bally's into Paris. My wife liked the, ""The Strip"" shop. She bought a couple of hats that, believe it of not, were hell of a lot cheaper than Freemont. We didn't stop at any other shops or eateries between the Bally's and Paris connection, but I wish we would've. Seems like great places to stop and eat. Prices seems reasonable considering where you're at. Although, may be a ""fine print"" that I missed.

Check Bally's out. If you're in your room to sleep, gather your things, and take a little break, you won't be disappointed. If you're into flash, bling, and a ""suite"" like room, go somewhere else. If you're a simple ass like I am, you'll do just fine. Enjoy and good luck!!",6,0,1

I spent 2 nights here last week on a business trip (read: trade show,) and had a pretty mediocre or less experience.  

We were in a huge group and all staying at Ballys, and were even renting two gigantic suites in which to conduct meetings throughout the show.  One of the women I was traveling with went in to check everything out in one of the suites before the CEO arrived and realized that they were completely re-tiling the bathroom, even though they'd promised this suite to the company the following night. The entire ceiling had been demolished and was sitting in the tub when she went in to check everything out. Ooops.

Another one of my colleagues had a plumber on the floor under her sink when she checked into her room, and my room had literally no shower head; just a pipe coming out of the wall blowing 90-mile-an-hour water all over the tub\/shower area.  Nice wake-up call anyway.

The restaurant selection is also really limited, and none of their ""signature"" restaurants is open for lunch. There's an Italian place, a steakhouse and a Japanese\/sushi place plus a coffee shop. I think that the sushi place does serve lunch and the coffee shop is pretty much open around the clock. Unlike even Planet Hollywood, there are no branded restaurants to speak of. Even PH has PF Chang's and a Starbucks.

The sad thing is that I know none of this is limited or particular to Ballys.  With the gazillions of hotel rooms in the city to attract and ""accommodate"" the gazillions of visitors, there is no such thing as personalized service or one-on-one experiences. You're just another person in their hotel\/casino, walking around with a drink in the elevators, running up and down the hallways screaming in the middle of the night, 18 of you to a room and because they've lost the personal touch, the hotel and its management couldn't give even a tiny shit.

The experience in Vegas is bleak, and I found nothing calming or oasis-like about Ballys. I think I'd like Bellagio or Mandalay Bay better, even though I've never stayed there.  Ballys is a step up from Flamingo and the likes, and it's on the monorail route (not that it won't take you forever to walk out there from your room,) but I'm thinking that's not quite cutting it anymore. It's centrally located across from Bellagio and connected to Paris (which was where we ended up to eat mostly,) and by comparison I imagine, on the lower side for pricing.",6,5,8

It could have used a fridge, as we had to throw out delicious left overs, but I think that's more our fault for not asking for one.  So, yes, we spent our resting time on the twenty-third floor in plush setting, slept in a nice King's sized bed, and I was able to do some quick work at the desk.  Room. Was. Great.

The casino attendants could use some work. Now, I value myself as a person who has worked every single job in the service industry. From night floor waxer to dishwasher all the way up to General Manager of a restaurant (and I've managed in other industries.) So, I don't know what floor staffing a casino entails, but I do know that what we experienced was well below what you feel standards should be. 

I ventured to Vegas with a friend who is a Diamond Club member. The girl loves to gamble. Loves the slots (where I value cards). She spends all day on the slots, and two days ago, she lost $1,000 over two hours. Not once, in that $1,000 spending spree, was she approached for a customary drink. I ventured over to her with my winnings (I'm a fairly lucky individual) and when she told me she hadn't seen a drink person, I ventured off to find one for her. I ran into a girl who scoffed at me with a ""That's not my section."" And when I asked- ""Well, can you point me to who's it is?"" She decided to walk away instead.

I retreated to my friend telling her I had no luck, and when she spotted a girl, she took off and her girl said- ""I don't take drink orders from there."" My friend came back to let me know that's what she was told, and I told her I was told the same thing. We eventually found our drink girl, doing her hair, checking her phone, laughing with server friends- behind the bar. She came out, empty-trayed, and we flagged her down.

So, I'd say- the first two girls need to be properly trained on situation-handling. The third girl needs to be properly scolded for valuing her social life over her job when she is on the clock. Management needs to be told of these problems so they can better train their staff.  Really let us down, as we were staying there- we'd like to gamble there.

After reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous to stay here, but we were staying for free so I couldn't really complain. The room was actually surprisingly nice! I think we had an upgraded room, but it was HUGE!! Decently clean too. 

Two people. Two nights. One bath towel... Uhhhhh that's definitely not going to work. Even after calling down 3 times for extra towels, still never got them. 

My boyfriend made the reservation for the room, so naturally my name wasn't on the reservation. He left for the day to play in a tournament which left me to fend for myself. Upon arriving back at the room, my key didn't work!! The lady only made them for one night, even after we specifically asked to make sure they were made for both nights. So I went down to the desk to have them remade, and she wouldn't make them for me! She wrote down all my information, had security meet me upstairs (after I sat in the hallway waiting for 35 minutes) so they could let me in the room to ""prove I was staying there."" I mean, I get it. I could be some random person. But it's still annoying. 

My boyfriend and I met for dinner, and he called to have me put on the reservation so I could get a stupid key made for myself. When I went to have the key remade, my name wasn't on there! She was really rude about it too, and acted like I was such an inconvenience which made me even more annoyed.  So being the brat I am, I threw a fit. Didn't work lol. She said security would be happy to let me in the room again, but they couldn't make me a key... So I'm writing this review as I've been sitting in the hallway for over a hour waiting for them again. Hopefully I don't have to pee otherwise I'm going in the hallway!

This trip I picked up my car from the valet and drove to my next destination. When I got out of my car I noticed that the cover on my passenger side mirror was missing.
I drove back to Ballys valet to find out what happen. The valet boy told me that it probably ""fell off"" when I was driving and urged me not to make a report. I drive a BMW and am sure it did not just fall off. 

It took an hour to make a report and had to follow up with several phone calls as well. I was annoyed with what happen but not too upset because I was sure Ballys would pay for what they had done.

I just received a letter in the mail today that informed me Ballys will not be taking responsibility for damaging my car. I am not the type of person to blame valet for something they did not do and would not have even made a report if i was not 100% sure it was them.

I am very disappointed in Ballys they would have better off paying for the damage they caused than losing my business and the business of anyone I know. If you do decide to stay there I suggest self parking!!! If you do valet make sure to inspect your car before leaving!!",6,1,1

I booked a room after reading a lot of the sketchy reviews from YELP...some good some horrible. I had to see for myself, because after visiting Vegas many time I never stayed at Bally's.

THE READ DEAL (read on)

Location on the strip TOP NOTCH...worth it on it's own merit.

I stayed from 12-10-2013  to 12-13-2013
I had a room in the South Tower.  I asked for North Tower but they were booked. I don't ""live in the room"" while in Las Vegas so no big deal. If you visit Las Vegas and stay in the room more than you are out then shame on you anyway. You can do that at home!

I entered my room on floor 17 South Tower  and I was immediately thrilled by how big it was.  I mean double the size of what I expected.     The bathroom was pretty good. It was rehabbed but good enough for my use.  I mean if you are looking for a TV in the mirror and a butler you wipe your butt that is not what you are going to get here. It was adequate, clean and fine by any normal human beings standards.   
The room itself was large (king size bed)  huge chair, 2 desks, cabinet\/ dresser with 48"" flat screen and nightstands.   It was a fine room and for the price location and you can not beat it.

I can not say what the other rooms look like but I know the South Tower was pretty decent.  The few was fair, but the view is OUTSIDE not inside. The room itself was everything you could ask for for a normal person.  You'll be happy you chose Bally's.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  GOOD DEAL",5,2,1

I will start with the pros since it's a short list. The hotel itself is in a great central strip location, which is one of the reasons we decided to give it a try. I also enjoyed gambling in the casino and the pool was pretty decent. As for the room, the bed was comfortable enough. 

Now for the cons:  We were asked if we would like to upgrade to a suite for an additional $50 per night. I figured, 'why not?' We were only staying two nights anyway. After seeing the suite, I regretted paying that much. It is very outdated. Yes, we had a Jacuzzi, but it was quite old. I got in anyway to help justify my $50 upgrade fee (which was actually $56 with tax). The jets worked well, but I noticed scum floating in the water once I turned these on so I quickly got out. The water pressure in the shower was horrible - very hard for me to wash my hair. The carpet was dingy and the wall paper may have been the original. I think the room has potential once it is upgraded. I liked the overall layout. 

The BIGGEST CON:  We had an iPad mini taken from our room. Housekeeping had already come for the day so we didn't expect anyone else to come into the room. We went to gamble for a while and when we returned the iPad was no longer on the table, and the bed had been made again. However, we do not think housekeeping had anything to do with the missing iPad. While we were gone, an air spa was delivered (we did not request it, nor were we told it would be delivered). We should have left the 'do not disturb' door hanger on our door, but like I said, housekeeping had already been there. So, we didn't expect the additional person. We filed a report with security and are awaiting Bally's reply. I am not that optimistic anything will come of it. It would have been a nice gesture for a hotel manager to at least contact us and acknowledge our complaint, but that did not happen. We only spoke with the security guard.

BOTTOM LINE:  Stick to at least 4-star hotels on the Vegas strip. Many of these hotels tend to be very reasonably priced and are well worth a few extra dollars. If you opt to stay at Bally's, definitely don't pay for an upgrade and leave laptops and other electronics at home or lock them in your suitcase when you leave. We were lax on this last travel tip, and it resulted in a roughly $400 reminder of why you should always lock away your valuables even when you are only gone for a short time.",4,0,0

Buss boy came back and we asked for waitress and he said he can take our order.  I ordered Steak and Eggs cause there was a advertisement on the table.  He then tells me oh we don't have steak.  I said but you are advertising it her as I pointed to the plastic thing on the table and what does he do? He pulls it out and says oh we don't have any steak??Really!!!! in Vegas at Bally's... so I chose Eggs and Nopales (catus).  40 minutes later we see a waitress and we say we have been waiting for over 40 min and she said let me get the manager, and we said we don't even have chips and salsa like the other customers.  She said ok I will get that.  Came back and dropped off chips and salsa.  The Manager came out and apologize and said ""I'm going to comp your meal don't worry"".  We let him know that we had just gotten our chips and again he apologized.  the meal came after 1 hour and 10 minutes.  The tacos were cold, the hot wings were sweet my friend said, but no sign of my meal.  My plate came in 7 minutes later. and OMG.... the eggs were cold, I had asked for over easy eggs and I got sunny side up.  The cactus was not cooked (they turn a dark green when cooked) and they were under a hard tortilla smothered with black beans.  I called the waitress who was useless all she can say I will get the manager.  Manager came and I told him my complain and again he said but I'm comping you the meal., I said but this is not what I ordered, eggs are cold and I asked for over easy not sunny side up.  He said well let me ask the chef, I said if its longer than 5 minutes I don't want it.

We stayed here for a convention, two rooms, and I don't even know where to begin.  From the incompetent RUDE idiot ""Christine"" at check-in, whom the manager repeated was ""new"", it started off VERY BADLY.  Never mind the details on that issue, it was just the beginning of our hell stay....

From the GHETTO-filthy paint-chipped room, with the bathroom faucet literally falling off, to the carpet\/chairs\/walls, etc, that were STAINED with questionable GAG-stains, this has to be the filthiest, smokiest, nastiest hotel we have EVER stayed in.

All 3 of us have traveled the world, and this was just a nightmare experience.

We would not stay here again if it were free.  One of our rooms FLOODED on the last day of the convention, which was really kind of funny after everything else we experienced.

The manager ""Jose"" did move us to another room after we informed him how broken-down and nasty the first room was, but with the ignorant tacky comment, ""We normally charge people MORE to stay in the nicer tower......""  Are you kidding me?  It costs MORE to stay in a clean room in the same hotel?  We are not talking a move to a fancy suite, just a cleaner newer room costs MORE?????????

These people are incompetent idiots.  I was in the hotel industry, and they have run this baby into the ground.  It is all about numbers.  ZERO QUALITY OR CLASS.  And we were not looking for fancy.  We came to Vegas to work a convention, not to party.  We were not expecting luxury, far from it.  Motel 6, where I stayed many many years ago at the age of 19, was MUCH MUCH MUCH nicer than Bulllys.

Indeed, the manager ""Jose"", moved us to a nicer room, but it was down the longest hallway ever (think the movie The Shining), and he put us at the VERY end.  It was SMOKEY (on a non-smoking floor), and there was INCESSANTLY LOUD CONSTRUCTION EVERY MORNING STARTING AT 6 AM.  Do NOT plan to sleep if you are here for a convention or a vacation.  I left exhausted, but without the great party stories to support it.

Staying at this problematic dump caused me to be like a zombie while working the trade show.  No joke, I was just dead.  Again, I did not party while here.  I just got little to no sleep due to the noise factor.  And the walls were so thin our coworker could not sleep due to partiers in the next room.  At the trade show, the man in the booth next to us could literally hear people having sex in the room next to him........  paper thin walls.

What has happened to the old Vegas?  I used to live here and the ""class"" is gone.  Bully's is a pig-sty.  It is old and dingy in the casino area and SMOKEY.

Again, Jose put us at the furthest end of a VERY long-hall-vortex when we changed rooms.  We were literally ON Las Vegas Blvd, so ALL night we got to hear the music show at the Bellagio which accompanies the outdoor water show, water that is propelled by massive horse power that sounds like machine guns.  NO SLEEP.  Thanks Jose?

Jose HAD to know he was moving us to a loud loud room (prior complaints...).  When we called to complain they were going to move us AGAIN, but by the third day of the convention we were just too busy and worn out (lack of sleep) to take the 2 hours to pack up, wait for the bellman, and go to another room and unpack for the THIRD time.

And with the luck we had, we did not trust that the third room would be any better.  Our co-worker had a mattress in his room that was so worn he literally rolled to the side of his bed.  And his room had NO coffee maker and plenty of questionable stains.

The place is a disgrace.  We did encounter a few REALLY great employees.  Charles, the black bellman who has been there almost 30-years, was a delight.  Von, at front desk, who said she had been there for 15 or so years was also a delight.  The rest was just crap.

The security guards were as fat as cows (gee, what were they guarding, the buffet?)   We checked out five other casinos and Bally's was the ONLY casino that wreaked of THICK smoke.  SINUSES...  bad bad bad.

As other reviewers wrote, the casino is TINY.  ALL slots, and mostly penny slots, and nickel or quarters.  WOW.  ONLY TWO crap tables, TWO roulette tables, the poker room was DEAD, and there was only a small circle of blackjack tables.  Slot machine city...

There were also no good restaurants or shops.  None.  Our co-worker had breakfast in the restaurant and said it was BAD.  How does one screw up eggs?  Anyway, I could go on, but I wanted to make a point to write this review and warn others.

If you stay here and have a good experience, you either have ZERO expectations in life, ZERO taste, or you got REAL FREAKING LUCKY.  Again, the LOUD CONSTRUCTION UNDER THE WINDOWS IN THE WEE HOURS (6 a.m.) IS JUST PLAIN CRUEL.  WE CAME HERE FOR WORK, AND IT REALLY WAS HARD TO DO SALES AT THE SHOW WITH ALMOST NO SLEEP...........

I left out a lot as I ran out of room.  Awful experience.  ZERO stars.",8,9,3

So my review is on the Penthouse only which by the way was amazing. There are 6 Penthouses on the 26th floor. We had the opportunity view 2 of them. One being the biggest one which was all carpet and the other which is all white and marble floors. We knew we wanted the all white one in case of spilled drinks and plus for dancing. It was huge and we fit 35ppl with no problem for our Reception! Had a sound system with speakers in the ceiling. Small refrigerator, microwave, bar counter with 4 stools, glass dining table that seats 8, 3 couches & 2 chairs n the living room. There were 2 bedrooms and a bathroom in each bedroom, as well as a half bathroom in the hallway when you walk into the Penthouse for guests to use during a party.  Beautiful windows in the living room area with a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountain show. 

For those using this for Reception purposes, it was perfect. We had catered finger foods from Bally's room service such as beef wellingtons, chicken skewers, shrimp, etc. The food was delivered in large food tins with warmers underneath. Croissant sandwiches, salads, & fruits in large trays. All plates and silverware supplied. The cake was 2 tier and was way more than enough. Served 35 ppl and still had half the bottom tier left.

Ballys has a perfect location for it's price. That's what always gets me coming back here. Good sized casino, shops and restaurants. It's connected to Paris so you get both hotels to choose from.

In my opinion it's one of the subpar budget hotels but probably the best out of all of them.",10,2,3

Parking: shared parking with Paris hotel, so it was a long walk from the structure to head over to the lobby and to our room. Parking is $10 a day. Make sure when you check in to have them add the parking to your room. It allows you in and out privileges in all the Cesar resorts, without having to pay any more then $10.  

Check in: It was Wednesday night around 6pm. There was three lines; one for diamond members, one for keys and mail and the other one was for regular check ins. We were in the line for the normal check in, but it was unfortunate that they only two front desk agents checking everyone in. There were about 20 people in line and it could have been faster. At one point, the second person walked away and we were only left with one person. The other two lines each had to people checking them in. That was unfortunate. 

Room: We stayed at the Indigo Tower Suite. I liked the huge spa bathtub. There was a stand up shower, which had a glass door, which i thought was a little odd since there was no door for privacy. The room was a pretty good size, we didn't have a view though. Everything was pretty clean, although it seemed a little outdated. I wish I would have stayed at the newer Jubilee tower. One concern I had was that we had left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door as we left for the day, and when we returned at the end of the night, I noticed they had made our bed and cleaned up a bit. A little lack of privacy, but nice gesture I guess. 

For the cheap price, i would stay again. I liked that it is located fairly close to everything, since it is about right in the middle of everything on the strip. 4 out of 5.",12,1,1

Don't get me wrong - that's obviously the ideal outcome, but it's also about the entertainment.  After all, it's not like the odds are in the player's favor (hellooooo, Hunger Games).  Otherwise, why would casinos even offer the game?  That being said though, I never thought the casinos would screw us out of both our money AND our fun...

Now, while neither of us consider ourselves to be heavy gamblers, my friend and I are more than familiar with the basics of Craps.  Since the table had been really cold, we opted to play the ""dark side"" (Don't Pass\/Don't Come) the entire time, which meant we were betting that the shooters would roll a ""7"" before rolling whatever the point was set at.  Initially, things were pretty uneventful - lots of people crapping out early, no hot streaks.

On this particular turn though, the shooter (who was on the opposite end of us) threw a ""6\/4"" on his opening roll that literally landed right in front of us.  This set the point at ""10"", which the dealer on our end of the table confirmed verbally, as well as with the placement of the marker on the table.  Given that a roll of ""7"" was twice as likely to come out as another ""10"", both of us placed odds on our initial $10 Don't Pass bets with an additional $50.

The next roll was a ""6"" and the one after that was a ""9"", which shouldn't have affected us at all.  However, the stick man called it a front line winner, meaning that it matched what he had as the point - ""9"" instead of ""10"" (ditto for the dealer on the other end of the table).  Our dealer had a confused reaction, but proceeded to collect our bets.  Seeing that, we immediately protested and asked for clarification\/review.   The stick man then brought over the pit boss, who then called up to the eye in the sky (aka the people monitoring the security cameras).

While they were checking, we were confident we were right.  We individually saw the first roll as a ""10"", our dealer had called it a ""10"" at the time, she knew we had been putting odds only on rolls of ""4"" or ""10"", the bet\/odds we placed were based on a roll of ""10"" (if it had been ""9"", our bet would've been $45 instead of $50), the third player at the table said he was positive it was a ""10"", and the final player\/shooter (after initially not saying anything) said he thought it was a ""10"" as well.

So, it makes perfect sense that the call came down as a ""9"".  And given that the eye in the sky has the final say, we were shit out of luck.

Now, I'm not saying we were lied to (read: cheated), but it seems awfully weird that so many of us apparently saw the dice wrong.  It also seemed convenient that ruling it as a ""9"" meant the casino won money (our bets were more than enough to cover any payouts), as opposed to calling it a ""10"", which would've resulted in no action either way.  Is there a chance the rest of us were wrong?  Of course!  Just like how there's a non-zero chance Jennifer Lawrence (hellooooo, Hunger Games) will read this and want to meet up for brunch next Saturday (which is open on my calendar, by the way...).

Too bad neither are very likely...",11,9,11

I like how they redid their front entrance with a modern street market. The entrance and parking is located on the side of the hotel, facing Cromwell. We were a little disappointed when we arrived at 1PM on a Saturday that the Valet was already full. But the self-park lot was easy to navigate and had plenty of spaces. The casino is relatively small, but it's clean, and I definitely don't mind playing at $10 tables. The line at reception was huge when we arrived. So we grabbed some food, came back in an hour, and voila, the line was completely gone. It took us literally 2 minutes to check-in and we somehow got upgraded to high floor room with a view of the strip. Sweet! We came on a busy weekend, but the cab line was very short, another bonus!

The casino area is crowded but they usually have someone on stage performing and you get to really experience the excitement of the casino atmosphere. Check in can be a nightmare, so slow at times but if you are VIP, they have a checkout\/in for that. 

The rooms are pretty quiet, we stayed in the North Tower for three days if that helps. Prices for rooms seemed reasonable. Although the rooms were free, I can confirm that the LV sandwich trick does work here. Shhh, don't tell them I sent you! Eat a Gordon Ramsey Burger in Paris downstairs!",3,0,0

I gamble 90% of the time at Total Rewards props, stay at Total Rewards props, and even have their credit card. That being said, I usually know what to expect at their Vegas hotel rooms.

It was not my idea to stay in a Jubilee room however my mom (64) wanted to stay in a newer room(still several years old) although I could have stayed a few comped nights in their North tower rooms. Anyways, $528 later (5 nights including Friday and after fees) I think she regretted it. Checking in was simple. Asked for a ""high room"" and was given room 5625....overlooking somewhat the Paris pool i.e. a lower floor. The young lady who assisted me said they were ""booked""....Ballys must be a huge draw on a Monday in June (sarcasm to the 10th power).

Nonetheless, got to our room and were graciously greeted by a huge wet white stain on the carpet 5 feet from the door. It didn't look like what I was orig thinking (wild guess) but it was the size of a child's  hand. No clue what it was. Ok, whatever. Next, turned on the bathroom light, and there were two plastic razor blade covers in the middle of the bathroom floor. No, not in a corner or under the sink but literally right in the middle of the floor. Put Helen Keller in a maids outfit and even she could have spotted them. No excuse for that. Ok whatever. But what's this...my wifi wont connect to my iPhone....but what about that absurd resort fee Im paying daily? So down to the desk I go. Im cool with it, totally laid back and so if Miguel who helped me. Told me he would send someone up immediately to clean the stain (wasn't gone until next afternoon) and also as a courtesy refund a resort fee of $32+. I checked my account today and it was refunded as stated. Wifi the next 4 days was spotty although the casino wifi was usually good. 

And then finally, I come back from the casino the second day checked in and my mom says...""the toilet bubbles."" Wait, what? Are you drunk mom? ""No, the toilet bubbled when I was on it."" What do you mean bubbled? ""It literally bubbled."" Low and behold the toilet did bubble several times over a 4 day period to the point that one night we left the toilet seat open and the next morning there was water all over the ground....cool Ballys.

Im returning in 4 weeks but this time with my girlfriend. Booked the North Tower and already know its dated and what to expect but its basically free MINUS MY $32 WIFI!

First of all, don't expect to be ordering room service once here. The room service is open 6am-1pm. ONE IN THE AFTERNOON! I got here at a later time starving and tired, and I was basically forced to go downstairs to simply get food. Almost everything is overpriced on their menu as well. If 4 guests are eating, you gotta pay an EXTRA $5. If more than 4 guests are eating, it's an addition of $2 per person. Seriously. Once I got to the point of ordering room service the lady claimed some items weren't available until 11am, when clearly on the menu it states 6am. There were other people around me and the lady on the phone for room service was RUDE! She got all grumpy just because there were people talking in the background. 

Secondly, they practically make you pay for everything. The internet is $13.99 per device for 24 hours a day. For people who don't own a hotel room here, it's $9.99 for 2 hours. What a rip off. To work out at the gym, it's $20. Just to exercise. *sigh*

Now to the actual rooms. The rooms itself are pretty gigantic. But, if you take a closer look at things it's EXTREMELY unsanitary\/not cleaned. I found half eaten chocolate strawberries as well as a bag of pie in the fridge. It seemed like they were there for quite a long time... Random areas on the carpet were wet when I walked on it, which was a little awkward especially not knowing what it was. The furniture was covered in hair (not mine) and had stains throughout the sofas.  I sat on one of the chairs and there was crumbs of something on it. Ew! Also, this isn't really a big deal but the bathroom toilet paper and the trash cans weren't even changed on arrival. Ehh..

This IS my first time experiencing Bally's and I'm pretty sure it'll be my last. One star for this. I definitely would recommend any of the hotels around this such as Bellagio though.",1,0,0

I gave this place a shot just because I've never been to this place before and also with the groupon deal you get $30.00 on food even for room service, and two Jubilee tickets. 

First thing was the valet service, I had too many bags to carry up so I really needed valet at the time. The guy was nice and friendly and that was good...As I came into check in I noticed the distance from valet to check in was super close and that was awesome...I had walked a lot previously at the outlets soo I was pretty tired already and waking up at 5:00 AM and driving from LA to Vegas was killer!

Check in took really long just because a few people for some reason were semi arguing with the front desk assistants. As soon as I was the first one coming up I got my ID and my credit card so they could look it up as fast as possible. The lady at the check out counter was super nice and she also upgraded our rooms just because and I thought that was pretty sweet ! 

Rooms were nice I would have to say they were pretty big and everything inside was quite new. Our bed was big with comfortable pillows and nice sheets. I have no complaints about the stay really..only about the $30.00 voucher for food. As we went to try a place out in the lobby area we waited for about 45 minutes and our server still was no where to be found...I had a last straw when she decided to take an order to these people that just barely sat down...Ughhh Nooo....Talked to the manager and just decided not to eat at Ballys ever in my life...EVER!

We (our team) decided this would be the best bet as it was closer to the actual convention in Paris, than staying at Paris itself. Boy was that a mistake. 

Pros: 
The people there are nice, and friendly.
The floor is very easy to navigate.
The prices are very reasonable (there's a reason for that.. read on!)

Cons:
Room came with a hot tub. That was what I was looking for, and would have been great if the jets actually worked. 

The chair in the room actually had something growing on it. Seriously, some green fungus was growing on it. 

The cover on the bed had a 'brown' stain on it that I didn't notice the first night. I can't even begin to explain how long I was in the shower after I found out. After that I slept on the couch for the remaining nights which was surprisingly quite comfortable. 

Room service.. What hotel in Las Vegas has room service only from 6 AM - 1 PM? Not 1 AM, 1 PM as in right after noon. On top of it, they won't allow delivery to the rooms from outside businesses. I was so backed up on work I just decided not to eat that entire day. 

The rooms are seriously dated.

The lights for the elevator (to tell you which one is going up\/down) are burned out on most floors\/elevators.

I then asked why they let me stay or gave me a room without having full payment and they said it happens. It happens!!! So as not to miss my flight I paid the 20 bucks and they lost a long time customer. Well done Ballys.",2,0,0

Each is good in its own way, each has its drawbacks (the working girls at Rio come to mind).  The past two annual visits have been here at Bally's for several reasons.

First, it's centrally-located on The Strip.  One is within walking distance of Caesar's Palace, Harrah's, Flamingo, Imperial Palace, Bellagio and Planet Hollywood.  If you're tanking at the tables in one place, it's easy to try another.

Second, Bally's is co-located with Paris, meaning you can walk from one to the other without braving the gauntlet of XXX-rated handbill passers outside.  This doubles the number of restaurants and shows available under one roof.

Finally, I cannot say enough about joining the rewards program no matter where you stay.  You can get free stuff for playing the games you enjoy.  A little play will get you a discount at the buffet.  A little more will get you a break on the room.  A lot of play will get you comp rooms.   For couples, have two rewards cards in the same name.  It doubles up the comps.

Back to Bally's.  The rooms are clean and spacious.  There are enough restaurants to satisfy a variety of tastes.  Cocktails are readily available at a host of bars.

Their service is impeccable.  Example: I forgot to check-in for my flight before the Business Center closed.  Nice young ladies at the front desk went out of their way to help me do this and get a printed boarding pass prior to checking out the next morning.  This was at no cost to me and they would not accept a gratuity.  Kudos!  I got a comment card and sang their praises to the management.

I'll be back next May.",4,0,0

This is an ideal center Strip hotel if you plan on checking out all the local hotels, casinos, restaurants, and shows. No need for a cab. However, they do have a free shuttle that will taxi you to Rio. With location in mind, it is definitely not one of the newer, luxury hotels. It isn't even modernized with upgrades to this centuries decor or amenities. It is a very plain hotel. BUT!, it is always well maintained and pretty clean for the most part. 

Hotel registration and check-in has always been painless for us. Maybe 15 minute max wait whenever we stay here. Keep in mind, that when everyone decides to check-in all at once, it's going to take a while. Play the numbers right, and don't check in when it's too busy! Go grab a bite. We always plan ahead, always have your ID, credit card ready, and be nice to the front desk clerk! You may even get a nice upgrade. We usually do.

The pool and the atmosphere is also a nice amenity for us. It is a very basic pool  and deck. Mostly sun, some shade. The scene is never obnoxious and usually more mature. A plus for us. Service is usually pretty good. The only negative I must note is that the lounges probably should be replaced or repaired. I'd say about 10% of them had a strap or two busted off or were very worn. The attendants were passive with not checking for room cards and even outside food and drink that so many patrons bring in. I assume they are aware of this practice and really don't enforce the ""rule"" since the crowd is pretty tame. Another plus for us. Usually a bucket of beers on ice (five, one pint aluminum brews) will throw you back $35.

As I mentioned, we usually have an upgrade to a North Tower Suite. Just like the hotel lobby and grounds, the rooms are also pretty basic, lacking amenities other luxury hotels boast. Not a big deal for us. As long as we have a nice bed and shower for a few nights. Not going to huff over an iPod dock and roman shades with a remote. When we want those things we will stay and pay somewhere else. 

We always enjoy the walkway from Bally's to Paris. Always air conditioned and scenic! Save the heat and traffic from the walk outside for the night time. Always a good crowd outside Bally's on the boulevard during the night. 

Really a good hotel for your buck! Please continue to be nice to us Bally's and please be nice to Bally's!",3,0,1

Thieves....
Complacent....

These are the three words I have to describe the employees of this hotel. 

Frankly let's start with the hotel. You can see the cigarette smoke floating in the air. They spent millions building the jubilee tower, but they should have spent some money on the ventilation system.

The internet isn't working. We kept having to call the Computer services to reconnect our computers to the internet in our room. The tower was having trouble.. The kicker was they still wanted us to pay the 24.00 resort fee. We made an argument out of it and the manager removed the fee from our bill. But since when does a manager have to do that? That should be something automatic. This happened to me at Mandalay Bay a few years ago, they didn't just remove the fee, they gave me a 20$ discount on the room. I didn't even have to ask. 

The final kicker is they stole a stuffed animal I had owned for 30 years. It was on the bed. As per the housekeeper, it got wrapped in the linen. I got in touch with the linen handlers. They didn't have it. As a matter of fact I talked to everyone who would have come into contact with my property and no one had seen it. It isn't small either. It is about a foot and a half high. Half the size of a pillow. From housekeeping to linen to truck to cleaners...that is the order. 

Whenever I try to talk to anyone, they try to blow me off. Frankly it is somewhere, inanimate objects don't just walk off by themselves. No one cares, no one wants to take any responsibility in helping to find it.  Frankly, they could steal anything and the answer is ""Talk to Risk Management."" That's all they can say for it.  I think the employees are so used to suboptimal quality they accept it. No one wants to have any accountability because they all know how awful the hotel has become. It's sad. 

Don't stay here. It's only going to get worse. Mind you, I wasn't in Vegas for a funtime, I was working. At least if the employees\/managers\/security\/housekeeping helped me look, actually attempted to care, it would make what happened less awful. But they don't. So it doesn't.",2,3,0

Took us 1 hour to check in.  Line out the wazoo.  Two people working the front desk, yes two.  One additional working the diamond princess window.

Asked for a view of the Strip.  Maybe I needed to specify, not the strip of crummy parking l
lots to the east of the Strip, which is what we got.

Last time we were there 2 years ago, shabbiness prevailed and everyone said they were right in the middle of a renovation.  Must have not been to my side of the hotel yet then and now.  

We were there for a week, this past July, with hubby and the kids.  

4 of the up\/down elevator indicators were broken on lobby floor and the 21st floor where we stayed.  

Even though there was a sign that indicated that this was a non smoking floor, the many, many burn marks in the carpet, and cigarette smoke that wafted into our room, indicated that was obviously not the case.

Shabby carpets throughout the hotel, some patched with luxurious gray duct tape.  

Rooms show their wear. Especially in the corners and the wet feeling carpet.

Housekeeping missed our rooms a couple of times when we left late, but we told the maid down the hall our room numbers and I called housekeeping to let them know.  They missed out on the tips.

The biggest rip off and the biggest F\/U to customers, and potential customers, is the fact that they charge a $28.00 resort fee, per day for internet service.  wtf?  

Who was the dumbass that failed marketing, 101 that came up with that idea?.
Probably the same one that said you can't get a glass of water for free by the pool unless you buy something.  Yes, let's chase our customers away.

So, I'm not paying a fricken ""resort"" fee for internet service.  
So we did what I'm sure thousands of others do, we go into town and find a nice Starbucks and spend a few bucks and a couple of hours doing my online thing.  What?  Not paying the $9.00 frappaccino at Bally's?  Nope, spending my money at Starbucks, buddy.  

Pool was deemed good by kids.  Though I hate what seems like the 100 yard hike through underground parking \/psuedo mall.  Some aware lifeguards, some really lazy.
Enough shade for me.  Not as loud as it was last time we were there.  Gets rowdy in the afternoon.

We find the self parking to be fine.  
We eat out every night somewhere in the burbs or sometimes we bring in, Robertos, Pizza Hut, but always eat at BFG's .
  
Found the treasure of Tuscany's cafe.  Try it.

Somehow we managed to squeeze 8 of us into a standard room registered for 2 (maybe 3 cus we got a rollaway bed). The room was plenty big compared to many other casino's standard rooms. I think it was 500 square feet, maybe a little bigger. 
  The room was clean, bed was clean n'comfy enough, bathroom was quite large, marble flooring, and most importantly...the shower had a constant temperature and pressure. Unlike some hotels that SUCK (i.e. Tropicana). The pricing for Ballys is also very good, and dirt cheap given we snuck everyone in the room. I think those of us who stayed 2 nights paid $70 each.  
  The casino itself is pretty small, clean, but lacking that fun atmosphere that many other Vegas Casinos have. But alas..Paris is right next door and connected without having to go outside...(it was 110 outside when I was there...I may be from Guam..but DAMN that's hot).  The location of Ballys is one of the best on the strip without having to pay huge $$$ and not staying in a sh*thole that is Imperial Palace. 
 Anyway 4 stars for overall value for Bally's. It's not the best, it's not horrible...the pool is large, but boring...no waterfall or slide..but if you just want to layout and get drunk...that works. Oh and the monorail has a stop at Ballys...Ballys is definitely a convenient place to stay.

We were told by some friends about hotels and decided to do Bally's because of the location.  We figured we wouldn't be in the room too much (day hikes, Hoover Dam, Grand Canyon, etc.).  I also knew we weren't booking the Bellagio so the ""updated"" (aka - we threw some paint and new wallpaper and changed the TV's and bedding) rooms were expected.  After the long drive we were starving so we dropped our stuff in our room and headed out to eat and do a quick check to see what was around and get our bearings for the next few days.  As I mentioned earlier, I knew we weren't staying at the Bellagio, but I was also expecting something a little more ""we actually care.""  The check in process was a bit confusing as to what to do with our car if we weren't doing Valet.  We followed the signs around to check in and there are multiple rows of Valet and a thru lane.  So I dropped my husband off and was promptly screamed at by a worker.  I told him I was happy to move but my husband was checking in and needed to know where to go.  He didn't give two craps and mumbled something and then yelled that I was blocking traffic.  So around the lot I went again.  Decided to just pull into Valet and pay the 18.00 fee (I'm pretty sure this is their way of forcing Valet vs the 10.00 self park).  Annoying, but I've dealt with worse.  What was unacceptable was the used soap from the previous occupant still in the shower.  As well as some trash left in the bathroom.  Not just a small piece, nope, the trash can still had trash.  We called the front desk and the woman apologized and said, ""I will make sure your room gets cleaned tomorrow.""  Yep, tomorrow.  She said she understood why I was unhappy (I was very calm when speaking to her as I know it isn't her fault the room was not cleaned properly), but expected something a little better than I will make sure your room is cleaned tomorrow.  I didn't sleep well last night because I couldn't be 100% sure I was sleeping on a clean bed or that our room was actually clean.

We had to wait in line to get our new room keys go up one tower get our bags and go down again and go up in a different tower to our next room. With no bell help offered. This room was 90 degrees when we got in and they would not change our room until engineering checked it out.

Why can't hotels just own it,  include the fees and say that they're going to be charging $129 and night plus tax? It insults our intelligence.

And they don't top up the shower gel\/shampoo. 

I've heard that a few people got stuck inside the elevator for two hours around dinner time and fortunately Mr.Q and I went for an early dinner that night.

Service:
Upon arrival, I experienced the most unprofessional front desk clerk in Las Vegas.  I booked 4 rooms for the entire group and logically, we all wanted to check-in together.  But, when we walked up to the front desk, the clerk refused to check-in all of the rooms and ask some people to go back in line.  Furthermore, she informed us that we had to pay extra if we wanted all 4 rooms to be on the same floor.  What the heck?  Never heard of that before. 

When the next clerk helped us check-in the second room, she just offered to put us on the same floor, with no EXTRA charge.  So I don't know what the first person was doing, probably going pocket the ""extra charges.""

Cleanliness:
The room is standard, a bit old.  But the problem I have is how dirty it was.  First, there seemed to appear to be coffee crumbs on the bed.  Weird.  Second, the bathroom was not wiped down.  I could see a lot of dust on where they put the towels.  

Overall:
This hotel is too old for the strip.  Everything seems to be falling apart.  Even the elevator light doesn't work.  

Tips:
Only book this hotel if you want to same some money.  If not, there are many other options in Las Vegas.",2,0,0

As I write this I have a headache from the stench of cigarette smoke in my room. It smells like an ash tray. The staff has been nice, but the hotel is not up to par with any of the other hotels on the strip.

- The room phones had a loud buzzing on them. It made it difficult to use the concierge \/ order room service.

- The concierge didn't know there was a ski shuttle in town (I found a $20 shuttle to Mt. Charleston online. The concierge said there's no shuttle and I should take a $200 cab ride!)

- The bed is hard as a rock, and the pillows were too gushy. Imagine sleeping on plywood with a folded up towel for a pillow.

- The ""updated"" room featured a large brown stain on the ceiling.

When the conference ended Friday, I called the bellhop to get my bags. I stayed the rest of the weekend at Encore.

Oh yeah, it took two calls and two hours for the bellhop to get to the room.

With so many choices in Las Vegas, this hotel shouldn't be one of them.",2,4,1

We asked for a late check-in since we were coming from afar and traveling very late at night. So when we went to the concierge, we were told that we got upgraded to a ""suite."" 

We originally booked a queen size Indigo room but upon arrival, we got jipped. Instead of the Indigo room as we have originally reserved AND personally spoken to the concierge to confirm our reservation and late-check in, we got a Murphy Parlor room instead. We got a room that DID look like a suite (had small living area, sofa, table, non-working fridge, TV) but the bed was a pull-out bed from the wall (aka Murphy bed) and it wasn't even that comfortable. Furthermore, the feather pillows they had were so dented that it barely had any head\/neck support. I might as well sleep on the bed without a pillow. 

The AC wasn't properly working during the peak afternoon warm hours of the day. At night, it was cool because of course, the weather gets cooler as it gets later at night. What even made me very unsatisfied was the fact that the hot water would only work at various times of the day. We had called concierge to request a different room but they only told us that all Indigo rooms (we wanted the room we had originally RSVPd) are booked. Then we mentioned the AC and they said a technician would come. Hours later, no one came. I called again and they said someone would come up -- not sure if they ever came up because we were out for the day and came back at night, when it was cooler.

Overall, I was not satisfied with my stay here although I had a fun weekend in Vegas. Understandably, if you were booking for a decent\/cheap room in Vegas, these would be probably what you expect. So book a room here at your own risk.

Despite these setbacks, Bally's is right next to Paris and is connected (so you don't need to walk outside in the heat) and there is a shared parking structure. I usually give places the benefit of the doubt, but when you RSVP a room, get a confirmation over the phone regarding a late check-in, you should get the room that you spent money on.",6,4,4

Stayed here for a bachelorette party June 26-29th 2013. After spending the day at the pool, we came back to our room  to find raw sewage, yes, SEWAGE filling the sink and spilling onto the floor. Ruined all of our makeup, hair supplies, you name it. Obviously this situation was out of our hands so we called the hotel front desk immediately. We were on the phone for about 30 minutes and never got to talk to a manager. A half hour later, they sent up a security guard and a cleaning crew. 

Even though we were upset, we tried our best to be friendly to the security guard and cleaning crew.. what a terrible job to have! One of them said ""This happens all the time""..... WHAT? Raw sewage spills into rooms all the time?

We had to claim every single item that was ruined.... meaning that we had to empty our sewage soaked makeup bags onto a towel and touch every single piece.. writing down its brand, description and cost. If we didn't, we woulnd't get any money for our ruined products. Poop EVERYWHERE. OH, I forgot to mention that it was my friends Bachelorette party and that was the night we had planned to go out. How were we going to get ready? We thought the hotel might be a little bit sympathetic to our situation and asked if we could get our makeup\/hair done for the evening....not a chance!! After arguing with people over our situation we decided to call it quits and ask for some toothbrushes.... they agreed and never sent them up!! We ended up having to buy them and get reimbursed. What a joke!!!! 

They moved us to a different room about 2 hours later. When we checked out, we realized that our room wasn't comped!!!! Not even for that last night!

2 months later and we are finally hearing from claims about crediting us for our ruined makeup. We are only getting half of what we claimed!!

The view wasn't bad but from my particular room (in the 600s), it wasn't spectacular. It looked best at night when the strip was lit up. 

The rooms: They come with two beds, a desk, a small table and a lounge chair. There is a closet right at entry across from the bathroom, and an entertainment stand with a decent sized television. There isn't an AC unit in the room, and it can get cold at times. The blinds are a bit dull, but nonetheless they do their job well. I didn't have many complaints about the cleanliness of the room. My bed was fresh and they kept the bathroom in good shape. There isn't a mini fridge or microwave so I wouldn't recommend bringing any food you don't plan on immediately consuming into the room. 

The bathroom: Very spacious. The sink is of a decent size and there is plenty of counter space. The shower is also spacious and has a towel rack and storage in it. Hand rails run the length of the wall and underneath the towel rack. There is a full length mirror on the wall across from the door, but can make using the toilet a bit weird due to placement.

In general: Of course, slot machines are everywhere. It's Vegas. Once you enter you're surrounded by slot machines and a few stores. The food court has pretty decent selection, options including American, Asian and Italian. A more upscale restaurant is located inside as well. We weren't able to access the pool, as it was closed at the time. I'm not certain if cigarette smoking is actually allowed in the casino area, but it definitely wasn't discouraged. 

If you want a more reasonably priced hotel for your trip, I suggest looking into this one. It was a comfortable stay, the staff was friendly and things were always lively in the lobby. Access to the strip is quick and easy as well which makes things even more convenient. Caesars Palace is right within walking distance, for those that love a good mall trip.",1,0,0

It's not very expensive, and mostly because of it's fabulous location!  It is right in the heart of the Las Vegas strip.  With the Bellagio right across the way, Caesar Palace diagonal, The Venetian next door, and the Wynn only a block or so away, it is an awesome location!  

The rooms are standard, nothing to really rage about.  You get what you pay for.  However, just my luck that the times I have been there, I'm been upgraded...not once, not twice, but three times!  Yep, that's right.  I found myself in the Celebrity Suite, which can mean different things, depending on what tower you stay in.  And yes, the North Tower is newer.  I have stayed in both towers and been in the Celebrity Suites in both towers too.  The South tower had a larger room, but the North Tower had newer furniture.  You can't help but love it when you find yourself with a king size bed, a hot tub, a steam room, and a separate living room\/dining room\/wet bar.  I even found a gym in one of my rooms!  Yes - a gym!  

Although the last time I didn't get the Celebrity Suite, I still found a bidet in my room.  I mean, the last time I saw a bidet was in France!  Fancy that! 

The view from my rooms have ranged from the water show at the Bellagio to the Barbary Coast hotel on the other side. It just all depends on what you really want.

And no, I am so not a gambler!  It's just my luck that the front desk wanted to upgrade me!  So, I think the front desk staff is fabulous in my book!  Be extra nice to them, and don't forget to tip when they do help you out!  After all, they are doing YOU a favor.  

Side note: If you're flying in, you can actually check in and get your hotel key at the airport.  They have a section by the baggage claim for you to skip the lines at the hotel and get your keys there.  This can save you tons of time so you can hop on up to your room and get ready to party quicker.  (Then again, the chances of getting upgraded at the airport are less likely in my opinion.  I've always been upgraded when checking in at the actual hotel.)

Big events in someones lives but do you think Ballys cared, NO!! Being in that downgraded room really sat me back two days with my wedding arrangements. I did end up getting my room, which was pretty lackluster. It was really in need of some upgrading. The bed was hard and the shower pressure was low. Also, while there we decided to try our luck at the slots. While playing slots a waitress came to me and asked if I wanted a drink, I said yes. I never got my drink and this happened to me twice.

In full disclosure, I stayed here completely free due to a hotel offer. I really can't complain too much about the place considering I didn't pay them for any of their services. That said, this is Yelp... The only place in the world where someone can complain about something free not being good enough. So here goes.

The rooms are okay in the jubilee tower. Peeling wallpaper notwithstanding, I can't complain too much about the room, though I was secretly sad inside that I didn't get an upgrade at check-in.

Speaking of check-in, the diamond check-in line was closed when I arrived, so I had to wait in the Platinum line. I guess keeping a higher status is only beneficial during banking hours.

Now let me tell you a little story about being almost 30 and not looking like it. I got ID'd SIXTEEN TIMES (No exaggeration in the least) on the casino floor in ONE day. I mean, I get it. Gaming laws are pretty strict. Kids probably try to gamble all the time. But it really cuts me to have to pull out a card, hand it to a person, then hear ""Wooow, you look so young!"" Sixteen. Times. in. One. Day. I kept swearing I'd tell the next person to say that to me ""Wow! You look so old!"" One particular cocktail waitress was probably so sure she'd caught an underage gambler at a video poker machine that she walked up to me with a rude, angry-mother tone and literally yelled ""I need to see your ID right now!"" at me. She actually forced me to stop playing my machine while she looked my ID over and scrutinized it. Then when she realized she was wrong, she threw my ID on the machine and walked off without even taking my drink order.

The next day the air conditioning died on the casino floor for about 8 hours. It wasn't a pretty sight or smell out there.

The pit bosses were pretty nice, but not a single one of them rated my play properly. I earned like 50 reward points after 4 days of decent play.

As a nice added novelty, they have a keno parlor with nice keno attendants (I know it's stupid to play, but I still love it). The best part is they always remembered me, so they didn't check my ID over and over. And as luck would have it, I actually won about $250 at it!

In-all, it's not the best place on the strip by a long shot. But if you're looking for a place with less excitement\/noise\/action on the floor, it's a decent choice.

Also, the hotel charges for Wifi. Even family-owned bed & breakfasts in the middle of nowhere in Italy don't charge their guests for Wifi. Seriously.",4,3,0

-$13 All-You-Can-Eat breakfast at the cafe. Long line, though. Very cheap compared to others.
-$2 margaritas, tequila shots, and burritos during happy hour, right next door to the cafe. Great for those on a budget.

I've stayed here, twice, and both times gave me a wonderful experience. I'm not picky when it comes to appearances, but if that's your thing then you might be a bit disappointed; a few vomit stains, cracks in the paint, etc. Nothing new to a hotel that's been around for a while.

My friends and I checked in on a Thursday afternoon and the line was terrible. We waited for almost an hour, and despite the dozens of impatient, rude people, the staff did their best to remain open and helpful.

The smoke in the casino seemed heavier than the other hotels, even when you're just walking through. Very friendly staff working the tables, though. 

There's a smoothie stand called ""Evening Call"" downstairs in the casino, while on your way to Paris. $12 for a decently-sized cup that you can bring back and refill for $8. I loved it.

Or maybe it's an understated casino in the middle of the Strip. I like the fact that you can park in the Paris parking lot and walk to Ballys and its all indoors. That's cool that they're adjacent to one another. Another thing that's cool is that there is a Sbarro that's downstairs.

What Ballys doesn't have working for them is that its not a young people's resort. Not super hip bars nor super hip clubs. The pool's not that great either. It's a budget option for a room, then you'll probably hit PLanet Hollywood and Caesars if you want to go out. So it's good in that respects. Ballys is really old school. It's kinda like the Stardust or Riviera on the middle section of the strip.

If you want a cheap or even comped place to play. Get a Harrahs card, play it, get your points and one of the best places to get a comped room is Ballys. It's right there on the strip. Even though it's been passed in features by other resorts close to it, Ballys is still a good bargain.",0,0,0

I stayed in the older tower the first night and was pretty miserable, it felt like sleeping on a rock with springs.  The room was very outdated, but large.  I switched to the Jubilee tower the second and third nights, and while the bed still wasn't as comfortable as I'd preferred, I was able to sleep and for a hotel bed I'd probably give it 4.5 stars.  The room was pretty awesome looking, very modern.  Certainly worth the extra $30 a night.
Do be warned, you will be charged an extra $23 or so a night for resort fees, which includes wifi access for two devices and gym access for two people.  I never was able to actually find the gym.
Also, in the older tower, my lungs were burning the whole time because it smelled of smoke so badly.
Overall this hotel is in a good location if you want to be on the strip, it's central to everything.  The new tower has very nice rooms.

11\/20-11\/23
We used the ""Preferred Perks"" promo code directly from Bally's website which gave us free early check-in and late check out if available as well, as a room upgrade but that last one was a lie -.-. 
Let's be honest that was needed. Since I live on the east coast...check in at 4pm from an early 6am flight was a no bueno. 
So with this, early check-in, free of charge which would normally be $40.00 I was elated. Since this is Vegas, I wanted to save money on the room. I want to spend what I saved shopping. When we arrived, at 11:30am since that's the time that early check in can be done..the line was pretty long. The customer service rep told us how in order to get a room upgrade we needed to pay $15 extra dollars per night. Now, I know what you are thinking that's only $50 dollars more....but it's not about money it's about the principle. In my eyes, that should be considered false advertisement. I didn't like the fact that the casino, which was smoke filled needed to be walked through just to get to your room. The ventilation here sucks on the lobby floor. If you don't believe me, walk through the Bellagio casino....nice clean air. Anywho,  I stayed in the Indigo Tower and it was very basic. Nothing fancy. No iron when I arrived. I had to request one. No biggie! I liked the free valet service. Please be sure to tip! 

Pros: Location ie: on The Strip and price...minus resort fees -.-
Cons: The haggling staff trying to sell you show tickets

The rooms are a little outdated but they were clean, which is the most important thing to me.

Cons: The check in line for your room reservation is way too long and they usually only have 3 employees helping at a time. (Self Check in is easier and faster) Another thing is, we put the do not disturb sign in front of our door since we were there for memorial day weekend and 2 times house keeping knocked and decided to open our door!???

The main things this hotel has going for it are the relatively decent rates and its location on The Strip. It's connected to Paris, which has some good restaurants and a more appealing casino than Bally's (a little newer and less depressed). Plus it's across the street from Caesars and The Bellagio. 

At checkin my husband asked if there were any upgrades available and we got a jacuzzi suite for the price of a king room, but that's where the benefit ended. The room we got was run down, had no view, the A\/C struggled to cool the room, the curtains were broken, one of the lamps was broken, the doors on the entertainment center were broken...

The casino itself was nicely appointed with all the popular table and slot games, although I feel like the air filtration system needed an upgrade, as it was very smokey no matter what time of day.  
The hotel had direct access to Paris and all that casino has to offer without going outside.

The room was clean but over priced and still occasionally smelled like smoke. We also had to call multiple times to have our bill corrected.

- Starbucks is located between North and South tower

CONS:

- Casino floor: compared to others (Cosmo, Aria!!) this casino is pretty rowdy and noisy. Not really a good impression for first timers that need to make their way through the floor to the lobby.
- Rooms: While the room size and bed comfort was okay, some rooms seem dated and the carpet smells like smoke although it's clearly a non-smoking room

Then Ms. Hagarty told us she's been with Bally's for 32 years! That speaks very highly of the management team to retain top talent for that long and have them still excited to welcome their guests. 

We definitely enjoyed our stay. I'd give it a 5 instead of a 4 except for only one reason - the facilities were just a bit overwhelmed by the size of the convention we were at and movement throughout the hotel and casino was a challenge. 

That crowding shouldn't take away from the fact that great people make a great business. If they retain and recruit great employees like Judy, and get better at ""crucial conversations"" with event planners, then I have no doubt the future will remain bright for Bally's.

You honestly cannot beat this location. It is in the middle of everything we wanted to see in Las Vegas, on our short 12 hour stay there while waiting for our flights home.

We walked in to the hotel, of course we were engulfed in Casino cigarette smoke, which unfortunately cannot be helped...but welcomed warmly by some hotel staff.
We were told where to check in and joined the other 180 people in line checking in.
Seriously, there were 3 people checking in guests, on a Saturday night. And there might as well have been only 2 by the snail pace the third guy was going. 1 guest for every 4 the other 2 had.
Look, I was not expecting superhuman super speed, but I was also not expecting to waste a full hour of our 12 hour-only stay, standing in this line.
About 30\/40minutes in, I left my bf in line to find us some water to drink.
I spent the typical $7 for a bottle and returned to him in line, we sipped our water and finally made it to the check out.
The counterperson was nice and funny, and he eased our growing tension with his happy personality.
We got our room key and turned just in time to see another hotel staff member handing out free bottled water to those standing in line. Dang it. 
20 minutes and $7 too late, Sir.

We began our long walk to our room. We had booked a king bed, and we found what we thought was our room but it was two queen beds. Nervous that we'd have to stand in the line again, my bf walked out of the room and discovered we were actually next door. (Our key opened the door to a room next door to ours) So yay, and yikes... I hope other keys wont open OUR room door.

Walking into our room any stress we had checking in completely vanished. This room was HUGE, beautiful, Clean and it smelled great. Non-smoking floor. Woohooo!
And it had an in-room hot tub, shower, separate bathrooms (one with a toilet and one with a bidet)

The view was nothing to get excited about, it was the side and top of parking garage, I believe. But I was so pleased with the room I couldn't have cared less for the lack of view.

So let's get the negatives out of the way first:

Issue 1: Finding the place. The biggest issue for us (and one that is completely outside the hotel's control) is that Bally's seems to be in the Twilight Zone as far as GPS is concerned. We came into Las Vegas from the south, and the problems began as soon as we exited the freeway. The GPS knew where the hotel was, but didn't seem to know anything about street names or where they were located. We were instructed to turn on streets with names completely different from what they were called on our Garmin, to turn on streets that simply didn't exist...it was totally insane. At one point we had both the Garmin GPS and Googlemaps on my phone going, and they each had different problems! At the end of a long day's drive, trying to navigate around the Strip, with all its traffic, with a constant parade of pedestrians in various stages of inebriation, and with two navigation devices that couldn't seem to navigate, we were totally exhausted by the time we finally managed to find our way into Bally's parking garage. So my first bit of advice to you is, if you plan on staying here, call the hotel for directions and use those rather than rely on your GPS!

Issue 2 (and this may be a deal-breaker for a lot of you): Smoke in the check-in area. If you've been to Las Vegas, you know that there's no way you can avoid walking through smoke-filled casinos, but most of the newer hotels have found ways to keep the smoke from leaking into the other public areas. Unfortunately, the check-in area at Bally's is every bit as smoky as the casino...possibly even more so, as there's no place for the smoke to dissipate. I smoked for 20 years, and am not normally bothered by cigarette smoke (in fact, normally I still rather like it) and it even got to me. If you have real breathing issues, and don't have someone else you can send to the front desk to take care of check-in, you might want to consider one of the newer properties on the Strip (or give Las Vegas a miss altogether).

OK...all that having been said, Bally's has a lot to recommend it. For one thing, to give credit where credit is due, despite the smoke, the check-in experience was about the best I've experienced in Las Vegas. We arrived at around 5:00 p.m., and there was quite a line, but things moved pretty quickly, and the woman who checked us in was both pleasant and efficient. I especially appreciated the fact that we were NOT given the usual Las Vegas lecture about how everything in the room is on a motion sensor and you'll be charged for anything that is moved. It was also really nice that the person who checked us in was able to give us very clear and accurate directions to our room in the Indigo tower (again, not always the case in Las Vegas!)

Our room was, in a word, amazing. Upon exploration, it was clear that is was actually the central common room of a multi-room suite (the doors to the other rooms were locked), but still...wow! It was HUGE! Quite possibly the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in. In addition to our queen-sized bed, we had a nice, big sitting area, a full-sized dining\/conference table, a big flat-screen TV, a small kitchen area with a sink, a microwave and a fridge (NOT a mini-bar, but a real fridge that we could use without worrying about being charged for moving a soda to make room for our milk), a full-sized closet, a vanity area, and a very nice bathroom. Great view, too!

The bed was actually a Murphy bed, but was very comfortable (and didn't squeak, as so many Murphy beds do!).

We were surprised (and pleased!) to learn that we were able to connect two devices to the internet without an extra charge, as part of the unavoidable Las Vegas ""resort fee"" (that isn't usually the case, and I've often grumbled about having to pay for internet on top of the resort fee). The internet connection was fast and frisky...no problems there!

I have to say that, navigation aside, the location is great...right on the Strip, with an easy walk to wherever you may want to go.

So, is Bally's the place for you? Well, it is clearly an ageing (but well-maintained) property. It can be a bit difficult to drive to, if you rely on GPS. And there is that very smoky check-in area. On the other hand, it's convenient and comfortable, and the friendly staff don't treat you as if they expect you to steal the art off the walls, which is a pleasant change from my other Vegas experiences. Issues aside, I'd stay again.",4,1,1

A: They all live out their miserable days on this earth at Bally's.


This might have been the worst hotel experience I have had since the blood-soaked carpet incident that time in San Diego, but I digress.

The service at Bally's is service in name only.  Nearly every employee I came in contact with at this establishment was very obviously waiting for death's sweet kiss.  God knows none of them were interested in doing their jobs.  Case in point?  The maid took my ice bucket on the third night of my stay.  I figured I would ask for it back when she came back on day four...except she never showed up.  I got annoyed waiting, and tweeted at Bally's (on the expensive, but lousy Wi-Fi ""service"") about this.  They responded with a promise to take things up with management on my behalf...some 18 hours later, and 20 minutes after I checked out. Way to go, @BallysVegas.

An ice bucket wouldn't have been a big deal had there been a fridge in the room...you know...as you would find in any Motel 6 in the United States, but no.  No fridge.  Even more inexcusable?  No coffee maker.  Bally's is as anti-coffee as they are anti-maid service.  This place had fewer amenities than the jail cell in which i once spent a night in Naugatuck, CT (the birthplace of Naugahyde, no less).  But this irritation only tells part of the story.

I was at Bally's for an academic conference, which included meals.  I use the word ""meals"" only in the loosest sense of the term, as what we were served was almost wholly inedible. So inedible was it that, when presented with a steak I asked for a vegetarian meal.  They took my steak, mashed potatoes, and vegetable clump away and returned with...you guessed it, the vegetable clump.  Apparently mashed potatoes do not count as vegetarian fare anymore.  Alas..I went out for chicken strips.  Of the 500 people at the conference, mine was without question the best dinner anyone got.

And the people at Bally's know they suck.  They absolutely know.  How do I know?  When I checked out, no one even thought about asking me if everything was ok with my stay.  They are apparently tired of hearing the answers to that question.

This place was dreadful.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  Seriously...anywhere else.",17,20,5

Cons: 
Hm where to start? 

The hotel in general is run down, the elevators were broken, the carpets stained, and very dimly lit. 

The staff is rude, and didn't tell me when they charged my credit card when I first arrived. Then after I complained they said it would go back on the card after I left or if it didn't to make my bank deal with it. 

The room itself was small and dusty. It had no microwave or mini fridge. The TV screen kept turning black randomly. All the outlets in the room were BROKEN and cracked or hanging off the wall. The shower water and sink water REAKED of bleach and chlorine. The carpet had large stains on it, and so did the bed sheets. We also had an outlet almost completely out of its socket hanging there behind our mini dresser between the beds COVERED in dust. 

So in total, the main reason we stayed here was the price. At the time we picked a cheaper hotel (but not that much cheaper!!) so we could spend more money around Vegas. But never again!

But when I got an e-mail offering cheap mid-week rooms in hot August Vegas, I knew we needed to get out of town.  A year ago, we had stayed at Bally's and upgraded to a jacuzzi suite for an extra $100 a night.  Those were the days.  So we booked a $59\/night room and headed out in the putt-putt Prius.

Now here's the trick that I learned from reading some other website.  When we got to the check-in counter I put a twenty right out on it in full view.  The sweet girl behind the counter decided to upgrade us to that same crazy suite -- this time with a view of the strip and the Bellagio dancing waters -- for only $50 a night.  Sold!  It was clean and great.  Jacuzzi was fun.

Other hotels look fun, and some of them are just as cheap, but we always seem to have a great time at Bally's, especially due to its sweet location.  We had a fabulous time.  Saw Penn & Teller, ate cheaply, got away with the whole 3-night vaca for around $1000.",0,2,1

Both the hotel and the casino are the plainest of the plain, but they serve a purpose.  Usually we stay here and gamble part of the time next door at Paris.  On this trip, we did a four-hour stint at the Bally's pai gow table on Friday night which should set us up with the comps for next year.

   Ballys best feature is its location. It is attached to Paris, across from the Bellagio and the Flamingo. Caesars Palace is diagonally across the street.

As far as safety, when we stayed at the north tower, security manned the elevator banks. Anybody could walk onto a south tower elevator. The room numbering is confusing.

The Good:
Two things about this hotel that I can actually give them credit for.....
1) Housekeeping was AWESOME! They were very personable and even went out of their way to notice that we had champagne chilling and got us two buckets full of ice. They did this without our request, so that was very impressive and thoughtful.
2) BLT Steak was so much better than I expected. They try to get you to sit down for the full dinner but my fiancé and I went there for happy hour (a great decision) and the drinks were fabulous. Try the french fries and Jag drink, it comes in an art deco glass with juniper and is an all around juicy drink. 

The Bad:
1) Self parking is actually in the Paris hotel, about a quarter of a mile away from the Indigo tower. For all those ladies out there, the self-parking is full of dark corners so I would not recommend traversing there on your own unless you have your trigger buddy with you;)
2) Valet is another story. Every morning, I had to wake up around 5 to make it to work and even at THAT early time, they would not allow me to call down a few minutes ahead of time and get my car ready. I have stayed at many hotels here in Vegas and never have I been told that calling down ahead of time was not possible, even at busy check in time. Add to that the fact that there is usually only one person on duty to both give new valet chits AND take existing ones and you have a waiting time of around 10 minutes. Even checking into the hotel, I had to get out of the car and stand there in the heat and wait to flag down an attendant. 

The Ugly:
1) The hotel does not find it necessary to even compete with your mother in law's guest room as they do not provide a mattress cover and think it completely acceptable that bottom sheets remain untucked and scratchy as sand.  I would also not trust any of the covers or decorative pillows and blankets as neither looked like they had been washed in some time. The room itself was spacious and the bathroom, peeling wallpaper aside, was tidy and looked presentable. Don't forget that wifi and using their in room safe are anything but free.
2) NO FRIDGE
3) Unless you find ten channels and static reception enjoyable, I would recommend not turning on the TV. We live in 2015, if you saw your favorite movie on this snowy set of channels, you would have changed the station. Let's remember that we paid 130 dollars per night for this room. 
4) The doors and walls are paper thin, so when your overzealous neighbor wakes up at 5 to take a shower, you wake up at five and take one with him:)

If you find yourself staying here, I recommend not bringing anything that needs refrigeration, as obviously, it will spoil unless you do what we did and obsessively refill your ice buckets everyday. 

We did read the yelp reviews before staying here, unfortunately we came for work and didn't have a choice. If you have a choice, stay somewhere else, you will walk away from Vegas happy instead of trying to drink your trip into oblivion.

Firstly, this hotel is perfectly located in the middle of the strip, across the street from the Bellagio and next door to Paris. The view from the rooms I've stayed in have been very, very good. When everything in Vegas is so much farther on foot than it seems, having a centrally located hotel with direct access to pedways is very helpful. Secondly, there are affordable options inside the hotel for meals and shopping, which is nice if you don't feel like spending big bucks on every single meal you eat while in town. Thirdly, for the location, the rooms are reasonably priced, especially weekdays. BE AWARE OF RESORT FEES; this is added to every day of occupancy, and for what, I don't know, but they are fucking annoying and should either be completely optional, or built into the rate of the room. 

Bally's doesn't get five stars from me because it isn't a five star hotel, frankly. The check in desk is 100 feet long but there were never more than three people total at any of the kiosks, and there were random employees talking and wandering around who didn't seem to care about or even notice the long line of patiently waiting customers. This looks bad for the hotel, and I heard more than one person say while waiting in line that this would be the last time they stay there. It's understandable. First impressions are everything. The people selling show tickets and timeshare tours were actually more helpful than the Bally's employees at the main desk, and the fact that they also look better than Bally's employees uniform-wise also is somewhat confusing.

Bally's also has no discernible theme and no personality. Compared to Paris, the younger, more beautiful sister, it's just meh. They need to brainstorm some concepts to make the place stand out. I think the outdoor mall is a nice improvement but it isn't enough. Bally's doesn't feel special; it feels generic.

Also, Bally's is starting to look run down and dirty, inside and out. The carpets are unforgivably dingy, and the details like dusting, wiping walls and glass surfaces aren't done thoroughly.  In my room most recently, I didn't really feel comfortable sitting on the couch or chairs without either putting a blanket or towel on them, because it didn't seem that the room was well cleaned. There were splashes of something on the bathroom wall, which I had to clean myself. The bed itself was a full-sized (ie underwhelmingly small) Murphy bed with ancient dust and dirt and balled-up tissue behind it. I mean, this is Vegas and the place is scuzzy, but the hotel room should be an escape from the scuzz, and not a source of it. I was also pretty shocked by how nasty the pool looks, like a bathtub with a ring of dirt around the sides.

To be honest, the next time I go to Vegas, I will probably stay here because of the pluses I mentioned, unless I find a better deal in a prettier or newer hotel. But if I do, I will also have to pray that I get a clean room with a decent bed, and pray that the pool is renovated by then.",0,0,0

We checked in, went to our room and almost opened the door when..the previous hotel stayers walked out.

A few things to note:
1) this was at like 5pm..I thought check in was alot earlier than that?
2) They put us in a room where it wasn't recently cleaned (okay, with hotels..cleanliness is always an issue..but really?)?
3) If we didn't see the previous hotel stayers just wake out of our room..we could have just walked in and stayed in a room not changed out at all.
4) They said ""Don't go in that room, it's pretty nasty in there""

2 stars down.

So of course, we ask for another room. We get an upgraded room for the same price we paid for the old room aka nicer accessories, same amount of space.

I've only been in the rooms here once, and that was 5 years ago, so cannot comment on it.

OVERALL VIBE

Ballys in perfectly located given it's appeal towards the budget minded folks. A popular spot for families, as well as younger groups. Very reasonable prices on food throughout the place. The decor is a little bland, but makes for a great casual environment to eat, drink, mingle, and even gamble. Not all ritzy and jazzed up, but not a dump either. A fun vibe with a less-than-normal-disorienting layout.

POKER

Poker room gets 4 stars. I frequent the poker room here due to the fact that it is a heavier concentration of nonsense players who are staying at the casino and want to give their luck a try. The poker room is well managed and a decent 1-2 game that gets pretty full around 7pm. They have a lot of bonuses, which contributes to the money on the table as the night progresses, but they also pull $1 extra per hand for it. It is located in the middle of the casino, so it gets a little noisy at times, but the bar is adjacent to it so no worries on cocktail service. 

DRINKS

They are stingy on the cocktails, even if you take care of the waitress. Fail. They do, however, serve cheap drafts at the bar closest to the entrance by the slots. The late night margarita specials are weak as well. Feel a sugar rush more than you do a buzz.

Also noteworthy is that the hot chocolate SUCKS. 

VERDICT

Again, I've never stayed here, so I can't comment on service or the amenities and all that. However, the laid-back, family crowd in a high traffic area along with decent cheap food options and a pretty soft poker game keep me coming back at least once a trip.",2,1,1

At one time it was the largest hotel in Las Vegas. The hotel is rather dated, but, I like its proximity to the monorail behind the hotel because my business was at the convention center.

My first night room cost was prepaid for $176.96. I checked in early around noon so I had to pay an early check-in fee of $22.40. My second night room cost including all fees was $264.32.

My king bedroom 1175 was average. The view was ok. The Wifi did not always operate smoothly. I really liked their laundered bathroom towels here. They were very soft compared to other hotels.",26,17,19

Rooms: I stayed in a standard room inside the newer tower (North Tower) located at the back of the hotel. It's about 450 square feet and included two queen size beds. Furniture and TV are a bit outdated, but I am very good at detecting rooms that are not clean. THIS IS A VERY CLEAN place to stay especially considering the ""age"" of the furniture, room, decor, and overall ""age"" of the casino. In fact, it was cleaner than the Rio suite I stayed at last time I was in Las Vegas. Tons of mirror space. hair dryer and iron that actually works. Amenities in the standard room include a facial soap, bar soap, Shampoo, and Body Lotion. Some rooms in this tower face a strip and it's a decent view. Unfortunately, I didn't get one of those rooms, but a friend of mine did and it was a pretty nice view! Strong shower faucet with great water flow. TONS of mirror space for ladies to put their make up on. Comfortable and spacious room.

Casino\/Gaming Floor: I have to give it 3.5 stars. A bit old and does not carry some of the newer machines, BUT REASONABLE RATES. They have slots priced on the lower end and my money lasted a lot longer here than Aria Hotel (and others). This place is a value for those that like to gamble with max bets on penny slots starting at 9 pennies! though generally speaking, they are about 20-30 and up to 50 cents for max bets (assuming 1 line play) for the penny slots. Sizable gaming floor for those that like tables as well. Fast lines and not too crowded.

Shopping: 2 stars if not 1 star. I wouldn't stay here for the shopping. It's an empty corridor, but at least Paris Hotel is owned by the same folks and is connected to Bally's. There are some shops along that corridor though it isn't THAT MUCH better either. 

Eating: Bally's has a Sbarro, Haagan Daaz, Ichiban (Japanese restaurant), and a Nathan's in its own food court. You can also eat inside Paris hotel and walk through the internal hallway inside the casino. It connects straight through and is very close to walk to Paris' Buffet.

Tip: Use the $5 off for a max of 4 people Paris Hotel Buffet and the total comes out to be about $14 bucks not including tip per person during the weekdays. Just as good as the Bellagio lunch buffet, but $10 bucks less with the coupon. They give out the coupons if you are staying at any of the Harrah properties and it expires at the end of March 2010.

Survey Opportunity\/TV Research: Earn $10 bucks by going inside a small market research room along the Bally's (almost dead) corridor. Get 10 bucks in cash for rating ads and television related market research. Easy way to kill some time and make 10 bucks. Takes about 30 minutes.

Check-In: I cannot complain. Fast and efficient. Friendly and helpful. Most importantly FAST. I had a smooth check in and my room was ready at 4pm (check in time). Check out town is at 11am.

Price: Excellent price. One of the best deals on the strip in my opinion. Not the best hotel on the strip, but for the price, it is a 5 star in itself!

Location: I am surprised and amazed at how cheap it is to stay here considering the hotel's central location. It's located center strip. I didn't have to take a cab my entire trip here. I walked to Venetian and as far as Encore and on the other end to Aria and Mandarin Oriental. Close to the cheap food\/food courts as well. EXCELLENT location!!! For shoppers, great location by two shopping malls (priced affordable for mid-America) including Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile and Ceasar Palace's Forum Shops (the non LV side).

The smell much like a convalescent home and concentrated cleaning products filled the hotel hallway. 
There were stains in the carpet for what seemed to be every 5-7 feet. When i finally entered the room the first thing i noticed was the big white stain on the carpet that could have easily been anything you can imagine that would disturb and make you instantly nauseous. The TV, furniture and decor were all beyond dated reminiscent  of an episode of the Brady Bunch where Alice may have been on vacation for a long stretch of time. The 1 highlight  i will admit was the spectacular view of the neighboring Paris hotel and the fountains at Bellagio, however this grand view was overshadowed but the disgusting grease smudges on the window. Needless to say....I wasnt going to stay here. After 2 plus hours hotels.com was persuaded to issue a credit which was applied to a night's stay at the beautiful Trump International.

The second we walked in the hotel, I knew this place was going to suck.  I understand the rooms have been updated, but when I stayed there, everything was so outdated. Not to mention dirty, with stains everywhere. The only good thing about the room was that they were pretty big.  We had two queen beds and more than enough room to probably fit a rollaway.  

You know how all the drink ladies in the casino usally wear something provocative? Yeah, they do that at this hotel too. Except they're older and at an age where something like that is totally inappropriate and awkward.  I'd always stare at the ground because I thought it was so weird!

The rooms were very run down, we even had a few holes in the wall (I think where the mini fridge had been yanked from the room). The room was a nice size and very comfortable, but hadn't been updated since the late 80's. 

As for the casino, we didn't spend much time there. I felt that it was smokier than the other casinos we visited, and with Paris within such close walking distance, that's where we chose to donate our money. I think next time we'll spend a few more bucks and get a room somewhere else.",6,2,0

Housekeeping did an okay job but a cocktail glass from the former occupant(s) outside the door in the hallway never moved the entire 5 days of my stay (see pic).  I brought two more to my room from the casino floor and those eventually ended up in the hall as well.  

There was not a fitted sheet on the bed which caused the pad and sheets to bunch up and slip away from the mattress (see pic). Also, my room faced Flamingo road and all I heard were sirens and horns all night long.  You would think being that far up it would be quiet but no such thing!

I was booked a room as part of a conference trip (ITC, if it matters) to present some slides accompanying a research paper submitted earlier. Anyhow, that's irrelevant, but just know this wasn't my first choice, even though I started with no preconceived notions.

My stay started with a lukewarm greeting at check-in. Upon arriving at the counter, and after checking that my room was pre-paid, I was informed that the only option for a room that evening would either be on a smoking floor (nope, not a smoker, and the casino floors in Vegas are smoky enough for me), or if wanted a non-smoking room, it'd be next to the elevators, would be noisy, and that I could check back the next day (the trip is three nights) for a better room. Whatever - I thought - I'm fine with dealing with some elevator dings and occasional people near the door.

The sounds audible inside the room are nothing like a few dings or people outside. It isn't anything like that. By ""next to"" the woman apparently meant - adjacent to and sharing a wall with - the elevator shaft itself. The room is arranged such that the headrests of each bed are bolted to the wall. That wouldn't be a problem ordinarily, however, on the other side of that particular wall is the elevator shaft. That wouldn't be much of a problem either, except that the elevators (there are three) are incredibly freaking loud and sound like a ski lift in the room. There's a continual series of three thumps as rollers ostensibly ride over a section of track bolted to the wall on the other side of the wall. Because the headboards are bolted to the walls, the bed and anything touching it vibrate accordingly, along with the floor and wall. It's like something out of a surrealist torture room instead of a Las Vegas hotel, I sh*t you not. As I write this, (from within the room, in fact) I've heard the elevator (or perhaps its counterweight, I can't tell) travel past the room 5 times. The sound is seriously surreal as well. It can also be imagined as the sound a deranged homeless man makes pushing a shopping cart filled with cinderblocks in circles over a set of three cement cracks. Except it Does. Not. Stop. Even at 3 AM. Nope. 

That's not really the only problem with this dilapidated room, either. The dresser looks like it has an incredible amount of water damage on the base and top, and cigarette burns. The room has a CRT TV (the south tower is obviously not renovated - thanks front desk woman for not giving north tower as an option) which sits on an equally battered looking TV stand that could collapse under the weight of a disapproving glance.

Oh and that isn't all either, inside the bathroom, there are several tiles missing at the base of the wall, with visible exposed drywall. As in, the entire tile is missing, and you can literally see drywall. The small trashcan was interestingly placed precisely to hide sight of this.  I've uploaded a picture to the gallery for your perusal, it's not hard to miss. There's nothing inside the room that wouldn't be much better without a fresh coat of paint, either. 

So why all this whining, didn't you ask for another room, you're thinking, right? Well, I did the next day - the answer? Not unless you want a smoking room. Pffft.

I just heard the elevator go by at full bore another time. \/sigh

The thing that got me was that when I booked my room I got a $25 food and beverage credit. After we check in we went to the Mexican restaurant that they have there, Tequila Bar & Grill. I charged it to the room per the manager of the restaurant. We dropped our keys in the express check out. And the next thing I know my card is charged for the food! Grr! The line in the morning were check out and check in and slow just like the night before! So now I have to go out of my way to make the phone which is painfully impossible to get a manager on the phone. Which at this current time I've actually given up on. I need to call again, but I hate tracking someone down. Anyway, the point is when I asked to speak to a manager and the phone rings and rings and they don't even have a voicemail! Is there someone even on the other end? Did you just transfer me to a phony phone number? Lame! 

When we returned to the hotel at night we valet not wanting to walk the walk with the bags again. In the morning, it took 15 minutes for them to get my car. There were people getting their cars that came up after us, we were about to ask about it but then we see my car. The attendant was nice and apologized for the wait that they had the wrong description\/wrong space of my car and he couldn't find it. Awesome! 

Can't comment on the casino or much else as that is all we did in the hotel that evening.",1,0,0

I had a king bed and an adorable blue velvet settee and matching ottoman.  We've all heard the rumor that casino's pump in oxygen to keep people awake and at the tables, but Bally's further incentifies you to stay awake by having really uncomfortable beds.  There is no fitted bottom sheet, so after stumbling into bed after a late night, you may find that you've peeled back one too many layers and are face to face with bare mattress.  Yuck.  Waking up in a tangled mess of top and bottom sheets is not a good way to start the day.  The mattress was cheap and uncomfortable, and I noticed small tears and stains on the sheets.
  
I had a nice window and balcony, but the sliding glass door was bolted shut.  Probably a good idea, but it sure would have been nice to have some fresh air.

For a middle nite snack loved the Tequlia bar for 2 dollar tacos. Friendly manager and nice bartenders. My only comparison is Bellagio where I did not have a good experience. I sent back my omelet because it was cold and the waiter asked me if i wanted it microwaved. I thought I was on candid camera but sadly I was not. Imagine a nuked omelet in a 5 star hotel.

My work had made the arrangements and we thought that everything was taken care of, but we were definitely wrong. when you book the hotel itself, they only take out for the first night(When you book through an agency, you pay for everything up front). This was a problem, because, they would not charge the same card without permission from the card holder. I had to place the other two days on my card, or we would have had too give up our room the next day. My work did fax the authorization for the other two days, but they did not fix it, until the day that we left.

I cannot say enough good things about our stay at Ballys - it was excellent, and the staff were always helpful. The location is easily the best on the strip, which is why I chose it to begin with.

We came in late on Sunday night, and went straight there. The check-in staff (David) upgraded our room to a suite, and even put us in a fairly low floor (6th floor), but away from any noise from clubs, and with a refrigerator. He figured out exactly what would address our needs perfectly. While the room was not updated with new furnishings, it was very clean and nice, and it did not look worn out. The bed was comfortable, and the curtains allowed me to block out the light completely to be able to have a power nap in the middle of the day. I would happily stay there again (and likely will next trip).

The check-in staff walked us through getting our TR cards, showed us how to get to the taxi stand, suggested the best times and ways to see the attractions that we wanted, etc. All of them were pleasant and helpful.
Our maid (Rosy) was perfect. She kept everything fresh and new, every day. Please tip the maids - they definitely make the stay more enjoyable.

The location sets Ballys apart from all of the others. It was very easy to get back to the room at any time from anywhere on the strip and take a break. With all of the walking in Vegas, being able to use both the buses and the monorail with ease makes all the difference. Additionally, Ballys is on the corner where you need to cross the streets, so the pedestrian bridges are right up front. It makes it easy to get to any location quickly and with minimal walking.
Additionally, there is a huge CVS right in front of Ballys, where you can get anything you can want, including alcohol. With a fridge in the room, it made it a no-brainer to pick up everything we needed right there.

We really enjoyed going to Paris a lot, so being in the Indigo tower was much better for us. The connection between Ballys and Paris was one of our favorite locations, and housed the best breakfast buffet in Vegas in my opinion.

I'm pretty sensitive to smoke, and I did not find the Bally's casino to be smoky at all. I had to physically leave Harrah's one evening, and had to leave El Cortez as well - both in less than an hour just due to the smoking. In contrast, I never felt any issue in the Ballys.

Overall, I highly recommend Ballys for anyone traveling to Vegas for the first time.",0,0,0

The beds were comfortable with tons of extra pillows. There was a standing shower- no dirty tub! The bathroom was spacious and clean. I truly loved the room itself. We had a gorgeous view of the strip- direct view of the Eiffel Tower! 

The casino is attached to the Paris. It's not as dated as I thought it would be considering how old the casino is. There are ton of food options there from the food court to Starbucks to random restaurants. There's a good size gym that's open 6a-6p. There's tons of cardio machines, free weights, arm\/leg machine and even a few resistance training equipments. It's much bigger than I expected! 

The best part of all? Location! The casino is situated in the heart of the strip. You can literally walk to all the big major casinos within 15 minutes. There's tons of restaurants within walking distance outside of Ballys. You really don't need a car at all! You can do all the touristy things you want by waking. There's the Miracle Mile shopping mall next door. There's food everywhere. It's hard to complain. 

So the bad? The noise! Omg the noise from our hotel was terrible. At 11pm, there's some sort of club going on next door, and it plays really really loud music. It was such a nightmare every night trying to sleep! The bass was so loud that i literally felt vibrations from my bed. There's tons of loud people screaming and random fire noise effect. It was bananas! My fiend and I were in town for a week for a medical conference. Our conference started at 7a and ended at 6p. I maybe slept 4 hours every night. I was exhausted every night during my conference. It's 1am right now as I'm writing this review. I've been laying in bed for 4 hours. That's how bad it is! The music comes from Drais night club from 1030p-4am so be prepared! 

I've called the front desk to request a room change. I've asked 3x and each time they said it was fully booked and call back tomorrow at noon. I asked for ear plugs but they didn't have any to offer. I went to the gift shop and they didn't sell any. I mean, cmon! I cannot be the only person complaining of this noise. It is seriously soooo loud!

I do not recommend playing their electronic roulette in the casino.  Their machine had a glitch and pretty much screwed all 15 of us sitting there.

Upon arrival, had some bad experience on three issues.  Number one was we got the worst room (6th floor) with reddish eyesore view overlooking the rooftop full of vents, etc.  Number 2 was the curtain was not long enough that these water from the shower passed under the curtain and flooded the bathroom floor and is dangerous as its floor is marble.  Number three was no maid service came in and the bathroom continued to be a big mess!

I went to the check in desk manager and complained how awful our arrive has turned  into.  She was totally understandable and felt guilty and the problem that these rooms were all full, so gave us upgraded room which was very generous and I we accepted the stay for the next two nights as planned.  We finally enjoyed our rest of the stay.  Bravo!

Not so good walking through the casino from the main entrance to the elevator to these rooms because smoking were all over and so unpleasant.

Food and drinks are poor and does not have independence owned establishment, so had to walk to other hotels to enjoy coffee and dining.

Rooms price are totally reasonable.  Come during weeknights which is as low as $45, up to $109 or more on weekend nights, rate are higher on upgraded rooms, but still good price.

Three stars is it, could have been more if experience are good from start to finish.  In the near future it will be more stars if its better.  So do the work and make it more flawless!",0,0,0

None of us we close! All on different floors!
My sister was upgraded to a suite - we don't know why! Nice for her!!

The worst part was the Housekeeping Inspector woman just walked right in our room WITHOUT KNOCKING! We were just walking out. Completely surprised! She said ""O' sorry, I'm just holding the door for you""! We made light of it but it was disturbing! 
The very next day we came back from the pool and I was in the shower, with the bathroom door open. My husband stripping out of his wet suit and here she comes AGAIN!! No KNOCK!! And tried to talk her way out of it, my husband yelled ""just get out I'm obviously naked-get out""!
We called the manager told him of our situation and he said ""she said she knocked""! What the?! That means she ran to him and told him, no I'm Sorry or that won't happen again!! 
My husband then told him he had to go home and my wife (me) was scheduled to stay alone for the next few days, but because of all these actions of Bally's employee's (including him) she's AFRAID to stay!
All the Manager said (very monotone) I'll put you down for check out tomarrow!  WoW!! I was a manager for the Hampton Inn for years and I'm completely Insulted and Appalled by not only his lack of empathy but the Disrespect we felt the whole time by him and Employees!!

It had been years since I stayed at Bally's and they are certainly showing their age. First thing I noticed upon arrival is the stench of cigarette smoke from the casino. Yes, I know smoking is allowed but upon entering Caesars and Wynn, it smells like flowers and sunshine. Alas, I know I'm not paying Wynn money to stay here so moving on.

The line to check in was in fact extra long. The front desk staff are in no hurry to get to you. We were given a room in the South Tower with stunning views of Paris and half of the Bellagio fountain. Gorgeous at night. The rooms are larger than average but dated. Terrible scuffs on the furniture, dingy carpet, just extremely dated. Not that we're there for the room ambiance but do better.

I would have overlooked it all had I not had a bed spread (won't call the thin blanket a comforter) with a spot of blood on it. A call to housekeeping had the situation remedied quickly. When our toilet flooded all over the floor, maintenance came right away to fix that as well. Again, we just pushed on. 

In the South Tower, you will also hear every single noise below, to the side and above. At times it was like we had a ghost in our room with all the random noises. One morning we were rudely woken up by repetitive banging like someone was bouncing a basketball. Walls are extremely thin. Bring earplugs!

All that being said, all of the staff I encountered here was very friendly and helpful. We gambled a bit here on the slots and my mother won a modest amount.

We ate in three restaurants (Tequila Bar, Sidewalk Cafe, and Sterling Brunch at Steakhouse). I will review Steakhouse separately because it deserves it. But Tequila and Sidewalk were good options for a quick bite. I had breakfast foods at both places and the food was good and plentiful. Drinks at Tequila Bar was pretty good.

Essentially, Bally's is a decent option for those that are on a budget or would rather spend their money eating or feeding the machines. We personally had the room from hell but I'm sure that wasn't everyone's experience. If I returned, not sure I would stay here. Would likely pony up the money to stay elsewhere.

There's several regular old players in the age of 60+ pretending they don't know each other but sitting next to each other coaching or telling each other to fold because one person has a better hand. It does not stop there because there's a Filipino wife of the older white gentleman who was like coughing to signal her husband to fold when she had the nut flush but her husband didn't fold because he got a full house and she was pissed he didn't fold. Normally the better hands win and you become a sportsmanship and not bicker about it but nope she gave this disappointment look and made comments you should have folded. On top of that, she was speaking Tagalog to a  dealer who I thought i trust but what happened to speaking English only at the table? I know that's the rule in every poker table. Knowing all this, I've requested for a table change but the person in charge said there's no open table when fcuck there's 5 tables with at least 1-2 seats open.

We ended up staying at Ballys because it was at the center strip, and it was cheap. On top of cheap it was for the weekday. So the parking was difficult at first, but that wasn't an issue till you get used to how vegas is set up. Upon entering I was awarded a free roll to win ""prizes"" which I was an all paid cruise. ""Bullshit"" but whatever. I checked in with ease. I believe I got a deluxe king room in 2429. Upon entering the room I was amazed! The view was towards flamingo street where you see flaming casino and high roller. It was amazing! The windows and doors to the balcony were bolted because obvious reasons! The windows were huge by the way. They had a desk, a couch and the tv was average. The bed was comfy, the pillows weren't all that amazing. As for the restroom it was amazing!

My man and I are Total Rewards members, and we like to do a little gambling. We were originally slated to stay across the street to the north at Flamingo, but the guy on the phone was new or something and never actually entered our reservation... hence how we ended up at Bally's. The only problem we had the entire stay was at check-in when we were told we would have to pay a mandatory $18\/night resort fee, which would entitle us to the use of internet and the gym. (Neither of which we had any intention of using, by the way.) This is apparently a new policy. I relented and paid the ridiculous fee plus tax, but my man put up a bit of a fight because he was told over the phone that the fee would be waived for us. It took about four hours and them actually going back and listening to the phone call where he made the reservation... but we came back to the room that night to a voice message from the front desk saying that we were in fact correct - it had been waived - and we could pick up our cash deposit anytime. Interesting start to our stay, but I will say, it was resolved in a timely and complimentary manner.

The room itself was incredibly large, to the point where I thought there really should be more furniture in there to fill up the space. Perhaps a bigger couch and a fridge, guys? The room looked fairly updated and was quite clean, despite it being on a smoking floor. The smell was never really an issue either. The bathroom was nice, we never needed housekeeping, and my only complaint was that the toilet flushed TERRIBLY loud.

I really love the location of this hotel on the strip, and I also love that it's connected to Paris. This part of the strip is my favorite, because it is just steps away from Planet Hollywood, which is also a favorite place of ours for gambling, and houses my favorite restaurant, Koi. Bally's also has easy access to everything fun, including my favorite Vegas destination across the street: Caesar's Palace. It was a bit of a hike from the parking structure to our room, but I didn't mind the walk. We had a great time at the casino, winning and then ultimately losing all our money at Blackjack. Drink service was pretty good and consistent in the casino as well. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants here, and it was too cold to use the pool. Next time!",0,0,0

Room included a sofa, dining table, flat screen with bar area (which eventually the sink backed up, see below). Bathroom was decent and there was a vanity area for the ladies. 

Quality of towels in bathroom was minimal and for a suite, it would have been nice to have a robe and slippers, but we didn't get that. The shower and toiletries was basic. Overall, the room served its purpose.

One night we came back from a night out and noticed about 2 cups of black GUNK and GLOB in the bar sink. Gross. We were told it was caused from a backup in someone's else room. He picked up the nasty black glob and we waited for 30 minutes for housekeeping to come and clean it and got too tired to wait up afterwards.

Casino has a variety of slot themes including Michael Jackson, Elvis, Monopoly and more. Good variety of tables and the people are nice that work at hotel. Good and easy access to Paris hotel and the Rewards program works at multiple hotels.

The location is great and their rates are really affordable. The older tower has pretty outdated rooms so we always make sure to ask for an upgrade...even if we have to shell out an extra $25. They have a little Taco\/Mexican restaurant inside which I believe is open 24 hours. I've spent a lot of drunk hours munching on chips and salsa with my friends. The margaritas there are also strong...and big. I remember them coming in a fishbowl. Good times.

Parking  is $10\/day for self-park. Rooms were nicer than expected. We stayed in the Jubilee Tower. Spacious and clean. We had a view of the Eiffel tower and some of the Bellagio fountains which was cool. Shower was also spacious and great water pressure, hot water. Basic toiletries (soap, shampoo\/conditioner in one, facial soap) provided. Coffeemaker is a basic one, comes with packet creamer\/sugar, sweetener. Beds were comfortable enough, sheets were clean. Desk was large with it's own comfortable, funky-looking chair. Seating area was comfortable and a good hang out area--not just a couple of hard chairs at a table. Decor was sleek\/classic, kinda 1970s. Check-in was easy and quick. Check-out was also easy and quick. 
Convenient access to Paris and right out the door you can get quickly to a bunch of main interests on the strip, so basically great location for less cost than the surrounding hotels.

Cons: Wifi--bit tricky to use because the log-in confuses you as to whether you will end up paying extra beyond what was already charged for Wifi. Apparently others have this problem because it's the first thing that comes up on the recording when you call the front desk.
No info in the room on the amenities, so I had to call to ask about the gym. Pay heed: It's located INSIDE their spa which is past the food court and before the pool. I missed it the first time. Also bring a photo ID and make sure your name is on the reservation. You can do that on check-in. They allowed me entry even though I didn't meet that qualifications as a one-time grace because no one tells you what is expected. Even though I called to ask where the gym was. Probably would've been useful information to include.

Bellhop service was cool because they kept our bags for the entire day but the system is terrible if you're not already in the know. We waited in line for the desk and there was simultaneously a guy with a baggage trolley calling out, ""next!"" maybe 10 feet from the desk. We weren't sure if we went straight to the trolley or if we needed to check in at the desk to get a ticket or what the process was. My sister went to the desk to ask and received a vague and distracted reply so we just stood in line. When it was our turn, we went to the trolley when the guy called, ""next!"" and the guy told us we needed to wait in line. We told him we did. The entire exchange was awkward because we didn't know what the expectation was and I understand being rushed because of being busy, but this is a service business. You still have to do the job. The guy quickly gave me a ticket and put a sticker on one of our 3 bags. I asked if we didn't need stickers on all of the bags. He said, ""oh. yeah"" and carelessly put stickers on the other 2 but they didn't stick which he didn't notice and I had to bring to his attention. How would we have gotten our bags if I hadn't been paying attention?",1,0,1

It's a good and decent hotel if you're looking for something on the strip with a lower budget. The location is definitely the best part of the hotel. We tried the $20 trick (actually I included $30 to see if we could get a bigger upgrade) and it kinda worked but the upgrade to a bigger room with a view was worth about $30 extra anyway. 

There are no real perks to the rooms, no microwave or fridge, the wifi only works on two devices so I'm not sure what the $32 per day resort fee is paying for, especially since the pool was closed when we were there. We had a late check in because of a missed flight, and they even tried to charge us a resort fee for the day before we checked in.

It's a pretty plain hotel, and being on the strip, everything inside the hotel is gonna be way more expensive than necessary.

This is definitely the next one for the wrecking ball, but our stay was fine and this property offers a few different positives which would make me consider staying again.

First off- I stayed here this past weekend with several (male) college friends in our late 30s.  We're all married, shared rooms, and went to LV for a fantasy football draft, and got really cheap rates on rooms as our draft was taking place at another (more expensive) property on the same block.  We got one room comped, and a 2nd for $89\/night.  This property was perfect for us- cheap, and easy proximity to everything we needed- adequate restaurants, booze, etc.

If I was a young, single 20-something, looking for a 'scene'- this is not where I would stay.  The crowd was generally older (than me), the pool was mediocre at best- very expensive drinks, and more of an AARP crowd than one would expect.  The 20-something year-old belongs at Hard Rock, The Palm, or basically ANYWHERE else...

If I was going with my wife for a nice weekend together- I wouldn't stay here either- you can do better elsewhere and get a more elegant room- although our rooms were clean very adequate, albeit outdated...But I'd look at Wynn, The Hotel, or many other options before this.

In summary- the good things about Bally's are the cheap rooms, the proximity to other casinos- including the direct tunnel walkway to Paris- where we spent most of our time gambling, and the 24 hour Sbarros.  If any of these things are of interest to you, you should consider Bally's.  I may stay here again, but definitely not the top of my list in LV.",3,0,0

We were comp 2 nights stay at Bally's, stayed in the new Jubilee Tower. The room was spacious and very clean. King size bed with two sinks in the bathroom, what was nice they were actually separate, one in the bathroom one outside. Water in the shower was amazing cold to hot in 2 seconds! Beds were comfy, and we each had 3 pillows so we didn't have to bother for more. The room service was super quick too as we needed more towels and shampoo. Overall I give the room a 5.

We ate at the Tequila Bar right after check in. Margaritas were pretty good, not too bad. I ordered the chicken potato tacos, good seasoning and not bad for the price. My girlfriend on the other hand ordered the Grande Nacho, this was our mistake. the plate was the size of a fourth of the table, don't get me wrong for $16 this  a steal and could feed 4 people easily, but we literally took it back to our room in two boxes after getting through a third of it. Overall i give them a 4 start for the portion sizes and price.

The next morning we ate at the Sidewalk Breakfast buffet, thank god! Great choice, only $11.99 a person, a lot of food choices as well. The biscuits and gravy were the best mixed with some potatoes and bacon, yumm! Even had desserts and DONUTS. 
Overall 4 start for the price and selection. 


The last place we ate at was for dinner, le burger brasserie. No wait, and it was happy hour, 2 thumbs up for that. Buy 1 get 1 free beers, no specials though on food. I got the French dip, very good size portion, fries do no come included. My gf got the hot dog sliders and were also a good portion especially for a starter entree. The beer was good the ladies were dressed kind of different then the theme portrayed, more clubbing if you ask me with corsets and color hair. A bit pricey. I give them a 3 star for the service and food, would be more but a little too pricey.

- Price.  First I had a room comped then I went there and asked for an upgrade and they told me it was 75 a night for the executive suite.  That is 1600 sq feet for 75 a night i jumped all over that.  Got an attached room for an additional 50 a night and had more than enough sleeping for 7.  
- Gambling.  I cannot base this on wins or losses because that is dumb (although I did clean up more than 2 grand THANK YOU!) There are always open seats and a lot of the times my group could find empty tables so we could take over the whole table.  The dealers were relatively friendly and pleasant.
- Location.  I don't think you can be more centrally located.  Across the street from Caesars, connected to Paris, walking distance to harrahs, venetian, O'sheas (when you are hammered).  

Mehs (not a pro not a con)
- Crowd.  I liked the fact that there are less younger people there.  Despite being in my mid 20s when I gamble I like the quiet older crowd.  Ballys gave me a nice quiet environment to gamble in and still kept me walking distance from the loud crazy places like Venetian.  This is all on preference though, my group likes the crazy people so it would be a con for them.

Cons
- Food.  A weekend lived on sbarro's is not good for the stomach.
- Service.  Takes forever to get a drink.  The staff is not hot.  I feel like every waitress is about to say ""yes sonny back in the day I used to be such a hot number you would've dropped your jaw"".  Too many gray-haired ladies as waitress.  Nothing against the older people but they just should not be dressed up in skimpy outfits handing out drinks.  I also think one of them was deaf, not joking.

Overall
 It was perfect for my crowd.  Here is how I would describe Bally's.  If you are looking for a boys weekend out, you need a place to hang your hat.  You don't want to stay at Imperial Palace because that place gives you the heeby-jeebies (yea it does to me too), but you want to stay on the strip.  It's pointless to spend a lot of money on the room because you are going to be out till 5am and be plastered all weekend then Ballys it should be.  A step up from Imperial Palace but still not that high.  Paris is a hop skip and a jump away if you want to meet ladies.  I love it for boys weekends",0,0,0

Not as crowded as the other pool parties, but lets call it a ""medium"" pool party scene.  Great DJ with great music, clean, lots of space.  The crowd is a bit of everything, but this hotel caters to the mid 20s to mid 30s crowd, a fun atmosphere.  Watch out $15 for a drink at the pool.  Sneak in your own.  Close to everything and in the dead center of the strip.  Everything we could ask for.  A $20 cab ride to the airport.

My only complain is that in this day and age the entire building should have free wifi to guests, especially since people are coming in from out of the country and need to connect their cell phones.  Americans don't care because they have their smart phones with local data plans, but Canadians felt a bit disconnected.  We paid the daily resort fee of $20, and that included wifi in the room only and ONLY on 1 device.  Any extra devices were $13\/day.  I think that is ridiculous.  A minor detail that makes any hotel more tourist friendly in this digital age we live in.

This hotel was NOT cheap.  It was moderate and free wifi would have made it a better deal.  Given it's not the top hotel on the strip a bit more affordable rooms wouldn't hurt.  I would go back again without shopping around if they give me a better deal, but when I go back I will do price comparisons, because the price was a bit steep.",2,0,0

Check in was good but there's an early check in fee of 20. or wait till 3 or 4:00? Great. Got in early.

There was no coffee machine in the room which would be nice just to get a jump on the day. The craps tables where fun and most of the dealers where friendly. The ladies at the cash window where super friendly too. Need some info on where to get a great steak dinner so we went to the concierge. Michelle was her name. She said the stake in the BLT steak house (in their building) was ""excellent"" I asked for another place as I has JUST read the reviews on yelp and they weren't good. She seemed offended I would say such a thing.. (too bad, I wasn't rude about it..) We also asked about a busline that goes straight to Freemont St, she said there was no such bus. Only a city bus. We told her at check in there was such a bus that takes you there and we told her.. she didn't have a clue and the rudeness continued.  She was a rude dolt, not to mention she was sloppy. She didn't look professional and sure wasn't in her demeanor. Isn't a concierge supposed to have info  when asked questions like ""Where's a good steak house and what bus takes us to Freemont St?""

The lady that checked us in told us that we can upgrade to the Jubilee Tower for $11 with a fridge, rather than just keeping our room in the Indigo Tower as the fridge would be $15 extra. We upgraded and when I checked out, instead of the $11 extra per day, we were charged $40 extra per day instead. The lady that checked me out of the hotel didn't even care to resolve the issue with my bill in any way. She had an ""oh well, sucks for you, now pay the bill"" attitude. Don't listen to them about the Jubilee Tower, the rooms were okay and the view was mediocre at best. The elevators suck, you have to wait for at least five minutes before you get one, and then you will be lucky if that elevator is not crammed with people. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL, they lie about the billing to charge you for way more than you intended to spend.

Ballys did not inform us prior to our trip that we couldn't use the office card to pay for our reservation with out an authorization form being filled out. One of the girls had to use her card when we checked in which was very inconvenient. They said our manager (who was back in IL) had to complete a form and send it back. She went back and forth via email with someone from the hotel who told her she could email or fax the back. She emailed it, and the front desk refused the form because they said they are not allowed to have it emailed.

After faxing it three times to the number provided in the email AND by a staff member, the staff said they had not received it still.

We booked using the Hotel Tonight app, and my expectations were not high. One downside is that they share a parking lot with Paris. So if you self park you'll have a bit of a walk to the check-in desk. Checking in was the roughest part of the experience just because it took so long. We arrived at 10:45 pm and I didn't expect there to be a check-in line. I waited for about 40 minutes and everyone around me was becoming super grumpy. They did not have enough staff to check everyone in. There were only 2 people tending to the regular line, and 3 tending to the Platinum Member line. One I reached the counter though, the woman was super pleasant. She was able to quickly give me a room with 2 beds and add my friend's name to the room so that she could come pick up a key later.

They did a very good job with the remodel. I was surprised when I saw our room! It was nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was all new and clean. There was a good amount of floor space, 2 plush chairs (that someone can combine to sleep on), mirrored table, a long dresser, and desk. BONUS: the room comes with a mini fridge! Our room had a view of the new Linq. There is a cafe downstairs by the elevators if you need something quick to eat. Bally's name doesn't hold a glamorous connotation but once you're inside you will be surprised. Plus, it is right in the center of the strip.

The room was actually a 4 star room but I give them 3 stars for the condition of the room upon check in. See photos. There was a bloody spot on the duvet, there was a bloody handprint inside the bathroom door, there was blood spatter on the wall and mirror and more blood spatter on the wall by the bathroom door. Homicide? Domestic spat? Who knows? There was an inch of dust all over everything. There were many greasy hand and face prints all over the picture window. There were vomit chunks residing just under the sink drain cover but very visible. The was a used chunk of soap in the uncleaned shower. This took several calls and finally a trip to the always packed front desk to resolve. We checked in after 1 AM so we let it go the first night. Since nothing was done about any of it upon cleaning the next day, I went to the front desk.  The line was very long so I asked the Concierge to get me a manager. Her response was That's not my job go stand in line or use that phone over there. I tried the phone, and after about 12 selections from multiple menus I was told to go the mail and keys desk. Upon checking there WAS no such thing but I asked the porter to get me a manager. Guess what? Not his job either, go stand in line. So I stood in line. I got a manager who didn't even look at the photos. She said our room would be Deep Cleaned ASAP and refunded one night's $34 resort fee. After several more hours with no result, I flagged the housekeeper down outside our room (no English) and with hand gestures and taking her to each spot, she did the cleaning. The good things about the rooms are that there are no LOoooong hallways, all the elevators are centrally located. The ice machine was nearby and working. Bathrooms are marble and nice. Our room at least, had a great view of the strip. Beds were comfy with 3 pillows each. Lots of TV and movie channels. The pool is nice and there's no Nazi guarding it.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we asked about an upgrade, and for an additional $20 we got a Jacuzzi tub and a view of ""The Linq"".

The good:
Location on the strip can't be beat, right across from the Bellagio and connected to the Paris. Didn't feel like I had to walk too far to anything. Close to bus stop out in front. 

The room was nice and clean on a non smoking floor.

Spacious floor plan and comfortable bed.

Multiple sinks and great vanity area for a girl and her makeup, there is even a little stool to sit on. 


The not-so-good:
The tile in the bath area is ridiculously slippery when the slightest bit wet, and the shower temperature and pressure was poor. 

Whenever someone above or below you uses their shower, the loud sound of water wakes you up, as does the sirens on the street passing by multiple times a night. I, however, had a terrible head cold on my trip so I had trouble sleeping anyway.

The pool was closed and construction being done at the entrance.

I understand Vegas isn't cheap, but $3.50 for a bottle of water in the shop downstairs? Room service has a $20 minimum plus delivery fee - they wanted $15 for hot water for tea?! Luckily I didn't bother. 

No mini fridge - maybe only suites have them?

I know people don't come to Vegas to watch TV in their room, but since I had the aforementioned head cold, I had to come back to the room to rest and the channels are extremely limited. Mostly Vegas ads, and Japanese channels.

We left Los Angeles at 4am and arrived at the hotel at 11am after grabbing breakfast. We attempted to check in and were told that the early check in was not available. The attendant told us to return at 2pm and it would be available at no charge, so we did. We came back as instructed at 2pm and were told that housekeeping was still working on the room and that it would be another hour. So we haul our luggage back to the car again and wait. At 3pm we return once more and are now told that we will have to wait until 4pm because the room is still not ready. So we wait until 4pm, everyone is growing impatient..  And as you may have guessed, we were told that it would not be ready until 5pm when we returned at 4! Fed up, we asked for a supervisor and were instead greeted by another sarcastic attendant who was unsympathetic and did not attempt to resolve the issue. Finally another associate told us they had a room ready for us in a different tower with a different view and we took it because we had already been waiting for over FIVE hours to check in. A second room was made available for us in a separate building, and we were told we would still need to wait an hour for the third room. We got to our room and found human hair on the couch and bed. Here we are, writing this review while waiting for a call to tell us our third room is ready..  But as expected, an hour later it is still not available. We have wasted our entire day attempting to check in, dealing with rude staff, and being repeatedly disappointed by this place. Our party is being split up into three very distant locations, which will create another huge inconvenience for us for the rest of our trip. We will NEVER return here, nor can we recommend this poor establishment to anyone in good faith. Don't waste your money; save yourself the headache and RUN (don't walk) to any other hotel.

It's run down, outdated, your showers\/bathtubs don't drain efficiently, half of the lights in the room actually work, and I could feel the springs from the bed mattress in my back.  We should have just stayed put at The Hard Rock Hotel, where we paid half the price for a room and amenities 10x better than what we received at Bally's.

I happen to have a conference in Vegas and thought I might lever my status to have a larger private room to entertain clients in.

My company is paying my room rate for me, but I thought that I would check to see if I can upgrade the room given my Diamond Status.

The host on duty, Jack McKevitt, told me that I won too much money to receive any free upgrades.  I was appalled to hear this, since the only reason I would ever go to a casino would be to win money.  I dug deeper and said, "" so if I lost more money, you would value me more as a player?""  His reply was, ""Definitely.""

I added, ""Do you want all of your customers to know that you will not give commensurate comps if they win?"" He said, ""I didn't say that.""

But, as you can tell, he essentially did say that.

We ended the call with him saying we were moving in circles, and he said he had to go.  However, I want you to know that I only asked for some way to lever my status during my conference attendance.

This was your opportunity to get me to love Bally's and Ceasars.  Instead, Jack McKekvitt has truly lost Ceasars and Bally's a client.

To throw icing on the cake, he told me that I have no play at his casino.  So, I assume my Diamond status really doesn't apply anywhere but at the Horseshoe Cincinnati (sold to Jack Casino this year) and Hammond Casino in a town that I rarely visit.  I guess Ceasars is not really 1 company taking care of it's customers.  It's many small to large casinos scattered across the US where you really need to play a lot at them all to benefit from a rewards status. At least that's my takeaway, courtesy of Jack McKevitt.

I'll be attending Bally's in October, but you won't see a nickle of my money inserted or played in your casino.

In the end here, it's called 'consultative approach.'  I get that my status may have limited reward capabilities.  But, instead of telling me what it doesn't do or afford me (and making me angry through insulting my winning status), try suggesting alternatives.

Years ago when I first started going to Vegas, I stayed at Bally's, and for some reason they always upgraded my room. So it always made me a happy camper and so I kept going back. I have great memories of this place.

Fast forward - I recently stayed here in the Jubilee tower. Wow. What an upgrade in itself. The rooms have been updated and are now a bright red with some really cute accents. They have been modernized - gone is the dark blue (or overwhelming beige) of the other rooms and ushered in is bright red and dark brown. They are really put together nicely - a nice modern touch. I really liked this room. 

This time, the room looked to the north, so we could see the Flamingo next door, and the ever cool looking High Roller as they were testing the lights. Definitely a good view. 

I like Bally's because I really like the area of the strip it is in. There's a lot around and a lot going on - so it's the perfect location. The casino itself is so-so, but hey, can always walk to Paris, right?

Drawbacks: a couple - you can hear a lot even high up. So if you're wondering what that strange noise is that sounds like cannons - it is. It's the fountains at the Bellagio.

The second big drawback is the casino floor layout. Bringing my bags into the hotel, from the parking garage, there aren't many ramps, so to get to the Jubilee tower or even to the check in, you have to drag your bags up and down the stairs several times. Not fun. 

One other complaint - they have cheapened up and no longer have conditioner in the hotel room. Fortunately, I had brought my own, so I didn't call and ask if they had any, but I would hate to have to buy it if they didn't. Other than that, I can say my experience was quite pleasant.",3,1,0

Besides that annoyance, I found it to be very clean, walking through the casino floors and throughout the hotel & room. The colors scheme and decor are nice, and the hotel itself doesn't wreak of smoke and old rug smell which I really appreciate. We had a classic room w\/a king and the the room was spacious!

There are the cheap places like Excalibur, Tropicana, and Imperial Palace.  There are the nice places like Caesar's and TI.  And of course the luxury hotels like Wynn and Bellagio.  Bally's hits that perfect low-to-mid sweet spot.  

Nightly rates were only $10 higher than IP or Excalibur, but the overall experience was considerably better.  Naturally, the place isn't as nice as a newer hotel, and in some ways it really shows it's age, but only the most critical would consider it ""run down.""  The casino is well organized and easily navigated, but of course the real benefit of Bally's is that it is in the heart of the action.  Across the street from Caesars and Bellagio, connected to Paris, and a short walk to the Venetian, TI, Harrah's, or Mirage.  There's also a direct monorail stop if you prefer that, although from the center strip location I didn't really use it.

The rooms and furniture are clearly old-school.  The desk in my room was a little scratched up, the end table had some well-concealed 70's-era cigarette burns.  But it was all very functional and generally tasteful.  Bally's slogan is ""Stay Classic"", and they really play that up... although the place is very comfortable and modern, there is a distinct classic Vegas feel to the place.  It's a good classic feel, unlike the Tropicana or downtown where you feel like you're staying somewhere that Vegas had forgotten.

I love staying at Bally's. 

People complain about the smell of smoke (HELLLLOOOOO.... You are in LAS VEGAS... at a CASINO!!!!), how it's outdated, too far to walk, bad view, blah blah blah. 

As far as I'm concerned (mind you I have only stayed in the new tower), I think that the rooms are some of the cleanest hotel rooms I've seen in or out of Sin City. And the beds are very comfortable. And the hotel staff polite and helpful. The location on the strip really couldn't be anymore central. Everything you could need or want is just a stone's throw away. And for those opposed to walking very far, the monorail is connected to the hotel and the bus stops right out front... and again I will remind you that you are in Las Vegas... unless you bring a wheelchair\/scooter you will be walking. Don't like to walk? Don't go to Vegas

Living in LA this was my first time to plan a quick trip to Vegas for me and a friend from out of town.  Plus, I decided I would rather not spend a lot of money on a room because I didn't want to spend a lot of money for one night, but I did want to stay on the strip.  Plus, I went on a Sunday night in June.

First of all, Bally's isn't the nicest Hotel from the outside, but as soon as me and my friend pulled in the Valet guys were extremely helpful.  They took our luggage ad let me know that valet is free, but of course tipping is appreciated. Great for me!
Check-in was easy and didn't take much time at all. The inside of Bally's isn't fancy or anything that special, but it's nice and seemed clean.
We got to our room and it was huge and that was for the cheapest, basic room.  It was a little outdated, but the view was good.  We had a basic room, but we could see the Bellagio from our window.  The view made 2 country girls very happy.  The bathroom was huge also which we loved, but they could use a new shower head.  It didn't have good water pressure.
The casino and bar at Bally's were fine.  Nice bartenders.  We didn't do much gambling, but it didn't seem very different from the rest of the casinos.  Even though I like going to casinos they always seem a little tacky looking to me,  but I noticed they ALL look like this.  Its just a personal opinion.  I never ate at Bally's, but instead we ate at Paris the next day for lunch since they are connected.  
I loved the location of Bally's.  We were in walking distance of the better hotels and restaurants and I loved being across from the Bellagio.  We cabbed it a couple times, but we were in heels and wanted to check out the Palms that night a little off the strip. 
The pool at Bally's wasn't impressive at all.  Just a big pool and layout area, but I didn't go to layout, so it didn't matter to me.
So, basically I was really happy with my experience at Bally's. It gave me what I wanted for that 24 hours.  I might like to stay at a fancier place next time, but honestly I would stay at Bally's again because it's not like I""m hanging in my room a lot when in Vegas. 
Also, when we left the Valet guy helped me get back on the interstate.  Some of the people at Bally's looked miserable working there, but the parking staff was helpful and nice.",1,0,0

When I checked in I did not realize what I was in for, the first night was great until I called for housekeeping. I requested to sleep in and then have housekeeping come later. I did not realize later means 7 hours later.  I called housekeeping to come clean my room at 12 pm they told me they would be there within an hour , when I returned to my room at 5pm I was shocked to see that it wasn't clean. I said alright let me just call again to ask what's going on. When I called I was connected to 6 different people each one transferring me to a new one.  When I finally got connected they told me that someone will be there asap. 40 minutes later nobody. After an hour I went to the front desk and asked for a manager who blew me off and said she will call the supervisor but can't guarantee any times because they are short staffed. Alright I went back to my room to get my keys and head out. I was surprised to see a maid cleaning. I knocked on the door which was open and said this is my room I need to get my keys from my safe. She said this isn't your room you need the key. I said I only have two keys I can give you my id and you can call my last name over the walkie. Oh no I don't have a walkie you have to go back downstairs and get your key. I went downstairs to get my room key and when I came back she said she called security. I thought you didn't have a walkie. What was the point to call security? Plus the fact that your telling me to go back downstairs without being accommodating to me, the hotel guest, is appalling. I went to go speak the manager again and was met with a rolling of the eyes and saying that we don't have enough employees and that we don't need to come complain again about the same thing. When I told her what happened this time she said she would comp our room 50 dollars for food and take off any other charges on the account. I said alright and went back to the room and was met with security who said they need to check my parties id and called them over the Walkie. And then when I said this issue is already resolved I don't need you to check my id when I just went downstairs and spoke with the manager, he then told me I don't appreciate the attitude and that I was rude to the maid and I shouldn't be so rude next time. Sorry, but who is the hotel guest here? I was the one treated rudely. Oh and on top of this when I checked out the room comps that I was promised were not applied to my account and the front desk staff said they can't do anything since the manager isn't coming in until later.",3,0,0

The one bad thing: I wish they would invest in a better ventilation system, because the smoke hung in the air longer here than it did elsewhere, and always smelled kind of gross like cigarettes.  The other nicer casinos didn't have that problem.

Otherwise, I was pleasantly surprised.  The cashiers were really friendly, and the dealers were kind.  We were right smack in the middle of everything, which made for easier walking in heels, and our room was totally not what we expected.  It was huge, for one, and they didn't shirk on any amenities.  Cleaning service was great, too.  The Indigo Lounge doesn't require a super long wait, which is nice, because in Vegas, you feel like you're always waiting in line.",0,0,0

I've stayed here about 3 times (out of 100+ Vegas trips in my life). Each time, I had a pleasant stay, but I didn't spend much time at the hotel. This place is more for the comfort and location.

The parking structure is shared with Paris. Valet is much easier, but self-parking isn't bad. Parking was free before, but parking fees will soon be implemented. The last time I stayed here in July 2016, I used valet - fast and friendly, during both arrival & departure.

Check-in took long! It was about 2am, with maybe 3 guests in line and 2 front desk employees. The process was slow. When it was my turn, I was told that the 2-queen room I booked was not available as it was first come first serve. Since it was late, those rooms were all taken. That didn't make sense to me because I specifically booked it, so it should have been reserved for me. I asked if I get a partial refund, to which the employee responded no because it's the same price. I became upset. She asked if I really need a room with 2 beds, to which I responded yes. She gave me the option of a room with 2 beds, but it was a smoking room. Since I was only staying for less than 5 hours, I agreed.

When we arrived to our room, it seemed to be a newly updated or renovated room that was more spacious and had a mini, narrow balcony with a strip view. The smoking smell wasn't too bad and there was already a humidifier in our room, which made it convenient so we didn't have to call for one in the middle of the night. The bathroom was more spacious than I expected. Initially, my check-in experience wasn't good, but the employee did what she could to accommodate me, which I appreciated.

The price & value of this hotel is good. The location is central, directly across from Bellagio & the fountains. There is a bridge that leads to Bellagio and another that leads to Cromwell. There are some eateries here & the hotel connects to Paris, where you can find more restaurants and activities. Comfort level is pretty good as well. It's not the best hotel, not the worst, but more positive than negative. You won't find a huge party or young crowd here like you'll find at Flamingo or Planet Hollywood, but that's what makes this hotel more comfortable. You can go out and party, get rowdy, but come back to a quieter ""home.",2,1,2

They are located mid-strip, which makes it an ideal location for walking around and seeing most of the other hotels, without wearing yourself out completely.  Check-in took a bit of time, we waited for about 30 minutes in the line while two staff members tried to work through a line of about 25-30 people. When we were second in line to get checked-in they finally had one more staff member start checking others in.

The room was clean and had a decent view of the strip, and like most hotels on the strip it was a bit of a walk from the front door of the hotel to our room since the overall building is huge.

They have a variety of things that you can do within the hotel, aside from the obvious gambling.  They have several restaurants and it's a great feature that they are attached and have a walk-through to the Paris Hotel - which has tons of restaurants and shows of their own.

Check out was much easier than check-in since we just had to sign off on the rapid check out form and drop it in a box by the check-in area. 

Overall: B+
We would stay here again when we go back - no real complaints. Middle of the strip makes it super convenient.",2,1,1

I've been a big advocate given it's location on the strip, reasonable prices, and friendly staff. However, I doubt we will be staying at Bally's again given our last trip. Not only was the service lackluster - the staff seemed miserable, from everyone from the bartenders to the dealers - which made it the opposite of pleasurable for the guests. This is in contrast to past years, so have to assume there was a change in management. Additionally, they got rid of our favorite slot machines!!! (Willy Wonka, Batman & Robin, Gremlins, Monopoly - so we went to other casinos to find them.)  But the biggest reason is that, for the first time, I felt UNSAFE staying at Bally's. 3 times over the weekend I was approached\/harassed by strangers in the Bally's casino, in the early hours of the morning, while playing slot machines:

- Incident #1: approached by 2 black men, one on either side of me, while playing near the Buffalo slots at the wall. One was in his 20s and the other in his 40s. Initially, the younger man asked for a cigarette and thought was just being friendly. But then his partner joined and they were drilling me with questions, until eventually they asked if me or any of my friends wanted to buy drugs. After saying no thank you and them not leaving, I finally cashed my play and walked away. That said, the casino is not that big and I had no idea if they stuck around of not.

- Incident #2: approached by a man of middle-eastern descent in his late 30s\/early 40s by the slots on the upper level; I was playing the Picnic one. He sat down next to me and started asking if I was single. When I showed him my wedding ring, he would not leave and proceeded to ask if I wanted to leave with him. Disgusted, I got up and walked away, but again, he creepily hung around the slots so I just left.

- Incident #3: approached by a white man in his late 50s\/early 60s at the older slots over by the new Buffalo ones. He asked if I'd been having luck, I said no and went back to my game. He was very close to me\/up in my personal space, and said he saw someone win 100k on that machine that morning. I said great, without even looking at him. Then he said something strange like 'why don't you take your money and I'll show you.' I then aggressively said, ""I'm not interested"" and he finally walked away. I was shaken up, and scared he was going to follow me up to my room. My heart was beating so fast.  

In all 3 instances, security was NOWHERE to be found.  It's unfortunate that a place we used to love, and 
started\/ended our nights at, was drastically different this year. I've never before felt unsafe gambling on my own in Bally's, after my husband went upstairs to bed.  Not only will I never do that again in Bally's, but is doubtful we'll ever stay there again.",4,5,1

We paid the extra $50 to get upgraded to a suite and were excited until we got to the room. Yea it was big, but it was just floor space between the bed and the TV. And the room itself looked really old and awkward with the railings separating the bedroom and the bathroom area.

While we were unpacking and exploring a little bit, we heard lots of noises from the next room in addition to doors banging shut. My bf called the front desk to ask to get moved to another room and after some waiting, negotiating, and checking, we got moved to the North Tower for a standard room on the Diamond floor. Sweet!

All the staff was wonderful, from the bellhops to checking in to booking my airport shuttle for me...everyone was super helpful and sweet to deal with, and get five stars. 

The negatives: No coffee maker (or fridge) in the room. You have to get room service or go down to the coffee shop across from check in for coffee. And even then a regular coffee or tea is $3.45. The room pretty much only comes with water glasses. There isn't even conditioner, just 'conditioning shampoo'. Not the same for us long-locked ladies. The bathroom is all in one - the sink, toilet, and tub are all behind one closed door. So if you are sharing a room make sure you don't mind sharing the bathroom as well. There is a casino, but it is pretty small, loud, and smoky. I would rather play elsewhere. There is a small gym but you have to walk through a mini strip mall in the basement to get there.

Get a room in the North Tower as they have been refurbished and are nicer.  SEA Thai Experience downstairs is actually really good food, although pricey for what it is.  The tequila bar is open 24, great for stumbling in at 5 in the morning and getting $2 tacos!

We would come to Vegas quite often in the past, but unfortunately this year has been so hectic, we were only able to do one trip thus far, We gamble a lot when in Vegas so we always get discounts offered to us by different hotels regularly. We decided to go with Ballys because its right in the center of the strip and you can't really go wrong with any Caesars Palace affiliated hotel right ? Wong !!!!!
This was an absolutely horrific experience. From the moment we checked in to the second we decided to leave I cannot express how utterly upset and disgusted I am with my experience at this hotel. 
First off, when we checked in and were walked up to our rooms by the bell hop, which we thought was nice, but as soon as we unlocked our room, it felt like we walked into a sauna. Our bell hop Immediately made the comment that he would adjust the temperature as he was feeling extremely hot as well ,but as soon as he looked at the thermostat he turned to me and my husband and said its set to 60 degrees. We tipped him and as soon as he left I turned the thermostat to the absolute lowest it would go, and it had the option to go into the high 40's.
  I after that I immediately started to unpack and get ready for the evening as we had reservations for dinner a few hours later. The shower head was not working properly as water was spraying everywhere. I unfortunately had to keep the water pressure very low which made my shower take much longer just to avoid making a mess in the entire bathroom with water being sprayed just about everywhere in every direction. 2 hours later our room was no where close to even feeling cool, let alone cold.  We contacted the front desk and told them we genuinely think  something is wrong with the Air Conditioning in our room, to which they said they would send up an engineer. We told them we were on a time crunch and we needed to leave to make our reservation to which they responded there was nothing they could no unless an engineer takes a look at the Air conditioning unit. We ended up having to wait for the engineer to come up , making us late for our reservation.  After the engineer was done with our room we had to immediately leave, but was hoping that our room would be nice and cool when we got back from the night. WRONG !!!! When we got back to our room it was still extremely warm. We called the front desk and told them that our  room was way too hot to spend the night in and we needed to switch rooms to which they responded they did not have any more rooms to switch us to for free but we had the option to upgrade to a suite for a charge. This is when I started getting very upset,  Not only are the employees here not being accommodating, but they are trying to charge us after they inconvenience us and not give us what we paid for. My husband and I decided there was very little we could do and then noticed that  it was past 1:30 am.  We decided to go to our friend's hotel room who was staying at the Aria and crash with him. The next day when we returned to our room it was still extremely hot and the air conditioner was set to the high 40's. At this point we knew we could not stand it any longer and called the front desk. My husband told them that we wanted to check out and we were going to call our credit card company and inform them that Ballys was trying to wrongfully charge us. This finally got the front desks attention. The said they would move us to another room free of charge, but alas that room was really not any better. The safe did not work and we did not want to walk around the strip with a large chunk of cash on us but there was nothing we could do. Then we noticed that the light in the bathroom did not work. We had to call the front desk another 3 times so we could get help getting the light fixed. Had we have had any clue what kind of house of horrors this hotel would end up being we would have paid the extra money and stayed anywhere else. Like I've said before, we have been to Vegas many times in the past and have never had such a horrific experience as we did at Ballys. This hotels executes UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACITICES and I can honestly say it was the low point of our vacation. Knowing we had to sleep and wake up in that hotel, start and end the day in that hotel just ruined our trip.

I stay at Bally's for a week and got to say it was good. If you looking for a hotel on the strip that near everything and don't want to pay a arm or a leg for it then stay at Bally's. Services was excellent and everything was close by. When I got there I ask if I could get a two queen bed instead of one and they upgrade me to the North tower deluxe room it was spacious, nice, and clean, and updated. No extra charge. The only draw by at that time was there was no refrigerator or microwave, but hey it Vegas I was going to eat out most of the time anyways and my friend gave me her cooler to keep all the drinks cold. Anyways if you need a refrigerator it $10 a night if you wanted to know. I pay about $30 something a night, Sunday to Saturday. I had a promotion code I got off the Internet. Also on the second day the house keeping staff notice a little wet spot on the carpet and got this air blower in the room when I came back they left me a message to call the front desk. When I called they ask if I was ok if they upgrade me to the honeymoon suite with a jacuzzi  and the view of the strip and the dance fountain show. It was nice got to say Bally's is a good hotel if you looking for a nice clean place to sleep on the strip and the price is just right. It also connected to Paris and in walking distance to everything. There pool isn't the greatest pool thought, but I went to other pools but for the price and everything I think it great. Oh yeah the Wi fi isn't free you have to pay for it so that might be a draw back for some.",0,0,0

I chose to stay here on the butt end of one of my trips to Vegas where the first half I rented out a fabulous 5 bed house for a girls trip surprise for my BFF and the last half I was attending a conference at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The conference had a special for Bally's and since I was alone and didn't need to leave the area (one of the girls rented a car for the first half of my trip when we had the house) Bally's seemed to be a reasonable choice. There's a monorail that stops at Bally's that takes you to the convention center. 

The check in line was horrendous! I stood in line for at least 40 minutes. My eyes got irritated from all the smoke in the air. When I got to the desk the agent was very pleasant, gave me a ticket to a free show at the hotel and hooked me up with a high floor with a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower right outside my window and the Bellagio fountains. I was in the newer Jubilee Tower. 

The room was clean and modern and I could see all the way down the strip and hear the music for the Bellagio fountain display as my nightly entertainment. Although my room was non smoking, the hotel is smoky that it didn't matter. I could smell smoke all the way down the halls and even a bit in the room. 

I didn't eat anything at Bally's, but I did eat at several of the places on the way to the monorail and in the connector mall area to Paris. All mediocre food. I have to say it is cool that you can get to Paris without going outside. 

Bally's is on the strip so it's easy to get everywhere from there.

I'm a bit spoiled since I've stayed at the Aria which is much newer and an experience all its own. Again, Bally's isn't bad, but I wouldn't stay there again due to the smoke.",9,2,3

Bally's is a respectable hotel located right in the heart of some of the biggest hotels in Las Vegas (Caesars Palace, Bellagio, Mirage, Paris, etc.).  The one advantage that Bally's has is that it is more reasonable when it comes to room rates.

While the room decor is your standard hotel room with no frills (some Las Vegas hotel rooms have character; not Bally's), the beds are comfortable, the linens are nice, and everything is clean.

The casino floor is decent.  They have a small number of gaming tables so they are often packed.

Last month I stayed at the Flamingo. A couple of weeks after I came back I checked my Total Rewards account. I noticed that I was eligible to comp a free room at Bally's. I wasn't planning to go back to Vegas anytime soon however I had to redeem my Asia Miles frequent flyer miles, which I earned 4 years ago when I went to South Africa for the World Cup, by the end of April. Because of those two factors I decided to go back to Vegas again. 

At Bally's I stayed for 4 free nights. I was very happy with my room at the Indigo Tower. The room was spacious compared to most standard rooms. I had a lot of space on the left side of the bed. On the left side of the bed was a couch and a small coffee table. This was an ideal room for a free vacation. The room was clean and there was no cockroaches as I've read from other reviews. This room felt I was the king. With all the amenities and the room free of charge (with the of the resort fees) why didn't I give a perfect 5 star rating? First even though the room was spacious the wall was close to the right side of the bed. The best hotel room I ever stayed at was the Roman Tower at Caesars Palace. That room was spacious but also was equally spaced on both sides of the bed; a wall wasn't closed to either side of the bed. Second like the Flamingo last month the swimming pool was closed. Since the season is late winter\/ early spring I wanted to relax and swim in the pool. Other than those two issues the room at the Indigo Tower at Bally's is a great room if you're eligible to comp it.",6,1,2

Almost reminded me of American Horror story hotel where the dead people hide in the mattresses.
The walls were falling apart, it looked like someone chewed on the corner of one. The room we were in could definitely use some TLC. Oh and we were on the 5th floor in the indigo tower. The only positive thing I will say is I liked being able to check in and out online to avoid lines.",0,1,0

There were a few empty blackjack tables...as we walked by, I took a look to see what the minimum bet was:  $10.  The floor manager urged us to play.  I told him I'd play if he changed the minimum bet to $5, and he did~!  That was kind of nice of him :)

Bally's is not one of the higher end hotels on the strip, but it is clean, is centrally located and has nice views and a pretty pool area (James said the pool at the Paris hotel is better with afternoon sun, and as a Bally's customer you are welcome to use that too) I will say that the drinks at the pool are EXPENSIVE, one margarita was $14!

Our floor was also very quiet and you didn't hear too much of the hussle and bussle of the outside Vegas world. Complimentary WiFi, up to 2 devices a day, which worked really well!

My only complaint, however, is that our room  did smell like cigarettes! If not our room, it must have been the other guests room smoking or something. It was tolerable but that was the only part I didn't like about my stay. 

Bally's is in a great location, wedged between Paris\/Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops and Cromwell\/Flamingo and right across Caesars! I loved that I could comfortably walk around to high traffic areas of the strip without having to take too many cabs.

I am not a hotel snob by any means. However, when I am paying to stay a hotel on the strip, I do expect better than a Howard Johnson, and I can say with all honesty that I have stayed at Ho Jo's that were far superior to this place. Little things like shampoo and conditioner and a bed that doesn't cave in the middle (and isn't a Murphy bed) would have been nice. Oh, and towels without stains on them would be nice also. I was also disappointed by the staff. The woman at the front desk was fairly miserable and didn't say more than 5 words to us upon check-in and then after checking out we realized the room was put under the wrong name, which was weird. When we realized our bed caved in the middle, we requested a new room (which I have never done before at any hotel, ever) and they told us they could switch us but the bed would be exactly the same. Ummm, ok, never mind then? They also told us we could switch to a suite which would cost $100 more a night, but if I was going to pay that much more, I would have just stayed at a nicer hotel. Another con is that it is a far walk to the pool. Usually when you get off the elevator on the pool floor of a hotel you are right there, but here you have to walk through the trenches of the basement. Be forewarned ladies (and some gents), and make sure to cover up because there is a long way to go while you while get lots of creepy stares by lots of creepy men.

But there are some pros I need to mention. The location is perfect, right in the middle of the strip and at one of the monorail stops. It has a walk through to Paris, which is where we ended up spending most of our time. Also, although the pool is a pain to get to, I liked the environment of the pool, at least on the weekdays while I was there. It was an older crowd and I know a lot of people wouldn't like that, but I liked that it was laid back and fairly quiet because I wanted to relax and not deal with a bunch of rowdy drunks making out all over the place. I understand this could be a pro or con depending on your personality.

Bottom line - I would not stay here again and probably would shell out a little extra next time I'm in Vegas.",0,0,0

We later received email offer to upgrade to the North tower for $10 per night but we decided to stay put since it really wasn't a big deal to be in old rooms.  My sister and three of her (adult) kids all got rooms in the North tower within having to pay for an upgrade, they simply got lucky!  She loved her room.

I have to preface the review with, I am a VERY light sleeper and somewhat of an insomniac.  Anyway...first off, the room numbering system is bizarre.  Our rooms were 7033, 7036-7038 which I think is on the 20th floor, not sure.  The carpeting in the hallway is very old and stretched out so there are lumps along the way.  My brother got two connecting rooms for his son & family which overlooked Bills Gambling Hall and a portion of the Bellagio fountains.  The room my mom and I got was #7033, which had a view of the Paris hotel, pool and Eiffel tower.  We had a view of about 60% of the Bellagio fountains which was nice!  The rooms were thread worn with furniture of cheapo fake walnut from the 70's-80's.  The bed was a stiff but hey, the TV worked, the bathrooms were clean and there was plenty of hot water!  The bath products were Gilchrist & Soames of London but the box stated ""Made in China"", so don't know what's up with that. In any case the soap was very drying and the lotion was very thin.  Thank goodness we both brought our own bath products!  There were three lamps in the room.  One on the center bed-stand, one on the dresser which actually turned on with the hall light switch.  The one at the table near the window was dim, like 40\/60 watt bulb and could not be used for reading.  The bath room lighting was nice and bright but not comfortable to have to stand there to apply makeup.  The shower was great, nice a hot!  I actually asked housekeeping for three bath mats the first day and they did so only that day, I didn't want to keep asking so for the rest of the time I used two towels.  (I don't like standing on cold tile while at the sink or toilet)

Now, the bad part.  On Wednesday and Friday nights there is some sort of event under the Eiffel tower which I did not know about.  The music was SO incredibly loud until around 3:30 a.m.!!!!  Even with the a\/c fan and my sound machine on it's loudest I could clearly hear the music.  I could even feel the vibrations!  My brother, whose room was across the hall from ours said HE even heard the music and wondered where is was coming from because he couldn't see anything going on from his window!  So needless to say, I didn't fall asleep until around 4 a.m.  Plus the uncomfortable bed didn't help any since I tossed and turned, never being able to get comfortable! 

Overall, I liked that it had easy access to the Paris hotel.  I actually liked the casino and the staff was very nice and helpful.  I really didn't mind the old and ugly furnishings of the South tower, but the noise level in our particular room was unbelievable!  I wouldn't stay there again.",1,1,1

First of all, we had a basic room for $40 a night. That is the cheapest I've ever paid for a nice hotel. This isn't going to be your fancy overpriced hotel, but honestly, for $40, it's worth it rather than paying $200+ a night. When you're in Vegas, you stay out most of the time. If you plan on staying indoors, I'm sure there are plenty of non casino hotels that are better for that kind of experience. 

Our bathroom was remodeled, study desk was a nice perk, and our sofa and bed were both petty and comfortable. Since it's connected to Paris and smack in the middle of the strip, le boyfriend and I had a lot of fun. 

We had up to $30 complimentary room service, which was delicious and service was great. We left our bags on our last day to go off and travel, which was really convenient.

Located in the middle of the strip, Bally's is connected to Paris and right across from Bellagio (which is connected to Ceasar's Palace) which was pretty awesome.  

On another note, they have a kiosk right by the front desk that sells pastries and drinks.  I had the red velvet cupcake (about $4) and it was THE best red velvet cupcake I have ever had!

The place might be a bit dated but it gets crowded.  We checked in on a Tuesday around 3:30 - got handed a pretty decent coupon book and an option to upgrade to a suite in the North Tower for $20 more per night.  I was told the North Tower was recently renovated but the South Tower had the better view...Really, how much time do you stay in your room in Vegas?  We saved some money, picked the South Tower and had a view of Paris, The Paris Pool, and the Bellagio fountain show.

Yes, the room might need some updating - the drawers in the furniture didn't all open, some of the outlets in the room didn't work, one of the lamps didn't work but the bathroom was big, the water pressure was great, and the beds were decent and I had 3 pillows on my queen size bed.

My sister is a PD dialysis patient. What that consists of is manually performing 4-5 fill-and-drain exchanges of liquid medication per day. Medication for traveling long distance must be shipped on site. Prior to making reservations we made all the arrangements for having her medication shipped to Ballys. Everything was set, we called a couple times to ensure packages had arrived and were assured everything had been received. They even told us that they had received medication for dialysis patients in the past. When checking in we were told that the shipping department is open from 7AM-7PM (we arrived at 9PM) and they couldn't retrieve the packages since shipping dept was closed. We explained to the clerk that her medication could not wait until 7AM and that it would have been nice to know that the shipping department closed at a certain time. The clerk called her manager DARRYL to see if he could help. We then explained the whole situation to the manager, he proceeded to tell us that the shipping dept was closed and the actual department is located at Paris Casino right next door and that he could not do anything for us. I kept telling the manager that she needs her medication as soon as possible. We told him it can be life threatening if she waits too long without it. The manager with no regard proceeds to tell us that he cannot do anything about it and that she should have brought her own medication with her. We told him that her medication isn't a pill of some sort to simply throw in a bag, they are liquids that cannot be taken on a plane and must be shipped. The manager proceeded to argue with me back and forth as if he did not care nor tried to find a resolution. What kind of a manager argues with a customer!??? Especially when the circumstances are life threatening. Eventually the clerk that checked us in decided to give us the contact number for Paris Casino and told us to call them to see if they could help in anyway. We ended up walking over to Paris casino, explained the situation, with no hesitation their clerk called security over to retrieve the packages. Thank god! I could not believe how lazy, rude and unhelpful Bally's manager Darryl was!? DOUCHE BAG! Ruined the beginning of our trip. When all he had to do is make a call or walk over to Paris Casino. A**H*LE!

Rooms - We had 5 groups with us. The clerk was able to give us all rooms on the same floor which was convenient. 2\/5 rooms had great views of the LINQ's High Roller Ferris wheel. 4\/5 rooms had a wet carpet smell to it. We had to buy our own water to brush our teeth, the water had a nasty sewer smell to it. Wish they had a microwave. 

Does anyone know where I can call Ballys corporate office about their manager?

The location is great.  It's right in the center of the action with very easy access to Paris, the Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, the Bellagio and several places on the center of the strip.  It was nice to see the Bellagio water fountain show from our room.

The casino has a 24-hour bar\/ restaurant that serves $2 beer and margaritas all night.  Holla.  But beware of the nachos-- I saw 4 big grown ass men could NOT finish the plate!

Service was not so amazing.  Room-service platters were left out in the hall for more than 24 hours.  The hall became littered with glasses and napkins by Saturday.  

Our room was large, but 2 of the lamps didn't work and there was no vent in the bathroom.  These are small things, but show a bit of disregard for proper hotel etiquette.  It also DIDN'T HAVE A COFFEEPOT.  What the...?  Motel 6 gives you coffee.  This is something I didn't understand.

Booked a Jubilee king room with a strip view. Specifically asked for a quiet room away from the elevator. I reminded person at check-in I wanted a quiet room. The room was not quiet by any means. You could hear the music from the nightclubs going until 4am. Went downstairs to complain. Turns out Jubilee rooms facing the strip or facing Cromwell are notorious for not being quiet rooms! Why wasn't I told at check-in?

So we switched from the Jubilee tower to the Indigo tower. Rooms are same size but not updated (or even very clean for that matter). Huge difference in quality and cleanliness. I refused to walk around the room in bare feet. The a\/c vent in the bathroom was caked in dust. Worse yet was that after the hassle of changing rooms and moving to much lesser quality room, we weren't given a credit or refund for downgrading the room. Staff didn't really care.

They emailed several times before our trip offering a discounted upgrade.  We didn't take it but it was a nice option.  The best part about booking directly through Caesars instead of a discount site was the online check in.  They send you a email in the morning you click a link, answer a few questions and you are checked in.  They text you when your room is ready and you go to a separate check in line to pick up your keys.  It was so easy and fast.  The room was nice.  No complaints there.

Never in my widest dreams had it ever occurred to me to stay at Bally's. We have walked through the casino many a time, stayed at Paris at least twice (they are connected) but always thought maybe the rooms would be too small, too dated. I had an opportunity this past trip to take advantage of a complimentary room for 2 nights at Bally's. Why not? Tis true, you cannot beat the location and being central to the action is prime when you are only in town generally for a few days. You want to have access to the best shopping and the best restaurants right? I am glad my personal reservations did not get in the way of me booking this fab hotel. It was clean and more spacious than many a fancy-pants Vegas room I have stayed in. I was taken a bit aback by the line-up to check in but I have encountered that before at other locations so we kept our cool. The other downside like any other Vegas hotel\/casino is the cigarette smoke. In Bally's it hits you as soon as you walk in to the hotel but I think over the years, the ventilation system has improved, even if only slightly. Staff at the front desk was curt and to the point, did not care much about our reservation preference for a king bed and we ended up with 2 queens but hey - the place was busy and the room was free. We were lucky at the time of booking that the resort fee had not come into effect yet - now I believe one has to pay to stay, per day. (pool, use of phone etc like every other Vegas hotel)
The elevators were quick, the casino has a decent layout and there are dining choices but not too many for late-night. (run over to Paris and grab a slice of wood-fired pizza!)
The room itself as mentioned was spacious as was the washroom. Decent mattress, quiet neighbours and good water pressure in the shower made for a decent overall stay. When you check out in the AM, you can get a nice cup of coffee next to the reception for $4. (Yikes, but the room does not have a coffee maker at all which is a bit of a bummer and I almost took off another point for this)
We walked down to the pool one day which was open and had a nice, quiet atmosphere.
Free valet which was great as we had a rental car but be prepared to wait for your car. No call-ahead so in line you go and hope for the best.

I stayed there Sep 17-20th 2015. Because the rooms were supposed to be comped, I thought I would get one of the newer rooms like the pictures on the internet. I even checked in wayyyyy early, about 9Am. I still got one of the older rooms that are from the 80's. 

The beds are not the softer, comfortable ones like most of the newer rooms in Vegas, they are the older spring type mattress' that give you a back ache when you wake up. Same with the pillows. 

But what is really shameful and disturbing is the daily $28 that Bally's charged for a complimentary room. this is supposed to be for a very weak and slow, 5MBP, internet connection, pool and workout room. The price does not allow you to go into the nicer spa and use the steam bath or sauna. This is ridiculous. I could not beleive how cheap this company is. They give you 1980's rooms. 2000's internet speed and a pool full of pee and charge you $28 for it. 

I sure hope Caesars Entertainment sells this property soon to someone that acutally cares about their guest. 

And one last thing. Don't even get me started at how bad the payouts are on Video Poker. Not only do they charge you over the top rates on daily resort fees, but they don't even want to play fair and give you a fair shot at a game where they already have a huge edge.

Meanwhile the valet guys were telling him he needed to move faster and that this ""wasn't a parking area"". It was obvious that he was dealing with a scared geriatric dog. Then one of the guys  proceed to say to him ""you better be giving us a nice tip taking up all this space. You know we live on tips right?"" Again valet was not busy...they obviously had enough time to harass my boyfriend. Boyfriend didn't have any cash on him but said he would come back. One of the valet guys then proceeds to tell my boyfriend that he better come back with a good tip because the car we were driving was expensive. I went down to luggage desk and told the guy there, who was super nice what had happened and he went to get his manager Cal. Cal listened to what happened and said he would look into it. He was understanding and genuinely nice. However didn't offer any compensation for the harassment. Otherwise hotel is fine for the price, however harassing people for tips is unprofessional and we won't be staying at this hotel again.",0,0,0

I guess I accidentally clicked that I need a room with 2 beds, because when I went to ckeck in, they told me there were no more of those rooms available. Before I could even tell them that it wasn't going to be a problem, they offered to upgrade us to a suite at no extra charge! Of course we took the deal! The suites are pretty awesome for such an old hotel. Two separate full sized closets, two sinks, a separate toilet room and even a bidet! There was also a nice, large jacuzzi tub right in the middle of the room and it was cool to sit in there with a cocktail and look out on the strip. The casino was kinda boring, but the location of the hotel is so central, you can just walk to one of the better ones in 5 minutes.

I stayed at Bally's on business this past weekend, from Saturday to Monday. I knew I'd be in the Jubilee Tower, and that the rooms were updated, but the rooms ended up being GORGEOUS. Very much approve.

PRO's:
-Location on the Strip - you're right in the middle of everything. They now have their Grand Bazaar shops too, so you have some shops and restaurants right there - Wahlburgers is there and they're building a Giordano's, too. There's also a CVS right next door. 
-THE UPDATED ROOMS. These were super, super nice. They're just as large as the older rooms they used to have, but very shiny\/new. (small ""con"": there's only a shower, and no bathtub ... but it's a walk-in shower, so I can't really complain)
-The casino: Bally's to me has never really had a theme, except maybe ""old-school Vegas,"" but I like that the casino isn't huge and is easily walkable. I will say I did more gambling at Paris next door than Bally's though, they had a larger slots selection.

CON's:
-Sounds strange to say this but ... price? My bill was about $400 for two nights, including their new fancyshmancy resort fee (anyone remember when it was just Mirage and places like that which had resort fees?), which I guess includes WiFi and ... other stuff? Pool privileges? Not sure. Last time I stayed at Bally's we paid like $230 for 4 nights, with tax, according to my review, which is about $55\/night. 
(granted, this was for two weekend nights, but still - it was about $200 per night including the resort fee)
-My room was the very last room at the end of a long hallway (room #6040) and it took FOREVER to walk back and forth. I did too much walking Sunday night so I literally limped back to Bally's, and then had that long hallway to walk down. Not fun. 

That being said, I was totally impressed by the renovations, so I would definitely stay here again.",6,1,1

This trip I stayed in the Jubilee Tower in 5719. While all the elevators appeared to be working this time, the redecorated room was still very average. The carpet was clean but the walls in the bathroom needed washing. The corner of the bathroom behind the vanity actually had a pile of debris. There was a hole in the comforter on one bed. It was a annoying that there was only one electric outlet on the base of the lamp on the nightstand between the beds. They also added a power station on the desk area that had two plugs but everyone I know likes to have their phone charging next to the bed while they sleep. Two beds should equal two plugs!  Also, there was only one sink in the bathroom - FIRST WORLD PROBLEM - two beds should equal two sinks!
All of that pales in comparison to the noise issue. The first night, at about 1:15 am, we were woken up by 2 huge city trucks below our window. They had set up spotlights and seemed to be doing some very loud sewer work. I called the front desk to let them know this was disturbing us and Sheila told me that it usually lasts till 5 am and she could send up ear plugs. I can't use ear plugs so I had to just listen to the racket all night. I did talk to a manager, Lupe, who did make it right (read as - comped our ""resort fee""). Then, on Wednesday night we got to listen to the loud music and partying from the  night club at Paris. That went until about 4:00 am. I WILL NOT be talked in to staying there again, no matter where my friends are staying.
My big suggestion, if you want to take advantage of the great location of Bally's, is to stay in the Indigo tower. The view from the Jubilee Tower isn't worth the noise.

I was checked in quick and easy given keys and given instructions as to where our room was. 
I assume we stayed at the north side. We had a slight view of the strip mostly view of the Bellagio n Paris.
The rooms were  modern, upgraded, roomy. 
Beds were so comfy. A\/C worked perfectly, especially since it was 110 degrees out there, (Yikes). Bathroom had only one sink but it was also upgraded with tile floors and marble counter tops. It even had a vanity mirror that slides right out, ( awesome ). 
Parking was a breeze. We found a parking space fairly  close on all 3 days we were there. 
Check out was a breeze, we stood in a short line at 11 am and we were at the front of the line in no time. I was given another opportunity to check out via email or text  but since we changed payment method we had to speak to a service rep.

For the price, it's not a bad hotel with a solid location on the strip. Just make sure you request the North Tower (newer one). I stayed in the South Tower suite once and it was okay. The furniture was pretty old but the fact that I paid for a regular room and got a room 4 times the size with a bar, millions of couches, and a few TV's, I really could not complain.

Only 1 somewhat bad experience when I requested a non-smoking room and got a smoking room. Non-smoking should not be REQUEST. It should be standard. A king or 2 queen beds is a request. I can live with not sleeping with my girlfriend but I can't live with my face shoved in a pillow that smells like years of nicotine!

I love the Grand Suite. I've stayed at places like the Signature Suites at MGM and yes, the rooms are much nicer and modern looking there, but the Grand Suite here is HUGE. HUMONGOUS. CELEBRITY STATUS. So much floor space and an amazing view of Paris & the Bellagio fountains! If you're going with a group of college kids, this suite definitely beats trying to cram into the luxury suites elsewhere!

Only downside is that everything here is a little plain -- not so much of the glitzy Vegas glam you might find at the Cosmopolitan! This place is definitely CLEAN (don't be fooled by the Best Western-eqsue decor) but just in need of a little update.

Every time we walk from our room to get a cab we always get a few stares too. I always feel like one of the youngest ones here and this is definitely not the place for the ""young & hip"" scene! BUT the price is great & the location is AMAZING. Main exit gets you right on the strip & you're in total walking distance to Marquee!

Check your Total Rewards hotel rates right up until the night you're going to stay. The prices tend to drop just before, and if you call the hotel they can adjust the price for you!

Staff is super friendly. Make sure you tip! :)

AND FINALLY... If you come back from a night of clubbing with your friends, you MUST check out the Mexican restaurant (open 24\/7) nearby the casino and get the super nachos!!! They're so big I bet not even 3 drunk & hungry guys can finish them! Show your total rewards card and you get a discount!",7,2,2

Only thing is that the room didn't seem extremely clean.

It clearly states on the website that upon arrival there will be pet bowls and a pet treat to welcome our pet. We received none of those. To top it off the two people we asked about the area to walk our dog in could not give us any information. When we were able to find the area it was a very small and not clean area for the dog to relieve himself. 

The pet room we stayed in had a bad smell to it and wasnt cleaned properly. I would expect for the price we paid to stay there that the rooms would be properly maintained.

It was upon check-in that fears started to subside regarding regrets on not booking a ""nicer"" hotel like Caesar's for our monthly staycation.   

Diamond VIP valet service lane made parking quick and easy.   Diamond VIP check-in helped limit the time spent in line and in turn gave more time for relaxing.  I asked for the Jubilee tower specifically and we received a 2 queen-bed room with a view overlooking the Grand Bazaar Shoppes.   

The Jubilee towers were more recently renovated and provide much closer access to the Strip and the Bazaar shops where a plethora of stores and food stops await. 

The room itself was very spacious.   As a matter of fact, they may be bigger than the standard rooms at Caesars.   Basic amenities come included; refrigerator at no extra charge.   Sofa\/love seats, as well as a desk join the far side of the room and meet with a large sized window and curtains to give spectacular views of the LinQ ferris wheel and the Strip.  

The hotel itself is centered in the middle of the Strip.  A CVS is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel which makes last minute shopping for toiletries, cheap munchies, or even liquor a very simple task.   The hotel is also connected via inside walkway to Paris hotel to allow for even more dining and entertainment options. 

As you walk towards the back of the casino though, the age if the casino shows through past the glimmer of the lights and blaring casino sounds.    The Bally's spa is much outdated providing a very simplistic spa experience.   Walking to the sports book or the pool all the way to the back of the casino and one floor below the casino just seems more of a hassle than it need be.   If you make it that far, you will also find a limited food court with a subway, sbarro, johnny rockets, and an asian joint.

3. Valet not available - i'm no stranger to doing valet at a hotel i'm not staying at but shouldn't you reserve at least a few for the actual guests staying here?

On the inside, you'll find a comfortable and reasonably priced resort.  I stayed here during a recent business trip in a renovated North Tower room.

From what I gather, the South Tower rooms, while cheaper, are not as nice as the North Tower rooms.  

Every morning while walking to the elevators the cleaning staff would great me with an unsolicited ""Have a great day!"" or a ""Good morning!""  That's a nice touch.

For meals, you have a few options. A cheap breakfast on the strip can be hard to find.  At Bally's for about $15\/person you can get a solid breakfast buffet and a cup of coffee. Maybe it was because I was there for a convention, but expect lines if you're not there by 8AM.

I didn't really sample the rest of the restaurants, save for the Mexican place late on a Saturday night.  It was packed, and the service was a tad slow, but that was expected.  The food was reasonably priced, and while not stellar, satisfied my weary traveler empty stomach.

Bally's is a short walk to the monorail, and from there it's a short ride to the Convention Center or any other place on the strip you'd like to go.  Fares are reasonable and better than walking or driving.

Self parking is shared for Paris and Bally's and was free earlier this year, but I guess every hotel charges now. Dodged that bullet; def a star just for that. Kind of a long walk from the parking lot (that's more towards Paris) to the front desk. Definitely a lot of places to dine and shop now that they've opened up that cute outdoor food court\/shopping area out front. Short walk to Drai's nightclub across the street at the Cromwell, so that's a plus for you party animals. 

Check-In:
Quick and easy. Staff at front desk was super friendly and efficient. I think they actually let us check in an hour earlier. A star for them. Thanks guys for the welcoming smiles. 

Room:
A bit outdated, but the room was clean and pretty spacious. We had a double queen, yet still had plenty of room in the corner near the window to add a twin sized cot for an extra guest. The cot was just as comfy as the beds in the room. Decent closet space and huge desk, but no refrigerator to keep leftovers in or anything. Big plus was the great view of the Linq high roller outside our window. Restroom was clean, water pressure was solid. Def a star for the view and comfy beds. 

Service:
Freakin' extra star for the amazing service we received from one of the bellmen. He brought us our extra cot about 15 min into us getting to our room. Tipped him a few bucks and chatted him up a bit; told him we were celebrating our anniversary and our cousin's 21st birthday. Next thing we know, we get a knock on the door and the same dude brings us a bottle of champagne to celebrate with. Now that's service. Can't remember his name, but I wouldn't post it anyway to get him in trouble cuz I'm not sure they're allowed to do that LOL. Eff it, the guy was amazing. He made our weekend. 

Only bummer was that the indoor food court downstairs was kind of a hike. I felt like I walked a mile trying to get late night drunk people food after the club lol. Easy checkout. Casino wasn't too giving though lol. Wish there were more tables to play on, specifically 3 card poker haha. 

Price was a little steep for the quality of the room, but it was booked last minute and our stay was a couple weeks after two major holidays (Christmas and NYE). Buuuut, I would definitely stay here again, especially when the rates are under $50 during slow season. Location is a sweet spot too since it's close to Bellagio and Caesars. Thanks, Bally's!",2,0,1

This was my mom's first trip to Vegas and I wanted it to be memorable. I went back and forth about upgrading to the newer suites when I realized our room was on the ""older and outdated"" side. However, when my mom opened the door and was pleased with our room even the ""ugly"" parking lot view I sighed a huge sigh of relief. Now don't get me wrong, the room was old skool and outdated. Thankfully, it didn't smell old and stale. However, it was clean, spacious and had all of the basic necessities. We didn't see any stains or crazy things to request a room change. If you're looking for modern style, this room wasn't for you, lol. 

The staff in Ballys were very cool. The hotel\/casino is huge and attached to the Paris hotel\/casino which was gorgeous. I hit the jackpot for $70 on one of the 5 cent machines and stopped playing. My mom won and loss throughout our stay but she had a great time. I was happy that she felt safe and comfortable to go and come from our room to the casinos on her own, especially at night.

They have several restaurants to choose from, high end to fast food. They had a show that you could see but we already had tickets to another show.

I chose Ballys because of the location which was right in the middle of the strip. I didn't want my mom to have to walk too far back to our hotel. It didn't matter because she still said I walked her too much and she just wanted to gamble.

Overall unless you're on your honeymoon or just plan on spending more time in the room, I would pay extra for the upgrade. If you're just looking for a nice, clean and convenient place to sleep you can't go wrong with Ballys.",11,2,9

I'm going to talk about my experience in the older building...Talk about ghetto! This Vegas lodging would have been acceptable if it had been off the strip. The problem is, Bally's is located ON the strip. Therefore, I expect a bit of decency.  I'm not asking for anything extremely extravagant, but at least something better than your average motel!  

The carpet looks like it hasn't been replaced since the 80s and the furniture is older than a dresser from the 1970s (the type that's covered with fake wood laminate). The pillows were flat and the beds were not even covered with a comforter.  I would NOT sleep on that carpet that looks like it's infection-ridden.  I'm glad we only stayed in that room for one day!

As for the casino, I felt that there was a sleezy vibe to the entire place.  If you're going to Bally's make sure you get to stay in the newer building.

The south tower is no good. We stayed here one of the four nights before we gave in, went down stairs to the lobby and upgraded to the North tower. The North tower was nice and has all the basics you need to get a restful night of sleep. 

Keep in mind that you shouldn't expect Bally's to look like the new Cosmo hotel or Aria, or any of the other big names in Vegas. Bally's is nice because the crowd is not as crazy, the location on the strip is great, and you get a good price for a room.  By staying here you can spend the money you saved on ... well... it's Vegas, you take your pick!

The room was very spacious for just one person. My room has a single king-size bed, which I found to be comfortable. The room had alot of mirrors, which I loved. I have to agree with a prior reviewer- that the hotel is quite cold. My room was chilly also. There was a thermostat in my room, but I didnt know how to use it. My friend finally told me, but by then it was leaving time.
 
All the elevators were working and I never had to wait long for them. 

The front desk staff was pleasant when I dealt with them for checking in & out.

The location of the hotel is perfect for the Strip. Its right near all the major areas or within reasonable walking distance.
 
I was there to celebrate a friends birthday and all of us were spread around in different hotels- depending on what each could afford.

Check In lines can be long but I was lucky enough to find a time where there was only a few people in the queue.

Self parking is in the shared parking garage with Paris and isn't too far of a walk. I found the parking garage here had ample room and I never had to park far away from the lifts no matter what time I returned to the hotel.

Ballys hasn't been known for it's dining options but the reinvented BLT Steak is pretty impressive and b popular given it's association with Gordon Ramsay and Hells Kitchen. This is an indulgent steak meal.

I expressed dissatisfaction with my room, and the staff presented no options whatsoever, not even for an additional fee, as though this were the only room available in the entire hotel. 

The room itself was at about the level of a Days Inn with nothing remotely chic, modern or luxurious to be found.  Mustard and brown patterned industrial carpet adorns the floor, and the wallpaper and drapes are also mustard colored.  The comforters are a thin polyester fill.  The headboard is glued to the wall, and all lighting comes from cheap table lamps.  The TV and hutch are antiquated.  There is no fridge or coffeemaker in the room, just a plastic icebucket.  Other than granite tiling on the floor and walls of the bathroom, its interchangeable with that of any budget motel with a plastic tissue holder and no drawers for storage.

Bally's also nickels and dimes on Wi-Fi.  For your $32\/ day resort fee you're limited to 2 devices per room.  If you have both a tablet and cell phone, and more than one person in your room, it's a hardship.   And my cellular signal barely worked in the hotel.   Even budget motels don't ration internet these days.  

The food court and dining options leave a lot to be desired: Johnny Rockets, Nathan's, Sbarro... about the level of a middle America budget mall.

So when something appears to be too good to be true, it likely is. This is the case with Bally's Hotel and Casino. I was on a quest to find a place to go on vacation that was A) Hot B) Had a pool and C) relatively inexpensive. A few days at Bally's seemed to be just the trick. Upon arriving (after a $25 cab ride - I think the cabby duped us) we arrived at the hotel. Whitney checked us in and was very professional and sweet. Now, I knew that considering we had paid just under $400 a piece including flight, that our hotel room wouldn't be The Ritz however I was unprepared for the room we walked into. Oh boy, where do I start? Furniture looked like it was from a garage sale, 25 years ago, room was not clean, clothes left in the drawers along with condom (unused thankfully). Bathroom dirty, bed uncomfortable and just an overall air of skeeviness that I couldn't shake. I literally thought to myself, this is where people come to drink themselves to death. A quick trip down to the lobby, a conversation with the humorous and accommodating Elvis (I kid you not), $200 later and a new room in the North Tower and mama was MUCH happier. The new room was light and airy with good linens, lots of mirrors and a whirlpool tub that was strangely although not unsightly on a platform in the middle of the room. The room also had a separate room for the toilet (nice when you're spending 4 days with your man) and a bidet (later to be called The Fountain). The hotel itself is fine, you can tell they have not updated it in years so it has that old school feel, the restaurants are fine although finding a salad can be a challenge. The pool is nice, but again nothing fancy and pretty much straight out of 1988. Of course the location is why people still come here, and let's face it, a lower priced hotel on the strip is a good thing for folks who don't want to pay top dollar at The Bellagio et all. I'll review the other places we went to within Bally's and also in Vegas to give you the full picture. Overall, this hotel is kind of dumpy but fine if you just want a decent place to stay. But seriously, pony up the extra cash to stay in the north tower it's well worth it to avoid the skin crawling feeling.",0,0,0

This time I checked Orbitz, priceline, etc...and the rates for this last weekend were $300-$320. Since last year's stay I signed up for Ballys' Rewards membership.  I called Ballys to see if I could get a lower rate through them directly since I have AAA and their rewards membership.  I got a room for $201 for the weekend with their rewards membership (was cheaper than the AAA discount).

Once we got there, we decided we wanted to upgrade to a room with a jacuzzi, so regularly that would be an additional $100 but the rep told me to wait til we arrived and they usually offer it for 50% off. They did! So the upgrade to the jacuzzi suite was only $50 a nite.  

This room 'North Tower Grand"" suite was a lot bigger than the traditional ""classic"" room they have.  There were His and Her Sinks\/Vanities and closets. Separate shower and sunk-in jacuzzi. There was even a bidet which is separate from the toilet.  The only thing I didn't like is if u did have visitors come to your room there was no privacy after getting out the shower since there are mirrors all over the place (on the closet doors, vanities) u can see be seen in the room at almost every angle ! lol The only privacy u have is when u go the toilet (door) and the bidet.  Maybe the bigger suites have a closed off area when u get out of the shower.

We always stay in the non-smoking rooms and they have accomodated us both times we stayed here.  The casino is a little smokey but we don't gamble so we don't hang out there much. The pool is pretty big and has lots of lounge chairs.

Downstairs there's a mexican restaurant and the chicken\/beef tacos are only $2.00 and are pretty good!   

The bands they have playing their on the weekends are very good and it's free and casual to go in.  They require a 2 drink minimum to sit in their lounge, however when we went no one bothered us about this.

I like Bally's because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip, the rooms are clean and once u get  their rewards membership card the rates are reduced! Will definately keep going back to Bally's!",4,2,1

We were given a hotel room in the South Tower, the non-remodeled side of the hotel...which is no biggie...but it is an issue when you are placed right next to the elevator...and I mean RIGHT next to the elevator.  I barely got any sleep the first night...all I could hear was the rumbling of the elevator shafts.  And as well all know...Vegas never sleeps...because the hotel doesn't let you!   Haha.  

I called downstairs asking for a different hotel room...they couldn't offer anything else but they did offer to set us up in a different room on the same floor the next day.  I asked if we could be moved to the north tower...NOPE!  $20\/day and sure we could...so we did.  Argh.

There is a pretty huge difference between the rooms.  If you do stay here, make sure you book the NORTH TOWER.  They have flat screen TVs, 2 desks, comfy beds, a less awkward bathroom with granite counters, a better sink, and lots of mirrors.  

One thing in common between the 2 different rooms?  The noise.  I could hear everyone's conversations from other rooms around me...I could hear my neighbors flushing their toilets.  At least, no elevator noise.  Thank goodness.  

The staff are friendly for the most part...I had a great conversation with one of the guys at the bell desk.  The slots didn't give up a penny...but it's Vegas!  You're here to make a deposit at the slot machines anyhoo.  Haha.

We've definitely been spoiled with stays at Mandalay, Caesars and Hard Rock, I realize this isn't a top tier hotel\/casino but I wasn't expecting such shitty service.
Our bedroom was never cleaned the first day and today, day 2, hubby went up to put our baby down for her nap close to 3pm and the room still hadn't been cleaned! It's not a huge hotel so what's the excuse?
Valet also refused to park our car even though we were guests of the hotel due to being full. Manager told us this is the norm, but I've never experienced this at the other hotels. Even with valet full, Hard Rock and Ceasars took our car bc we were guests.

Overall if you don't care about quality or service then this hotel isn't bad. The one star goes to the nice lady at check-in, they ruined everything else.

First of all, we went in the off season(mid-December) and I booked our room with Expedia and it was a jubilee King. We paid a little extra for each day to not be in a basic room, but it was worth it. Jubilee tower is the north tower, so we had a strip view and right outside our window was the Eiffel Tower and you could see the Ballagio fountains. It was beautiful! I see a lot of people complaining of noises, YOU ARE IN VEGAS. What do you expect? Yeah we could hear the fountains from our room, and some music but we could still sleep. We slept in almost every day too so it wasn't too loud. Again, it's the off season, but keep in mind that it is Las Vegas, you're probably going to hear noise no matter what. The room was very roomy. It had a couch that could easily sleep another person, a desk, a large closet, and a pretty big bathroom. The bathroom came with a blow dryer too, although I wished I had brought my own because it was a low quality blow dryer. If you leave your towels on the floor room service will bring fresh ones and that's what we did every day. Room service was usually on our floor (61) around 11am and by the time we came back to our room later at night the room was cleaned. Also be sure to put the do not disturb sign on because they'll knock once and walk in, they almost walked in on me getting dressed but I think my music gave away me being in there. They do have a resort fee that we paid soon arrival, but when I was booking I noticed almost every hotel on the strip has the resort fee. To me, it's justified. 
I'm not much of a gambler, so to me the casino was just another casino. I got ID'ed every 3 seconds, which is pretty annoying when you already have a beer in your hand. The waitresses do a pretty good job of checking on you tho. 
Bally's does not have their own buffet but they're connected to Paris and they have one. Or you can walk to any of the hotels right on the strip. We liked Harrah's and The Mirage. 
As far as Bally's location on the strip, it couldn't be better! Right in the middle of everything. We did a lot of walking, but it was less walking than someone would do who stayed at the Luxor or Stratosphere. I can't tell you how many times I said, ""I'm so glad we stayed here, the location is great"".
Speaking of location, everyone told us to go to Fremont street. In my opinion it was a waste of walking and time. It's at the north end of the strip, probably 5 miles from Bally's. It's pretty much all souvenir shops. If you do want to go, buy a 24hr pass for the deuce bus. It runs down there and you can use it as much as you want in 24hrs. We tried to walk, got 3 miles down, and hopped on the bus. 
One thing to watch for is the people in the lobby offering 90% off show tickets. They offer that and you'll have to put down money for a hotel room for the following year or something like a time share.  Ignore that, and go to the tix for half off. We saw a Cirque show for $60 a ticket and got a buffet with unlimited beer for $11. It looks sketchy, but it's actually a pretty nice deal. The closer to show time the cheaper the tickets get.",7,0,0

We went into our room and found hair on the bed and all over the sink. It literally looked like someone shaved their beard and forgot to wash it out. We were of course disgusted by the room and called down to front desk. We were told that their manager was not in right now and they would give us a call back. Waited 5-10 minutes and no call back. We decided to go downstairs and just take care of the situation and get our room changed. 

We went downstairs and the workers were not busy at all and they were having a conversation about seeing one of the girls that was working on google images. We spoke with Tiffany who was very rude to us and was not empathetic about the disgusting room we were given. My boyfriend asked if there were any suites available since we would be staying for the next couple days. Tiffany blatantly said no there was not. We ended up checking online and seeing suites available (mind blown). 

After putting us in a new room, which was a downgrade from the first room we had, we went back downstairs to see why we were lied too about the suites. We spoke with another worker because Tiffany was no where to be found, which we also found out she works closely with the manager on duty. Turns out there were suites available. 

We have never stayed at a hotel in Las Vegas that had such horrible customer service. Ballys really needs to get their night staff situation fixed. The last thing anyone wants is to arrive to their hotel room exhausted and not being treated fairly.

The pros on staying at Bally's:

1. Easy access to other properties: Paris, Caesars, Bellagio, Cromwell, Tropicana.
2. The room was comped, can't complain about that!
3. Staff was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.

The cons:

1. Our keys did not work the first time we tried to use them.  We had to have security let us into the room for the first time and get re-keyed.
2. There was some miscommunication when it came to credit-card holds and pre-authorizations.  When we booked the room we were told that the pre-auth was $100.  As it turns out, it was $100 per night, which for us, was $300.  Additionally, because my boyfriend asked that I have charging privileges, they authorized an additional $300, plus some other charges we did not authorize.  We were able to get it straightened out with the front desk, but an up-front explanation would have been better and led to less frustration on our part.

Well, if you're version of ""old school cool"" translates to ""run down, dilapidated, and unclean"", then Bally's is the Vegas experience you've been waiting your entire lives for!

Upon exiting the elevator onto Floor 55 of the South Tower, I was greeted with a 60's vintage stale smoke aroma. (I've heard rumors that casinos pump oxygen in to keep you awake, but pipelining 5 decade old smoke smell? What an authentic touch!) This delectable odor is accented with worn, stained carpet that I can only assume is from the same era as the smoke smell. When I arrived in my room, I was amazed to find the stale smoke smell morphed into more of a pleasing 70's mildew scent; another classy touch of  ""old school"". 

The furniture was a mish-mash of my grandma's guest room dresser, my old college dining table, and my mother's push button lamps circa 1985. However, despite all these dated decorative marvels, the beds were somewhat modern and comfortable. The walls were a lovely blend of mauve colored wall paper, highlighted by cracks, stains, and peeled areas, thus completing the motif.

In my humble opinion, the real standout here was the bathroom! If I was wondering where that mildew smell came from, well I found it! It was strategically placed in the rails of the shower door and a little of the grout. Not to mention that, upon seeing the shower, I began wondering if my grandma was secretly their decorator! That shower was identical to the one in her hallway bathroom - minus the uncleanly nature. The three sided mirror was covered in spots, as though it were a collage of previous occupant's dental hygiene, and I later discovered that the bulk of the mildew was sneakily placed under the rim of the sink. (I don't know if this is a special touch they add in all rooms, or if it was just for me; but I, and my toothbrush, were happy to draw in the microscopic mold spores with every brush of my teeth.) Lastly, the coup de gras, pubic hair on the floor adorning the base of the water throne! This hotel really goes above and beyond!

In closing, all kidding aside, this really was a mixed bag for me. I have always been a fan of Bally's as a casino and really enjoy gambling there. The hotel's location on the strip is perfect, and staff is always pleasant and polite.. However, this place needs a massive overhaul to remain a viable as a hotel, especially at the rate I paid. I won't be staying there again, nor would I ever recommend it to others.

***EDIT

After reading some of the other reviews, I want to add a few other things that I noticed as well.

The check in line is miserably slow! It might be advantageous to employ more than 2 people to handle peak check in time. However, the staff is quite friendly.

Walkways didn't work and were absolutely filthy! Simply disgusting appearance and a shameful blight on The Strip.

I smoke, but the stale stench throughout the place is very bothersome. Not just on the hotel floors as I mentioned earlier.

Rooms are very large, but if that is a positive, it is severely discounted by all the other negatives listed above.

Noise was not an issue for me, but the mattresses are concrete firm and didn't do my back any favors. Still, I slept decently, save for my fear that I would acquire scabies from the linens.

I have the price listed as ""Moderate"". However, it's way overpriced for the level of accommodations.",3,1,1

We went up to our room, and got a bit of a shock. It had a fancy layout, with a bathtub in the room, and huge mirrored closets, but the carpet was old and stained, and the coverings on the bed looked faded. It also had dual sinks, and a small shower. No big deal, we thought, as long as the bathroom and sheets are clean, we were fine. So, we went out ate dinner somewhere, walked the strip a bit, and then came back, and went to bed early, since we were planning to drive to California the next day. That was when we realized that the room was against the elevator shaft, and that the elevators made a LOT of noise. 

The next morning, my husband, decided to shower before going out for breakfast. There was no light in the shower cubicle, so he turned on the lights outside and stepped in, and almost slipped. That was when we realized that the shower floor was literally mossy - so much mold had grown in the shower that it was difficult to stand. He stepped back out and washed his feet in the tub, and, we both, decided to shower when we got to California that evening. We were pretty happy to pack up and leave that 'suite'.

Bags were unloaded and my girlfriend was waiting for me to pull up. After loading the bags ourselves and getting in the car my girlfriend  goes on to tell me about how one of the bellhop men basically demanded a tip from her. After helping him take the bags off the cart, she was in the process of looking for her wallet. While looking through a couple bags the bellhops friend decides to start saying ""ma'am, ma'am!!"" louder and louder.

On a Saturday afternoon, the queue line weaved 3 times OUTSIDE the actual queue line, with only 4 people checking people in, one person dedicated to their diamond's club.  Very ill-prepared.

Room's show their age in their older rooms, but it was semi-clean (better than Imperial Palace for sure) and the amenities are scarce (wifi didn't work well, food court was decent, but room service lacked anything after 1pm).  Elevators sometimes got stuck when opening on certain floors...

I got upgraded to a 23rd floor suite (surprising, given that I was there on a conference rate) with a great view. The room was very large and very clean. There were some little ways that the hotel showed its age (sliding glass door to balcony sealed shut, etc.) but none were really worth mentioning.

Internet connectivity isn't free but was very fast. This is often a pet peeve when I travel, but I had no problems here. Lots of channels on the TV, though parents should be aware that there's no easy way to turn off access to adult movies.

The hotel is physically connected to Paris next door, where we had a couple of good meals. There is a walkway that connects to The Bellagio and Caesar's Palace on the other side of the strip.

I travelled to Las Vegas with family members in conjunction with a business convention in JAN. At check in, I arranged for an adjoining room at full price fare (Bally's does not offer Military discount). While we were out on the first day, maintenance personnel entered one room to attempt repairs on the sink (not requested by us nor coordinated with us). They inadvertently over pressurized the waste water line which flooded the room (water flowed out into the entry way and outside the door) and covered everything in a black\/putrid mess that smelled like sewage - destroying makeup and electronics my daughter had placed on the vanity. According to other similar reviews I have since read, this appears to be not uncommon. Front desk personnel informed us at the time of damage that we would have to file a report for damage claim, but that they would do nothing regarding adjusting the cost of the room - even though we could not use the bathroom for 24 hours. After 3 months of unreturned phone calls and e-mails, the Claims Adjuster informed us that even though we submitted receipts totaling $808.96, Bally's would only reimburse $431.41. I contacted the Customer Relations department to see if they would be willing to refund at least a portion of the room charges, and after 47 minutes of transfers\/holds was told ""Unfortunately, there is nothing further that Bally's will offer you."" 
I guess I had an unrealistic expectation that a Service Entity would want to at least attempt to resolve an issue of damaged property that THEY caused. 
If all you require is an inexpensive room in a worn down, old smoky casino, and are unconcerned about potential health risks of sewage contamination that may or may not have been properly sanitized, then Bally's may represent an option for you.

Opening up the bathroom there was a hot tub for 2. King size bed in the master bedroom with a sofa at the window. Huge window panes to look out onto the strip. Could see Bellagio from our window.

There was a small work out room with a bicycle. I was shocked by this. In the workout room there was a radio too, haha.

The dining room had a nice 6 seater dining room table. One side had a mini bar and in the between the living room and the dining room, there was a TV. A VERY OLD SCHOOL TV. One of those huge boxy ones with a rounded screen. GHETTooo! That's why I took off a star. For the nasty TV in such a nice suite. The furniture the TV sat in was pretty cool though, you could turn it around to watch the TV in the living room or turn it so you could watch it in the dining room. Pretty sick design. This suite had couches everywhere and TONS of floor space so you could easily pack 20 people in here.

The casino at Bally's isn't that bad. A good variety of tables and also poker if you're interested. You can find minimums at $10 but it depends on the time of day and of course which day you decide to stroll in. 

I think Ballys has prime location on the strip since it's right smack in the middle and walking distances to other awesomeR casinos.

A big shout out to my Total Experince Concierge Dallas Holmes. :) Dallas you made my experience seamless and great for our guest. I used Bally's to host my guest for my wedding on August 25th. My guest were quickly won over by the location, spacious rooms, and great service.

Location: Almost on the middle of the strip. so a quick walk to some of the prime locations you may want to visit. Had the perks of Paris, but not the price. Across the street from Ceasar Palace. Bellagio, Paris, Planet hollywood and Miracle Mile Shops. Also monorail picks up from Bally's location. And is connected to Paris hotel with great shops and eateries.

Rooms: Our room was very spacious in the South Tower Seventh floor. Enough to have 3 queens beds. Flat screen tv was nice especially when it was time to check out all we had to do was press a button. Cleaning ladies came everyday and made our beds, vaccumed and cleaned the bathroom.  Which was nice especially since we stood there for 6 days.  My guest were all happy with their rooms and a few had great views of the stip.

Service: From top to bottom every member of staff we came in contact with was helpful, and very nice.  Service is stellar here! :)

However, they tacked on a $29\/night ""resort fee"" that erased any financial advantage of the deal. The rooms were large and well-appointed, quite nice, in fact. But what made this visit nearly unbearable was the poor air quality throughout the casino and even in the room. We took our service dog and left him a couple of hours in the room while we went to dinner. When we came back, he was wheezing. A quick check online suggested it was an allergic reaction to something in the environment, so I gave him an antihistamine and took him outside, and he improved immediately. However, every time I entered the casino, I hit a wall of smoky air that nearly took my breath away. My eyes burned constantly from irritants in the air, and my nose was constantly dripping. Both nights the dog wheezed after spending the night in the room, so I got him outside as soon as possible, and left him with a friend outside the resort when we took in a show. 

The spa and fitness area seemed relatively free of these irritants, and that was a relief. The gym was adequately equipped and hardly used, as far as I could tell. The spa was luxurious and nice. 

Overall, the superficial glitz of the place quickly gave way to the dreariness of a hell hole that never sleeps, where zombie-like patrons listlessly play slot machines in a choking, smoky atmosphere without joy or even the seeming ability to get up.",2,3,0

Overall, I thought it was good. The location was awesome. The a\/c was really good in the rooms, so good in fact that we had to turn it down, we ended up getting too cold at night. 
We had 2 rooms, and when we got there we managed to get them right across the hall from each other, it was perfect. Check-in was a little slow, and there were not a lot of people ahead of us. Not a big deal to me though. 
We loved how we were pretty much in the middle of the strip. One day we could go one way, the other day, the other way. It worked out perfect. 

We found that Bally's is fairly outdated, and the pool atmosphere is lacking, for us anyways. My boyfriends parents loved it because it was quiet and not very busy, relaxing. My boyfriend and I however, felt like we were missing something. A good crowd, some music maybe. 
We found the rooms were clean. Not much to say there. Just your typical hotel. We were only in our rooms to sleep, get changed and shower. Either then that we were out on the strip or else catching some shows. Also, I'm pretty sure you had to pay extra for the wi-fi, and I don't think it was really good in the rooms. Again, not a big deal as we were barely there. 

We realized we were spending more time at other hotels then our own. Bally's didn't have any shows on at the time. We never received any coupons or show discounts from Bally's either. We ended up buying all of our show tickets at those ticket boxes all down the strip with the red signs. If you go out in the morning, you can get tickets for shows that night, and for cheap. We were able to check out Mystere for half off! 

My boyfriend and I are heading to Vegas again at the end of August, staying at the Luxor this time though. 
Booked through Red Tag, travelled from Edmonton, AB, Canada.

Ultimately, you get what you pay for at Bally's, and it did the job of providing us a home base for a couple of weeknights while we were in Vegas. The location is perfect to quickly shop and explore other areas of the strip.

Ok so I stole this line from NBA 2K (a video game)  but it describes Bally's to me, nothing stands out but it's a solid option. It's a decent value hotel and you can splurge on other parts of your Vegas trip.

The rooms were surprising. The standard 2 bed room look was nothing new, but there was a lot more space than comparable rooms at the other hotels. It has a nice location on the strip and it has easy access to Paris hotel.

The casino isn't that great. The tables don't look very new and the lighting in the main room is very bright. The electronic boards here for roulette and other games don't always work. It's a problem at every casino but it seems to happen here more. They do have lower limits though so that is a plus, but there aren't too many tables.

However, when they have the party pit , it's very fun, especially when you get the right crowd at the tables. It's definitely a good time 

I've spoken with the front desk just once or twice but they were very courteous. 

I'm not a fan of the moving walkway. It's nice to be able to just relax and not walk but I'd rather just have the entrance closer. Though, they can't do much about this now.

Parking: parking is free. You can self-park, or use the valet (free, but you should tip). The valet is fairly quick with an approximate 10 minute wait.

Room: nice size, average amenities and appearance. fairly comfortable beds with 3 pillows each. No refrigerator, safe (@ $3 per day), good A\/C, TV with local channels (optional PPV and adult movies). Bathrooms are a little dated and tired, but functional. Hairdryer included in bathroom. No coffeemaker, or snack\/honor bar. Can get adjoining rooms with interior doors that can be opened by the housekeeping staff, good for groups of friends, or families. Ice and vending machines are near the elevators.

Casino: Average, kind of old-school, lots of penny slots (yay!), cheap blackjack tables, lots of video poker, decent cocktails.

Bars\/Lounges: Couple of okay-ish cocktail lounges with a variety of music, go-go dancers. 

Restaurants: The Steakhouse was delicious. I had the filet mignon with Bearnaise sauce, steamed asparagus, and the lobster bisque. The filet was tender and juicy, and the bisque had huge lobster chunks the size of a quarter. Al Dente offers a prix-fixe menu @ $19.99, with an appetizer, entree, and dessert. For a few dollars more, you can have a glass of the house wine. I had the crab bisque (good but the crab was stringy), the lasagna (pretty good), and the lemon gelato (also good). You get fresh bread and a mixture of olive oil, pesto, fresh shredded parmesan cheese, and balsamic vinegar to eat it with. Frankly, that was the best part of the meal!

Shopping: There's a good selection of shops, ""Satisfy My Soul"", a shoe store, a $10 store with cheapie junk, a food court (I remember seeing a Sbarro, and a Haagen-Dazs  stand). Don't let the skin care lady sucker you into buying the eye serum. It works, but no thanks on the price tag of $160 (half-price, at that). A quick search on the iPhone around the corner found the same product on Ebay for $25.

Pool: The Blu Pool was a lot of fun. Sure, it's an older pool, the water is the temperature of bathwater, and it's crowded, but when it's 118 degrees outside, who cares. There's a DJ, decent house music, booty-shaking contests, and lots of eye candy for everyone. You can rent mister chairs or cabanas. Great drinks, and cocktail servers make the rounds. There's a pool shop (Splashes) right by the pool for swimwear, towels, sunscreen, bottled water, sodas, and juices, in case you forgot something.

My pedometer showed a 3\/4 mile walk from my room in the south tower to the pool, so be prepared for a lot of walking!

Location: Great location, with Bill's Casino on one side, and Paris on the other. FYI: you can enter Paris through the lobby in Bally's. Had a nice view of the Eiffel Tower, and part of the water ballet across the street at the Bellagio. Caesar's Palace is catty corner across the street. The skybridges and walkways make for a nice walk in the evening once the sun has gone down, with benches along the way in case you need a rest or want to people-watch for a while. 

Shows: ""The Price is Right"" is hosted by Dave Ruprecht (the host of ""Supermarket Sweep""), and is pretty fun. $50 a pop, and no guarantee you will be picked, but who knows- you could be one of the lucky 50 people or so. One of the contestants won a Nissan Versa, so there ya go. 

""Jubilee"" is the classic Vegas showgirl show. You can opt for the 7:30 PM show (tops on), or the later 10:30 PM show (topless). We opted for the later show. Eh, why not. The costumes are beautiful, I felt like I fell into an Erté dreamworld, the dance numbers are pretty cool- more old-fashioned than I thought it would be, but for theatre aficionados- it's worth the ticket price. Numbers from ""Titanic"" (very 'Gilbert & Sullivan'!), ""Samson & Delilah"", and a waltz to ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"", overall quite sedate, but entertaining. The entire show is not topless, just a few numbers are, which was fine with me. It isn't distracting, but I'm not into looking at boobs. 

Probably not the most family-friendly place for kids, but nothing objectionable really. Have fun!",5,0,1

However, can the carpet at least get upgraded? Also, may we have small refrigerators and a coffee pot with basic amenities? I guess I am taking it for granted that it seemed like a standard guest offering since I've always had that experience at many hotels I've stayed at.

On the positive side, the rooms are spacious. The shower flow is strong & drain works well. That's about it. Hooks for hanging wet bath towels are absent, to say the least.

This was at 1 am, and my husband and I decided we couldn't deal with the noise, so we called back to request a room change. After leaving us on hold too long, we called again and the service rep stated that they did not have any rooms to substitute. So we booked another hotel and checked out at 2am. None of these circumstances were in the control of the staff, but both my husband and I were treated rudely by Bally's employees and were given different stories. When we finally spoke to a manager, he told us that the club would not continue the next night, which was not what we were told over the phone. He was still unable to change our room for that night (not because they were booked, but because of the type of room we were in), so we decided to check out anyway.

i was soooo hungry one night after a show, i ordered room service.  i've been eating so healthy lately....no sodas....no chips....no chocolate....major cutbacks on my sugar intake (cuz i'm already naturally high)....and definitely no oily and fried shit.  so what does this healthy chica wanna eat at 1 a.m. in the morning?  a sampler, baby!  i've never been more excited about JUNK FOOD!  boy was i sorely disappointed!  instead of ordering something else, i decided to not waste food and eat as much as i could.  the potato skins were hella oily and smelled funny.  the ribs were like no ribs i've tasted before, soggy and tasteless.  the buffalo wings were just plain nasty, i had to doust it with ketchup to swallow and even then i only finished 2 out of the 4 pieces.  and the only thing that tasted half decent was the quesadilla - i ate TWO WHOLE pieces!  i can't speak for the other items on the menu but do yourself a favor and don't ever order the sampler!

i normally don't care which hotel i stay at because like seriously HOW MANY HOURS do you plan to stay in your rooms right?  you're either too busy stuffing your face, too busy shopping, too busy dancin', too busy gambling, too busy shopping (yes, i know i said that twice) or wayyyyy too busy checking out the butts and the boobs.  just admit it, there's nothing to be ashamed of.  it's a NORMAL thing to do when you're in vegas, really!!!!  heck i do it.    

BUT WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THOSE MEN passing out cards of naked woman with numbers on the back and making those smacking sounds with the cards??!!!!!!!!!!  i have collected 30 of these cards.  layla is my favorite.

so if you're like me, bally's okay - just don't order the sampler.  but if you are like the woman who's got a hawt human tamper, then maybe bellagio, venetian or wynn is a better choice.  don't get me wrong, i enjoy staying at the luxury hotels too, but it depends more on the ""purpose"" of the visit   :)",10,11,12

It is located pretty much in the center of the main strip and the monorail stops here. It is also connected to the Paris for a little classier option for food and drinks. The pool is good, however, no outside drinks are permitted so either pay $15 a drink or sneak them in in a pool bag. The rooms were very clean and staff was very friendly and helpful. I would consider staying here again, however, if you are single there are other hotels that are suppose to be more single friendly. 

The breakfast buffet here is absolutely horrible!!! It makes you feel like you are at a holiday inn! I ate it once and never went back and never will. Check out the other hotels or just go to the Paris and get yourself a crepe and coffee. You'll be much better off. They lure you in with $11.99 and the food is not fresh and drinks are not included unless you drink water...coffee and juice is $2. I recommend going down to Fremont street with the monorail and Bus to the Golden Nugget. For $15 you get the most amazing breakfast buffet I've had, fresh omelette, fruit, bread, meat, drinks, and desserts. It's worth the trip down there and Fremont street is worth seeing at least once.

There is a bar and casino right across the street that advertises super cheap drinks. It's worth going there. You will get a good amount of people watching even though it looks shadey on the outside and loaded for $20.",0,0,0

As a result, we wound up picking Bally's because they had a great rate and my girl had stayed here once before and liked it. 

What we didn't know is that they're doing major renovations on the hotel street side facade. The escalator that leads down to the Strip is being torn up, making room for new shops and shit. This makes parking a bit of a headache, as you have to drive through a maze just to get into the main structure. But the good news is that it's easy to find a space near the elevators so you won't have to walk too far. 

The long walking comes once you hit the ground level, when you've got to walk through a concourse to Bally's since you're actually in Paris at the moment. Check-in was done at Vegas' usual slow standards. I found it annoying that the only king bed available was on the pet floor. If I book a king bed online, I should get a king bed on a normal floor. Luckily, this ""pet floor"" was quiet and clean. 

The rooms are pretty nice, maybe a bit antiquated. Furniture and fixtures looked like '90s relics, but it did feel comfortable. We had a decent view of the Strip from our side room, and the love seat by the window was easy to melt into. 

The pool is a major pain to reach. Take the elevator down to the ground floor, then navigate through their underground strip mall\/food court before finally reaching the towel bar. It's a big pool, and surprisingly deep, hitting 12' at the lowest point. We had no problem finding a couple of chairs. The pool bar was out of mint, so I was unable to enjoy a goddamn refreshing mojito, so I settled for a Shock Top. Bring plenty of cash if you're gonna drink here, because it ain't cheap. 

The hotel itself has few restaurants for a quick bite. We went out more often than we ate in, but the area between Bally's and Paris has a couple of food spots worth checking out. 

I can't say I'm in a rush to stay here again, but they did provide good service and a good room. Nothing blew me away, but then nothing turned me off so much I wouldn't come back. If you want mid-priced rooms in a good location (middle of the Strip), then this is the spot.",4,2,2

Holy crap!! 

First day: Paid extra for an EARLY (arrived at 11am) check in and was roomed at 3:45pm. Later, I was sucked into talking to one of those timeshare people while my husband went to the room to meet the bellman. I stand there for 10 minutes to find out we don't qualify (figures). Then I rush to my room. I stuck my key card into what I thought was MY room. Turns out it was an nice OLDER gentlemans room. I ran out of there and was running down the hall with housekeeping laughing at me. I went to the belldesk and asked for help. They sent me to the house phone to call my husband in the room. However, since the casino floor is so LOUD and also because I'm hearing impaired I could NOT hear the lady on the other end and she HUNG UP ON ME!!! I sat for a bit at a $5 machine and asked three employees for help with no luck, then went back to the belldesk. FINALLY someone to help!!! I told him the dilemma and he looking it up and wrote my room number down. Got to my room, and told my husband NEVER to leave me again at this hotel!!!!

Day 2: We went to talk to a manager, Jose upgraded us to a suite! We walked into this suite and let me tell you it was meant for people who are being ""upgraded"". The best suite in their offerings gave us the following; poopy smelling water, tile that kept falling out, a broken FIRE ALARM, plus broken handle bars in the hot tub. WOW!! SERIOUSLY?????

Day 3: We went to the pool (Nice!), and tried to order food. But since we moved to a new room they did not transfer our credit card info...... and we didn't know to bring any cash!! Denied!! And humiliated!!! WTH??? 

Day 4: A month prior we had reserved a limo through Bally's. Ricky picked us up from the Luxor and took us on an hour ride though Las Vegas! He dropped us off at Bally's and we paid him plus a 50% tip!!! He took it ALL and stuck the bill on our room!!! GRRRRR!

We did get the room for $39 a night, excluding tax, but no resort fees. The first night we checked in because we didn't make it by 4 PM, they gave us a room with two queens instead of a king as we requested. Instead of honoring it, they kept trying to upcharge us to move to the north tower for $30 a night, but why would we pay an extra $30 when we only paid $39 in the first place?!

The front desk was extremely slow for check in and check out. They weren't very friendly and not accommodating at all. I guess part of the cheap rates is the service too. The rooms are outdated and it shows. The first one we checked into smelled like smoke on a non-smoking floor. Fortunately, the second night we did get a king room (no apologies from the front desk) which did smell better. 

It's the little things like the ventilation system and amenities that suck. Sure, the location may be good, but realize that even if something looks close in proximity, it's still far to walk! 

I realize I might b a bit of a hotel snob, but Bally's didn't cut it for me. I would never stay here again and you shouldn't either!",2,0,0

We called a week in advance and told them we would have a late arrival. Then we called and confirmed they saw the late arrival and they said that's fine and someone would be there to check us in. Along our drive we ran into a few delays. So we called the hotel to let them know we would be even later but the customer service line said the office hours were closed.

Well, when we arrived they said our reservations were canceled! She asked if we had let them know ahead of time and said there wasn't a note of being a late check in. By this time we had been up for 24 hrs and they said no rooms would be available until MAYBE 10 or 11 am and check around then. We asked if they can call us but she whined and said only the manager can do it. So we asked to talk to the manager and she went back in the office then said they would call and took our number down. around 1045 no call so I called and the customer service lady said something along the lines of 'I see the notes here of late check in, let me figure out what happened and it shouldnt of been canceled in the first place.' She put me on hold for 15 mins and said a room was available and to go and check in but hurry! So at 1130 we finally got into our room. Worst hotel experience ever!!",0,0,0

This was our first time in Las Vegas, so we wanted to stay in the center of the action.  Bally's is great for this, the location is right across from the Bellagio fountains, and next to some of the larger resorts in Vegas.  The other reason we chose Bally's was the price, which was cheaper than almost any other resort in that area.  

Check-in was a bit of a pain.  After hours of traveling, the last thing we wanted to do was stand in line for another 30 minutes, but that's what awaited us when we got to the hotel.

We stayed in the Jubilee tower.  It was recently updated, so it feels new and current.  The room was a good size.  We had a nice large window so we got a good view of the north side.  There's probably a better view if you stay in a room facing the south side, which would include the faux-Eiffel Tower and Bellagio Fountains.  Everything in the room was fine.  The bed was nice and firm, sheets were comfortable, and overall was clean.  The bathroom has a nice big shower, which you'll love after spending a day under the Vegas sun, dodging tourists, half-naked street performers, and people shilling escort service cards.

Being from a state where smoking indoors in public places like restaurants and bars is banned, it was a bit of a shock walking into the casino and smelling all the smoke.  This is just the nature of the beast in Vegas, so there's not much we could have issue with, but it did seem like Bally's was a little more fragrant than the other casinos we walked through.  No smells once we got up to our room.   

We didn't gamble much, but there's definitely plenty of that available.  There's a range of food options, from cheap fast food to a steakhouse and Asian-inspired restaurant.  We didn't go to those, but did grab a sandwich from Nosh, which we found convenient.

The pool was fine.  It's heated, which we really liked.  The music was a bit annoying.  There's a to get drink from, and a few waitresses walking around taking drink orders.  No outside drinks are allowed.  

There's access to the tram directly from Bally's, which is nice if you want to explore parts of the strip that you don't want to walk to, or your legs start aching from the aforementioned dodging.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would probably stay here again if we were to visit Las Vegas in the future.",3,0,0

Why?  

Because there was no room at Caesar's Palace.  (Why?  Who the **** knows!)

Why?  Because it's ""kitty-corner"" to Caesar's, where the group of family members were staying for combination 50th Birthday and Family Reunion Party.  

Yeah, but why here?  Damned if I know, the big party was at THE Hotel at the Mandalay Bay.  *shrug*

Smelly, stinky, filled with cigarette smoke not only on the casino floor (sort of to be expected), but also within our allegedly non-smoking, teeny, tiny room!  

The room itself?  I've stayed in rooms at Motel 6 that were less stinky and more comfortable.

The pool?  Closed.

The food?  P-u-u-u-l-l-l-e-e-e-e-e-z-e . . . we kept going elsewhere!  (Even the ""sidewalk"" cafe in Paris was better!)

It is pretty much run down at this point and in desperate need of a complete overhaul.  Caesars Entertainment should have done work on Ballys even before Bill's.

Booked for 5 nights from 10\/13 through 10\/17 and in the end, everything was much better expected.

Red-eye into LAS from HNL, got to Bally's around 9am, tried to check-in but was told no rooms available and to come back later closer to noon.  Came back around 1:30pm, about 10 people in front at check-in line but moved very quickly.  Front desk rep was wonderful (regret not getting her name), didn't do the $20 trick since didn't think was worth it (solo trip this time) but was asked if would like to upgrade to renovated room in South Tower for minimal fee ($30\/night I think....), took the offer since can check-in right away.

Got room #6439, king-bedded, (south) strip view including view of Paris and pool, full view of Eiffel Tower, Cosmo, and half of Bellagio fountain.  Room was new. clean with a contemporary feel, spacious, large comfy king bed, flat screen TV, in-room safe AND (DRUM ROLL........), a coffee maker with complimentary coffee, replenished daily...this I must say is a rarity on the strip, and beat the heck out of having to crawl down to the lobby and wait in line for coffee in the morning.  Although a hike to get to\/from elevators to #6439 (end of the hall), room was great, and very quiet.  Housekeeping was on par with daily services keeping room clean and linen fresh.

Casino was clean, pretty good selection of F&B outlets\/restaurants.  Didn't have time to try any though this visit since most of dining were off-property.

Overall, stay at Bally's was quite good and better than expected, excellent value considering the hotel's location on the strip, very convenience to either ends.  Staff encountered and services received through out stay (valet, Front Office, Total Rewards desk, casino, housekeeping...) were all wonderful.  Would definitely stay here again, and can't wait for the entire property to be renovated.

Small gripe....RESORT FEE.  Hate to see this on the bill, why can't they just build this into room rate if it's mandatory.  I guess can't be helped since all major hotels in LV are charging this or will be in near future.",1,0,0

We love staycations. LOVE them. Safer for everyone on the road because if we drink we aren't driving, and it has a perfect location in the middle of the strip. Also, NO RESORT FEE. That is a huge bonus considering Treasure Island has a $25 resort fee per day! Not going to happen!

We love staying on the strip in February because the prices are great and it is the month when we have almost always had success with receiving free upgrades in every hotel we've stayed in. Every time we have come to Bally's we have gotten an upgrade to either the South or North tower. One time we stayed in a regular room as well and it was still, just fine.

For my bachelorette party we stayed in a basic suite. Huge bed, wet bar, table and chair and a nice bathroom. Bed was comfy, everything was clean, nothing growing in the corner or bathrooms and no bed bugs. Score.

Not a big score? The pool. That's why one star disappeared. Horrible poo, not sexy at all l, old lounge chairs, and the only thing saving it was a nice bar that has my favorite drink at a reasonable price - Tyku Sake with club soda and a squeeze of lime. Delicious!

The next time I stayed at Bally's it was with my husband. Free upgrade (since we are local, a Total Rewards member and only staying for 1 night), extremely friendly service every time we checked in, and the suites are wonderful. Sure, they don't have a step down like The Venetian, but this is a slightly older casino and I could pay $150+ for a room at the Venetian or spend $37- for a suite at Bally's and use the extra money for electronic roulette, booze and the Goldfish slot machine. I have posted pictures of the executive suite on Yelp and the tub is very large and comfortable -  my husband and I fit comfortably in the spa tub (mind you, he is 6' 7""), and not going to lie, everyone looks a little better on the ""her"" side of the his and her bathroom because of their very flattering vanity lights! Just in case you need to, they have a bidet on one side and a toilet on the other small bathroom. Just in case.

Bally's is also connected to Paris which is perfect because we love Paris and Mon Ami Gabi! Just a quick walk over and we're there! No need to go outside and I love walking through the shopping area. For the price, the quality of the rooms is wonderful and the customer service at Bally's and Total Rewards in general is more than satisfactory. I love this place!",1,0,0

The casino floor was decent enough so I expected the room to work out ok...I have never been more wrong in my life. I walk into the room and I immediately notice how dirty the carpet is. It's filthy with some burn marks sprinkled around. I set my suitcase down and get ready to lay on my bed, I see white stains on the bed throw, the small cover at the foot of the bed. I immediately knock it to the floor and never put it back on the bed until of course housekeeping does that each new day. I really wish they wouldn't have. Anyways, I slip on a pair of flip flops and move across the room to the desk where I begin to search for an outlet to plug my phone in. I push a faded chair out of my way and squat down low, careful not to touch the feculent carpet.  I plug my phone charger into an outlet surrounded by dust and stand back up. I pull the chair behind me, ready to plop down until a large white stain catches my eye. I pause, releasing my grip and survey the horrors that appear to have befallen this sad, unfortunate piece of furniture. It is absolutely disgusting. It looks like it has been used as a prop in an adult film since it's construction, which based on its retro stylings, I wager would be some time in the late 80's. For the rest of our stay I avoid that chair like it's the plague...which may actually be thriving in the carpet fibers below. 

Other issues include caramel-colored spatter on the walls that I'm sure taste nothing like a sweet treat. The floor of the bathroom was also quite filthy, again, flip flops pretty much 100% of the time. Also the shower curtain would never keep water in the tub so the floor would flood.",2,4,0

Bally's is an older hotel and we got good deals, so after half of our friends left (we were at MGM) we decided to come here.  

* We were 3rd in line at check in and it took us close to 40 minutes just to get checked in. 

* As soon as we walked into the hotel room, everything looked neatly placed and clean.  First view of the room was pleasant until I lied down on their bed. I can smell really bad noticeable B.O from the blanket... what the heck?
...... it's either that they don't wash their sheets well or the housekeeping staff has really bad hygiene.  The housekeeper can also be a hardworking person who is having a hard life as well... so I will not mention the person's name who serviced this room, but I advice you guys to encourage your staff to at least wear deodorant. 

* The edge of the ceiling (by the door) had nasty reddish ""who knows what"" smeared all over it.  

* Walls are very thin.  We can hear our next door hotel neighbors... getting it on.

Should have stuck with what I know. The restaurants all closed earlier than advertised by a few hours. The gym staff kicked us out of the gym early. Not by saying they were closing early,  but instead by a guy coming in turning the TV off and saying ""we're closed gotta go"" then knocking on the glass and saying sir over and over when he came in early to again close early.  This normally wouldn't be a big deal but added on top of the restaurant employee answering my inquiry to the hours of operation with ""we're closed, bye"" at 1 when the hours state open until 3am. The 24hr restaurant also being closed when they state 24hrs, and the Italian place in the food court not making anything to order but only serving the cold food because they were also closing early didn't add to a great experience. Room was decently clean but wouldn't call it clean. I get that in a city that sees many out of towners get drunk and raucous they might have developed a little callousness to others. But for someone staying in their establishment for the 1st time who was sober the short and curt manner of interaction wasn't a pleasant one.

The room you book will not likely be the room you get once you check in, especially if you check in after 8pm. You'll also wait in line to check in for quite some time because their check-in desk is always understaffed. Maybe something to do with the fact that the room access cards don't work properly--needed 4 cards for a 3 night stay--and given its size, that's a long walk at 3am when said card doesn't work. One of our group paid for an extra night because they needed to check in early (8am). Sorry, don't have that room either. We can give u less and not comp you anything because we're busy and don't need your custom. Busy and cheap is the visual I want you to think about before you book a room. This is Economy Drive.

Due to come booking errors I was able to get comped Saturday night and also upgraded to their Jubilee suite and total price for 3 nights was $240 even after tax and resort fees. Their resort fees are $28.00 a day fyi

The Jubilee suite was a very large room with lots of wasted space. There was 2 lounge couches a king side bed, a huge jacuzzi in room, 2 separate sinks, and separate makeup station and a pretty large shower with a seat inside it. We got the 17th floor facing Caesars and the Cromwell hotel. From the window you also have a great view of high roller ferris wheel. 

The room was clean and there wasn't any funny smells or stains on the towels or sheets. 

The only thing is if you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs because you can still hear the club music across the street, cars, and also the guest next door. 

Parking is shared with the Paris hotel and it's probably about a 5-6 minute walk from the guest elevators so not too bad.

The next day I contacted Hotels.com and told them about the situation, and told them I wanted a different hotel. They were willing to work with me but had to call Ballys to have the reservation for the next night cancelled which they would not allow me to cancel and get a refund. After 30 min on the phone I was told I had to go talk to the manager. That afternoon I spoke to Melissa and she was very understanding, they switched us to a upgraded room that was actually clean. We didn't need a renovated room, just wanted something clean at this point. She called 30 min later to make sure it was clean enough for us.

I checked in at 9pm and there was only 1 person behind the counter. they could have used a 2nd person (there were about 3 people in line). I was quickly checked in to a room on the 18th floor of the north tower (view of a parking lot). The room was better than expected. Everything seemed clean and the loveseat was perfect to curl up on to do some reading.

Here is some info regarding my stay-

Smoke- I asked for a non-smoking room, but the entire property stinks. I think the ventilation system needs to be renewed.

Air- Just because it's 106 outside doesn't mean they have to compensate by making it 46 inside. The AC was POWERFUL.

Food- Sidewalk Cafe- service SUCKED. Food was ok.
Room Service- I had breakfast 2x in my room. Food arrived quickly, was hot, and the portions were very nice. However, they don't pick the trays up and there was food left for almost 24 hours in the hallway...eck.
It's a hotel in Vegas, the food is expensive.

Customer Service- very poor. The employees did not look happy to be there. No one was smiling, no one wished you a good day as you walked by. They just didn't care, and they even didn't care who knew that they didn't care!

Pool- GROSS! I went out at 5pm to sit in a lounge chair, have a cocktail, and read a book...the bar closed at 5 (but the pool was open until 8- that makes no sense), the chairs were not comfortable and looked really dirty, and there were stupid kids splashing in the pool.",1,1,1

Everyone should make this their first gamble in Vegas.  A discrete greasing of the hotel check-in person could change your hotel experience pretty drastically.  By adding a folded up $20 bill between my credit card and id, my comped standard room magically turned into a comped junior suite!

The suite was generous in size, included separate bathroom sink areas, sunken living room, jacuzzi tub, a bidet, and a great view of the Paris Eiffel Tower.

I elected to skip the use of the bidet during my stay.

Bally's is old, but still in decent enough shape to stay on the cheap (or free).  It's location on the strip in relation to other spots makes walking to them totally doable.

First, if you don't know, Bally's connects to neighboring upscale Paris and it is an easy walk between the two casinos. Restaurants, shops, gaming and upscale decor abounds. Traveling on my own for personal business, I didn't hit the cheap buffet or any of the shows. 

Check-in was easy with only a short wait. Service was helpful and quick, the room in the North Tower was clean, very nice and quiet (per my request, always ask for a quiet room location in Vegas), internet service was $12 for 24 hours. The AC worked, was not excessively loud, and the bathroom had strong water pressure. I did not eat room service or at the restaurant but I have no doubt it was excellent. (In fact, I've not had a bad meal in Vegas even at dive bars)

Ballys prime strip location offers easy access to the monorail service up and down the strip and on foot there is plenty to do right outside. I spent some time in nearby Miracle Mile Shops (a huge mall with shops, bars, clubs, etc., connected to Planet Hollywood) just a short walk away. 

The self parking garage (free) offers easy access to Paris and as mentioned a short walk to Ballys.

After parting ways with my dance crew in Vegas, sore, tired, (maybe a little hung over!) I meet my pal @ Bally's to wait in what looked like a multi-hour wait in line at check in. It is around noon on Sunday. 

""Self parking is 'shared' with Paris."" says the pal with a hint of exasperation as we kick our bags another inch when the line inks forward. Meanwhile, the staff are busy performing a very official-looking pen count. 

Our deluxe, double-room is three left turns from the elevator on the seventh floor. The key works on the first try. Shocking right? 

Closet to the left, sparkly clean bathroom to the right, a table, chair and desk in the corner and a velvet bench awaits at the foot of each double bed. 

The room is nice and smells like soap. But cheap plastic shower curtain Bally's? Boy are you lucky that I am a bubble-bath girl! Mediocre bath products have me thanking my lucky stars that I brought my bath products from home. The towels are not soft but large enough. 

We spread out on our separate beds in excited anticipation of reading our coupon book courtesy of Balley's at check in. (I wasn't lying about the coupon thing!) Coupon book stinks. Five dollars off any purchase of fifty dollars @ the gift-shop? -NO one should buy these goods. Ten percent off Thai looked good. What kind of Thai restaurant charges $18 for Pad Thai? The kind that gives a ten percent off coupon. We did not love the coupon book. 

The pool is closed for the season in December but they offer the use of Paris for pool wants. We are pounced on every time we leave the room and offered a ""free show"" in Vegas from desperate time share sales persons. Run away when this happens! Your time in Vegas is worth more than what ever "" free goods"" they are giving you sunshine. 

The spa was... SO good. After dancing all night, my legs were never so happy as they were mid-deep tissue massage...... (insert ten minutes) Sorry, I was lost in happy thoughts for a minute there. 

This location is pretty fantastic if you like walking around in Paris which adjoins Balley's. Wonderful, if you want to watch the Bellagio water show across the street. Being within walking distance from my favorite old-timey diner in Vegas, Ellis Island, is also not a bad perk.

And I don't know why there are so many doors in the room, someone want a party?????? Even in the afternoon you could hear there's a dog barking at the next door. 

I really don't like Ballys. Even the location cannot make up for the dirty situation. 

Ps: I lived in different hotels when I stayed in lasvegas, like Aria or wynn or the signature of MGM, so I do know what's good and what's bad.

Those who think this place is actually good need to have their brains examined. There are SO MANY other hotels on the strip, I don't understand why anyone would want to stay here. The only reason I stayed at Bally's was because my mother had a convention located in the hotel. We only stayed two nights until the convention was over and transferred to the New York New York (which is much better and happened to be cheaper) for the rest of our stay in Vegas.

To top it off, the staff was extremely rude. We were supposed to be placed in the newly renovated North tower, but all of the rooms were taken by the time we arrived. My mother was specifically told she'd be placed in the North tower because the convention was being held in that area. The lady at the front desk basically gave us a ""too bad, so sad"" look and rolled her eyes. We were placed in the South tower, which is awful.

There are two towers, South and North and the North tower is the nicer one and I stayed in the South Tower.  I asked if they could upgrade me but unfortunately they were unwilling to do so.

This hotel is right in the middle of the strip and is usually reasonably priced so that's why it's always been where we stay. However, the saying: ""You get what you pay for"" is starting to ring true. The hotel is starting to go downhill in that they aren't keeping it up as they should. 

The carpet in the hallway of the seventh floor where we stayed was heavily stained as though it had been that way for a while. Also, the hallways have begun to grow a strong undertone of the smell of mothballs as you walk through. The carpet in the room was starting to come up around the nightstand and there was even a strip missing. The bench at the end of the bed had buttons popped off and was covered in crumbs, or God knows what. The chair at the vanity also had dark stains on it that looked as though no one had even tried to get them out. In the bathroom the paint and wallpaper were peeling away in a very noticeable way.

We stayed at the Monte Carlo the last time we came, but came back to Bally's because Bally's does not charge your card upon checking in and hold a ""deposit"" that they will refund when you check out. I don't know yet if there are any other hotels that do or do not have this policy, but that is definitely something that Bally's has going for them.

Bally's isn't the worst hotel I've stayed at, but it can definitely afford to improve. Being that it is in the middle of the strip and has decent prices is definitely a good reason to stay here if your main concern is having a convenient place to stay while you're here visiting and you won't be spending too much time in your room. 

Personally I just didn't feel comfortable in a room that was obviously dirty. It left me thinking that if they couldn't bother to take care of the obvious then there were definitely deep cleaning issues that needed to be addressed.

We stayed in the Indigo tower. I'm assuming this hasn't been renovated recently. Not sure. It didn't look run down. But the features of the bathroom and the lack of convenient electrical outlets reminded me of bygone eras. The room was clean. But there was a scent of mildew, so I could tell there'd been water damage. The shower is a bathtub with a shower curtain. Ugh. They really need to install a proper shower. There is no fan in the bathroom, so the things you don't want in a bathroom linger. Humidity, smells, etc. The Air Conditioner BLASTS air loudly and forcefully into the room. It's very uncomfortable to have cold air blown over you periodically through the night. The bed was fairly comfortable, with the exception of the pillows which were like spongey balls. It was very difficult to sleep with my head bobbling around trying to stay on top of the pillow without sliding off. There were three pillows on the bed and all three were terrible. The outlets in the room were NOT located with the modern traveler in mind. I travel with a little power strip so we can plug in our phones near the bed. But if I hadn't had that thing, they would have been on the floor, far away from either bed because they didn't leave any accessible outlets near the bed. I had to move the bedside table and unplug the alarm clock in order to plug in the power strip. 

The elevators were clean and fast and quiet. Very good for a tall hotel. The hallways were clean, bright and wide. The vending machines were irritating. I had to go to four different floors to find one that would take $1 or $5 bills. I'm NOT going to put a credit card into a hotel vending machine. Ever. And a few of those said bills only and then wouldn't take them.

The housekeeping was competent although not very detailed. 

Checkin was a bit ridiculous. It shouldn't be that slow to check people in. Hell, you could do it with an automated system. If an airline can check you in on your phone in two minutes, surely a hotel could manage to do it in 5.

The food court has comfortable seating. The hotel signage is good. The staff seems friendly. I didn't eat at the restaurants, except for the food court.

Once I got to my room, I was appalled at the condition and lack of cleanliness.  Lampshades were askew.  The carpet was filthy and worn.  The beds did not have proper comforters (I was told this is due to ""hygiene"" -- have never stayed in a hotel that withheld comforters from the beds).  My ""nonsmoking room"" reeked of stale cigarette smoke.  The room was freezing but there was no way to control the temperature from the room.

 I loved the Tequila Bar's food prices. The cup of chilli was actually to big as it was served in a bowl. I felt that I wasted perfectly good food. It was delicious. I did not want that amount. The only issue was the bar across the way had loud music. When I want a conversation with someone, I want to hear them well.

 I went to the Sidewalk Cafe twice. Once for a late lunch. Once you are inside you enjoy the quiet atmosphere. The buffet is small but well worth it.

Still love the rooms at ballys. No other hotel on the strip can you get giant sized (almost suite like) rooms for a low price. Rooms always are well furnished and clean. Room service is fast and efficient. 

Casino is still tight as hell but we are on the las vegas strip mind you. Wanna win 50% of the time?....go to Reno or go to fremont street. I still think this casino has one of the better vibes on the strip. 

God I love those big ass red chairs they put in the corner of every ballys room.There have been times when I slept in those chairs.",6,8,5

It's across from Bellagio and right next to Paris, and is within walking distance to all the other favorite spots (including the Forum Shops at Caesars). 

Just as Monica F. noted, the standard rooms are VERY spacious. The room was clean and looked pretty modern. Not sure when they updated this place, but it was looking good! The only downside to our room was that it was located at the very end of an unusually long hallway. This was not good when we were walking to our room - wincing in pain from our too high heels - from a long night of drinking and dancing. 

If I'm ballin' on a budget in Vegas again, I will seriously consider a return stay at Bally's. It's a wise spot for those looking to spend most of their time out and about, rather than holed up in the hotel's confines. You just need a spot to lie your head, right?",3,1,2

I was very impressed by the makeover. New beds, new decor. Totally redesigned bathroom. No tub just a larger shower. There's a refrigerator in the room  which I think is great especially if you come in summer. Ballys rooms are pretty large, at least 40% bigger than Paris. 

They also have a nice quiet factor, no thin walls. So you can get a good sleep. 
This is gonna be my new go to hotel in Vegas. They just need to remodel the casino.

This is a big tip, if u want a good night sleep then you need to make sure you don't get a room facing the Cromwell casino due to the drais after night club there the music is blaring in your room with the base thumping.  
I believe if you get a room that has odd number not even then your good but if you a room in the even number in the jubilee tower your gonna get a lot of music noise.  

Now the only draw back you won't get a room with a strip view but I prefer a good sound sleep over a great view who cares about the strip view bunch of lights and casinos. You want a view then go up the Eiffel Tower at Paris casino or stratosphere casino observation tower.",8,0,2

Pros:
Checking in was pretty straight forward. From the time I arrived to the time I was in my room took about 10 minutes. Granted,  I arrived 9pm on a Monday, but I was still happy with the fast check in. 

When I opened the door, I was impressed by the size of the room. By far, it was the biggest hotel room I've been in without upgrading. 
Although I was in the north tower,  I still had a decent view of the strip. Captain Chaos took a couple of pictures by the window with a sweet view of the Bellagio fountains. The bed was nice and the bathroom was adequate. 

Cons:
One thing I wasn't expecting was all the extra charges to stay here! When I checked in, I asked where the gym was located because I wanted to get some working out in ti maintain my masculine physique!  The front desk rep said ""the gym is past the north towers and to use them requires an upgrade. ""  Upgrade?!?! $22\/day. Wack!  But I was OK with the fee because I heard the gym was pretty sweet. So I asked the front desk to upgrade me because I wanted to work out after I finished checking in. ""Sir, the gym hours are from 6am to 6pm.""  Ha. What? Excuse me? ....... That's wack!  I understand that a lot of people go to Vegas to have fun and party, but Vegas is also known for conventions.  If someone attending a convention wants to work out, it is not going to happen if you stay at Bally's. But hey, the restaurants are open all night.   

The next issue was the room wifi. They actually charge $13 a day to use in room wifi. Wack!  I've been to smaller non-resort type hotels that not only offer free wifi, but give you breakfast as well!  But hey, I needed the wifi to access some files on my work's network. Btu the in room wifi has horrible connectivity!   I was constantly dealing with dropped signals and slow connection speed. Argh.

Finally,  the room itself had some issues. There wasn't enough outlets by the bed so I had to charge my phones and plug in my laptop across the room. Makes it hard to do work in bed without the lap top's battery dying. Next, the wallpaper was peeling off in several locations in the room. Seemed kind of strange considering Bally's is a resort hotel.  

All things considered,  Bally's room was average,  but the people who helped me were nice. The room rate was relatively low and you are right on the strip, so I think I would stay here again.

Also the rooms don't have a fridge or microwave without a request and a $15 daily fee. And that's only for a fridge, no microwave.

Additionally there is no room service after 1:00pm!

My July 10 check in went smoothly and I was delighted to receive a free upgrade. Both were Travelzoo deals. All was fun and games until it was about time to check out the next day.  At the very least, basic housekeeping expected at any hotel would be a clean toilet. Prior to checkout I lifted the toilet seat to ensure all was flushed as is my morning ritual at home and away. Common courtesy at our home is to use toilet tissue or Lysol wipes to remove any ""debris"" that may have splashed onto the seat. Pardon my disgusting mention but think it is relevant.  Imagine my horror when I discovered what must have been weeks worth of dried up\/ caked-on urine on the underside of that toilet seat. I was nauseated to think I had been sitting on that seat. How can housekeeping neglect to lift a toilet seat to simply run a scrub brush every time they clean a room? I have photos of the seat  that I snapped before leaving as I found this unbelievable, but they are gross and can't imagine YELP would want posted.
 I also phoned and spoke with a Housekeeping Manager and advised that I was checking out  but wanted him to be aware of the situation so that it did not traumatize another guest. At the urging of relatives, I did decide to email Caesars Customer Service today in the hope that all of their housekeeping staff is given a refresher course that lifting a toilet seat to clean after each guest is basic housekeeping 101.",0,0,0

First of all, Bally's location is great since it's smack dab in the middle of the strip. You're right across the street from Bellagio for those fountains, across the corner from Caesar's for Omnia, right next to Cromwell for Drai's, and only an intersection away from Planet Hollywood for some eating and shopping. You're also attached to Paris too but I don't know why people go there.

The casino was clean and smelled clean instead of like stale cigarettes. All the employees I came across were super friendly also. Miguel helped us check in and he hooked it up. I booked a Jubilee room and when we checked in around 9:30 PM on Friday, he apologized that there were none available except the handicap version. He offered a room change on Saturday morning for the 23rd floor. The views were pretty great in both rooms but of course the 23rd floor room's view was a lot better since it faced the rest of the strip in the southern direction. The handicap room was on the 6th floor and faced the LINQ ferris wheel. The handicap room was 1.5x the size of the regular room though and was right next to the elevator so both rooms were both great in their own ways. I wouldn't have minded if we were stuck in the disability room all weekend, especially when our feet were dying after the nightclubs. Just like the casino, the rooms seemed clean and well-kept. There is an iHome in the room but it only has a 30-pin connector (iPhone 4S and earlier) but luckily I had a 30-pin to lightning connector because who doesn't have an iPhone 5+ these days?

Parking was also easy. Self-parking is free and not super difficult to find as long as you're willing to drive up but be warned: the garage feels like a sauna and the elevators are not particularly easy to find. My friend and I wandered a lot more than we needed to the first time we parked. In my experience, it seems like most if not all the Total Rewards hotels say that valet is full except for Diamond and Platinum members but at least self-parking is still free unlike MLife hotels. When coming in from self-parking, make sure to turn right after the escalator instead of walking straight into Paris like I did.

Not really sure what there is to eat at Bally's since we never really looked for food here. We would just walk to PH or drive off the strip to eat. 

Overall, definitely a great value for your money.",3,1,1

1)  Rooms are nice, large, and updated.  The downside is there is a lingering smoker and wet dog smell to the rooms.

3) The casino has a nice collection of slots and offer good and cheaper minimum bets.  I like that a lot!

4) Were requested double beds and ended up with a single.  We had to go back downstairs to make the change.  It's inconvenient since time is taken away from our fun time!

As others have said, you can't beat the location. We were right in the middle of the strip, and it seemed that anything we wanted to see wasn't more than a short walk away. 

I dock a star only because the first night, whoever made the bed had put the sheet over the blanket, and that was kind of weird. Also, some of my hair got caught on the back of the hair dryer when I was using it one morning because the dryer didn't have the plastic safety thing on the back. I was careful the next day, so I didn't have a problem.

This hotel was ok for the price we paid. I could have easily gotten a nicer room at planet Hollywood but since we had others traveling with us , I had to accommodate according to their budget. 

I booked a suite in the south tower with a guaranteed connecting room.

The woman checking us in told me that they DONT guarantee a connecting room. I specifically told her to check the notes because i wouldn't have booked with ballys if that was the case.

Long story short. Her attitude the whole time was condescending , rushed , and down right rude. She didn't even check if there were any available rooms in the north tower. She told me ""nope, sorry "" WITHOUT CHECKING. 

At that point I was pissed off at her attitude , took my room keys went to our room.  

In the end, I called and complained to the assistant manager about the rude customer service I received . Once I told him the name of the worker , the tone in his voice seemed like this person has had many complaints on her already.

3. It's connected to Paris hotel, so it felt like I was staying in Paris hotel for a cheaper hotel price.
4. The floor-cleaning lady at the food court area and the receptionist at the front desk were friendly. 
5. The maid did excellent job in cleaning my room. She replaced my soap and towels every day and gave me extra soap.
6. The room is spacious and clean.
7. The bathroom is also clean and meets my standard.


I think I will stay here again when I go to Vegas next time.

In addition to the unsanitary conditions of the room and the outdated decor what really ticked my off was the $28 ""resort fee."" First off, I was unaware Bally's was a resort.  It's a hotel\/casino! Secondly, when I reserved the room (for a work convention I might add) there was nothing about the fee nor was it mentioned when I checked in.  I even sighed a paper saying $54 was going to be charged to my card.  I stayed two nights of which one was paid for by my company.  Next day I log on to my bank account to see a $28 resort fee followed by another $82 fee which was my room plus another day of resort fee!  I called to question it and was treated like an idiot by Blanca, the women who took the call.  Very dishonest business practices. I will never stay there again...ever!

We had an option to stay in the new Jubilee tower, but that was a bit out of our price range, so we stayed in the North Tower. The room was beautiful, spacious, close to the elevators and the ice\/vending machines. What's more, we had a gorgeous view of Flamingo Blvd!  What really stuck out was that one night, we came back pretty late, and the valet was full, and only open to VIP card holders, but Alfred, the valet supervisor, gives standing orders to his guys that if there are children, or seniors, to go ahead and park the car.  Since our daughter was with us, they did so. Alfred, and the man who parked our car were so genuine and hospitable, I was thoroughly appreciative.

The pool was the same, but not bad...it definitely needs better\/louder music for a better vibe. I like that they have a smaller kid pool where the water is warmer. The ONE unique thing about this pool is that there is a parking structure to the west off the pool....once the afternoon sun drops below the top of that structure, ""POOF"" no more sun, the whole pool area is in the shade, which sucks in non-summer months, because it gets cold!! If you're a summer sun worshipper, that's a definite negative too...

They have a great food court, with a Johnny Rockets, Subway, and Nathan's hotdog place, and a couple other places.  Machines are good, and it's a decent size casino floor as far a Vegas casinos go. Normally a great atmosphere on Saturday night, and they even have live music in the lounge, which is always cool. The walkway over to Paris is also very convenient, and perfect for casino hopping without having to go outside.  Great place to stay...we'll be back!",3,0,0

We booked a room and checked in through the kiosk. Came back and our key wasn't working, so we went to the front desk. Found out they cancelled our room because someone with the same last name checked into the hotel (Yeah, doesn't make sense to us either). We had to go through security to get our stuff out of the room and when trying to get someone to explain what's going on, they tried saying it was our credit card or Vegas.com (we've booked with Vegas.com many times before. They weren't the issue). Finally, a dumbass admitted the kiosks weren't working and they had been having problems with them (didn't even apologize to us). They then ask us if we still want to stay and that we'd be charged in the morning! No place to stay, so we then had to drive back to California (3 hrs.) at 1 am. 

They did the same thing to another guest while we were dealing with the front desk.



Some tips for your staff:
-Check IDs when people are checking in! I'm sure many people have the same last name don't just assume sliding the cards would work.

-Take the kiosks out if they've been an issue

- Should've compted us a room, not ask us to stay, but we'd get charged.",2,0,0

I stayed at Bally's during my most recent trip to Las Vegas. We booked 2 standard rooms with 2 queens in each room. Our rooms were in the South Tower, which I believe is the ghetto-er of the 2 (the other being the North Tower). This observation comes from not knowing where our room was and getting lost in the North Tower for a bit. The South Tower has older carpet, isn't as brightly lit, and might have smaller rooms since it has more rooms.

We finally got to our rooms. They were modest yet pretty spacious (pics). They didn't give us the mini fridge we requested, so we just made the best out of some ice buckets. One of our rooms was fine. It didn't have any weird smells, but had a slight cocoa smell. The other room smelled like Flintstone's vitamins...I kid you not. Also, the hair dryer in that room didn't even work and their sheets were not the cleanest feeling.

Room service was ok. It took 30 minutes to get a plate of appetizers to our room. The front desk, bellboy and the guy who flags down taxis were all very nice people.

Other than that, no complaints! Great view of the Strip from our rooms and being centrally located, you can get to pretty much anywhere. Thank God for the monorail and free shuttles to Rio, or else we would've been roasted by the sun.",0,0,0

I stayed in the newly renovated Jubilee south tower, and got a king luxury looking at the flamingo. Wish I could've got the view of the Eiffel Tower and Bellagio fountains. Only negative to the north side is the music playing in the brand new shopping plaza, also the guy playing and beating on buckets to make a buck. Although he's good, I just wish he'd shut the f*** up during rough morning hangovers. Oh well, my bad. 
     So the casino is not huge, but has all the games you would find in any. If you're not satisfied with its size, Paris is connected with restaurants and stores that lead you to a little bigger casino. That or Bellagio or ceasers across Las Vegas blv. Ballys has two restaurants hidden in south east corner of the casino. A steak joint called BLT Steak, and a Thai place called SEA. There's also a food court and small bagel\/sandwich shops. You'll also find three bars on the casino floor, although I think one is open later for entertainment. 
     I'd definitely stay here again, but my goal is to always stay some place different. Unless prices are through through the roof, then Ballys it is. Enjoy!",4,0,1

Its the perfect middle ground - average in every way - and would probably be a big hit if your an avid reader of Consumer Reports.

The location couldn't be better. The problem is that visiting the neighbors are the best part of staying at this hotel. Its got great neighbors to visit - Bellagio, Paris, Cromwell, and CP - all in the Harrahs family BTW with the exception of Bellagio... heck, maybe its all part of the plan with the recent Boyd\/Harrahs tax deferred Barbary\/Echelon exchange. 

There is a top rated club at CP, outstanding food options at Bellagio, a romantic view of the fountains at Eiffle Tower, and a killer pool party at the Cromwell. You could amuse yourself all day with just the neighbors here. With the pedestrian bridges there is no reason to ever move your car or take a Taxi anywhere.

Big things happening here at Ballys - new drug store tacked on the face of the property. One of the most awkward things of this hotel is that it is set so far back from the Strip. It had this strange long moving walkway like they have at airports. For people with low attention spans its a problem. They tried to remedy the issue with advertisements but I'm sure the property still failed at attracting as much Strip foot traffic as possible. 

Rooms are old and vary slightly depending on what tower your in. Good value - no frills in the standard rooms. The value of the rooms are so good I would actually compare a larger upgraded room to the base room at Bellagio. Price-wise that is the comparison you would have to make.

I have yet to eat the Sterling brunch. I have just watched the price for it skyrocket over the past 15 years. Maybe I haven't gone there yet to give me something to look forward to. I've got high hopes. They are known for their dancing show Jubilee. The ladies wear feathers and diamond crusted bikini dealies. Its a classy show - especially for Vegas standards. After a 34 year run would they really pull the plug on the resident show that is the only differentiating thing that sets Bally's apart from a Hilton Garden Inn down the road?!

I still do think something is missing from this hotel. I love Harrahs and am loyal to them and want this place to do well. My constructive criticism is that it is still missing that something something that appeals to ones emotions. No I didn't mean a drugstore slapped on the front. Perhaps a better logo like SLS, or a doorman on The Stip like Sir Francis Drake in San Francisco... Gosh, I'm not part of the marketing team here with a six figure salary - I shouldn't be asking these questions... But a leprechaun running around the casino floor might be more helpful than you could imagine. Maybe he could have a girlfriend too - re-hire one of the Jubilee! ladies or something.

This resort caters to traditional consumer values - but I think the kind of people that go off those values probably aren't in Vegas in the first place.",1,0,1

I have been checked in since Monday night and I am due to check out tomorrow, 4\/13\/17. I am highly displeased w\/this hotel because their staff is HORRIBLE. It is just myself w\/my 9 & 10-year-old and I've been treated abhorrently since I arrived. I just called the front desk to share my grievances with whomever I could speak with, and in light of everything I shared with Anisha, she offered a $30 food & beverage credit.

Let me go back to Monday night: 
The bell man delivered my luggage to my room and after greeting him, I asked, ""Do you have change for a $100? He already seemed annoyed when he arrived and he replied, ""As long as it's not counterfeit. Is it counterfeit?"" Taken aback, I responded: ""I HOPE it's not counterfeit, I withdrew the money from YOUR ATM."" The man smirked, walked past me and asked, ""Is your phone broken? It shows you've been calling and then hanging up."" I said ""Yes! It does seem to be broken, I kept trying to call for my luggage, but there was no dial tone- only a weird noise could be heard, so I had to dial out from the other phone on the desk by the window."" The man went over to the phone, appearing incredulous that the phone was not working and tried using it, but encountered the same problem. He said, ""I guess you can just use the other phone."", and left. I thought to myself, 'did I seriously just tip him 10 bucks to insult me by implying I had counterfeit money?'

Next, Tuesday 4\/11\/17:
I took a shower and the shower was so clogged, I had soapy water to just around my shins, which was very unpleasant, unless you ENJOY a shower in a clogged tub. I had to call to report that I either wanted to change rooms or get the tub fixed, (on the desk phone, of course, since the main phone was not working). The person I spoke with sent someone to fix the tub while my children and I were out to dinner. You should not have to make maintenance calls while you're on vacation; especially when you pay at least $30 a night for a ""resort fee"" which covers your wi-fi and I-don't-know-what else.

Today, Wednesday 4\/12\/17:
I came back to Bally's after having dinner with my children and I pulled into the valet where we sat for a few minutes in my car, waiting for someone to approach us.  I was speaking with my child, who then gestured there was someone at the car.  The valet was standing next to my door with his arms crossed over his chest, looking irked- never mind the fact I sat and waited patiently for someone to come assist us. I explained that I am a guest at Bally's and needed to leave the car overnight. With the arms crossed over his chest, and no 'Hello', he replied, ""Will you put the car in park?"" How difficult would it have been to say Hello? I thought, 'Wow, why so rude?' It was very awkward. This was the final 'straw'; I took time off work to come to Bally's to enjoy Spring Break with my children, not to prepare myself with quick ""come-backs"" to smart remarks and attitudes at my, seemingly, every turn.

As I explained to Anisha, maybe one incident doesn't seem like a big deal, but with everything combined, it was too much. With tears of frustration I communicated that I was fine with a $30 food credit, as long as she could say she'd honestly be fine with it, were she in my shoes. She didn't care to respond to that, and for this reason, I will never return to Bally's ever again.

*Update: It is now 3:26 a.m. and I am now home after a 4-hour drive from Vegas. Disappointed by the offer of a $30 food and beverage credit, (which would get me as far as a sandwich and maybe a coke), after speaking with Anisha, I called the front desk once again and asked to speak w\/a supervisor. After speaking with a young man who said his supervisor offered no more than credit for 2 of the resort fees, I was finally transferred to said supervisor, who, when she finally provided her name it was, ""just Michelle"".  The following is a condensed version of my interaction with Michelle: 

When Michelle initially picked up the call her ""greeting"" was a brusque, ""Yes? How can I help you."", without introducing herself or stating her name. I advised Michelle that how she answered was inappropriate and unprofessional as an assistant manager, especially in the public service sector- she was unfazed.  When I asked for her last name, to note who I spoke with in my letter to corporate, she said, ""I'm not giving you my last name."" (Nor that of her supervisor, ""Fabian"").  When I asked why, her nasty reply was, ""Because- I'm just not.""  Michelle stated my grievances ""did not warrant"" the removal of each resort fee, only two.  After I informed Michelle that I posted a Yelp review that detailed the poor treatment I experienced, e-mailed the corporate office with a copy of my Yelp review, and advised her I was leaving the hotel promptly and was going home; she was indifferent.  I ended the call, got my children out of bed, gathered our belongings and drove 4 hours back home.",7,3,0

She said my head snapped back as my glasses flew to the floor. We immediately told a nearby security guard what happened and asked him for an ice pack. He led us to a back room where I was asked how many quarters are in a dollar and a few other simple questions that I easily answered, and was given an ice pack. I had to fill out an incident report and then we left.

The rest of our evening was subdued as I felt a little off. We had dinner and then retired to our room and shut out the lights to sleep at 9:30.

I woke up at 3:00 AM to a screaming headache. At 4:30 AM we tried calling room service for water and Tylenol but the front desk said room service doesn't open until 6:00. I tried again after 6:00 but they said they only deliver food and to try security. I laid back down and tried to relax but eventually got up and showered. By this time my headache was only pounding, and I noticed that we had a vm message--from a hotel manager wondering how I was doing. I called him back and said I was not okay, but had a pounding headache and needed some water and Tylenol. He said he can't dispense medication but will send up an EMT. When the EMT arrived she looked around the room, told me where the nearest CVS store is located and said I could get some Tylenol there or in the liquor store in the lobby, and then she left.

Ultimately I charged two bottles of water and two doses of Tylenol to our room from the lobby liquor store. When we checked out, I suggested Bally's pay for the Tylenol charge but the front desk declined saying, ""we're not authorized to adjust charges but you could contact Risk Management.""

Customer service was sub-standard and superficial, so I'm quite sure I'll never stay at Bally's in Vegas again. I'd say they nickel and dime you to death with additional charges, but that would be an understatement since the additional charges are highly inflated. 

Also, the free ""self-parking"" was difficult to find (not sure we ever did) and blocks away in the Planet Hollywood garage, we were accosted not once but twice by slick sales people peddling future visits to Bally's, only two devices are allowed connection to their ""free wifi,"" there's nothing good to watch on their televisions, though you can rent a movie for $17.99, and the smell of skunk weed permeated the hallways and wafted into our room on the ""no smoking floor.""

Hey, Vegas is all about hardcore capitalism, but I already paid for 3 nights. Let me check out the cleanliness of the hotel before I decide to go to a four hour meeting on buying a condo. Disclaimer: ALL of the big resorts are doing this, so I might be a bit harsh about this. 

Check-in was pretty quick, and I used the ""twenty dollar trick"" at the counter. A very nice woman knew the score and helped us upgrade to a deluxe room for free. Good clean room, nice couch and wonderful view of that gambling mecca Imperial Palace (hellhole). 

Location was excellent, attached to Paris and walkways to Bill's, Cesears and the Bellagio. It's in the heart o' the strip. 

The casino was a bit hoity-toity, but serviceable for table-gamers. Limits were $10 craps\/blackjack, but the dealers (played with about 10 21 dealers, numerous craps dealers) were a bit sterile. A smile would be nice once or twice, especially if they get a toke, but alas.

The people at Sea & BLT Steak were awesome.  Everyone polite, respectful, cleanly dressed.  Both these restaurants are GREAT and I highly recommend them as the staff at both were awesome, accommodated my random dietary request without issue and made me feel welcome every time.

Otherwise for lodging experience, not as positive.  I am here for work, this does not cater to that.

I read reviews and was lucky enough NOT to ask for a newer room (which I frankly would have preferred, the bed was pretty rickety).  Those newer rooms in Jubilee happen to be across from Drai's which apparently has a roof top bar open till 4 or 6am or something.  Not good because I am here for work Wednesday-Saturday.

I was looking forward to a mellow workweek, the conference is IN this hotel, but this is NOT the hotel for you if are here for a those things.  SEVERAL reasons:

-  This must be the ONLY hotel on the planet with NO ROOM SERVICE AFTER 1PM.  Yes 1 P M.  Delivery from 6am - 1pm ONLY.  So no dinner in my room after a long day unless I go trek around with the tourists and throngs to bring it back.  Sad.

-  Gym closes at 6pm.  So if you are in a session until even 5, good luck getting a decent workout in unless you go at 6am, when it opens.

-  No COFFEE makers in the room.  Or fridges.  So I have to get up at the crack of dawn to try to make it to the gym and back to get ready for my room before 7:15 with NO IN ROOM COFFEE !!!  GAH !!!

One plus is they do have a SEA Thai restaurant, I went to the one in Brooklyn when I lived there and the food is good.  So I ate Thai for 4 days and they were nice enough to make a healthy steamed plate for me.

We got there early and had the option to pay $30 to check in early but there weren't any rooms available so we just dumped our bags with the bellhop (for free).

When we did get into the room, it wasn't great. Asked for non-smoking room and it was like a cave of cigarette smoke and there were burn holes on the sheets on the bed. Totally tacky and gross. We called down and got a new room fairly quickly and it was MUCH better.

THE GOOD
*Bed and pillows were fantastic!
*Room is huge, bathroom is huge, shower pressure is nice
*Location is really great--close to everything and there's a bus stop right in front
*The gym is FANTASTIC! Huge! Nice equipment! It's worth the $20
*The pool was really nice and fairly low-key. Still the party atmosphere but not totally douchey and it was never so crowded we couldn't get chairs. 
*Casino was small but it was nice and looked newly remodeled.

THE BAD
*The drinks at the pool are SUPER expensive and I don't think they actually put alcohol in them. WASTE OF MONEY
*The lady at the front desk was kind of rude when we were checking in but everyone else that worked there was super nice, so not sure where to rate this...

I would stay here again for an affordable weekend trip. If I was looking for something a little fancier, I'd probably stay somewhere else.",2,0,0

The room we had was spacious... hey, it fit 6 of us girls and all of our stuff comfortably. Only complaint would be the LONG walk from the elevator to our room. Not fun to do after a night out in heels.

When visiting Las Vegas and staying on the strip, you don't really spend much time in your room, so the fancier more expensive hotels are kind of a waste of money. Bally's is great! Puts you in the center of everything and you have incredible views of everything else from your room. I do recommend you request the jubilee tower as it is newer, renovated and nicer than the older indigo tower. I'm hoping they renovate the indigo tower so the entire place is nice. The hotel could use some better restaurants in it but the food court isn't bad. The pool could really use some updating but it's super fun either way. 

Also if you stay at bally's you have access to the other hotels associated with it which is great! Paris' pool is nicer. It has a more quiet vibe compared to bally's. 

Across from bally's is a cool nightclub called drai's. Highly recommend going there if you're looking for a fun night! Don't really recommend drai's after hours. 

If you meet Elvis, one of the supervisors at bally's you are lucky! He's wonderful and has incredible customer service skills! He really saved the day when we experienced some miscommunication at check in.",4,1,1

No matter where we end up staying, I always find myself having a great time sitting at the Rapid Roulette table by the lounge in the back of the casino. I always get fast service and enjoy the skilled cover bands that play at the lounge.

From that table you can easily walk over to the Paris and grab a slice of Pizza or hit the buffet. 

Bally's looks very outdated when you're coming into it from the strip, but once you're inside you'll enjoy yourself as it's fairly modern for an older casino. 

It's certainly no Wynn or Bellagio, but I always enjoy myself here.",2,0,0

- Stayed in the North Tower of the hotel with a view of the north side of the strip.  $40 on a Saturday.  Pretty good.

- Near EVERYTHING we love in Vegas... very easy walking distance to everything.

- Parking was somewhat close (had to go through Paris), but easy.

- Room was renovated (we think?) and was more than adequate for our $40 one-night stay.

- Bed was comfortable and linens were seemingly clean.

- Bathroom was much larger than most ""standard"" hotel rooms on the strip.  And clean with lots of towels.

- Ballsy has one of my favorite casinos, and connected to Paris, which also has a great casino.

- Express check-out made it a whole lot easier.

- Widescreen TV (not HD), but still had all the channels we liked.



CONS:

- Check-in took FOREVER.

- On the way to Hotel Registration, was stopped by a guy trying to sell us on a hotel package.... we had just arrived and I was flu-ish and the last thing we needed was to be held up by a guy trying to sell us a bad deal.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get get rid of this promotion... NO ONE WILL BUY IT!!!!

- Concierge says no restaurants in the hotel are open after midnight.  So when we returned to our room at 1pm and needed something eat -- whatever, as long as it's close -- our only option was heading to Paris or somewhere across the street.  Trudge, trudge, trudge.  And the cold air from the cold night was sobering.  (Ballys -- Your Sea website says they're open until 2am, but yet they closed at midnight.  Pffft.)

- Bottled water at the gift shop is $5.

- Wi-Fi is $14.  Cellular service on the iPad sucked.


All in all, I'd probably book again, but will bring some snacks with me in the future.",5,1,0

Service associated with my conference was awesome.  We had morning pastries, muffins and coffee.  We had a buffet style lunch that accommodated meat lovers and vegetarians which included water, sodas and dessert - all which was yummy!  In the afternoon we had chilled sodas.  A water cooler, ice and cups were provided throughout the day.  The front desk staff was very courteous, in person - not so much on the phone.  My reason for the three star drop mostly had to be for services associated with the room.  There was no coffee machine and associated accoutrements.  Room service is from 6am - 1pm ONLY!  Housekeeping did NOT remove my discarded food delivery leftovers until I personally put them in a trash bag.  AND when i did order coffee from room service, those items were also left behind for two days - even after I placed it outside the room on the floor, as I saw other people do.  And don't expect any service on the casino floor along the full length of the front entrance.  I know, it's Vegas and not to expect much when the drinks are free, but still --  using the service call button twice did not result in any wait staff to show up.  The room size was nice.

The standard rooms have tons of popcorn ceiling texture, dated wallpaper and furniture, and the bathrooms are nothing special.

The casino isn't that great either, luckily Paris and Bally's are connected so you can just walk over to Paris for more choices on games and a better atmosphere.

The price is usually very reasonable to stay here and most all hotels in Vegas have the unavoidable resort fee. The pool has a tropical vibe and it's nearly 12ft deep! The one drawback is that they have no jacuzzi, but you have access to the other Ceasar's properties pools. Some are gratis and others require a nominal fee. I myself head over to the Paris Hotel since it's complimentary and they have two jacuzzis. There is definitely a long line at check in. There is a steam\/sauna which is all apart of your resort fee!
Bally's is known for their Sterling Brunch with free flowing champagne. The location is the winning attribute has it is located dead smack center with easy access to the monorail for the other hotel properties.

I also like the friendly people who work there. 

There was a bell woman by the name of Lisa who was outstanding. She was so friendly, and told us how to navigate our way through her hotel. My friend was in a wheelchair, so this was very helpful. She rented a wheelchair for about $10.00 a day for 4 days.

Our room was huge, comfortable, and clean. No smokey smell. Yes, it could have used a makeover, but we were still pleased for the value vs\/ the price. We paid about $78.67 a night, Sunday through Tuesday. We felt that the price was fair to good. We did not give any extra money to the front desk person, but we didn't care. How much time do you spend in your room, anyway?

The Buca di Beppo all you can eat breakfast, was a very good value for $15.99. I would suggest that you pick up a couple of gift cards from Costco for $79.00 for $100.00 worth of food. The gift cards work here.

There was a Thai restaurant (forgot the name) that was good, but the portions were surprisingly small for the price. My favorite dish was the dessert....a mango sticky rice. MMMM. Don't order the vegetables. They were cheap..mostly celery, carrots, and a little broccoli. 

There is a Starbucks at the corner in the front mini-mall, and a CVS in the next building to the left of the hotel, facing the main street. The CVS is expensive, but better to buy bottled water there than the hotel (a bottle of water costs between $4-5.00 in the hotel shops).

Self parking (free) was in a shared lot with Paris.  A bit of a hike but you do get a glimpse of the Paris shopping mall and Bally's casino floor. Valet was also available.  Check-in was as expected.  Long lines unless you had VIP status.  

As for the rest of the room, the ""junior suite"" we received was huge but lacked furniture.  It had 2 queens, a couple of desks, 2 random dining like chairs, and entertainment cabinet.  There was enough empty space for at least 2 more queen beds in the main area.  The pieces that were present looked old and a result of a cost conscious renovation.  The bathroom was on the smaller end but serviceable and not noteworthy.  Standard amenities were provided - shampoo, condition, and soap.   No lotion.

I had avoided Bally's based on the reviews but this recent trip to Las Vegas was just a 6 hour stopover so i didn't care to drop that much monies on a room that I would rarely see.  The casino was meh as well.  It has all the standard games and sportsbook but not a lot of energy.  Paris next door is a better option.

The first time I stayed here, in 2009 or '10, the Indigo rooms were the newer ones, and Jubilee were the old ones. Then they renovated the Jubilee side and now folks are complaining about the seediness of what was - not so long ago! - the ""nice"" side. The difficult part of reading online reviews is figuring out the review-writer's expectations, and whether they are similar to yours. I'm not a luxury sort of gal - I've never had that sort of money - so my expectations are for clean and decent, and that's exactly what I get at Bally's.

Rooms and bathrooms are large. There are annoying fees, but that's a Vegas thing. You come to Vegas, you deal with weird things like no coffee maker (they want you to leave the room) and no fridge, and sky high ""resort"" fees. It's part of the price of doing business. Since I know what to expect in Vegas, no complaints there.

Great experiences with check-in (even though I was directed to a spot by a name that should've been, like, on a sign somewhere so I could figure out where to go without asking three different people), and check out, which can now be done online. Every employee I interacted with was either just fine, or downright pleasant, including the friendly cleaning dude I exchanged ""Merry Christmas'"" with at 4:00 in the morning.

Our favorite casino game kept dying - it was out of service when we first arrived, to our disappointment (The Big Wheel - look for it! It's fun!). The next time we checked it was working! Then not working. Then working! And it stayed working, as far as I could tell, for the rest of our visit. Oh, we arrived Christmas eve, so even on this day, the repair folk are working their tushes off.

Drink service in the casino is okay. Not great, but perfectly okay. You have a better chance of being offered a drink if you're not on the slots.

Ventilation (poor) in the casino area is the worst thing about this hotel.

The webpage information about the fitness center is confusing. Your resort fee covers admission to the fitness center, which is inside\/behind the spa. However, they closed early on Christmas eve, without warning, and we didn't bother checking again, so we didn't get to try it out.

So the first time I visited, the experience was not so bad.  However, I made several requests to be moved over to a different tower as my husband and I were travelling with family and my husbands brother and cousin were placed in the same tower.  Someone at the front desk said they moved us over to the same tower as our family for the next day which was great for us only to find out the next morning that we were going to be charged extra.  This would have been fine if it had been explained to us the night before.  

The next time I stayed to redeem the rest of the package I had purchased all was well, or so I thought.  When I was going to bed, I pulled back the covers only to find a red stain across the sheets.  Whether it was blood or lipstick, this shouldn't have happened.  Aren't the people in housekeeping paying attention?  I did take several picture and went down to the front desk to complain.  Only to be greeted by the rudest lady I have ever met.  I am very big on customer service and expect to be treated well.  After all, if this had been my hotel, I would want people to return.  

She sent housekeeping up to change our sheets after insisting that it was probably rust on the sheets.  (I'm not stupid I know what a little rust would look like)  The lady that changed our sheets was a hot mess.  she was dropping the pillows and blankets on the floor and was stepping all over it.  This bothered me terribly as I don't even do this at my own home.  Clean linens should never touch the ground.

Could the staff have been ANY MORE DIFFICULT to work with?

Why is it so hard to give us the right room the first time?
Why is it so hard to give us the right room after you messed up the first time?
Why is it so hard to give us an upgrade from the first time, considering you made the mistake?
Why do we have to spend a good 10 minutes on the phone with front desk, getting transferred from person to person, only to be forced to ask to speak to a manager, in order for you to make things right?

I've never stayed at Bally's before, but I've stayed in Vegas a million and a half times, and I'd never had such difficulty in figuring out a room reservation.  What's strange is, we'd reserved everything in advance, and it was still difficult.  I've literally WALKED IN without reservations to random hotels in Vegas and had easier times getting a decent room.

Strange, I say.

Oh, and the casino is tiny but functional.

In the end, the room that we ended up with wasn't bad at all, except for the fact that we had a CRT tv.  What hotels in Vegas have CRT tvs nowadays?  Then again, it didn't really matter.  Who goes to Vegas to watch tv?

Last complaint...

Maybe it's the fact that the Harrah's chain hates me after the ""incident"" a few years ago.  Or maybe the chain has just gotten sheisty over the past few years.

Whatever the case, WHY IS HARRAH'S ENT. SO STINGY WITH THEIR COMP POINTS?!",7,7,6

The only thing what we dont like the ventilation does not work in the room. We cant ope the window either. So at night my husband could not sleep with really heavy air. It was a little smoky.

So we called on more time to ask about technician. They said ok and we left our room about 6 pm. We back at 12 am and noticed nobody was here. So we called again.

We scored another great Hotwire deal for two nights, then checked in with a teething 11-month old and a mother-in-law who wanted to see what the big deal was with Vegas before she went back to England. Minus one star for the painfully long check-in queue; I suggest they either put more reps at the counters, or have reps in the queue ready to hold luggage and whining children. Or your Starbucks, if you're single and get to sleep in and enjoy hot baths and food and have an entirely different Vegas experience damn you where did my life go.

The room was a two-queener with blah cable and a sprawling view of the roof, but spacious and very clean. We got a free fridge for our child's food, but it took three calls to get it up to our room. Still four stars, as I should have called ahead to request it. It also took three calls and three visits from housekeeping before we got the extra blankets we requested. They're also pretty firm on the 11am checkout time, but if you're nice and have children, or can borrow one from another family, they will give you until 11:30 to get to steppin. A $28 resort fee gets you ""free"" wi-fi, which is accessible by simply entering in the room number and the last name of the person who checked in. 

Good walking path through Paris to get to the Strip. On the other side, escalators (or elevators if you are pushing a stroller God help me) take you across and down to Bally's entrance, where Starbucks is waiting to save your life. Walgreens and the Miracle Mile shops are just two hotels over (just past Paris and Planet Hollywood). We usually do Excalibur for our contemporary room with the rollercoaster view (yes, I am that lame), but I have to say that I felt safer at Bally's, there were less children running around, and there was no cigarette toothpaste smell in the casino. You also get an Express Checkout option at the end of your stay (just grab a pen and a card and fill out the particulars).

The fitness center was actually a little disappointing and the once famous Big Kitchen Buffet wasn't all that great (it used to be spot on for dinner).

Ballys is in a perfect location on the strip and shares the same lot as Paris hotel. We could hear and see the Ballagio water show and were very pleased at the cheap rate.

Positive: large rooms, clean, and location! we were right off the strip which made it easy to wallk around and enjoy the sights.

Negative: Front desk service was lacking badly, although some of the other staff had excelllent customer service. There is no Wifi, so that sucked, and if you needed high speed you had to pay 14bucks! also the shower\/tub was clogged, and no coffee in the rooms. I had to pay almost 4 bucks for a cup of coffee in the lobby! 

Overall it was okay, but understand I am not taking into account any of the other amenities. I was there on business, I did not even have time to go to the pool, the restuarants, shops, or even gamble. (which I don't like to anyway) 

So, 2 stars. I guess if you just need a place to stay, take of business and leave, and enexpensive (i believe?) I don't know, my accommodations were paid for, so I can't really complain too much.

We just returned from a Birthday trip for my daughter... we had four rooms at Bally's. The two rooms that were in the ""old tower"" were entirely unacceptable. They were not only old and tired but filthy and in total disrepair. One room even had a bloody hand print on the wall! Dirty linens, stained carpets, marred furniture, stained bathroom amenities, the list is long. We went to the front desk to see about changing a room and were told they were totally sold out so no other rooms available. Then, when I offered a tip, the nice young lady said, ""well I can probably find one but it will be an extra $75 per night"". When I told her that was ridiculous, considering they were already paying $250 per night, she kindly reduced the upgrade fee to $40 per night. How funny that she miraculously found a room! Extortion just like the old Mob days!

We had our choice of two free rooms at any Caesar's property and chose Bally's only because it was less expensive for those who had to pay. We will never make that mistake again. You could not pay me to stay there again.

The gambling was the worst I've experienced in my 30 years of experience. I don't expect to get rich but a simple return once in a while would have been reasonable. I didn't believe the horrible gambler reviews online about this place buy now I understand and agree.

The only decent thing about this hotel is its location. However, there are so many better choices in the area and price range. One bright spot - A couple of the staff members were very nice, particularly the lady at the Diamond Desk.

In my defense, it was a last minute trip and we were only there for about 6 hours to see friends visiting for a wedding.  My other friend had booked it because it was the first hotel that came up on her search and the room, no joke, was $30. 

Anyways, back to my review....I think Bally's marketing team literally dropped off coupons for rooms at every trailer park in America.  I'm not judging but I kind of am.  As a woman, I honestly felt uncomfortable walking through this hotel at certain times because their patrons seem to also be residents of the local prison (just an assumption).  I have never in my life seen more flannel print since 1992.

In regards to the staff.  The bellman, valet, and housekeeping were all very sweet.  Everyone else we encountered just seemed lost.  When we ordered a coffee at the deli, the cashier looked at my friend like she had just requested she solve a statistic equation and she was about to pass out.  Took like 10 minutes for the coffee with no one else in line.

It was such a hike to get to my room, but when I got there, it paid off, I booked for a classic room, but he gave me a deluxe one, nice, the room was spacious and been renovated, bathroom had marbles, was clean and bigger than in my house lol.

We chose our stay at Bally's for our past weekend trip due to a pretty good Groupon deal. Room rates: weekend @  $79 & weekday @ $35.

We check-ed in after 7PM on a Friday night and the line was minimal. Our front-desk gal was friendly and we requested for the highest floor possible in the renovated Jubilee Tower. She gave us floor 65 :)  Our room view faced Caesars Palace, Bellagio, Flamingo, Drais, & LinQ.

The room was spacious. The bed did not disappoint. We napped for hours on Sat night & missed out on clubbing! :\  The bathroom was clean & comfortable.  Definitely call Housekeeping for a humidifier (generally available) for it'll really help with the dry air!

What I've noticed this time around that I didn't before was when you open the room lights it does take a little time to warm up & then it really lights up the room. At 1st, we were like the room looks so dim & thought it was for romantic room purposes :P


:: NOTES ::

1) Fridge is hidden in the dresser below the TV. You need to turn it on to get it working. Fridge does not come stocked with goodies. So it's great to bring your own & fill it up.

2) Bathroom amenities were minimal: 1 bath bar, 1 face bar, 1 shampoo\/conditioner & 1 lotion

3) Each day could be a different housekeeper cleaning your room -- so we tipped house keeping couple of dollars per day of our stay there. 

4) Valeting the car was much easier & quicker than self-parking. Not much wait time either (at most 10 min) when we went this past weekend. 

5) We didn't bother checking out at the front desk nor through the TV nor online. We just left our keys in the room & headed home. A day later I received my invoice via email.",18,5,6

My girl and I stayed at the Venetian back in January and I honestly like this better. Better location and they had 10 dollar min tables. Now you're not going to get the high end thrills and luxury of places like the Venetian or Aria but I'm barely in the room anyways. When I go to Vegas it's for the action not to sleep all day! Why not 5 stars? Well the pool is just OK, food options are very limited, and the bed could have been better if there was more than one blanket. Overall though it was extremely satisfying and worth way more than I had paid for it. Staff was friendly enough and I wouldn't hesitate to come back.

Now, let's list some of the issues:

1. It took 25 minutes to check in, and I started at only number 3 in line. There were at least 15 positions at the check-in counter, but only 3 employees working.

2. The air conditioning in my room would not cool things off below 75 degrees.

3. The shower temperature varied between lukewarm and ""meh,"" regardless of how high I turned the knob.

4. The drain in the tub was mostly blocked, leaving me standing in 5"" of soapy water at the end of a quick shower.

5. The tub and bathroom floor had many long, black hairs on them. My hair is neither long nor black.

6. The TV is enclosed in a cabinet that will not allow you to view it from anywhere but on the bed. So much for watching a movie while you eat your room service dinner at the desk...

Overall, the negatives outweigh the positives. For the same price, I could stay at an off-strip, 2-star hotel and get the same treatment. Sorry, Bally's. I'm not impressed in the slightest.",0,0,0

CONS: VERY standard amenities, skimped on toiletries\/towels, idle employees during check-in chaos.

Would recommend to those not looking to spend a whole lot of money to be on The Strip.

-----

As the 3\/5 stars review suggests, there is not anything too special about this place. It is your standard hotel\/casino, neither a shit hole or a palace, that is conveniently located on The Strip: Across from Bellagio and Caesar's Palace, connected to Paris, and about a 5 minute walk to The Cromwell\/Drai's day club. Because of these things, you would not be paying for top-notch amenities or amazing rooms, your money is investing in the great location. Staying here allowed us to walk everywhere we needed to go, inebriated and not. 

In terms of the room, unless you are staying in a suite or in a newly renovated room, it is really just a place to sleep and sober up. The only complaints I have are that during the height of check-in on Friday, there were employees that seemed to just be standing around and talking to employees that were actually working and struggling, and that the rooms had the very minimal toiletries and towels. 

Not a GREAT place to stay, but it is a place to stay if you are looking to wreck havoc in Las Vegas and do not plan on staying in the room very much. If you are going to be in the room for some time, the TV's have TNT movies at least.",1,1,2

Classic.

These words are what accurately describe Bally's Las Vegas (formally MGM Grand).  As always I had a comp room offer and didn't hesitate to book for our family trip because it was FREE! I'm more a mid roller and I'm glad to still receive free rooms from Ballys, Flamingo, Harrah's and Rio. It's great to see a part of Vegas history still alive on the Vegas strip now that Stardust and Frontier are gone. 

But anyways, the best thing about Bally's is the direct location on the strip right across from Bellagio where you can see the fountains from the Indigo and South Tower. Back in the day, Bally's in the 70's was the Bellagio of it's time and time sure did take a toll on this property. Let's be honest here, the rooms are alright, clean and cozy. The casino is plus because it's easy to maneuver compared to Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. Just a few second away is the Paris hotel connected to the Bally's casino, what a great way to keep your guests from lingering to their competitors. 

Their food options are great with a food court in the basement and a 24 hour cafe but that will soon be replaced with a hipper restaurant. Tables minimums are low and slots didn't pay as much compared to Paris. Getting comp rooms at Bally's is pretty easy if you gamble a few $$$ in their casino. As always, the hotel is nothing fancy and still has that 90's vibe to it with the retro furniture. Not a lot of outlets in the room to charge your electronics.",28,20,25

Bad enough that the place is run down from the oldest slot machines in Vegas to the crap furniture that's been around since Elvis Presley was born. Velvet sofas in the rooms, crappy pillows and if that's not bad enough every staff member I encountered or was forced to interact with was completely worthless and did not give a rats ass about customer service. Each one passed the buck like they didn't give a F*cK. Really these idiots are in the service business? And can receive tips?

$3 each for 2 8 oz bottles of water that they give out for free? $6 for 2 bottles of water I picked up on the way to my room 2 nites in a row for free now cost $6? Idiot. 

I complained to Chris Lowe Director of Operations who also didn't seem to care. This was the last straw for me. We checked out even though we had 5 more nights paid in advance. We moved to Encore where so far they are customer service oriented.

The line moved pretty quickly, thanks 24 oz beer :) Since we wanted adjoining rooms with our friend, the lady checking us in told us that adjoining rooms are 1 king bed adjoined to 2 queen beds. That option would not work for us, so we asked if we could at least be on the same floor as our friends. When our friends arrived, they were in the room right across from us!! Even better!

Stayed in the Jubilee tower (room 6515). AWESOME view of the strip by the way!!!  The rooms are very spacious, and clean! Beds are comfy and plush! No bathtub but the shower was very relaxing with the rainfall shower head. 

After the day club and eating Earls Sandwich, we decided to go back to the room for a quick nap. That quick nap lasted for 2-3 hours!!! We had a show to catch at 9, and we still had to get ready! Me, being dumb, plugged in a blow dryer while my friend was using one too. Before we knew it, the power to the restroom turned off along with some power in the room. I called housekeeping and within 10 minutes maintenance went to the generator outside the room and fixed the power inside the room. We thought the restroom would be fixed too so we didn't bother calling again. We got ready in our friends restroom across from us and headed to the show! When we came back, still no power in restroom. I called housekeeping again, and within 5 mins, maintenance came inside the room, poked something on the outlet and lights turned on! we felt stupid :(

Overall, an GREAT stay here at Bally's. Prime location in the middle of the strip. Will DEF stay here again in the future! :)

I also liked how you can select a time to check out via phone! Saved some time and didn't have to check out at front desk.

Bally's is nicely straddled by Paris and Flamingo and in my opinion is right where you want to be on the Strip, destinations easy walking distance in both directions. No theme unlike other hotels.

The Casino is smaller than most, which I think is great. You can always find a chair at one of your favorite slot games.  I have stayed in both the newly renovated tower and the older tower. Both rooms were clean, and spacious. I like that there are not lines for the elevators. The staff is friendly, Brystine (I believe was his name) the concierge was awesome, helped me out a lot by finding me different places and deals to celebrate my new years eve. My only complaint was when I stayed here in Sept last year, my room overlooked the Paris tower and the fountains.. I heard the night club outside quite a bit and you could hear the fountains. The second night I toned out the fountains.. but the night club was tough (only happened on Saturday night), I needed more drinks that night to fall asleep. I know it is not an expensive place to stay, for the price it is great! I did always have hot water for a shower, so that was a plus. 

I have stayed at Bally's, MGM, Mirage, Luxor, Quad, Monte Carlo, Flamingo and Mandalay Bay. This is my second favorite place to say, but 1st for those on a budget.

All three times I went for work and stayed at Mandalay Bay, Hilton and Paris and I had never had anything stolen. For the first time I went to vegas for a vacation and stayed at Ballys I had my charger stolen. I arrived at Bally on 5 Feb and departed on 9 Feb, 2015. On Saturday 7 Feb, my family and I left at 6.30am to take tour of Grand Canyon. As I was in a hurry I left my ipad charger behind the couch where I was charging the night before. I had brought two chargers with me the small charger for the iPhone and large charger for the Ipad. The large charger charges faster and I had just bought my ipad so the charger was pretty brand new. When I returned from my tour at Grand Canyon, I did not notice that my large charger was gone. I just used whatever charger that I could quickly grab. However on Sunday evening as I was packing my sister was trying to help me pack and picked up all the chargers in the room. I then realized I had two small chargers instead of one large and one small. I first searched all our rooms then our luggages and I asked my sister if her husband had brought another small charger and she said not this one. So I told her I didn't bring two small ones, I only brought one small and one large. That is not mine either. Also to note, all our small chargers have a green mark on it. The charger that was in my room had no mark on it and was dirty. I realized the cleaner who cleaned my room on Saturday had subtly swapped her small charger with my large charger. I informed house keeping straight away advising them of what happened. The scary part was they did not sound shocked nor surprised. They advised that they will follow this up and find out. The next day since I did not hear anything back from them, I called only to find out the person that worked on my room on Saturday is off. As a result, they could not reach her. The manager at the front desk asked me how much was my charger and he was going to compensate me, I told him I don't care about the money, I just want my charger back. I do not understand how Ballys staff all acted as if it was something that happens on a regular basis. the fact that there is a thief in their staff should be a cause for concern. I did report the case to Ballys security on site. They were very helpful and were going to look into it. I also spoke to another supervisor at Housekeeping and she advised that the person will lose their job and their insurance. As a result, I did not want to be responsible for someone to lose their job over a charger. However, I am writing this to let people know BEWARE. I Stayed on the 6th floor. the hotel is cheaper than others but only slightly. if you can afford $10 or more stay at Planet Hollywood or other better hotels like Paris, Treasure Island etc. Like I said I have been to Vegas three times prior to this and have never had any of my belongings stolen.

Bally's is one of the old properties on the strip that still allows people to smoke. So, even if you're staying in a non-smoking room you'll still be effected by the smoke. My allergies were out of control during my four night stay even when I was taking Benadryl and Claritin. When we first arrived, we got impatient waiting in the ridiculously long line at check-in, because we only moved two feet in twenty minutes so we finally used the kiosks to check-in. Apparently, that is the worst thing you can do. The kiosk just assigns you the first clean room and only takes your smoking vs. non-smoking preference into account, so we got a room with only a king bed instead of the two queen beds that we had reserved online. Of course, we were not made aware of this until we got to the room. So, we called customer service and after quite a bit of run around we were told we had to go back down to check-in to get another room. Luckily the line was shorter, so we didn't have to wait as long but it was still a major inconvenience. Although we were told on the phone that there were not two queen beds available. The guy at the check-in desk got us into one, so from that point on it became clear that whenever we didn't get the answer we liked from staff at this hotel we'd just ask someone else because we were pretty much guaranteed to get a different answer. The room we ended up getting wasn't a suite but it did have a lounge\/seating area and a random room that probably had a conference table in it at one point, but was empty when we were there so we ended up using it as a dance room. 

The conference facilities we used were in the Indigo Tower, however our room was in the Jubilee Tower. It's a good 5 to 10 minute walk to get between the towers, so we definitely got our steps in while here. The Jubilee Tower was renovated a couple years ago so it's a bit nicer than the Indigo Tower, however the rooms in the Indigo Tower are a bit bigger. Bally's also easily connects to Paris, so if you have a conference here you might want to stay there instead.

Long story short, I called the Total Rewards hotline and got an immediate new reservation at Bally's.  We hauled our stuff over and walked right up to check in.  The gentleman at check in was very friendly.  He gave us a great room in the Jubilee tower facing toward Ceasars and Flamingo.  The room was very nicely remodeled.  We were pleasantly surprised and quite happy after the Flamingo issue.  The bed is so soft and comfortable!

As someone else mentioned, the pool is very warm but that is to be expected in 115 degree weather.  Don't look for it to be refreshing.  Also the drinks were outrageously expensive at the pool.  We were shocked when our bill showed one normal size frozen margarita for $17.  Almost $70 for two drinks each.  Needless to say we did not go back to the pool to be ripped off on drinks and not feel refreshed.  All other prices were what you would expect for Las Vegas.  Overall a great stay.

-This was absolutely the longest check-in process of any hotel I've ever stayed in... EVER. We're talking over an hour waiting in line just to check in.

-The casino is majorly outdated and generally just looks very sad.

-The restaurants are pretty terrible as well. 

-The people all seemed nonchalant and uncaring.

But happy birthday to me, because Groupon contacted Bally's to see if they could do anything, and said the best they could do was give me my money back in 10 business days.

They don't really have any big attractions, but they do have quite a few restaurants and shops. Unless your going here for a specific place to eat, there really isn't any reason to go here over anywhere else, except maybe their exceptional Sports Book.

Bally's has a large casino area with all of the usual table games and machines. Their odds aren't very good, but you can't really expect good odds on the strip. Local casinos usually are far better for gamblers.

They have three areas of shops and restaurants. One outside bordering Las Vegas Boulevard, one that connects to the back of their property and leads to the Sports Books, and another that connects them to the Paris. It's more than your usual casino provides for shops and places to eat.

They have a very large Sports Book that isn't connected to the main casino. It's really cool and has stadium style seating and would be a great place to watch a game. Of all the strip casinos, this is one of the best setups.

Bally's is a perfectly normal strip casino. There are better ones and worse ones, and if your a tourist this place should be fine, but for locals there isn't much to do here over a locals place.",8,1,1

The rooms are spacious, the hotel is right across the street from Caesar's, and right by Paris which in turn is right by my most favorite LV hotel, Bellagio. 

I must admit that the check-in lines are a b*tch sometimes because they take so long. However, the staff is always pleasant and accomodating.

I have stayed at just about every casino on the strip throughout the last 15 years.  There are multiple casinos that are much better from a plush \/ fashionable perspective but Bally's will give you a good bang for the buck.

Pros:  
** Location, location, location - smack dab in the middle of everything
** Cheap good sized rooms
** Good gaming for those playing video poker (my wife hit 3 Royals in 4 days)
** Quick valet service

Negatives:
** There are areas of the North Tower that are dated and not in the best shape.  Our room (Grand Suite in the North Tower running along Flamingo Rd) has not seen an upgrade for years.  The other negative about these rooms is that the bathroom sink area is not far from the bed (no door separating the bathroom and bedroom areas).  If you are rooming with someone and plan to get up early while the other sleeps in, it is not going to happen in these rooms.  Just running the sink water will immediately wake up your mate.
** Restaurants are sparse and not at the upper end of the dining spectrum.  We went to Fin in the Mirage and Carnevinos in the Plazzo instead of dining at Ballys
** Casino itself is dated.  The carpeting is in much need of updating.
** Hotel hallway carpeting is disgusting - dirty, stained, just gross
** Workers are not personable.  I always found the maids, waiters and dealers very friendly at Caesars or Mirage.  Here, the staff seems to be very cold - never got a ""good morning"" from the maids as I left my room in the morning unless I initiated the greeting.

Bottom line - you get what you paid for.  If you enjoy a plush \/ fashionable casino and hotel, go to Caesars or Bellagio.  Want a cheap hotel without all of the frills at a great location, go to Bally's or Flamingo.",0,0,0

Things have changed in the 10 years since I've been to Vegas...and not necessarily for the better.

We chose Bally's because of price & its proximity being pretty much in the center of the strip.

I was totally galled by the fact that they wanted an extra $30.00 to check in before their designated check-in time of 3:00pm, to a room which was already made up. Really?? Screw corporate America and their money-grabbing ways. The room was already to go, for god's sake! And I have to pay a premium for that?? Whether I had a choice to take it or leave it is not the point. It's just sheer CORPORATE GREED! It's like your cleaners telling you your clothes will be ready at 5:00 and you get there at 4:30. Your cleaning happens to be ready, but they will charge you an extra $10.00 for getting it early. 

Our room, in general was OK. We got a hot-tub room. Tub jets didn't work. What was even more amusing (sarcasm!) was that a sign on the tub said to press the black button to turn it on. Guess what? There was NO black button to press in the entire room. Just as well, because I bet the air jets have never been cleaned since its installation. (Just a hunch, mind you.) 

Since there was the large bath\/hot tub, there was a shower stall. A VERY TINY shower stall...and I mean TINY. They had a $1.00 shower head you might buy at the dollar store. ZERO water pressure. Took forever to rinse off soap & shampoo. The soap dish sloped downward, so soap would not stay on it. Yeah, I know these are dumb things to pick on. But geeze, a job worth doing...

Overall, the room was clean enough. However, all the ""sculpturing"" (? Sorry I don't know the different types of carpeting.) on the carpet was worn down smooth...except, of course, under the furniture. 

I did like that Hertz had on-site car rentals and returns. 

So, should I venture to Sin City ever again, Bally's will not be on my places-to-stay list. It's one of the older hotels, (It was originally the MGM, at which I stayed before the fire.) which I believe is getting beyond the point of meaningful updating.",2,0,0

Ended up booking a Vegas trip on a busy weekend (some basketball tournament), so everything that weekend from flight to hotels were extra pricey than usual. After going back and forth from Cosmo, PH, Aria, and all the other nice ones hoping that if we refreshed the site it would go down but sadly that did not happen haha so settled for Bally's. We picked Bally's since it was right on the strip.

First reaction to the outside seemed a bit outdated and a bit sad. Casino is quite spacious, but i'm not much of a gambler so can't say much in that department. A few cafes and restaurants inside. Located right on the strip next to Paris and PH hotel. My gf's and I walked to PH for Earl's Sandwiches and for their popular Miracle Mile Shops. 

Inside our room was a pleasant surprised. Bathroom was spacious and great mirror for us ladies to do our makeup :) or some would say put our face on haha. Room was pretty spacious, closet with mirrors. It was myself and 3 gf's and closet was still pretty spacious.  2 full\/queen beds. The bed was to my surprise real comfy! The pillows were like the pricey hotel pillows. Goose feather like that just sinks down. But not too low where you feel like the pillow is smothering you. The bed matteress itself was comfy and bouncy. And the blankets were soft and not like cheap hotel blankets. I think my favorite was the bed! especially after long nights or partying and drinking the bed is pretty important. Unless your pissed drunk then even the floor may seem like cloud 9 haha.

I would rather go gambling at Paris or cross the lake across the street.  

There are no resort fees charged.  A resort fee being charged here would be like a resort fee at an Econo Lodge.  It costs 22 dollars a day to get into the spa.  Who would pay 22 just to work out?  Hours 6 to 6.  Oh and its $15 a day for the internet.  

My main complaint about this place is there is no information about the hotel in the rooms at all.  No information that you usually get in those hotel binders.  I was very displeased by this.  

The website says the pool is closed for the winter, but it does not say that you can use the one at Paris.  

I would stay here again, but only for the right price.",2,0,0

Older and not so hip Vegas Strip casino but super location centrally located across the street from Bellagio and Caesars and literally next to Paris and Planet Hollywood casinos. Could not have asked for a more convenient spot. 

Stayed here since we weren't planning to spend much time at the room or pool and we wanted a place that was centrally located and resaonably priced so we could spend more money on the tables. 

North Tower rooms are apparently newer and refurnished. We got put into the older South Tower. The room was very spacious but the decor and furnture looked definitely dated. However, we got a room on a high floor and had a fantastic  view of the Paris Eiffel Tower, the Bellagio water fountain, and the South part of the Vegas strip. 

Bottom line: Not the hippest casino around, but solid hotel experience, in a great location, and reasonably priced so we had more $$ for food, gambling, and other sin city fun.",2,0,2

We stayed at Ballys from 3-27-16 to 3-30-16. We travelled with our two dogs, so their pet friendly rooms are twice as much and are located on the 7th floor. Now that's not why I gave them only one star, it's because they really don't care about their customers who are traveling with their pets. After I went in to check in, the lady at the counter said that she can't check us in until they saw our dogs. So out to the car I went, only to bring our two dogs back in line....(after I already stood in line for about 30 minutes). We got checked in and I then took our dogs out to their so called ""pet area"". Well what a disgusting area this turned out to be. Full of dog shit and cigarette butts!!! Heck our dogs didn't even want to use this place. I had to tip toe around the piles of shit and after our dogs finally did their duties I took them back to our room. I then went to the front desk to complain about how disgusting their ""pet area"" was. I told them that this was indeed the work of some very ""lazy"" pet owners who don't pick up after their pets, but since this is their property and they charge twice as much for their ""pet friendly"" rooms that they still need to keep this area clean for the responsible pet owners. Well this went into deaf ears since the same piles of shit that I had to tip toe around on Sunday were still there on Wednesday morning when we checked out. I complained again at check out and they did refund some money, but that wasn't the point.

We were there for about an hour before we ran into our first issue. The waitress that had been serving my boyfriend checked my ID & took my drink order. When the drinks arrived they were in TALLER glasses and it was a different waitress so we weren't sure if they were ours. My boyfriend was in the middle of a hand (like literally the dealer was asking him if he wanted to hit or stay) and the new waitress rudely interrupted, put her face in his face and said, ""IS THIS YOUR DRINK SIR?"" but in a nasty way. He said, ""hold on"" and she wasn't having any of that and rudely replied, ""you're welcome"" and slammed the glass down. EVERYONE and i mean EVERYONE  at the table was like ""wtf is her problem"".... she proceeds to then announce to everyone including the pit boss that he's had ""one too many"" even though she hasn't served him a single drink that night or interacted with him. It was his 3rd drink and he's 6'1"" 260 lbs so not like he gets drunk easily. 

So after that snafu, (i had only been down stairs for 15 minutes at this point) I wanted to leave and go get something to eat. So as we're walking to the restaurant the same waitress chases me down to demand to see my I.D. I'm 23 mind you and have already had my ID checked by the waitress that took my order. This waitress takes my drink and puts it on a tray with dirty glasses (health code violation btw) and stares at my I.D. FOREVER! So my bf, already pissed about her earlier treatment calls her a grandma and says she's taking forever to read my i.d. She then WALKS OFF WITH MY DRINK, on that dirty tray, and says she's calling security to kick us out because he called her a granny....i mean really. As I mentioned earlier everyone at our table saw how rude she was and a complete stranger from the same table saw what was happening and VOLUNTEERED to speak to security and offer his testimony in our defense. So we speak to security who honestly looked annoyed that she called them over this. Then her manager Kate proceeds to say how ""she doesn't deserve to be subjected to being called names i.e. grandma"". But I like to say every action causes a reaction and her actions caused that reaction. As a server in Orlando I too deal with all different types of people and the Beverage Manager Kate didn't even want to hear the whole story she just came in there to defend her EXTREMELY RUDE WAITRESS, by saying she's been doing that for 16 years and she just went on break and that was her station (like we were supposed to know that was her station. Maybe if she had said ""i'm taking over for so and so, or so and so was helping me out while i was on break"" BUT SHE DIDN'T. We're supposed to be psychic I guess. )

The restaurant: Tequila y Taquerios (or whatever it was called) said they were open till 3. We went at 1:30 and the manager flat out refused to serve us food unless we wanted to take it to our room. The server\/bartenders were clearly pissed about it because it was money out of their pocket. apparently they are open till 3 to take your money but not seat you, because they bring their cleaning crew in at 1:30 so you can't eat there. Where i come from (orlando, universal city walk to be exact) as long as your taking food orders you're seating guests. WE close at 12 but will seat up to 12:15.

The room: We found and empty spence shell casing in a chair in our room. NEED I SAY MORE?! That means that bullet was shot at something...that's how Aaron Hernandez was caught, he left a shell casing in his rental car. JUST SAYING.  We called security but in Vegas their known to cover things up to keep the crime rate down so I doubt security turned it into the police. 

My boyfriend was a rated player in vegas for years and has been over 50 times and said this is THE WORST experience he's ever had in vegas. And as a server, I have to say shame on the Beverage Manager Kate, she had no idea what happened and came in attacking us right away. They have camera's all over that place right? Play the tape and its clear as day the server was in the wrong. Customer service in Vegas, well at Bally's anyway, is non-existent. They don't want to treat you like a valued guest, its more like ""give us your money and gtf out""

The clerk couldn't find the reservation even when using the confirmation. He finally found it and sent us up to our room, which initially looked nice. We found a DIRTY q-tip in the bathroom trash, hair in the tub, and tons of hand prints all over the windows. While those aren't totally disgusting, it made us concerned about how well the rest of the room and bathroom had been cleaned or sanitized. We couldn't connect to the Internet that we pay for with the resort fee regardless of the combination of possible log-in names.  We called for assistance about places to eat in the hotel and ""coupon"" we were presented at checkin. The ""coupon"" was only an advertisement according to the guy who was off-site and had no clue about anything we were asking about restaurants, even though we called the 'restaurant' line on the room phone.  

The next morning, I tried turning on the TV but the remote didn't work, after playing with batteries for a bit, it worked. I tried to check out & low and behold, two other people's names appeared as the registered guests in my room and I was able to view their folios. We didn't know either of the people who were listed on the room. We couldn't check out on the tv and get a copy of the bill and didn't have time to wait in the checkout lines to get a copy. To top it off, while trying to nap before checking out, housekeeping ignored the 'do not disturb sign' and tried to enter without knocking.  Luckily the door was secured- but it startled us enough to get us up to leave.

Well I always poo-pooed ballys because it was 'cheap'. Which is odd because I've stayed at the Luxor a number of times for the same reason. A friend bragged about his room rate so when I extended my stay, I switched from the Aria to Ballys. 

Certainly it has undergone a series of renovations recently; adding in an open shopping promenade to funnel people down towards the main entrance, what looks like a new sports book and food court downstairs (Johnny Rockets puts out tasty shakes and onion rings) and possibly room upgrades. 

Checkin \/out was a breeze. The rooms are very affordable, pretty standard, comfortable beds, towels were softer than the ones I had at the aria a few days before.

Must give them 5 stars for their service, look & feel, amazing rooms, and phenomenal views in their rooms. My boyfriend and I made our first (and now yearly) Vegas trip in July to a video game tournament (EVO) and got there a Thursday night and left Sunday. Now, I've read a few reviews about the check-in lines and I can't say whether this is a regular occurrence since close to 10K people came to this event, but we easily waited 30+ minutes to check-in the day before the event. Can't fault them here since it was a huge event held at Bally's and they offered discounted rooms for those who attended the event.

First is the room itself. Originally booked a small room with no extra amenities and after reading about the tip trick, I managed up the courage to try it. Between my ID and my credit card I sandwiched a $20 bill and asked sweetly ""Do you have any complimentary upgrades?"" Well, the answer was ""Yes, and do you want a suite or the new building?"" I answered ""a suite"", hoping that was the best option. The woman behind the counter took my 20 (very slyly) and didn't mention the upgrade again to the point that I almost thought she forgot. Don't get discouraged if this happens to you, they definitely heard you, they must not be able to talk too much about it. When we arrived at the room, I was ecstatic to find a hot tub, two vanities, a shower, a living room complete with couch and desk, and a King sized bed! And of course a great view of the new ferris wheel, the Flamingo and Caesar's. Let's just say I would've loved to see what we would've gotten for a $100 tip!

Second, the service. As mentioned the woman behind the counter was incredibly nice and helpful and the event held at the Bally's ballrooms would not have been possible with the dozens of workers helping everyday.

Now to the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. After an entire day out and about the wonderful city of Vegas, we decided to stay in one night. i wanted to use the hot tub and run a bubble bath. Called the front desk, and no bubble bath. :( Oh well, I improvised with some shampoo, and it smelled wonderful too. Well, room service and a hot custom-made bubble bath, I thought! I call the front desk again to ask for room service. There is none. Only for breakfast between some early hours in the morning. Nothing?? No room service at this raved about hotel, big name in Vegas? I was shocked. Well, how about a pizza then? Front desk has no name for pizza places...""We've got tons of restaurants downstairs."" (That just means Mexican and Thai unless you want to walk further) And also, room service is supposed to be avoiding going out but I left that part out. Ended up grabbing take out from one of the restaurants and still got to enjoy half my vision for the night. So that was for the 4 star review. Otherwise would totally stay again!

Also, if you go - try that $20 tip trick!",6,1,2

I didn't want to valet park anymore but was forced to because no spots were open in the other lot. So on my birthday we had one of my 3 friends wait for the car as we went to Starbucks which took us about 20 mins because it was really busy.. We came back to the valet area and waited quite a while and finally realized we were waiting a really long time... I looked at a text I had gotten when we were at the coffee shop to see how long we had actually been waiting and it was the better side of 45 minutes. We asked 3 times if we could go get our own car because it was freezing outside and we were trying to make the best of our last day... Then these 2 valet guys come riding up in our car... First of all why were there 2??? No one else's car had 2 workers in their car- and we were the very last people to be helped even though we waited longer and were there before most of the others... Then I spoke to a ""supervisor"" named Michael who told me I was a liar and that we were only waiting 20 minutes not 40... Are you serious? And when the 2 idiots brought the car up there was a dent in the side that wasn't there before we used their valet. The guy who was in the driver side has a red beard and looked somewhat like a leprechaun and made a smug comment at me saying ""well it is valet and we are busy...""

Per Yelper's reviews, I requested we got a room in the Jubilee Tower, which supposedly is the new, renovated rooms. They were more than happy to give us a room there and we had a nice view of Paris Hotel and could even see the Bellagio fountain\/show from across. The room itself is very clean. Bathroom is nice. Bed were comfy! There's a sofa if you happen to have extra people in your group.

Edward (Eddie), one of the bellhop guys, is so entertaining and funny.

We came in Vegas and it was pouring rain. To vallet your car is $18 per day now and $10 each day to self park. If you are a platinum card holder or higher then your fee is waived and you don't have to pay. They were short on staff and bell men or were very slow as we had to wait outside our car for about 5 minutes. Someone finally came with a bell hop and the guy was very rude. He made me help him with the bags and didn't say anything and ripped the ticket and gave it to me. He then moved behind our car with our stuff and stacked other people's luggage onto our luggage...we had stuff in our bags that were fragile...

We wait in a short line where the front desk lady is taking forever laughing with a couple. Took about 10 minutes and it wasn't busy. 

We checkin to our room which was very hard to find and we almost got lost. Our safe was dented in and our view was the above parking lot and a short piece of the strip which sucked. The gambling was pretty bad besides one night I did okay and got lucky on one machine. 

My sister had her 21st bday here in the suite and the suite was okay. It didn't come with a large trash can so we had to bring our own bags for a party. The pool table was abused by previous people. The sticks were all broken besides 2 of them. The carpet had blue chalk stains on it. The red pool table felt was off and bumpy. 2 of the far corner pockets were literally taped on together so when I would shoot the balls into them they would fly up and out of the table! The balcony doors were locked so we couldn't even go outside. There were matches and ash trays everywhere but I don't think you could smoke in there so we didn't...for 2k it was a waste of money because of the service and the actual place...

The waitresses ALL expect a tip every time you order a drink, even a water...it is not mandatory to tip. These women get payed hourly plus tips which is more than most of us make. Excuse me if I want 3 oz of water for ""free"" while I'm loosing $900 on a slot machine all night...

The restaurants in here were super overpriced. $20 for a burger, $20 nachos, $18 drinks....

When my sister and her friends wanted to have fun for her 21st on the card tables they were very rude to her and her friends. They would stare at her I.D. For about 5 minutes, put it down and deal the cards to others until they got them verified. That took a total of 30 minutes! When they complained to the pit boss they didn't do anything about it. The dealers were really rude and wouldn't let them order any drinks or go anywhere... when they finally said okay you girls can play they didn't want to anymore and they left...what a waste!

The pool really sucked here and was super far. The pool had no scenery except a tram on top we could look at. The sun wasn't out and there were more kids than adults here splashing around us and being rude. The parents didn't say anything of course because parents are terrible now a days and don't discipline there children and let them control THEM! 

We go to checkout and they charged me for the wifi even though I payed the entire weekend and the resort fees. It includes 2 devices. It's just my girlfriend and I staying here. When I called the front desk to ask about the $14.99 charge for wifi he tried to make it seem like there was a 3rd device. I told him it was literally me and her and that's it, we didn't even have any friends come to our room.... he made me wait and then waived the charges and they just charged me for the resort fees.

Finally, we go to leave and I got my parking ticket and the valet guy is getting my car after our weekend. I told him thank you and he just stood there staring at me with his hand out...again, it is NOT mandatory to tip especially when it is not $18 per day to park. Again I said thank you...and he still stood at me and said ""Thank you,"" ""Thank you"" ""yeah...I heard you I heard you...thank you thank you"" VERY RUDELY and stared me down as he walked to the next car and drove off staring me down....like come on. I didn't have any money on me because we had lost and they already drained the living soul out of us and now we are getting it from a valet guy that again makes decent money. IT IS NOT MANDATORY!!!!  

Bally's, I am sorry but I am NOT Staying here again. Even the casino machines are very Tight! They didn't even have a buffet here or a night club.... 

Perris next time for sure!",4,2,0

Bally's, by far, was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. A group of cousins\/girlfriends and I stayed in the Bally's Indigo tower for a 5-day getaway and I was blown away at the negative experience we had. Our first encounter was at the front desk. We checked in with Carrie, who didn't even give us a welcome greeting.  She acted like we were bothering her. I was trying to excite her by telling her how excited we were for being in Vegas the very first time.  She was not moved, very dry and her tone was negative to the point that I asked to see a manger. She went to the back (pretending to go to the back, but she could still be seen) and returned saying he was in a meeting and would be there for several hours. We continued our check in, enduring her bothered tone. After a few moments, I had to ask her if she was mad. Her response, ""No, I'm not mad are you mad!"" At this point, I just continued with the check-in process for fear of being stuck in a crappy room. She told us where our room would be located and I asked if we could get a room with a view of the strip. She told us we had to pay $50\/night for an upgrade. We declined. When we stepped foot in the room (#638), I was expecting to see a room similar to the ones we saw on their website...FAR FROM IT! I entered the room and the stench smacked me in the face. It smelled old, musty and like there was mildew. And the view...the air conditioning unit! The carpet was old and stained. The furniture was dusty and worn. I was appalled. I saw the housekeeper in the hall and asked her to step in our room. Terry was extremely pleasant when she came in. She listened and too could notice a stench in in our room. She advised that the Jubilee Tower was updated and suggested we try to upgrade their.  Terry offered to clean our room more (she used bleach), but advised that if we were unhappy with the room, we could call the housekeeping manger. Whelp, that didn't work. I called for the housekeeping manger and was told that I had to speak to the housekeeping supervisor. So in comes Ginger. When I explained to her that I was unhappy with room and the fact that it was hard to breathe due to the mildew smell, she was only focused on the fact that Terry sprayed used bleach in the room. She totally missed the fact that the room was in dire need of deep cleaning and updating. In the end, Ginger stated there was nothing she could do. The next day when we asked Terry for fresh washcloths and towels everyday she was more than happy to oblige. Sometime later, we overheard a conversation between Terry and Ginger whereby Ginger told Terry not to supply clean washcloths and towels, to only clean out room. Terry advised her that we specifically requested fresh washcloths every day, but Ginger was insistent and told her no. I felt bad for the interaction between Terry and her supervisor, Ginger. In any event, when Terry came into our room, a call had to be made to housekeeping to order fresh washcloths and towels. 

I endured the next few days in disgust. I woke up with a headache every day. I was convinced there was something wrong with the air quality in the room. In addition, the lobby of the hotel was always smoky. I expected to smell some because smoking is allowed in the casino; however, I did not expect it to be that bad. We visited many other hotels while there which also had smoking in their lobby casinos and unless you were standing right next to the smoker, you couldn't smell the smoke. Again, probably and air quality issue. 

In the lobby of our floor, I kept saying that it smelled like urine. Well, well well. Would you believe that a homeless male was sleeping on the couch of our lobby at night? The first night we saw him, we thought he was passed out drunk. Nope! The second night we saw him, we leaned in a little closer and noticed he was filthy, carrying a few dirty bags and reeked of urine!

Finally, the food choices at Bally's Indigo Tower were very basic. Johnny Rockets, Sbarro, some Chinese stuff, Subway, a buffet and steak place. We hiked it over to Paris Hotel (connected to Bally's, and very beautiful, might I add) to enjoy much better selections. 

I hate that I booked Bally's and will never do so again. My first visit to Vegas was not what I expected, but we made the most of it outside of Bally's. Terry, the housekeeper, made our hotel stay as pleasant as she could, doing whatever she could. Ginger, on the other hand, should be reprimanded for entering my cousin's room, unannounced, and running out once she noticed someone was inside. Never again Bally's...never again!",12,3,0

It's right in the middle of the strip, it's nice, it's cheap and they even just renovated many of the rooms! It's connected to Paris and is a very short walk. You don't even have to leave the hotel\/casino since they have a connecting hallway. Their casino is large and has a lot of different slots and games. There's also a quick service food court and a couple of small restaurants. They're not the best, but again, Paris is just a short walk away where they have plenty of delicious sit down restaurants as well as a great quick service food court.

Be aware that all the hotels on the strip charge a resort fee of about $20-$30\/night. It's just another way for the hotel to add on more fees but every hotel on the strip is doing that now so you can't really escape it.

The staff is really friendly here and I've never had a problem with anything when I've stayed. I've been here about four times and every time it's been great. It's my go-to hotel on the strip when I'm looking for a quick last minute trip to Vegas since it's affordable yet nice at the same time. Other hotels like the Quad, Luxor and Excalibur definitely aren't as nice and\/or have awful locations.

If you're trying to do Vegas on a budget but still want to be in a great location in a nice hotel, Bally's is definitely the spot for you!",15,0,2

Being conjoined with Paris meant that as you walked inside and down the escalator from the parking lot into the main halls you were invited by Parisian facades and spectacle that is Vegas; however, it is classy and doesn't try to overwhelm you with senses. Instead the show element melded with just enough sophistication to give you luxury that didn't over- or underwhelm you.

Casino Floor Deco - 4

I still find their styling and design so refreshing and classical without looking too dated. Like a fine, middle grade wine, this casino floor is aging well. The ceilings are still clean. The tables are in good condition and the dress code for the dealers is still a classic look of dress shirts and vests. It's no Cosmopolitan, and truly nothing anywhere in Vegas is, but this isn't a budget casino.

Hotel Room Deco - 3

Walking into the hotel room and you can start to see how the years have taken a toll. For the most part the rooms are standard and I mean that in the most general way. From the dark wood stain to the set up of the TV cabinet and bed tables there is nothing fancy about it. It's a basic setup and it works well. Some of the wallpaper in the bathroom has seen better days and the bathing supplies given complimentary isn't necessarily the greatest either but the rooms work. Enough to keep you comfortable and also keep you out to enjoy the rest of Vegas.

Price - 3

The pricing for Bally's in my opinion is very fair. Because they are more of a middle range casino their prices will usually range in the lower side compared to places like the Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, and The Linq (all located in the periphery of Bally's). With such a great location Bally's really is a great place to call home base yet still get to see all Vegas has to offer around it for a budget price.

Casino - 4

By no means is Bally's the largest casino floor but it is all placed and located even through a floor that can be seen easily from the lobby. It has every game you might want and some you don't. It is a place where you can find your friends easily if you get lost and not such an eyesore where you want to seek refuge outside as soon as possible. For the most part the dealers are quite pleasant and if you get onto the right table you might have a nice conversation if nothing else.

Conclusion

Bally's will always have a place in my heart because of the wonderment it brought me when I first arrived to Vegas. With the easy transport from Bally's to Paris and the eye candy in between it really is a great casino to stay for any frugal traveler looking for a good room with enough money remained to paint the town.",3,1,1

It's cheap and has great location! Not to mention the monorail stops here so I can get anywhere on the strip faster! (and avoid the scorching heat)

It's not as nice as the bigger hotels like Palazzo, but hey you pay for what you get. And this is the best bang for the buck for anyone looking for a cheap place to stay. I had booked a promo for the south classic room. Did the $20 sandwich trick upon checking in and was upgraded to the North tower deluxe room for free (aside from the tip). The clerk checking me in told me it was ""VIP"" and had a great view of the strip... which I found he lied because all I saw was Flamingo's pools and a part of Caesar's. But I didnt' really care coz all I needed was better rooms than the south tower classics.

Room is pretty clean and cozy. Mine had a flat screen tv (I was expecting a tube tv). So I was really content with my room. This will be my place to stay from now on for regular Vegas trips. Save the 5* hotels for special occasions.",1,0,3

My mom said it's name after the famous shoe brand, who knows? When my mom told me we were going here I thought she meant the gym! Anyways rooms are okay, location is great! It's in the middle of the strip and it's really near the Miracle Mile formerly aladin hotel. This is where you can find tons of shopping like urban outfitters, guess etc. Its one of the older hotels so you shouldn't expect much! My view was of a parking garage but hey it's vegas! You want to spend the least amount of time possible in your room!",0,0,0
