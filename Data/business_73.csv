That being said...
I was underwhelmed. Three stars perhaps I'm over Cirque shows.  The latter part of the show held my attention more:)  I anticipated more, as I've seen other Cirque performances. An hour in and I quite frankly was ready for the show to finish up. I didn't find the acrobatics flowing smoothly while suspended above.  Let's chat about the children in the white masks, creepy. I know the amount of reviews are highly rated of this show.  More than half the theater was empty.  The entire row in front of us was vacant.  To my left our entire row was empty. The entire row behind us- yes, empty. Yet, we had two people seated right next to us.  
Indeed we inquired about spreading out a bit- absolutely not we were told.  What prompted our question was the man directly to our right spoke the entire show. Nope, not in a whisper regular speaking tone.  Heard his every word Perfectly clear over the music.  I gave him a stare down a few times and yes!  I made mention about him speaking. He clearly had the me, me, me syndrome. As did his wife, her shoes were off (no socks) and she had them hanging over the seats in front of her.  I heard more of him than the show!
I've been in attendance for various Cirque shows from the beginning.  Yes, these have been around well over a decade. Not sure if I would give this or any other Cirque show another go around.  As you can see from my pictures, I enjoyed the gift shop! By far more entertaining:)",2,0,0

Mirage spending a lot marketing this show; you can see a huge Beatle Love Logo from their Hotel.  After all, they invest like 100 millions in innovation the stage.  These stages used to be the iconic Siegfried & Roy Magic show with the white lions and tigers.   One of the big cost of the new stage is in fact all 2,000 seat have an individual speakers placed in the back.  That feature help bring the sound balance in all seats.  In addition, the stage can be open and close just like other Cirque du Soleil, except no water in this one.  However, a lot of perfume foggy effect, and many high-tech lighting systems.

The entrance to the show was nicely done; it felt like you walk to an upscale nightclub.  The show is a lot more about the music, is really the heart and souls of the Cirque Du Soleil acrobat performers.  Performer of all ages were part of the show, some stunts does not look like it had any safety strap despite been like over 100 feet in the air.  The best act I think was the Come Together, that act was flawless it require perfect timing between several performer. That song was a great fit of the act.  Not every act was excellent, but there more than a few dozen would wow you.

This is my first time watching Cirque Du Soleli, and I am definite a fan of them.  Looking forward to see the famous water show like O and Le Reve.  I basically got this show for free view the special hotel reservation promotion.  The shows tickets value were higher than our hotel stay in the Monte Carlo.  At top of that, our seat were been upgrade from balcony to second row !",28,21,26

When you walk in, you'll be wondering if you Can't Buy Me a better seat, as the large see through curtains that drop from the high ceiling to the stage are going to obstruct your view (they drop away in the first act, after which I Feel Fine). 

The staging, which is ""in the round"", is unique and creative - seating was offered for half price, and the front area of the theater is colorful and really gives the 1960s Beatles vibe. I'd say don't change anything here - Let It Be. We got our Ticket to Ride and entered the theater With A Little Help From My Friends.

Some of the scenes in ""Love"" are really overly confusing and have just too much going on, and just make you say Hello Goodbye. You may find yourself saying ""Whiskey Foxtrot Tango?"" in some scenes. (Almost like being Back In The USSR).   

And much of the amazing acrobatics that Cirque shows are known for are gone from this production, and in its place is just generic dancing, running fast, and facial expressions. 

But on the other hand, when they get it right, it's so right.  The sun made out of candles for ""Here comes the Sun"", featuring rope climbers, was perfection, and beautiful.  The aerialists and performers in simple white that were involved in the production of ""Something in the Way She Moves"" were so spot on perfect, that it brought a tear to my eye.  Outstanding.

Unfortunately, the scenes that were chaotic and confusing seemed really out of place.  I guess you can say they didn't Come Together. The ushers were hit and miss (one was really rude, but he probably had a Hard Day's Night), and you might find a few favorites missing if you are a big Beatles fan.  

Overall, highly recommended - most people will enjoy this immensely.  As it turns out, All You Need is Love.",1,4,2

Tried to get into see the Michael Jackson ONE, but the show was off that week. At the recommendation of the ticket sales at the Mandalay Bay we opted for the The Beatles - LOVE show. Our tickets sales gal was great and she suggested to sit higher up due to the great effects during the show. So off we went to the Mirage ...had a lil dinner first, then saw the HUGE line. Doors open about 40-30 minutes before show time, so we casually waited at the bar near by as the line slowly dwindled down. Once seated you can see how the stage is sorta circular and I would say there is no bad seat in the house. The performers come out and mingle a bit with the crowd before the show, which is funny and entertaining - made the waiting time pass quickly.

If you are a Beatles fan, you will be singing the whole night.....if you are not and do not know of the era the show might be a little confusing. The story line follows the Beatles musical Sgt. Peppers Lonely Heart Band; in which tells the story of a band as they wrangle with the music industry and battle evil forces on stealing their instruments and corrupting their home town of Heartland. It shows how tragic their era was, wanting peace then the protesting and of course wanting love. Really touching, heartbreaking, yet very heartwarming.

Kudos to our ticket sales gal.........the higher seats you can see when it comes to the middle part of the show.......a little SPOILER ALERT (they wave a big parachute like blanket for an effect and it covers the middle to bottom seats - and those seats cannot see! That part and the effect and was incredible and really nice from above! We were in row 208. The performers were fantastic, as the effects and acrobatics up above.

Can someone please tell me if I missed some MAJOR metaphor?  I didn't get it.  I enjoyed the music and I don't really like the Beatles but I thought most of the action was lame.  

The dancing pregnant lady???  I've seen better dancing on early-season shows of Dancing with the Stars.  

The kids riding on a bed - it reminded me of something of a cross between Pink Floyd's The Wall and Harry Potter.  

The coolest scene was by far done to Octopus's Garden-I felt like I was in an aquarium with jelly fish floating around.

But other parts of the show were really slow, confusing, and just not that interesting.  Even the opening act, for example, lacked enough ""oomph"" to get the show started.  As for the white sheet being lifted over the audience, I was actually seated above it, so it looked really cool from my vantage point...i did wonder what it looked like underneath though. I did have an issue with the way the walls were partitioned though...especially at my seat level, it just cut the stage in weird spots, and at times, blocked my view of the artists performing on the stage.

It's been 2.5 years since I saw it twice in the same week. I was afraid it might have lost a little something since then. I mean, I used to listen to the soundtrack daily in my car and may have worn myself out on it. But moments into the performance, those fears were allayed. The heart and soul of LOVE is the wonderful soundscape that George and Giles Martin have crafted. That part is evidently timeless and it still translates magically to the stage.

This time around, I managed to get front row seats. To be honest, I think I prefer to watch the show from higher up. It's not that being so close is a bad thing; it's just different. In the front row, your eye level is just above the stage. The show is a trip to begin with, but looking up and being so close to the performers exacerbates that feeling. At the same time, you probably miss a lot of things with your view occasionally obstructed. But with so much going on, this is true no matter where you sit. The important thing for me is that my friend absolutely loved it. Outside of my Dad, she's the biggest Beatles fan I know and it was just ridiculous that she had never seen the show.

By the end, I found myself falling in love with LOVE again. In fact, I'm listening to the soundtrack again as I type this review.",2,1,2

Although I like the Beatles, I don't think I was able to appreciate the history as much. I was definitely one of the younger folks at the show and I am 35.

If you've been doing your homework and studying Yelp for your upcoming Las Vegas vacation, you've probably read through several different Cirque shows by now. It's true that every Cirque show is different- KA is very intense, Zumanity is very sexual, and The Beatles show? The best way to describe The Beatles Cirque show is a non stop party- eye popping entertainment- action all over the stage at all times- a splash of audience participation and a whole lot PEACE and LOVE!

All of the characters are filled with life, the scenes are energetic and alive, and you'll be singing along with the Beatles songs all night long.

I don't want to spoil any of the show for you, but I assure you this is one of the best Cirques in town. I advise you to purchase tickets from Tix4Tonight or straight from the Mirage the day of the show. I purchased great seats in section 104 for 35% off the day of the show, and it was totally worth it- just ask them if they have discounted seats available!

- Remastered music.
- Talented cast.
- Well thought out integration of music and visuals.
- Expensive for front row.
- Comfortable seats.

While on a memorial trip to Vegas with my wife and uncle, Cirque du Soleil makes a sure bet for a memorable trip. I have seen many Cirque du Soleil shows in the past and they all differ in their own way. LOVE helped bring back some Beatles nostalgia for my uncle and provided a unique performance for the audience.

Sitting in the front row is a good idea 90% of the time with Cirque du Soleil shows and worked out well in this case. I scored the tickets from the fan club, well under the going rate and it amplified the experience being so close. Characters practically sit on your lap and do front-flips like you're the only person in the audience.

With Cirque du Soleil LOVE, the audience honors the musical legacy of the Beatles through remastered recordings, special visits from the iconic band members, and fictional characters pulled right from the songs.You'll find yourself watching Sgt. Pepper who encounters many familiar faces, including Lucy in the Sky, Eleanor Rigby, Lady Madonna and Mr. Kite. 

The unconstrained story of the Beatles starts at the Blitz, moves through the band's founding, climb into superstardom, and their break-up. Using the master tapes at Abbey Road studios, they have created a unique soundscape of The Beatles music for LOVE. With panoramic sound and visuals, the audience will experience The Beatles as never before.",1,0,1

It was perfect cuz you get a full view of the stage and screens and you save a couple bucks too.

I'm not a Beatles fan, I really don't know many of their songs.  My husband on the other hand is, and really wanted to go to this show.  I just wanted to see a cirque show, so I figured this would be fun! So I call to arrange our tickets and spoke with the friendliest guy who told me he was setting up with front row balcony seats so we can be higher up, because it's the best view.  I'm now pumped! On the day of the show, getting our tickets at the box office was a breeze.  We grabbed some drinks from the Beatles bar & brought them in.  We showed up and looked for the stairs to get to our seats.  There was an employee there who informed us that the balcony was closed! So now I'm bummed because the guy I purchased our tickets with raved about the balcony views.  Anyway, this guy changes our seats, which to our surprise was 2nd row.  My husband was psyched, but I could see why the view was not preferred.  It's like sitting front row in a movie theater. Plus you can see all the mechanics of it which takes away a little from the experience. 

So far so good.. we're about 20 minutes in, and are loving the show! The songs, the acrobatics..wow! Then things go downhill.  I notice a guy in front row, just in front of us.. literally slapping his wife on the face as hard as possible.  My husband and I along with the couple sitting next to us were now focused on that, trying to figure out what was going on! We start to wonder if this is part of the show or something.. but then we notice that the performers we focused on what was happening as well.  We stood up and waved to the security guy who was at the top of the stairs and they came running down.  We then noticed she was unresponsive.  Then 5 or 6 more security people came down.  We couldn't tell all what was going on because it was pretty dark in that section of the theater.  All of this continues for some time.. all the while the show is going on.  The paramedics came out and took her.  So... that was our show of the evening. Needless to say, nobody in my section watched the Beatles show because of that.  

I don't know what happened to the woman but I hope she's okay.  My problem is with the staff.  They should have handled this A LOT better.  They definitely should have came over to us and assisted us in changing seats.  Maybe got her out of there sooner so that the security wasn't speaking loudly and in our way.  Or shoot..maybe just stop of the show and get us rescheduled.  I don't know what should have happened because it's such a weird situation.  But it was just a crappy situation, it put a damper on our evening and we didn't get the enjoy the show we spent $300 on.  Or maybe they should have offered us who were in the immediate area a refund.  It's not their fault, but it wasn't ours either.",3,1,2

Note of frugality: I saw cheaper tickets were available online (20% off!) through the CDS site for 10 pm shows that they won't give you if you call the box office or go through Mirage directly. We didn't get them before we left home, and then couldn't get the discount.

Ticket tip: It is a small theatre, and ""all seats are good"" as they say, but I would recommend the middle section for the best views. High enough to get a perspective of everything, low enough to see faces. We were in the higher section of the balcony and it was a bit too high for me.

it's almost impossible to go in expecting to hear all of your favorite beatles songs because there's so freaking many but the show does a good job of picking the hits most people should know. 

we got our tickets from tix4tonight ($112 after fees) and when we got to the box office they gave us the option of either front row or 15th row and we chose the front row.  i think there's so much going on that you might miss things if you sit too close. that said i think between the 5th and 10th row would probably be perfect.

we saw ""O"" last time we were in vegas which happened to be my first cirque show. the show was utterly boring and just weird. it's from the same guy who did the celine dion show so he just seems to throw in random shit to make things look artsy or something. maybe it's just over my head or whatever but from the second Love starts it's a PARTY and you just feel awesome. walking out of the theater we were buzzing about how great it was while walking out of O we were wondering why we just wasted so much money.

I love the Beatles, which was pretty much the only motivation for me to see a Cirque show or go to Las Vegas, where I hadn't been in at least eight or nine years.

It took Tita and I from February until June to finally confirm a weekend where we were both available and could commit to flying up to see the show. I bought the tickets only a couple of weeks ago, $165 each for fourth-row seats. TOTALLY WORTH IT. The performers were at eye-level, plus every seat had speakers on the front and back of the headrest, so the sound was incredible.

The song choices, as well as the costumes, choreography, and screened images that went along with them, were completely flawless. My favorite portions of the performance were probably the blinding beauty of the sun made of electric candles during ""Here Comes the Sun,"" the twinkling lights and dizzying imagery during ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,""  the skating act during ""Help!"" and of course, the lushness, vitality, and sheer beauty of the final number, ""All You Need is Love.""

I don't think I've ever been to a cirque show where I have felt so close to the performers before. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. I sat in 206 and I had a great time.

I love watching more circus acts so that's just my thing.

Now the real reason I am writing this review is because I don't think I have had an experience with service like I did here. I called in to purchase tickets a couple of days before the show and I spoke to a woman named Jodi. She was so kind. helpful, and provided me with every answer to every question I had to ask. She also signed me up for M Life (which I had never heard of until now), which provides you with the best discounts ever on the strip. I'm talking about saving up to $30-$40 dollars on tickets. It's amazing. Jodi pretty much helped me knock $100 off my tickets to One. I tried to purchase more tickets with her, but my card saw a strange activity and declined. But she provided me with the sections for the best seating in the house and I wrote them down. The next day I called again and spoke to someone else and bought the tickets and had asked for section 209. I picked up the tickets and saw that they were in section 306 instead and were not the ones I originally asked for. They were cheap tickets, but I wanted a good view of the show for my parents anniversary. I went to The Mirage to trade them and the ticket prices had gone up. So I was actually really upset that I was going to have to spend $120 on tickets that were originally $80 a couple of days before. Then this lady at the desk told me she will speak with the manager and she came back a couple of minutes later with waaaay better tickets. I almost wanted to cry because I was so happy. I thanked her and I didn't realize it until 10 minutes later, but the lady at the desk's name was JODI!

Once you embrace this freak show for what it is, the rest comes easy -- Just let this baby drive your car, then you're going to be a star. In a sense you'll Get back to where you once belonged. 

Just turn off your mind, relax and go down stream. The show's not dying.. The show is not dying...  It's something in the way the dancers move. I don't want to leave this show now.. I don't even know how -- I guess the exit signs. 

But yeah, you won't need any Lucy in the sky with diamonds before coming to the show. It provides enough of an mind fucking of uppers and downers in itself. 

With all those terrible Beatles song puns laced...okay, making up the entire review, I guess you can easily see that this show, if you're not one of those Elvis folks, will blow you away. 

It's a visual, audio and all sensory overload of spectacularness. Forget the Octopuses garden, I'd like to be watching this show a couple more times. 

As Sgt. Pepper lonely heart club band said, I hope you enjoyed the show, but hey, they're sorry but it's time to go. What next? 

Let me take you down to the Beatles Revolution lounge... Strawberry drinks, nothing is cheap. And nothing to write home about there. Better yet, let's just avoid the Beatles Revolution lounge bar altogether unless you really want an overpriced drink with a Beatles name attached to it. You're in a Casino, after all, drinks should be plentiful and comped. 

Go to the show, but forget The Beatles themed bar as a means to kill time before the show.",10,8,8

I didn't tell her where or what we were doing...but when we arrived to the Box Office..I told her what we were going to do and see. She was SO EXCITED.  Then the man gave us the bad news. CANCELED...BOO HOO.  Canceled?  The look on her face......broke my heart.
So Grandma and sad kid walked away from what was going to be a BIG MEMORY.   Yes we will someday go back, but the opportunity to watch them rehearse-Priceless. Yes, they have 'other' times ''maybe'' in the next couple weeks, but with work and school this was our day.

LOVE does not follow the typical story plot, but each song is a mini-story of it's own, but somehow tends to lead itself to a semi-story that allowed the next song to easily transition itself to the ""LOVE"" story.

Truth be told I grew up in Canada and have seen many Cirque productions and they frankly scare me. The crazy clown\/ juggling, Miming, high flying trapeze , acrobatic contortionist acts never appealed to me. Not one bit. But yet I found myself in love with LOVE.

LOVE is a gorgeous interpretation of the songs of the Beatles. The production captures the spirit of the Beatles. It's visually stunning, and it envelops you, encircles you. It becomes overwhelming at points with the amount of action happening all around. You really have to sit back and take in the beauty of it all. Don't blink -you'll want to see it all. The sound and staging were spectacular. 

There isn't really a story so much as there are themes. It revolves around Beatles era references: the Cold War, beatles-mania,the 50's, the 60s, their crazy acid induced trips into Sgt Pepper territory and their foray into India are all referenced in a dazzling way. 

I particularly loved how they interpreted Black Bird, the yellow Submarine was amazing and surprising and of course, beautiful (especially viewed from the top).

At times, there's so much going on on the stage that you're not sure where to look.  And a couple of parts could have been done better, but on the whole 90% of it was amazing to me.

I didn't wait to buy the soundtrack at a normal store. I chose to pay the retail price. By choice. At the Beatles Shop.

I'm not normally a fan of remixes, but this is brilliant. Fantastic soundtrack that did not disappoint with their fabulous sound system.

The lights, acrobatics, dancing, costumes, Beatles songs (mashed up and remixed), and dialogue all come together to form the perfect tribute to the greatest band in the world. If you're a hardcore Beatles fan you'll be in a state of nostalgia and if you're a newbie (I doubt there are any) you will be turned on to the music of this talented group.

My favorite segments of the show are the slower ones: ""Here Comes the Sun,"" ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" ""Something,"" etc. Those are the parts where you really get to see just how intricate and effortless the acrobatics are. (Having the guy without his shirt on during ""Something"" is not too shabby either).

The show has been going on for five years, and with good reason. It's incredible. You have to go see it!

Anyway, the show is basically a mix of dancers and some acrobats choreographed to Beatles music. I thought it was kind of cheesy and I didn't think that the dancing or acrobats were particularly unique or intriguing. To add to the cheesy factor they had an act with roller bladers going back and forth on a ramp.

I cannot believe people would give this show anything lower than 4.5. Im also sure these people do not understand the kind of grueling training and precision that goes into this kind of show. Ribbon work alone is not something to turn one nose up at, snobs!

If you are not a Beatles fan and are not familiar with the music, don't waste your time. If sounds like the people who rated low stars really didn't understand the era, what the music meant, what was going on politically at the time, etc. They also didn't understand the ""storyline"" which i heard people saying there wasn't one? wtf Beatles music is a story line in it of itself man. I guess you cant please everyone and i'm really not sure what else people expected from this show. It blew me away to say the least.

Cirque tried to cover it with something going on each side but I found it to be a sensory overload. The soundtrack is good as it is a take on legendary music here. The acrobats are ok but not amazing like other shows. My friend enjoyed it but I wasn't impressed so my take is if you are a Beatles fan by all means go for it but if you are Cirque fan there are much better options.,0,0,0

My best friend and I met in Las Vegas specifically for this show. The Beatles have been a MAJOR part of our lives since the moment we met in kindergarten. Most songs give me the chills listening to them on my crappy car stereo. So imagine how affected we were sitting in that amazing room with the speakers in our chairs. Pretty awesome. 

Our seats were in the first row in the balcony. I think they were the best seats in the place. So much happened right at our eye level. These creepy, flying people came out of the wall right at our heads. Fantastic! I think I would have been disappointed had I been on the lower level. My neck would have been majorly cramped. 

The one thing I do have to say is that about 3\/4 of the way through, they stopped the show for no particular reason and made us wait about 30 minutes before restarting it. I know how professional and experienced the Cirque family is, so it had to be something major for them to stop the show. Perhaps an injury or something. Regardless, it started back up and they finished the show. No harm done.

What a wonderful experience. So worth the $500 flight and $100 tickets. I would so go again. I've seen other Cirque shows and for me they don't compare. I suppose it's a personal thing. I can only watch people jump up and down for so long. But, I could watch John, Paul, George and Ringo on a big screen while listening to their music for ever.",1,1,0

Where can I even begin to describe how fantastic this performance is?

For starters, when the workers say there is no bad seat in the house they truly mean it! The stage is situated right in the center and the seats are stadium style and offers a different perspective from each angle. I preferred to stay at the very top row because I was able to see everything without having to crane my neck up or down too much (especially since there is a scene in which the entire audience is covered by a drape). 

This was my first Cirque du Soleil show and expected more acrobatic movements but it seemed to be more of a circus-like performance with heavy prop usage. Still a great show though because each song offered a different stage setup that kept the audience from getting bored!",0,0,0

Any seat is great because the stage is in the center of the room, like watching a basketball game except you're not focused on two hoops on the court. The room also felt a lot more intimate-- it looked like there were less people than at other shows. 

There are less ""tricks"", less acrobatic skills, less display of the human flexibility. Instead, the show revolved around the Beatles' classics and the performers dressed themselves and the stage accordingly. The thought that went into each phase was incredible and there were so many beautiful set ups. Honestly, all the other shows have meshed into one in my head, but this one was SO different.

There were parts of the show I did like, but much more that I did not like. I like the music,  I was expecting more stunts and acrobatic acts since its by Cirque. But what I saw was more dancing and the characters parading across stage. The costumes were definitely very creative. The show also incorporated alot of old England culture and highlighted some of its darkness. I couldnt appreciate that aspect because I dont find anything dark entertaining in Vegas.

Anyway, the show is OKAY. Definitely better than the Chris Angel show.

LOVE was on my bucket list so I managed to convince my friends to watch it with me. It was pricey but worth the experience! 

LOVE has a special spot in my heart. My ex boss had their soundtrack on repeat for several days at work while I worked on The Beatles illustration for a client. Usually people get sick of it but the more I listened to it the more the band grew on me.

The music was eargasmic and nostalgic. The performance was top notch (of course) and so much was going on I couldn't catch everything that happened on that circular stage.

What I liked: The whole experience is very Beatles. As you're walking in, the usher are dressed like 60s mod versions of Tower of London Beefeaters. It's hard to get a bad seat in the theater, and actually, I was told the better seats are higher up because you have a wider view of all the action. When you're sitting closer to the stage, you end up looking up and around a lot as you're trying to see everything. The costumes were beautiful, and or course, I love the Beatles, so I found myself singing a lot.

What I didn't like:For me, the show started off on a high note, with Britain in its post-WWII days and how the four lads from Liverpool rose to fame. As the show went on, it was a little harder to follow the story (as is typical of most Cirque du Soleil shows.) The other thing that really bothered me is that at one point, the dancers started yelling in that made-up Cirque de Soleil tribal language. What the heck does that have to do with the Beatles?! It was just so out of place for this particular show. I also wish they had picked some more upbeat songs. There were some low\/depressing moments in the show. 

How it compares to other Cirque shows: I actually liked the Beatles Love show better than ""O"" and ""KA"" but it's not my favorite. That title would have to go to Zumanity. While it's for a completely different audience, I didn't see any low points or annoying tribal yelling in that show. Zumanity is totally worth your money.",0,0,0

There wasn't a ton of acrobatics, but it had more dancing.  This was like a bad musical, except the characters hardly sing.  Rather they rely of course on the soundtrack of the Beatles and the characters running around trying to act out a story.

And .. as for the story.. does the guy lose the girl, and then see her pursued and wooed by another dude before she gets killed in an accident and go to heaven?  Or did I drink my giant $16-20 Pina Colada too quickly?  It's not a really happy story.

Thank goodness the pina colada was significantly large enough to last the show.  (Might hold ~40 ounces.)


The true mark of a good show is the buzz that you hear when you walk out, with everyone raving how great or awesome it was.  When I went to pick up my tickets at will-call for the late show, the previous show was coming out.. and that should have been my cue to request a refund before I even go it.  I understand their disappointment now.  Save your money for dinner, gambling, or something other than Beatles\/Love show.


My recommendation:  Go see the Cirque du Soleil ""O"" show.  That was fantastic when I saw that on a previous trip.  That's one of the most popular shows for good reason.

It would've been better with 'shrooms!  Not that I've had it but I can only imagine what it would be like tripped out as you watch the over the top psychedelic show.

My Mommy Dearest is a big fan of the Beatles (understatement), so it's only natural to have this show as part of her milestone celebratory day.  I'm not going to divulge the show, all I can say is it heightens every senses you have...get some popcorn and you will experience all five at the same time.  You may even add the 6th with 'shrooms and see dead people.

Warning:  It will have an opposite effect on some, like my hubby for instance.  He was in and out of naps during the show.  We did go to the 9:30pm showing, plus the mellow parts can really put you down.  My little cutie pie did so well, sitting on the edge of his seat in awe of  the acrobats.  Towards the end, I look over and he's in a fetal position...asleep.  It was 2 hours long plus we waited at the gift store for at least one hour before.  One of the most expensive naps they've ever taken!  My little cutie pie told me he really liked it.

We got a group discount that went from costing us $150 pp to $98 pp.  If you decide on the less expensive seats, I don't see too much of the difference.  You will only be a level  higher.

The founder of Cirque, Guy, was close friends with George Harrison, who had initially thought it'd be a wonderful idea if the worlds of Cirque and the Beatles somehow met.

It was no easy task, as this was not just a collaborative effort of the director and actors, but of the original musicians, and their family members and Apple Corps. Basically, everything you see during this show is both Cirque approved and Beatles approved, as every little decision was closely collaborated upon by the likes of George Martin, his son Giles, Yoko Ono Lennon, Olivia Harrison, Paul and Ringo. 

And it's amazing. It really is. 

While I've meanwhile never been a huge fan of the loose plots Cirque comes up with, the sensation of mixing several ethereal visions & effects with remixed, remastered Beatles songs proved to be a place-altering experience. I had many moments of being lost, confused, but joyful of that lostness. Certain moments of mixed music, mixed with the right vision, often left my speechless and happy, and as close to the Beatles as I'll ever be.

There are two kinds of people who will see this show: Beatles fans, who will connect on a spiritual level to what this means to the fans and the actual artists, and occasional\/not so much fans, who will still find something beautiful and deeply gratifying about this show, because it is just so highly worked on, so highly imagined. 

It's certainly an endeavor of its own, and its magical!

Personal favorite scenes: Octopuses Garden (which begins magically as Good Night - I LOVED this!), Strawberry Fields Forever (a demo version which Yoko donated from her archives, reworked), Within You Without You (mixed awesomely with Tomorrow Never Knows), Something and A Day In a Life. The music was all revisited by George & Giles, and includes demo\/anthology versions worked upon - including ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" which brought in a whole new orchestra to re-create the feeling of the song. It's almost like hearing these songs new, done by the master himself!

Now that the show's behind me, I'm glad I checked it off my list but didn't love it like I thought I would. My husband had the same reaction.

We were told to arrive at least half an hour early to pick up tickets at will call, and moved dinner to an elderly hour in order to make that time. Picking up tickets took about one minute, and we could easily have arrived right on time--I think we couldn't even sit when we were told to arrive. This seemed like a pretty naked ploy to get us to gamble out of boredom and I was definitely tempted. We browsed the souvenir store and went to Starbucks instead.

The house was far from full (makes sense, as we were able to get discount tickets) and we had decent seats. I enjoyed the show, for the most part. The music and choreography and visual effects were good, and I loved the acrobatics. There were several really impressive numbers that focused on small groups of performers. (The aerialists were amazing.) I preferred these to the giant ensemble pieces, which got kind of jumbled and boring. I also realized as I was watching this show that I don't care for circus humor. There was a part where a man dressed like a blackbird came out and cawed, and I wanted to look away.

I may just be an uncultured boor with a short attention span, but I definitely didn't want this show to be longer, and there were several times when I hoped it would end in the next five minutes. Also, I'm convinced that part of this show was pretty racist. There were thin white aerialists by the dozen, and only one black female performer. She came on stage to put her hands on her hips and thrust her pregnant belly up and down at a black male performer, who was shouting either gibberish, or another language presented to sound like gibberish--Africanese presented for laughs. (The performers didn't really speak otherwise, except for one narrator.) I was already watching with a measure of horror and incredulity when my husband leaned over and asked, ""Is it just me or is this really racist?"" I'm surprised Cirque hasn't gotten shit for this bit.

Anyway, I'm happy I checked Love off my list, and I did have a good time watching acrobats fly and dance to Beatles music, which remained stuck in my head for weeks. If it weren't for the spot of racism there, I'd probably recommend the show freely, at least to people who are into Cirque.",8,5,5

First of all, let me preface by say that I am not a huge Beatles  fan and was a little reluctant to even go. This said....I AM SO happy that I went. If you can, go on an off night too...not Friday or Saturday. We went on a Sunday, and were upgraded to floor seats at no additional charge. 

Wonderful story of their songs and incredible acrobatics and dancing.

We also splurged on a speciality cocktail IN a huge Beatles LOVE cup. worth the $$.

Lovely evening. I highly recommend it.",0,0,0

I live in Vegas and have gone back to see it probably a dozen times, always taking guests who were visiting from the states and abroad. My husband took me for our anniversary last night. I don't know what the heck happened to the show. It sucked!! Just chaos! With no story line you could follow anymore. The changes in the music score, the lighting (more like a light show now), the performers, all chaos.To top it off, gave the audience a little bit of ""white guilt"" with their klan outfits and burning crosses and madness. It's like the show went through a blender on high speed. I thought the show was about ""LOVE"" and the history of the Beatles. What a shame! Amazing how such a wonderful show could go so far downhill. I left with a headache (as I'm sure many also did) and realized all good things must come to an end, I will find another show to entertain our guests. Just glad I got to see it the way George Harrison and the Beatles families intended it to be, before it was trashed.  And the way George Martin intended the score. Glad I have the cd from years ago. At least I can picture in my mind what once was. Sad.
I notice some reviews say, you would only enjoy if you were a die hard Beatles fan. I've taken People to the original show who hated the Beatles. They were at the edge of their seat in excitement, saying the best show they ever saw. At that time if you weren't a Beatles fan, you were when you left. What a shame ......",0,0,0

I would have given it 5 stars but I was somewhat disturbed by the fact that they had no warnings that people with epilepsy would have problems with some of the acts. I don't suffer from epilepsy but after one particular piece I was worried I might start then and there! The effect was very disorientating and made us all feel a bit queasy. Not a reason to avoid the show unless you have a medical condition, but a warning should be given before you book.",4,3,3

The music sounds amazing. The cast is energetic and you will have a hard time knowing what to look at because there is just so much to see. There are some very moving moments in the show - I've seen it twice and loved both performances. 

Now let's talk about the problem. The Cirque security team, ushers, bouncers and the like are all poorly-trained, power-hungry, Paul Blart Mall Cop types. Another way to describe them is ""thuggish."" They were rude to me and my guest both times I went to the show. If you go to the early show they really want to rush you out of there quickly. I was trying to buy gifts in the gift shop when some ape steps in front of me and ropes off the back entrance. He says I have to move on. I asked him if I could simply cross the rope that 10 seconds ago wasn't there. He put his hand in my chest and said no - it was ""for my own safety."" What he really meant was ""This is MY power. This is my chance to pretend I am somebody and I get to tell you what to do."" It was silly, unnecessary and downright off-putting. I wasn't drunk (hadn't had one drink,) I was dressed in a suit and tie, I wasn't causing trouble but was run out of there (like anyone else who had the bad luck to be trying to spend money in the gift shop) like I was a deadbeat. I won't be back. Ever. 

If you want to go visit the gift shop, my advice is go before the show. And watch out for the so-called ""security."" It's easy to spot them - they are the typical wannabe cops that couldn't get a job with Metro so they play Barney Fife at the Cirque show and pretend they are bad-asses. 

If you do go to the early show do some workouts the week before you go. Then prepare to do some wind sprints down the hallway the second the show is over because they WILL run you out of there like it or not - and they won't be polite about it.",2,1,0

I've seen almost all the Cirque du Soleil shows, in Vegas as well as the traveling ones. They really out did themselves with this one!

Let me start off by saying.....I'm not like the majority of people who go to see this show, I'm not a HUGE Beatles fan who just can't get enough for them. I mean don't get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of their songs and have immense respect for their longevity. 

I have to disagree with one of the other reviews don't think there is any awkward\/bad seats in this place, the way it is set up is amazing and very well done. Like one of the other reviewers, I did seat in a seat right where the sheet ended in the last act and I have to say those probably are the best seats (in the middle area) if there is a ""best seat in the house.""

I totally get why they don't want anyone to take pictures or video during it because I think just going in there and experiencing it yourself is the only way to do it. I've always been a fan of the Beatles, and this was the show I picked for my birthday. And the show didn't disappoint. The music was arranged wonderfully, and the costumes and the acrobats and just everything was amazing. At times I almost felt overwhelmed because there were so many people to watch and things to look at, but it was overwhelming in a good way. There was just so many cool things to see that I was trying to take in as much of it as I could.

We also got the tickets for about half price because we actually went to the box office the night before to ask if they still had seats available for tomorrow night. (It was a Sunday when we went to check and some timeshare people had told us the show was sold out.) As it turned out, they were doing two shows on Monday night and the guy at the box office told us there were more seats available for the 9:30. So we asked him to pull that up, and he told us he would give us a deal. We ended up getting seats that were kind of in the middle (not in the balcony but not right next to the stage either) for like $90 a piece. We were sold, and again the show was amazing!

Blackbird, Yesterday, and Hey Jude were my favorite parts.  My only disappointment was the lack of 'Let it Be', but I'll let it slide because the Beatles obviously have way too many great songs to fit into 90 minutes.

Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, and it did have its moments.  I just expected more out of the Cirque.  They danced and created skits to some of the Beatles' most popular songs, drawing you into an artistic storyline.  

Some of my favorites include the little yellow rain boot tricycle, the car crash, and the lady whose head drunkenly fell down to her ankles.

A couple of my disappointments: they seemed to focus a lot on the lesser known songs, and spent very little time on some of my favorites, including ""All the Lonely People.""

If you're a huge Beatles fan, you will love this show. If you're a huge Cirque du Soleil fan, you will be just a wee bit disappointed.

This is more of an interpretive visual feast of the Beatles discography cleverly edited together, following the eras of music in England. Don't expect jaw-dropping acrobatics or shocking shows of strength and agility. My fiance and I were feeling VERY frustrated in the first 20 minutes because the show felt more like an off-broadway dance revue with lots of hydraulics and bungee cords, than the usual amazing feats of humanity that we've come to expect of Cirque shows.

Once we realized that the show was more of an artful, visual performance for the senses, we relaxed, accepted the fact that we wouldn't be seeing any super-human skills, and allowed ourselves to get lost in the visual spectacle.

But that's all it was: Spectacle. No substance. The show depends so heavily on Beatles music, whereas the choreography is not very imaginative at all. (On the same level of what you'd expect to see during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.) 

I usually leave Cirque shows feeling ""elevated"" and inspired. But I left this one feeling misled. Don't get me wrong, there were points that were lovely, and parts that were fun, but overall this is not a Cirque show, but a psychedelic 3D jukebox.",4,0,0

I loved the music and when the Beatles shadows come out and you feel like they are in the show too! The dancing, the propos, the colors, the acrobatics.. all of it is just a perfect medley.

My only complaint is that they need someone to watch people during the show. We had a drunk girl sitting next to us who kept getting up, talking very loudly during the show, etc. -- someone should've asked her to quiet down or leave. They had tons of ushers before and after the show but need someone to monitor more during the show. It was very distracting but no reflection on the actual show as much as the venue.",2,0,1

Much of the show takes place above the audience so our seats were perfect.  Even one part of the show involves the whole audience and our seats again provided a superior vantage point.  

So a couple of thoughts to help you if considering this show.  It is not a Beatles tribute with acrobatics.  It is a Cirque Du Soleil show set to the Beatles music.  The difference?  The performers are still the focal point (vs. the Michael Jackson show which was a tribute to MJ performed by Cirque Du Soleil). 

Second, for this show it is as if they have taken movie special-effects and brought them to a live audience (in terms of the sets, scene changes, choreography).  It is jaw dropping. 

Third,  the athleticism of the performers is remarkable and yet understated as it is used to advanced the show's theme.

Although you don't need to be a Beatles fan or know their music particularly well, I think it helps greatly in the entertainment and enjoyment factor. It pushes it over the top for me. I love the Beatles. Thanks to my parents listening to them incessantly, it was hard not to hear their catchy tunes as a child.

I recognized all but a couple of the songs played and for the ones I didn't I wasn't as pumped compared to the ones I knew.

This isn't the first Cirque show I've been to but there were less amazing acrobats and more interpretative dance in my humble opinion. If you are looking to be wowed by acrobats then this is probably the least ""Cirque"" one for you. The best part for that I can recall is the skating part where they do some nice tricks.

If you want to feel good and enjoy the show as they sing the song at the end, then this is the show to see.

We lucked out scoring seats in the fourth row, but I'm sure every seat in the place is great. The sound is perfect in every direction, combined with speakers in your seat, front and back. I've read other reviews complaining that this show somehow wasn't athletic or acrobatic enough. WTF? Sure, maybe other Cirque shows have more crazy, rowdy, acrobatics, but Love certainly doesn't lack for amazing physical feats, particularly by the aerial performers. 

I highly recommend going to the Cirque web site prior to attending the show, to familiarize yourself with the director's interpretation of the characters. Had this not been recommended to me, I'd probably be kind of lost and just listening like the show is a jukebox. Instead, you're treated to a cast of characters derived from elements of each Beatles song. You'll be surprised at how these elements aren't confined to the song you'd think they belong in.

I enjoyed the show, there are some magical moments but a lot of it is just dancing.  I read a disappointed review of how this show looked like a high school musical.  It's partly true.  The show kind of tracks the evolution of Beatle music and does a great job of visually expressing some of their more psychedelic songs.

I really enjoyed how they captured each Beatles song with dancing, lights and acrobatics. We sat in the 300's and had a great view on everything. The best part of all of the Cirque shows is that no matter where you sit you are insured a great view. The set design and sound is amazing. We got a steal of a deal on Travelzoo.com. Tickets were sort of pricey before the discount, but I would have paid for them even if I wouldn't have had the discounted tickets.

Love was good.... but I guess it wasn't everything I hoped it would be. It was entertaining but I didn't find it riveting like I like my Vegas shows to be. It was more of a concert with dancing than a show I felt. It was literally just playing Beatles songs (which sounded awesome) with performers dancing\/acting out the songs. I felt like I was at a concert more than anything. I've been to Cirque du Soleil shows before and this one was eh. The costumes weren't as creepy\/bizarre\/eye catching as I thought, there weren't as many stunts as I expected and they weren't that extensive. The stunts pretty much just consisted of swinging from the ceiling, climbing ropes, roller skating and jumping around.  And I am a Beatles fan, I knew all the songs & was singing along. It was good but I just felt unsatisfied and a little disappointed, I think my reaction was, ""That's it? This is what the hype was about?"" There were cool parts- like in the beginning when this creepy looking guy with a tea pot was walking around pouring the steam brewing out on people's heads or when a large sheet came down covering everyone and the ending (parts of the show were trippy).

Went with my father, who was still in his teens when The Beatles emerged, and my wife, who was decided not yet in existence at that time. So between varying age groups and varying devotion to the Beatles and\/or Cirque, all comers were satisfied.

I can't go into too great a detail because SO MUCH was happening all the time on stage! I fell asleep during the plinky-plonky water-dripping snore fest that is O, but at BL I found myself unable to blink due to the need to take it all in. I could even see myself going again just to see what I missed the first time round.

There's the barest hint of a story, which will only make sense if you know the personal pasts of both John and Paul, but the real emphasis is on the art, yes art, that is on display.

Fantastic sound system as well, sounded immediate and close, not just noise-blasting-ly loud.

If you like the Beatles, you will love it. Be aware it's a lot more of the later, Sgt. Pepper-era stuff than you might expect, but most of the old classics are in there too.

Be warned- this is not necessarily like other cirque shows. I LOVED it, but it involves a ton of psychedelic\/funky\/dance-y type elements versus pretty much straight acrobatics seen at ""O"" and others. I LOVED it, but my parents were a little bummed out because they were expecting that.",3,0,0

There's more dancing, acting, and comedy and it flows more like a musical. The costumes, props, and sets fit the music soo well.

The best Cirque show, hands down and around. One of the best shows, period. And I've seen a LOT of shows in my lifetime. Aren't all Cirque shows the same, you may ask? The answer is no! This show focuses less on glorified circus tricks and brings more LIFE to the dances and acts, making the experience more REAL.

'LOVE' is different. It is moving and meaningful. Set around the World War II period, the show really captures the mood of the era. The music is all the Beatles tunes you grew up singing and tapping your feet to. The performers' dances and acts are so easy to relate to and the room is flooded with such a heightened sense of emotion. The show is also so much FUN! There are many acts that completely blew my mind, and others filled me with such joy (some acts did both!).

Unlike almost every show I've ever seen, every seat in the house IS a good seat. The theater is structured such that it has a very communal feel, and enhances that sense of community during the way cool audience participation section -- don't worry, it's nothing that puts you on the spot at all. 

During 'LOVE', I lost sense of time and thought (and hoped) it would never end. After leaving the show, I felt like I was walking on air.


TIP: Although this show may be costly, it is definitely worth it. This is the #1 show I've ever attended in Vegas. For your reference, 2nd place goes to Avenue Q -- anything that erases lines of political correctness is awesome in my book!",16,8,15

When we arrived we went to the Gift Shop for a souvenir we got a nice Christmas ornament from the Show. Also upon entering was a photographer that took our photos in different pose. They came out great and bought all 4 in their leather embossed duo frame. It even had the date on the bottom which was great as it was a nice remembrance from my husband's big birthday. 

Before entering the show they sold ginormous drinks in great souvenir cups. Both alcoholic and without. We got our drinks and headed inside. Was glad that our seats that were bought on the phone with Vegas.com were perfect. I couldn't have picked better. The show was fantastic and the Beatle songs some sad some happy at times had me cry. It was just beautiful. So much of the show you can't imagine how they do it. At times there was big balls in the air going back and forth between the audience.

Why? Because if you see it first I can all but guarantee everything else will completely pale in comparison.

In the past 2 years or so, I've become an absolute Beatles nut. When I found out I was getting to see LOVE with some family, I was absolutely thrilled. Before going, I started to build it up in my head and ran that risk of having expectations that are far too high. 

Well, they were exceeded.

The first thing I noted, and was really excited about, was that the theater is actually not all that big. It's actually quite intimate and has a very cool design, with round seating facing a stage with four entrances that the performers come in on.

The show itself totally blew me away, and actually really moved me. After a beautiful intro with ""Because"", the silhouettes of The Beatles are projected on 4 screens hanging down and they launch into ""Get Back"", kicking it off and causing some serious chills.

I won't talk about details for the rest of the show, because you've got to experience for yourself. There is so much going on, and the performers are incredibly talented. They really pull you in. I had a smile plastered on my face the entire time and even sang along with some songs (the whole crowd was that into it)

The whole thing was a pure rush, and I couldn't believe it was over....I could've watched 5 more hours!

LOVE is one of the best, if not maybe the best, shows I've ever seen. It's funny, it's moving, it's energetic, it's nostalgic, it's just incredible.

This is not like your typical cirque show.  I made the mistake of going in expecting to see all the fun bendy and crazy stuff from the other shows I""ve seen - O, Mystere, KA, Kooza, and Zumanity.  Love is mostly dancing, bouncing on trampolines and floating around via bungee cords to Beatles tunes.   Don't get me wrong, I love the  Beatles, and I especially love musicals.  The show started off AWESOME and I thought, ok this is going to be great!  But then they seemed to play more of the slower tunes after and it just seemed to get bland.  Unfortunately, I found myself slightly bored and even fell asleep a couple of times during the bouncing and rain boot stepping.  I'm not the only one either, I caught my fiance and a few other people around me dozing off as well. haha

This show focuses more on the music, the beauty of the costumes and stage, the visual effects and lights.  They even play conversation clips of the famous quartet.  There's quite a number of symbolism going on here as my friend explained, a lot of acting to complement the songs.  

There doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the theater since the stage is in the middle with seats surrounding it.

The show allows the audience to experience the music of the Beatles (which was remixed by their producer Sir George Martin and his son) in a new way. There are fewer acrobatics in Love than other Cirque shows, but the costumes and sets are much more elaborate. Love is entertaining and i would recommend it to anybody.

To start off, I don't want to give too much credit to the good music because, I mean, it's the Beatles.  You can't really miss if you've got that as your starting point - I almost feel like they're cheating with that as their basis.  Still, I did enjoy the music and left thinking that I really need to beef up my collection of Beatles songs.  The obvious trick is to interpret the Beatles songs in a beautiful and artistic way, and this show certainly accomplished that.  It was visually stunning - colorful, dreamy, sparkly, enticing.  The show flowed very well and the sets were gorgeous.  We probably got the worst seats available in our price range and, having seen it once, I would maybe return but would go for the balcony seats.  It's just not the kind of show where I think it makes a huge difference if you're really close because there is so much going on all over the place.

While it was beautiful and I enjoyed watching everything that was displayed for me, I was expecting there to be more acrobatics, contortions and feats of strength since it is a Cirque du Soleil show.  Had I known going in that there just wouldn't be many of those, I would not have been waiting for them and maybe would not have been as disappointed.  In that sense, it is very unlike other Cirque du Soleil shows.  It's more like musical theater but with recorded music and choreography and imagery and effects, kind of like Movin' Out with ballet set to contemporary music, except that it was prettier and didn't suck and there was not really any ballet.  It was nice, but I might check out some other Cirque du Soleil shows to get my fill of acrobatics before returning to see this one again.  With Love, you definitely are going for Beatles music and for the scenery, which is all very lovely.",3,2,3

We waited and waited for it to get better but we were so disappointed, like really, over the top disappointed. This is the 6th CDS show I've seen and this by far is the worse! Those who gave this show a 4-5 star review have not seen the other excellent CDS shows like Ka and O. 

Why?
- they played a lot of Beatles songs that I or my hubby haven't heard of, you have to be a hard core fan to know a lot of the songs
- they failed to play the more popular songs, what's up with that???
- the price was too much for what you get to see and hear (or should I say not see and hear?)
- there was no art to this show. it was pure dancing and regular acrobatic acts, nothing extraordinary, it was so boring
- clown in this show? for what?
- large screen that looks like my screensaver, why did we waste 90 minutes of our lives, why???

In short we don't LOVE Love. SKIP!!!",8,12,3

There was not one boring act in the entire show!
I also like the fact that there was no intermission (1.5 hrs straight)

The amount of work the performers endure and the intricate details in the props makes the show worth watching. 

The show is based on a compilation of Beatles top hits throughout their years. The performers uses different techniques to express what's going on. You have some break dancing, others on roller-blades, and some swinging in the air. This is a very visual and musical show. At one point, you have the performers act out as a car and then break away doing different things. When watching this show, it is best to sit as far back. LOVE's stage is actually broken down into sections, so there is no main stage. Because of this, I think the performers have a greater range for the stage and can utilize more of the area. During the show, you have dancers all over the place and it'll be easier to take everything in all at once instead of only being able to focus on certain acts.

We took family that grew up as Beatles fans, who went completely bananas over LOVE.  Then there's my boyfriend, who despite not growing up in that era, has always enjoyed their music.  He also enjoyed the show.  There you have it from all 3 Beatles fan perspectives: newbie, die-hard, & appreciator.


If I might give you one single piece of advice from my 2 separate LOVE experiences, it would be to reserve a seat just above where the "" white blanket"" ends.  This area of seating will provide you with the best available view and overall experience of the show.  This request will not be anything new or foreign for them.",2,0,0

The performers came across as charming and funny during asides and they flawlessly executed death-defying acrobatic maneuvers throughout the 90 minute duration. Cast members engaged with the crowd prior to the show and one even chased guests with a prop steampot. The atmosphere was very fun.

The show itself flowed wonderfully and there were a number of standout moments including the elusive angels of ""Something"" and the beautiful interaction of performers and special effects during George's intimate acoustic rendition of  ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps.""

The emotional transition between the tragic end of ""A Day In The Life"" and the redemption of ""Hey Jude"" was unforgettable, as well.

The rest of the show ranges from roller bladers on half pipes to the expected 60s protesters screaming for a revolution and it is enjoyable throughout. My only compaint is that the show ended far too soon and the performers left the crowd wanting more.

There are plenty of photo opportunities and the gift shop has something for every John, Paul, George and Ringo fan to geek out over. It took me ten years to get here for my first viewing, but I will definitely be back very soon.",0,0,0

We were in section 200 row N middle row seats so had a great view of the stages. I thought the dancing and acrobats were amazing. the skaters were awesome. chirography was excellent. 

I was a bit confused about why the KKK was in the show. another puzzling moment was 1\/4 of the audience being covered by the parachute\/ bed sheet, what was up with that? 

My favorite was Hey Jude, love that song! 

I'd say this is one if not the best shows that I've seen.

Sure, the music is great and the way they remixed it is awesome. But, I recommend buying the soundtrack if you are going because you love their music so much. 

We had seats that were pretty high up, but I don't think I would have wanted to be any closer to the ridiculous spectacle performed below.

The 60s' and The Beetles are very well represented here through dance and a wide array of visual splendor.  

As usual for Cirque du Soleil, the dance and performances are seemingly (amateur opinion) choreographed and executed flawlessly.  A skateboarding ramp is utilized by the four Beetle's characters who wear shoes with concealed wheels.  

Throughout the show there is a ""lonely guy"" (Sgt. Peppers Lonely Heart Band) who keeps missing out on love throughout the performance.  There are long sheer panels of cloth with illusions of the former band members and they seem to come to life with old vocal recordings of their dialogue playing in the background.  

This proved to be especially poignant for Bella as she was unfamiliar with nearly every Beetle's song but found herself moved to the point of cloudy eyes by the shows finale tunes of ""Hey Jude"" and ""With a Little Help From my Friends"" from the ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Band"" album.  Truth be told, I'd forgotten how many truly great songs The Beetles had until I heard them all in one sitting.",0,0,0

But, I'll cover the good news before the bad.  The theater was great, and I don't think it was possible that there was a bad seat in the house.  There were speakers in the backs of the seat headrests as well as in the front, so they didn't have to blast the volume to make it audible by all.  Just the detail that was put into the show was amazing, and it was visually a work of art.  They also incorporated some real candid recordings of the Beatles into the show and had a lot of great sub-stories to build on the main theme.  The spread of songs was good as some were from their pop days and some from their 70's trip days.  I'm more familiar with the pop songs, but enjoyed everything.

I've never seen any other Vegas shows or Cirque shows, but I've heard a lot of them contain a lot of action and stunts.  LOVE is much more about the acrobatics than death-defying stunts.

There is no possible way that the audience can take in all the visuals that are being thrown at them. Once the director doesn't care if I see it as and audience member, I don't care about watching it. There is actually a moment where 50% get covered and cannot see the visual that the rest of the audience can see. How arrogant. 

Their is no cohesive moments to allow the audience to even attempt to build a story for themselves. I know this isn't the point. But we audience members like to find meaning in our entertainment. 

The Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was the only piece I saw that had the 2 performers in a relationship. It was beautiful and moving. For a moment, I thought there would be something to build on. Luckily these wacky technical people squashed any relationship from that part forward.

This show is obviously a show about the Beatles. The show is a broad spectrum about the Beatles biography during the world war in London. It's characters and costumes represent each character in the song. For example, a few favorites of mine; Lucy in the Sky , Eleanor Rigby, Lady Madonna,  Mr. Kite, and of course Here Comes the Sun, with a character that resembles Krishna. The fabulous costumes were done by a French designer Jean Rabasse, and the stage itself is a central stage giving each seat the ultimate LOVE experience without any obstructions in view. The scene is named after each songs. Each scene has it's unique choreography which includes dancing and acrobatic stunts, that are your typical Cirque du Soleil routines, but I still find it entertaining since the theme is different from your typical cirque show.

Turned out to be great seats because you saw things happening up higher and got a pretty good perspective of the overall show.

Unfortunately, I thought we were going to see recreation of the Beatles (the 4) doing funny acrobatics or something, but it wasn't. It was more like the cast was recreating the songs and their stories. My favorite was LSD ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and this one song I don't remember but they used this HUGE shear blanket to cover most of the audience and there was a boat ""floating in the middle."" That was pretty spectacular. The sheer blanket just expanded outward, covered most of the mezzanine level audience and how it just enveloped the theater was amazing. It really felt like it was waves of water. LSD was amazing too with all the twinkling stars in the sky and a girl swinging on a swing. Oh and they played Elanor Rigby, which I love.

I guess if you aren't a Beatles fan this may not be the show for you, but if you aren't a Beatles fan you are probably chronically unhappy anyway.

I don't really want to share too many details and cause spoiler alerts, so I will mostly say that Cirque adding a show that has skaters in it is genius.  Add to that the staging and story they build out of the Beatles musical catalog will have you laughing, crying and ooing and ahing.

It's true what other reviewers are saying: If you're seeking unbelievable acrobatics, feats of strength, balance and athleticism, there are better choices you can make than LOVE -- Mystére and O are the obvious answers.

But if you get off on a show that elevates the theatrical experience to its highest, state-of-the-art, world-class level, with a truly astounding array of wildly creative, insanely inventive and surprisingly transforming setpieces, ingenious costumes, motion graphics, lighting and special effects, all backing a huge cast of talented, stunning and en pointe performers, set to a lushly and skillfully mixed soundtrack created from the original studio masters for what became the blueprint for modern pop and rock... well, you'll be in hog heaven like I was. LOVE is a rich feast for the senses, and probably about as close as you can come to experiencing psychedelic drugs without actually doing them.

The good folks at Cirque du Soleil know how to put on a show. They spare no expense and craft intricate productions where every detail has been carefully considered and perfected. I find that very inspiring.

I took advantage of the Summer of Cirque promotion and got a $50 ticket, which put me in the back of the balcony, what you might call one of the worst seats in the house, but honestly it turned out to be a great vantage point. There is a LOT going on throughout the whole arena. I'd sit up there again in a second. I think sitting too close to the stage would probably be a mistake; you wouldn't be able to take it all in.

The music itself -- I'm paraphrasing this from the amazon page for the soundtrack CD (Dammit! Now I'm gonna have to buy it... why isn't it on iTunes!?):  Love is a mélange of the familiar and obscure, all literally mixed together in one 78-minute audio collage which succeeds in reminding the listener just why the Beatles truly are, as Lennon put it, 'toppermost of the poppermost.' There's no new Beatles material here per se, but the songs are all approached differently -- some are cut together in a flawlessly mixed medley (check out ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\/I Want You\/Helter Skelter""), some reassemble different backing tracks and vocal performances to create new spins on old classics; but all the songs are revitalized considerably. It begins with a twittering of birdsong lifted from ""Across the Universe"" and once the haunting, triple-tracked a capella harmonies of ""Because"" enter, followed by snatches from ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""The End,"" leading into a fired-up ""Get Back"" (as the darkened theatre explodes to life in one of the shows many larger than life, wild and dynamic transitions), it becomes obvious that this is far more than just another Beatles compilation. This is Love, conceived by the Fabs' former producer George Martin and son Giles.

I could blather on and on like a gushing fanboy about all the brilliant details of this lavish production, which combined so flawlessly to give me not one but multiple 'goosebump' moments -- those rare occasions where you experience something so magical that you get an actual physical sensation: a wave of chills up your spine and all the hairs on your body standing on end -- but I think I'll leave it at this:

For me, this is live theatre at its very best. Thank you, Cirque du Soleil! You have surprised and amazed me, and fanned the flames of passion that burn in my soul once again! I love you forever.",2,0,1

As other people have mentioned, it is much more about dance than the acrobatics of other Cirque shows, although Love also relies more heavily on theatrical effects.  It's a very trippy show and I think at some point the creators mixed up abstract artistry with throwing a bunch of random-ass shit together.  For example, some burning questions:
- why was the KKK at the carnival scene?
- why were the Beatles in space?

The music was obviously good but didn't use as many of the ""upbeat"" Beatles songs as I would have expected and if you're only going because you love the music, save yourself at least $100 and buy a Beatles CD.  If you don't mind completely incoherent things happening on stage while Beatles music is playing, then go for it - it's very neat - but don't expect anything to make any shred of sense.  That was my mistake.

A few pieces of advice if purchasing tix though:
- Be sure to check BroadwayBox.com beforehand to see if there are any discounts available - most tickets are priced $150 and $125 normally.
- I suggest NOT sitting in the very first section (100 series) as there are quite a few effects from the ceiling.  The theater presents pretty good views from all seats
- If you need to pick up tickets from the Mirage box office, go EARLY instead of right before your show - the line for pickup can be REALLY long an hour before a show starts
- You get a 2-for-1 ticket for the REVOLution lounge at the Mirage from 8-10pm with each ticket purchased.  Offer applies only to well drinks, beer, and wine.",2,0,1

If you have experienced Cirque shows, you most likely assume what you're getting yourself into is another entertaining performance with tricks and stunts, basically typical circus acts with flair. Well, this definitely stands out amongst the others.

Obviously, LOVE celebrates the history of the Beatles and their music. Rather than aerial acts, contortionists, and trapeze acts, Cirque uses the art of dance and unique stage props to portray Beatles' classics and tell the story of their music. Don't worry, there are still some cool tricks they perform to keep you entertained. 

The staging for the show is awesome, honestly any seat is a good seat. Wait, I'm lying, don't sit in the very first row! Your necks are bound to be hurting by the end of the show and all you'll get to appreciate is their feet. The stage is set in the middle of the room with the seats placed around them in a full 360 circle. There isn't any type of backdrop other than 2 panoramic screens placed against the back walls, which can be seen from any seat. 

Even if you're not a huge Beatles fan (what?), you'll still enjoy the show because of the excitement and liveliness the dancers, props, and special effects are able to bring to the stage.

You'll leave the theatre feeling nothing but happiness and truly believing 'all you need is love'.",2,0,3

This is a show about Beatles's music and their history, and it follows a semi-storyline.  If you have no idea of the context of the song, you will just see whole bunch of very good dancers with pretty costumes running around.

Another thing is that the theater does have bad seats.  I would say 85% of them are good seats but the 15% that is at the side of the big curtain, (the theater has one big curtain and two small ones) they will have problems seeing 100% of the show.  So, avoid the cheapest seat and opt for the closer seats. (Avoid sections 203, 204, 205 and 206 if you can.)

I was so wowed by everything. There are sad parts, there are fun and happy parts, there are crazy parts, there are parts where you want to run on stage and start dancing. There wasn't a boring moment. I've never been so upset about a show coming to an end, why couldn't it just go on all night?! We had 3rd row seats, so we were able to see every detail.

5 Stars because...
- the 360 degree view seating provides a more intimate feel
- they didn't try to ""cover"" any of the songs and used real clips of the Beatles songs (if it ain't broke, don't fix it)
- the song selection and mix kept the show pace appropriate 
- the artistic interpretations of the songs were interesting and not trite
- lastly, the $15 frozen margarita came in a Beatles LOVE cup and was absolutely delicious!

This show is a stunning visual display of artistic interpretations of Beatles songs using a combination of dancing, acrobatics, and acting.  This isn't a traditional-traditional Cirque, so if you're looking for jaw-dropping acrobatics then perhaps KA or Zumanity would better interest you.

I gave it a standing ovation.

Saw the Beatles LOVE show, AGAIN!  This 2nd time around we got our tickets like way late (an hour before show start) and we got amazing seats.  I'm talking 3 rows up from stage floor seats.  I could feel the gentle 'whoosh' of air coming from the performers as they danced, and did acrobats literally 4 feet in front of me.  All of the details of this show are worth a good seat.  Music compilation and acting was still en pointe.

I do have to point out a few things to help you choose from the many different Cirque shows in Las Vegas at any one time.

1. You will enjoy this show 10x more if you are Beatles fan.  They excerpt part of the Beatles Sessions\/Beatles Anthology with speaking parts from their recording sessions.  They fake you out a few times with that.  If you don't know the music, you will still probably like it, but I think knowing the songs helps you understand the context of some of the aspects of the show.

2. This is not a terribly aerial or acrobatic show.  Don't get me wrong, there are acrobatics in the show and some of them are cool to watch, but you will not get the gravity defying acrobatics that you might see in some of the other shows.  This show is all about the music and the songs.  They tell stories and they dance.  And oh do they dance.  If you are a fan of dance, you will love this show.  I would describe it as more acrobatic ballet. 

3.  There really is not a bad seat in the whole place, but if you sit in one of the lower sections, you will be able to participate in the audience participation part of the show which is hella cool and if you have kids, they will really love it.  The scale of the online seating chart is misleading.  It is a pretty small theatre and you will not miss out on anything or have any obstructions if you sit higher up.  I would recommend section 209 if you can get it.  It is where I sat and I had an excellent perspective. 

4. The staff was very professional and friendly.  I bought my tickets online and was not given the opportunity to select a seat.  The seat I was assigned was next to a young couple who were obviously trying to impress each other because they smelled like they had very literally taken a bath in cologne and perfume.  It gave me such a headache, I got up and asked the aisle section attendant if I could possibly be reseated, especially since it didn't seem like it was going to be a sold out show.  I explained why I wanted to be reseated and she seemed to understand.  Not only was she able to reassign me a new seat, it was in a better section, closer to the action.  I am extremely grateful, otherwise I'm not sure I could have enjoyed the show.

5.  Don't even think about trying to sneak a photo.  They have people monitoring the sections and if you get caught, they will ask you to leave.",0,0,0

The show isn't just a tribute; the Beatles were involved in making it.  George Harrison was friends with the Cirque creator and they brainstormed the idea until George died, at which point Paul, Ringo, and Yoko became consultants on the project.  The soundtrack was also personally redone by original Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles, so the cliche that you will ""hear the music as you have never heard it before"" is literally correct.  Look out for the new strings version of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" - it is just as good as the original, imo.  The way a song like ""Because"" merges with the opening chord of ""Hard Day's Night"" before launching into ""Get Back"" at the beginning of the show is just a clue to how much they really pushed the envelope with reinterpreting the music.  It is pretty risky to ""remix"" songs by a legendary group like the Beatles, but they pulled it off. 

The show itself loosely tracks the story of the Beatles - from their start in Liverpool, to the Ed Sullivan show, their hippie\/psychedelic stage, political phase, through the band's break-up.   Don't expect a ton of the traditional Cirque acrobatics.  There is a good bit, but mostly it is dancing and choreography.  Like any Cirque show, however, the costumes, sets, etc. are pretty impressive visually. 

Again, I'm a huge fan of the group, but maybe the best testament to the show is that I took my girlfriend, who could barely name any Beatles song, and she came away a fan and has since gotten up to speed with their entire catalog.

It's all very sixties, very colorful, at times exuberant, at times somber and always visually stunning.  The music is GREAT!  The songs don't deviate far from the originals, but they are arranged in interesting and different ways.

My favorite number was Something -- it just made me think of my own life, and brought tears to my eyes.  Kind of fitting, since George is my favorite Beatle and Something is my favorite song, but this number was absolutely GORGEOUS.  Loved Lady Madonna and Octopus's Garden, too.

CdS shows are mostly about acrobatics and stunts, but the Beatles' LOVE show was different because everything was choreographed according to the history and music of The Beatles'.

PROs:
My favorite part of the show was when they played, ""Strawberry Fields."" 
If you are a Beatles' fan, you would know that this song was created when Lennon started experimenting with LSD.  During the song, the CdS performers draped a HUGE white sheet that covered the entire audience... and the sheet flowed across our heads for a good 3 minutes... which was to simulate a euphoric ""heads in the clouds"" experience.  I didn't need to be on LSD, but that part of the show definitely made me feel like I was flying high!  

Any seat in the CdS shows is a good seat!  The only difference is having a closer encounter with the performers or having a vantage point of the show coming together as a whole.  Our tickets cost $112 each and we were seated about one section above the stage.  These seats enabled us to see all the performers' facial expressions as they rushed on and off stage.  At one point during the show, I flashed the infamous ""Peace Sign"" and one of the CdS performers smiled and winked at me!  Ha ha ha... Gotta show LOVE to the British Invasion Era! 

CONs:
-No cons, except for the price.  It's not a cheap show, but that's cuz it is totally worth the money! 

SERVICE: ***** [Enjoyed that the ushers were dressed in British wear!]
AMBIANCE: ***** [Enthusiastic, energetic, fantastic color, felt like livin' in the Beatles' era, ...FUN! FUN! FUN!]
PRICE:  $$$$  [$112 each, seated one section above the stage] 
OVERALL:  ***** [Beatles' LOVE is FUN, entertaining, and a spectacular show!]

I highly recommend!  5-stars!

- Insane visuals, music and performers flying overhead

Vegas is all about good drink specials and while you wait for Beatles Love I highly recommend taking advantage.

Notes on tickets:
I spent quite a bit of time looking for a good deal (for a show on Mother's Day weekend.) You can get tickets on Vegas.com with discounted gift cards from Costco; log onto Cirque de Soleil's site (http:\/\/www.cirquedusoleil.com\/lasvegas\/en\/promotions) for current deals (usually 25% off selected shows) or book tickets on Mirage's website (sometimes for better deals.) Note: students get 35% off and active military get 40%. I was set on booking the 25% off but changed my mind at the last minute. When we arrived in Las Vegas, we went to a Tix4Tonight kioski on the strip and purchased great seats for $99 after tax. They were ""category 2"" seats.

Notes on seating:
There's not a terrible seat in the house, but I can see how some seats would be better than others. Like most Cirque shows, the best seats in the house is NOT the most expensive. The people that sit in category 1 (closer to the stage) actually have to look up the whole time. It's stadium seating so the best seats are actually further up (towards the middle.)",11,2,1

I remember how stoked I was to see this show!  This was coming from a point where I jumped on the Beatles bandwagon after watching Across The Universe.  I loved the songs they used in the film so after watching that, I knew that I was going to watch LOVE for my next Cirque show.

So for a whopping $165, I managed to score 3rd row seats.  It was really up close and personal with the performers!  Literally!  There was one part of the show where a performer flew at our section and the lady beside me hella screamed, LOL!!  The music selection was great and I loved the parts with the Beatles' silhouettes.  There were many moments in the show where I would be head bopping to the music and even singing along too.

LOVE isn't really for everyone expecting the crazy acrobatics and circus acts like in Mystere and KA, but it's more like a musical experience with the Beatles.  It purely is a show for the fans, but even if you're not a Beatles fan, I think you'll like it for the performances.

Of the three Cirque du Soleil extravaganzas I saw in as many days in Vegas last week, ""The Beatles: Love"" was the one that moved me the most.  This was unexpected, because -- although I am very, very familiar with the Beatles music -- I am not an ardent fan. This production cost over $125 million to stage, and every penny was visible on stage -- and audible, with six hand-tuned speakers in every seat-back.  Fantastic choreography, dazzling costumes, incredible sets, and of course, the amazing and thrilling acts that distinguish Cirque du Soleil from any other company performing today.

What drew me to this show initially was my love of the Beatles.

I was blown away by both.  

The performers were true professionals who have clearly mastered their craft.  The amount of precision and timing these performances entailed was mind blowing.  Not to mention incorporating the acts to fit various songs was no easy feat in itself.  I was happy to see two of my favorite Beatles songs ""Something"" & ""Elanor Rigby"" included in the show, the performances sent shivers up my spine.

The theatre is a circle so there's really no bad seat from what I could tell and the theatre is smaller than it would seem from the seating chart online so seats are all closer than you'd think. This was our first Cirque show and it was simply magical and captivating. It was funny, interactive and of course the tunes and talent were amazing.

Ten years ago I saw La Nouba and, while I appreciated the skills, sets, and costumes, the performance itself eventually left me so bored. Do amazing thing. Hold for applause. Keep holding. Do same amazing thing. Hold for applause. Keep holding. Do same amazing thing a few more times. Keep holding for applause although all aerial somersaults are starting to look alike. You get the idea.

As a self-respecting lifelong Beatles fan who married an even bigger fan, which I didn't think was possible without getting into obsessive territory, I wanted to see LOVE, but I had doubts. Wouldn't another boring Cirque be made even worse if it involved profaning the Fab Four as well?

We went for the cozy two-seat rows right down front. I don't think it's possible to get bad seat in this intimate theatre; people argue whether its better to be above or below ""the tent"" during a certain part of the show, but I don't think you can go wrong either way. We really liked being right in the midst of things (I was even hit by a flying ""brick"" during the Blitz scene. Cool!), and I especially liked having the row to ourselves. Ah, relaxed elbows! Sometimes it was hard to take everything in at once, but the close interaction with many of the characters was a good trade-off.

The show was BRILLIANT. Please imagine this word - BRILLIANT - written out in diamonds across the sky with Lucy trapezing around and between the letters. BRILLIANT.

I don't know how they weave it all together, but they do: the personal background and stories of the Beatles, the phases of their musical growth, historical context, and then also interpretations of the songs. All using the original (if modified) music - no cringy covers here.

I was spellbound.

Spellbound and snuffly, with a very wet face at the end.

This is a theatre-in-the-round so it's much better than most for good viewing. Find a seating chart online and take a good look. Stay away from the four top most balconies. And the close-to-the-stage down front section 100's seating is not good either. It's more expensive and you'll see LESS since you're so low and so much of the action is up in the air.

The best to see everything is in the 200's sections, about 4 or 5 rows back.  We sat in section 208, row N, seats 11-12-13. Perfect view for everything that was happening. The only way it could have gotten better would have been to be a bit more towards the middle. 

I also prefer main sections 207-208-209 and 200-201-202. They are more unobstructed and have a better view than the smaller separate sections 203-204-205-206. Also the performers seem to ""play"" to the two larger seating areas. Plus you can see from the chart how parts of the stage jut out into the main seating sections -- so you see the performers more up close.

We paid approx $125 each for the seats including an online discount but then adding on an online booking fee. (Still less than the advertised $143 each.)

Have a wonderful evening and enjoy the show!

This show is a lot more musical with less acrobatics. That was fine with me because the entire score sounds absolutely amazing in this theater. Every seat has it's own speaker system built in and every seat offers a great view no matter where you sit.

The sets of course we're very elaborate and the cast all very talented. But, overall the show just seemed very disjointed to me and I even found myself nodding off in parts and trying to stay awake!! As the other reviews noted the further back you can sit the better. We actually had seats on the end and the usher Susan (what a doll) asked if we wanted to move back so we would have more leg room and not have people climbing over us.

I'm not sure if it would be as enjoyable to someone unfamiliar with their music. I am a fan of the Beatles but I'm not completely wow-ed by this Cirque show. 

We had gold circle, row K seats, which are supposedly the best according to the box office. I will have to disagree with that sentiment. I would recommend a row or two behind K, as you sit higher up and won't have people walking directly in front of you. 

The show is music like other Cirque shows that I've witnessed (Mystere, Elvis, and Michael Jackson ONE) in that there's dancing, humor, acrobatics, etc. The lighting, sound and stage setup is very impressive. All this requires a large amount of technology and coordination, which also equals plenty of room for problems as we experienced. Our show was delayed mid-performance for about 5 minutes due to a technical problem. This was the first time I'd had this happen to me or even heard of it, although it's understandable with all the performers, hydraulic stage and lights. This delay definitely kills the vibe of the show as it essentially causes the performers to break character and simply walk off the stage.

If you've never been to a Cirque show, this is a great way to start but it's not the best one.

I'd never seen a Cirque show before this one and I went in not too sure what to expect.

It was tasteful and highly entertaining.

As a long time Beatles fan I appreciated that they didn't stick with all of the extremely obvious, overplayed songs and kept it all relevant to the story they were trying to tell, rather than making it be a cheesy procession of Beatlemania references set to acrobatics.

If you're in to huge amounts of the circus-style trapezery you might prefer other Cirque's but this one was just right for us - a great night out.

Love the old show as well as the revamped show!!  As grand as all Cirque du Soleil shows, The Beatles - Love Cirque du Soleil (""Circus of the Sun"") is more. It is a euphoric, festive extravaganza, celebrating the Beatles lyrics, music and influence through decades of political upheaval and social change, from a time of innocence through social volatility expressed through magical theatrical representation, extraordinary gymnastics, acrobatics, stunning performers flying from ceiling to floor, dance, costume, transcendent movement, props, extraordinary lighting, original music, photographs, and video.

You walk into the theater and enter a cerebral and intermittently psychedelic time machine, traveling forwards or backwards in time. Even before the show begins the imagery and characters that begin appearing transform you to the time of the formation of Ringo, George, John and Paul's band, The Beatles. Pulling on your heart strings, you are transformed and feel part of, or possibly travel back to times that may be experienced through music-Memory (pre-frontal cortex).

We went for a team building to see the new show.

Last year, I remembered that it was still enjoyable but it was a little ""dark"" in regards to the feel of the show.

This new show is much ""brighter"" and truly takes you through a fun euphoric journey matching the music selection.

There are no bad seats in this venue and the costumes and choreography is incredible.

I will say this, there is so much going on that it might be overwhelming. From the lighting, the acrobatics, the aerials, the dancing etc., it's truly a very visual show!

And to some extent, it is different from the rest as there are few mind-defying acrobatic acts or incredible contortionists, or other staples of a traditional Cirque du Soleil show.  What there is, however, is great Beatles music, incredibly talented dancers, and a rocking good time.  This is the show to see if you want to walk out with a big grin on your face and while we got free tickets, it would have easily been worth paying full price (there are often discounted tickets available though, so look around first).

The theater is circular and very intimate, so I don't think there's a bad seat in the house.  The sound system is extremely good, and they use the space well.  The show is well-paced, with only one or two numbers that drag and could be revised or eliminated, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience.  Of course, Beatles fans will love the music and cultural references, but even non-Beatles fans will appreciate the dancing and entertainment value.  It's also a great show for kids as there is a lot to look at and the mood is festive and fun.  We are planning a return visit on our next trip.",6,2,2

It was my first experience with Cirque Du Soleil, but later I've seen 'O' so I have something to compare it to. Here, the stage was situated in the middle of the podium and seats were all around it. Because of this, the visibility was great no matter where you sat. As far as I know other performances do not have such an advantage.

Of all the shows on the Strip. LOVE is probably the one with the least acrobatics. Still, there are a lot of aerials, climbing, trampolines and roller skating tricks :). What it has instead is great music and a great story with the historical and pop-cultural background. The classic Beatles songs are arranged in a new way to match special effects and changing of the sets.

I've been to other Cirque du Soleil shows and have never been let down.  I was expecting crazy acrobatics that would have some story line with a Beatles flare with this show but I was wrong.  It was a generally good show with great music obviously but I kind of felt lost in their storyline or lack there of.  It was so spotty and I was so confused with what was going on most of the time.  Also, I soon realized it's more of a dancer-type theatrical show which was nice I guess but I must admit I kind of fell asleep in most parts since I'm so used to the more acrobatic stunts of their other shows.  

Another bummer is that this show was all ages I believe and so it was unfortunate that my friend and I were stuck behind a row of teenage boys trying to whistle down scantily clad teenage girls....Three thoughts came to mind, 1) OMG...I hate teenagers. 2) Where are your parents?! 3) Why are these girls showing more skin than I am in Vegas?  So....depending on your luck you may have some issues w\/ that.  

Generally speaking it was just an Ok show to me.  If you're into the crazy magical flare of other Cirque du Soleil shows then this might not be the show for you.

I'm not a hardcore Beatles fan (as in I don't know every song by album or the trajectory of their career or long-lost behind the scenes footage\/audio) but I love tons of their songs. This show hits many of the well-known songs and also includes conversational clips of the fab foursome just jamming out in practice. 

I had already seen a few of the set pieces via the Worlds Away movie, so it was slow in parts for me. Plus, you could start to see the pattern of Cirque's creative approach after a while.

Is Cirque de Soleil taking over Vegas one cavernous venue at a time? It sure looks that way, and the familiar, dangling acrobats are on full display here. But what separates this show from the other writhing bodies-wrapped-in-fabric extravaganzas is the Beatles songbook. Culled from the group's master tapes to produce an authentic if sometimes bombastic reinvention of the Fab Four, it's entertaining for baby boomers like myself who still pathologically blame Yoko for breaking them up. 

What I didn't know was how involved the surviving Beatles were in mounting this production in 2006.The storyline traces the Beatles' lives from the London Blitz through the band's founding and then of course, the cultural icon years when their psychedelic and spiritual works overtook their pop hooks and finally gave way to their break-up in 1970. The stage is in the center of the theater, and Jamie W. and I were in the front row being pummeled by windblown sheets, plastic bricks and various paraphernalia coming from the vaunted ceiling. 

It's all good fun if rather loud. Some of the numbers worked better than others, the least fulfilling being the ones with repetitive acrobatics (for example, bodies jumping onto a phone booth) or uninteresting choreography (the gumboots used on ""Lady Madonna""). Few of the moves displayed are on the same level of what you see at ""O"" or ""Mystere"", but the familiarity of the music is the draw here. Even so, there are lots of alternate takes used here, as well as snippets of conversations between the band members and - perhaps heresy to purists - ""mash-ups"" created from elements of several songs.

My favorite sight, I have to admit, was the look of resigned sadness on the janitors waiting impatiently for the audience to leave in order for them to sweep up for the next performance. BTW, we were able to get half-price tickets ($75 each) for our front-row seats on the day of the performance by simply asking the concierge what they had left.",11,7,10

There are some acrobatics here but I felt like a lot of the show was a mob of people on the stage running around dancing. It follows the rise of the Beatles to international fame, but there's a little bit of dialogue (by the Beatles themselves? Or impersonators) over the loudspeaker.

There's one really cool scene that involves a gigantic sheet. For this reason, I recommend sitting in the back row to view the whole effect.

You know that feeling when you are giddy like a child and your eyes are big and you can't help but smile? Yep, that was me for the entire span of LOVE.

I am a huge fan of The Beatles, but even if you aren't I think that this is a performance you would enjoy at any age. When Sir Nicholas and I left the show we asked each other our favorite parts and truth be told it was hard to name the ones we like best because we liked them all. But, we managed to narrow down some highlights and I'll put them here for you. If you've never seen LOVE and don't like things ruined for you don't read any further...

Nick loved two parts best, one was a reoccurring theme of VW Beatles that ended with one actually made of different parts on handles with performers holding each piece inside the vehicle. At one point the car breaks apart and all these dancers spill out using a wheel hub or hood as an accessory for their act. It was quick charming. The other part was a trampoline set where there were four trampolines in the floor and the performers used them along with nets and a big red English phone booth to do the most amazing acrobatic acts.

While I liked both of those acts, too I thought that a foursome on roller skate (Maybe roller blades? I don't know because I couldn't see the wheels thanks to their shaggy white boot covers.) that used ramps to do their tricks was amazing. They were all perfectly in sync with hitting the highs in the air and on their tricks. 

But, for the song that stole the show when put together with the act I'd have to say Lucy in the Sky was the hands down winner for me. This started with a giant sheet covering the entire audience that reminded me of being in elementary gym class. They withdrew the white covering and the entire theater looked light we were out in the night sky, but a trippy version. Then a lovely red headed girl along with accompanying aerialists performed their act that seemed to showcase the song beautifully.

The tickets range from $100 - $150 for performance I think and this is one show where I say the $150 is worth it. It's a memory that likely won't soon fade, especially if you've ever liked any Beatles tune at all.",18,12,22

Anyway it was my first Cirque show ever and I had a great time. It was fun from start to end. Some characters were kinda creepy yet cute at the same time. I thought the kids were particularly good.

Love was good but  not spectacular. I went expecting tons of acrobatics and high flying tricks and such and all it was, was people dancing to the Beatles music. I could listen to the Cd at home for that. It was disappointing. Some things were cool to see, like the roller bladers doing some tricks during one song, but it wasnt exciting in your face as I thought it would be. There werent many arielists at all.

Of course, the main draw to this show is the music of the Beatles.  Most of the tracks are taken directly from the Beatles' albums and played as a backdrop to a Cirque du Soleil show that was less Cirque, and more of a visualization of the Beatles' style, cultural impact, and art.  There are roughly four performers who serve as caricatures of the Beatles, and it was evident that several sequences mirrored the lives of the Fab Four.

A lot of the acts did more to tell a story rather than showcase a skill, which I thought kept the show together as one coherent piece.  And although I'm not big fan, some of the interpretive dance sequences were truly memorable.  The 360 degree stage was also interesting, and while it seemed during some scenes a little too big for what was going on on stage, most of the audience a central view of the action.  The wide movie theater style screens behind the back rows added visualization effects and depth.

On the way out, I noticed several people exiting the theater still singing Beatles tunes.  But whether you're familiar with the Beatles' or not, you're sure to leave entertained.",3,0,2

The music selections were no problem for me, since I'm quite familiar with their catalog. But like one previous reviewer stated, too much clowning and antics, after what were quite serious moments. Like their Michael Jackson show though, which I was thoroughly disappointed with, the music is the best part of the performance. And I get it with the odd costumes; think Yellow Submarine, Sgt.

Performers fly in from every direction, from the floor or down from the ceiling.  It is borderline overwhelming, in mostly a good way... though I did seem to enjoy the more low key sections that focused on a single or small group of performers.

I'm going to include this first so you don't waste your money on seat upgrades: the floor seats aren't the best seats in the house. Don't spend the $200+ per ticket because you'll actually miss some of the performers. We had the very last row and loved our seats- which I know sounds strange but let me explain. When you click on the seating for the stadium, the stage looks huge. However, the show is divided up into four stage sections so that each section gets it's own show for the most part. Also- the stadium seating is extremely steep so even the back row is closer than you would ever expect. The show has so many performers, and a lot going on in the air above the seats past the stage- this is what you wouldn't see if you were in the front section because this would all be behind you. 

OK, the show itself is long and there is no intermission so get your drinks and bathroom breaks in before hand. We weren't sure what to expect, but the story covers the entire history of the Beatles, which is very cool, but a little depressing during a few parts. Confetti falls from the ceiling at a couple different parts and there is never a dull moment as there were several stage changes and continuous music. It was almost sensory overload. We weren't sure about spending more than the usual cost for the traveling shows, but honestly it's a completely different experience (starting with the more comfortable seats) and I would recommend going.",8,1,2

If you don't already know, I am obsessed with The Beatles (no, seriously...). I was interested in how this show would pan out, given that other Cirque shows have a specific repertoire.

Despite the uniqueness of Cirque shows, what I enjoyed most about this one was that it was different. You could understand exactly what was going on. The tasteful cuts in music presented an understandable and easy story to follow.

Theater: It is a circular theater facing a stage in the middle. I sat more toward the back, but I could still see everything nicely. The outside is super colorful and makes for great photo ops.

The show: SO.MUCH.COLOR. It's impossible to be in a grumpy mood the whole way through this show (even if I'm wrong, don't prove it to me please). The acrobatics were great, but some ran for a little longer than they should. I like the connection between the songs and the acts - ""Lady Madonna,"" ""Here Comes The Sun,"" and ""All You Need is Love"" being my favorites. 

Service : Ushers Sgt. Pepper costumes? Ahhhhh yes. They were very helpful and fun to approach\/look at.

Docking a 1\/2 star because it is a bit pricey. You can try finding deals outside or if you stay at the Mirage.

Overall, out of all the Cirque shows, I'd recommend this one. I could just be biased considering my love for the band, but I'm sure you'll walk away from it happy.",2,0,0

I was so excited to see this show I almost peed my pants. My gf got us tix to see it for Valentines Day (I know, awww) and the first 20 minutes of the show was all I expected and more. Dreamy sequences with hints of characters from the songs I grew up listening to..it was amazing. I sung along with every track and darted my eyes around the stage so I wouldn't miss anything. I bought the soundtrack before seeing the show so I sort of knew what to expect music wise (awesome soundtrack btw; remixing the Beatles is like sacrilege but not in this case).

The only problem was that 20 minutes in, some jackass pulled the fire alarm...and the show grinded...to....a.....halt. The fire sprinklers over one of the sections starting going off, so they had to evacuate everyone.

I can't believe people pay $100+ per ticket to watch the dancers on stage blow bubbles around. Glad we got free tickets for this.

This was not like other Cirque shows I've seen. It's mostly dancing. The females are ballerinas but done in a modern interpretive style, and the males are mostly artistical breakdancers. There are only a few Cirque type acts, and watching the aerial girls get tired after so much of the same.

There was not one single time I was holding my breath afraid a performer would fall and die.

There are speakers in the seat headrests that are way too loud and didn't sound good.

The stage is very small, so get a seat further in the back to see everything, but there ARE bad seats. We were all the way in the back in seat 1 and 2. You can't see when they come out. You gotta crane your neck.

I like Beatles music but I don't LOVE it. I guess you really gotta be a huge Beatles fan to love this show. Overall I felt it moved too slowly, and the acts didn't really connect to one another.

seats are tight meaning not very much leg room. but really for this show anywhere you sit you'll be able to see everything. the music is loud enough for you to hear what's going on. no pictures can be taken. they take that seriously as well.

Kudos to the mechanical engineers and backstage\/understage peeps making it all happen seamlessly.  While it's fun and energetic, I felt a bit overwhelmed at times.

My favorite bits were the quiet ones where there was a focus on performers and acrobatics (what Cirque is known for)... and didn't lovelovelove everything else.  I wish there was more clowning, too.

The show seemed short and I wanted more acrobatics.  The show had some serious undertones as well (love in general does have serious moments, I suppose), which weren't ""fun"" to watch but still lovely.

The music is amazing!  I love the Beatles and love how they've made the music extra special.  Tip - get the CD with cash from one of the many standalone vendors outside the store rather than fighting the crowds after the show.

Worth a watch, but I wouldn't see it again.  There is no set story like Ka, and the lack of acrobatic feats was disappointing.  Come for the music, especially if you're a fan of the Beatles.",2,0,0

The bar provides some nice quality drinks ( at a reasonable price - $12 and $13 ) and they only help to enhance your experience.
I got an excellent seat ( I think) near the stage and one of the runways used by the performers to enter and exit the stage. 
Thinking about this whole show - it was like watching the Beatle movies coming to life right in front of you. 
Being a big fan of beatles music, it was enjoyable to see the interpretations of the music played out in front of you.
The ""high wire"" rope work throughout the show was amazing and the coordination between the four roller blade specialists was the highlight of the show. 
This performance is much different from Mystere, Ka or ""O"". 
If you enjoy acrobatic acts you will enjoy the performance at O or Mystere. Ka is amazing theater production - 
but if you enjoy interpretive dance, you will really enjoy this program.
I would rank this show 4th. behind O, Ka, and  Mystere. 
That being said - all the Cirque du Soleil shows are such high quality productions, with so much going on all different parts of the stage, you will see something different each time you come back and view the show.
 I must admit, I really enjoyed this show knowing  I watched it for much less than most of the people siting in my section.

UNLESS YOU LOVE watching people in Austin powers and KKK costumes dancing around, (seriously what was the point of having white supremacists spin Barney-style alongside 'good,' happy people? Or having the unwed 'pregnant' African American woman & her 'baby daddy' mostly walking around in the show?) 

IF YOU ADORE seeing people driving around cars that go .5 mph, and wig-wearing women bouncing up and down on bungee cords for hours (some of them-- specifically The glowy things from Octopus's Garden-- utilized NO SKILL whatsoever. They literally looked DEAD)

IF YOU Have a NEED to BURN your hard earned money and your precious time, then THIS is YOUR SHOW.

Beatles Love has NO storyline, or feeling WHATSOEVER. It's ALL over the place. Parts of it actually made me feel uncomfortable and NOT in a good way. NOT the best cirque we've seen, and we've seen O, Ka, Mystere (3x), Zarkana, La Nouba (in FL), and MJ One so far.

If you want to see a show with chart topping music, go watch MJ One instead. Awesome story, feeling, stunts, diversity, and LOVE over THERE.

The colors were fun and vibrant. I felt that most of the acts captured the songs well.

There is a concession stand where you could buy drinks and popcorn, but be sure to come a little earlier because the lines do get long! If you're not in your seats by show time you'll have to wait like 5 minutes into the show to sit down. If you have your mlife player's card, I believe you get a little discount on your purchase.

I was skeptical of Cirque shows in general. It just seemed too flashy for me. I am not into the bare-skinned maneuvering rope jumpers like I had seen from other Cirque show previews. Needless to say, I was expecting some amazing music with so-so dancing. 

BOY, was I wrong. This show can be summed up in 3 categories- Visual, Musical, Atmospherically\/Storyline

Visual- Visually stunning comes to mind. The way the set were produced was just unbelievable, and it just goes to show how the songs are all great stories. Each set was painstakingly put together to add to the story. My best example would be the main sequence involving the bombing of England and the subsequent revival comes to mind. Also, the acrobatics are breathtaking. It is as advertised, amazing and over the top.....But in the good way!

Musical- Come on, its the Beatles. If you are even a general fan, the way they re-scored the songs will please your eardrums. As a life-long Beatles fan, they did not take advantage of their original scores, and certainly very few if any liberties were taken. Also, just adding everything together makes the music that much more enjoyable

Atmospherically\/Storyline- The atmosphere the story provided really was surprising. I didn't think they could pull it off, especially the way they were going with it. I like how the producers decided on multiple tie-ins and stories, in which you can go many directions as you follow along. The story is great and adds to the music you hear.

Honestly, I do not know how long the show will last. I mean, its been there for years. That is a testament to how good the show is, rather than dying off it rides on strong. See it before its gone. I hope I get a chance to get back and see it one more time. Its that good.",0,0,1

This show really lives up to the expectations, and we walked out with smiles on our faces. BTW: we went to the 7:30pm showing; when it was over, we felt like a herd of cattle being ushered out. We noticed an extremely long line-up for the 9:30pm showing on our way out (not to mention it being a lot busier than when we first got there), so we were glad we made it to the earlier showing. 

Oh, photography is strictly prohibited; probably because they have their own photographers walking around taking pictures (to sell after, of course) of you. There's a really cool backdrop after the box office as well, when you're about to head into the auditorium, where you can take pics. They have a photographer out there as well; when we asked her to take a picture with our camera (in addition to the one she take of us to sell) she declined and said she wasn't allowed. 
No big deal for us (we just had the people behind us take our picture), but I don't understand why this isn't a big deal at somewhere like Disneyland.

I'm a huge Beatles fan, but I went with people who were not big Beatles fans, and they absolutely loved it too. It was the highlight of our vacation. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: I do not recommend buying the more expensive tickets for seats up front. Instead, I suggest buying the cheaper seats further back in the main section (not the corner sections). I think we sat in the last row of section 200, and we had an excellent view of everything. I think the seats regularly cost $99, but we got them at a discount and paid $80-something each. 

The cool thing about Cirque du Soleil is that the action is happening above you and the stage, not just in front of you as is typical with most theaters. If you sit right in front of the stage, you will be straining your neck looking behind and above you to see a lot of the action. If you sit further back, you will have a better view of the entire show. Without spoiling it for you, you will actually ""miss"" one cool part of the show if you sit too close to the front. 

Overall, I HIGHLY recommend going to Beatles LOVE. It is a truly amazing show and something that you will remember for the rest of your life.",5,0,0

This show is definitely a visual and auditory treat -- so much to look at and the music is sensational.  If you are a Beatles fan, you will ""LOVE"" it.  Even if you are not, it's quite the spectacle. 

I don't want to take away from anyone's first time experience by offering any spoilers -- however, it is pretty much like most of the other cirque shows: music, acrobatics, awkward comic reliefs, conceptual themes, and creative costumes & makeup.  

One of the biggest questions I had when I was looking to book this show was where I should sit.  Is it really worth spending $198.00 per person?  Honestly.  No.  Not because it's not a great show, but I don't consider those seats the best ones in the house.

First of all, it's a circle theater, which means, unless you get a seat with ""limited"" or ""obstructed"" view, you can see most, if not everything, that's happening on stage.  However, the best seats are not the ones closest to the stage, nor is it the most expensive ones.  My favorite place to sit is in the upper half of any of the 200s sections (200, 201, 202, 203, etc.)  The lower half of the 200s are expensive -- however once you start looking at rows N, O, P, S, etc, the prices are no longer the 198, but $143: these are the best seats in the house.

Without revealing too much, there's a part of the show in which a show prop is extended into the audience.  If you sit too close to the stage, you will miss my favorite part of the show.

As always, this is MY suggestion and experience.  Of course if you are closer to the performers, you can see the costumes a lot better, but honestly 198 is a lot of money to just look at costumes.

Maybe I'm biased because I am a Beatles fan, but I never leave this show disappointed and always manage to get the song ""Hey Jude"" stuck in my head for the rest of the night.",15,2,2

My friend's husband surprised her a few days before we left with tickets to LOVE since she is a huge Beatles fan, and figured that the rest of us would enjoy it, especially since it was free for us. We were very excited when we picked up the tickets at Will Call that we were in the fifth row!

I would recommend picking up your tickets during the day instead of right before the show to avoid the lines. Additionally get in line at least 30 minutes before the show starts so once they start letting people in, you can get a drink (they have some ""themed"" mix drinks for $17) and find your seat before the show begins.

The highlight of the show is definitely the music, and they incorporate all of the Beatles greatest hits. The costumes, staging, creativity, and choreography are all first-class as you would expect at a Cirque show; however, the reason people go to Cirque shows - the acrobatics - left something to be desired. Sure some of the stunts were truly breathtaking, but there was not enough acrobatics, and what there was got to be repetitive at times. I have seen better acrobatics in the traveling Cirque shows. However the atmosphere and use of music in LOVE is what separates this show from other traditional shows.

Nevertheless, the three of us had a great time at the 90 minute show. For Beatles fans, this is a great show to see; for those wanting a bit more pure ""Cirque"" I would probably steer them toward another show.",2,0,1

What I liked about this Cirque du Soleil show more than others is that it's a tribute to the Beatles. People can relate to the Beatles, so it was a delight when certain songs came on and I'd hear people around me singing, humming, or clapping along. It's very interactive in that sense. The performances and effects were mesmorizing. I had a soft spot for the lonely clown, who also came out to entertain us before the show started.

Granted, the Beatles were before ""my time"", but I have always been a fan of their music, and the visual world that they created through their music.  ""LOVE"" brings that vision to life.

There's so many things to cover about LOVE: The music, the theatrics, the representations of the songs,the realizations of characters from the songs, the side ""cameos"" from the Beatles... it gives the viewer the feeling that they are taking part in a live musical concert where the Beatles are still doing their thing in the present time.  The suspension of disbelief isn't difficult: The sound system is incredible.  Music flows around the theater, from within the audience seats, and there is always something going on at every angle.

Seeing the show multiple times isn't boring at all as I still catch things that I hadn't seen from previous performances.

Everything is meticulously set up in the theater.  Even the lobby outside is just wonderful to walk around in and behold all of the detail and care put into everything.  My recent favorite is the addition of a Blue Meanie in the gift shop.  I've had to curtail my fantasies of somehow kidnapping it and putting it into my home, but visiting it is almost as good (almost).

Even the beverages in the lobby, while somewhat pricey, are big, and will definitely put you in a great mindset to enjoy the show.

LOVE was THE show that I had to see when I heard of its opening,  and still remains one of my favorite Cirque shows.  Even though Cirque has begun to shy away from its whimsical storytelling of old to focus on musical legends these days, this is one that I don't mind seeing again whenever the opportunity presents itself.

We had sat in the back row.. yet felt we were sitting in the middle as the stage was so close. 

Opening scene... I was wondering how the heck will I see half of the show with the curtains blocking... and was getting really annoyed 1 minute into the show. Next thing I knew, BOOM! The curtains dropped and it was a loud applause. It's like the Cirque Gods were listening to me! Definitely felt the audience jamming in their seats throughout the night, from start to finish.

I am so glad we were in the last row. We were able to view the audience participation acts that sadly the first few rows to middle rows could not see. 

Would I see it again? Of course! But make sure to go into this show not expecting a typical Cirque show with the same flips and jumps.",1,1,1

I'd like to see it again and again and again and again.

I didn't want it to end.

We were probably the furthest seats possible, and I wasn't too disappointed.  We were able to see the stage in its entirety, which is something the front rows probably didn't get to experience.

Loved it.

Lots of cool acts and entertainment.

I believe this is one of the more expensive Cirque du Soliel shows due to it's popularity but I was able to get 2 balcony seats for about $110 each.

My seat was section209 P10. After much research, I've found that you don't necessarily want to sit in the front most row. There are some things that happen during the show, and my seat was almost perfect to get both views at a point where you will only get one point of view. Actually, I would even recommend one row lower, the O row, or one even lower than that in either section 209 or 200. There is a grayed out box in section 209 - don't worry about that. It's a soundbox or something and it will not obstruct your view at all. If the show faces any side at all, I would say its the 209 or 200 section. I got a 25% off online offer and got these tickets at $125. 

The set designs were seriously impressive. I am amazed at how they creatively figured out ways to make a huge visual impact. There were moments where I blurted out ""wow"" because it was just that cool. 

The show isn't so much about acrobatics like the other Cirque shows. It's more about dancing, the mood, and the creative production pieces. If you appreciate production design, you will enjoy this show. 

Don't worry if you aren't a huge Beatles fan - I like them, but not religiously. It was still very enjoyable.

The only reason this show is getting so highly reviewed is because people giving it either a three or up review are biased about the Beatles or this is their first Cirque show.

I consider myself a Cirque connoisseur, having seen many of their shows.  Most of their shows have amazing production value, sets, and spectacular movement throughout the show.  There is always something to look at, and everyone on stage has a purpose.  The acts are unique to every show, as well as the storyline throughout.  Having said that, this show embodies none of the Cirque charm.  The opening minutes promise an amazing journey of dance and acrobatics, but after that severely lets down its audience.  They quickly abandon an interesting story line for boring choreography and repetitive acts.  Compared to the sets of ""O"" or ""La Nouba"", the stage might as well be bare.  There are only two acts that are memorable; the opening number and the Russian swing\/roller blade number.  Other than that, you aren't missing anything.

I think what I liked was that it was much more like a play than like a circus of acrobats... and, they have some really unique things that I'v never seen in other shows.

More dancing and frolicking around and less acrobatics, amazing stunts\/tricks, and somewhat lacks the ""Ooohs! Ahhhs! That was insane.""

I get this was more of a tribute to the Beatles so if you're a fan, you will definitely enjoy. It kind of reminded me more of a musical. It's not that I don't enjoy the Beatles' tunes, but I just wasn't too into the show for some reason. However, most of the people seemed to enjoy it so maybe I'm the oddball. Don't let it discourage you, bring a hot date, she should still be grateful regardless.

The show was only about 1.5 long with no intermission. I had pretty high seats and they still went for about $115 a piece.

I personally think this could have been the best seats in the house. The portray  of the Beatles era was spot on. The dancers were very talented. My favorite set had to be to the song Strawberry Fields Forever. The entire room went red and they had an array of various performers blowing all different types of bubbles. it was visually arousing.

My Fiance and I are both fans of The Beatles, and she has always wanted to see a Cirque show, so we felt good about our choice. This show is located inside The Mirage on the Vegas Strip so it was easy to find. 

Overall, the show was really entertaining and the actors\/acrobats were all very talented. There isn't a ton of narrative or story to drive the show (which I feel was it's main weak point), but the story is broken into a few main 'scenes'. However, the visuals and music were exactly what you would expect going into a Beatles themed show like this. Just about all the hits were covered as well as a few deeper tracks. The visual style of the show drastically changes from song to song. When we started getting more into the trippy, psychedelic Beatles songs, the show followed suit and it was awesome! The scene with the bed and sheet (you'd know it if you saw it) was especially amazing - even though it caused a hiccup that had to be dealt with before moving on. There were moments when there was so much going on that it was impossible to keep track of everything. Stimulation overload...

All things considered, I really enjoyed the show. I felt the ticket price might have been a tad bit high, but otherwise my complaints were minimal. The seating was pretty comfortable and made a full 360 circle around the stage so there aren't many 'bad' seats.

Don't get me wrong, I like their songs (at least the popular ones I know from watching Glee, haha) but since the theme of this show seemed to be their journey as a band, it was difficult for me to understand.

I don't know much history about the Beatles, so I didn't really know what was going on during the little numbers that were performed throughout the show, but it apparently is supposed to reflect on their journey together as a band, all of which was completely foreign to me.  I think I was expecting more of a general storyline like the Ka performance I saw earlier in the weekend, rather than individual skits to songs that didn't seem to connect cohesively together as a story.

The numbers were mostly dancing numbers with minimal aerial tricks.  I wasn't wowed by the performance as I was at Ka Cirque du Soleil performance.

The cool thing about this show was the stage.  Chairs completely surrounded 360 degrees of the stage in a tiered fashion so that every seat was a good seat.  Me and my BF were able to acquire seats that were closer (aka lower) to the stage, yet not too close (low) where you have to look up to see the performance.

Bottom line: Probably something you'd want to see as a Beatles' fan, but if you're looking to see more aerial tricks, I'd suggest seeing something else.",7,2,5

The different settings was pretty cool. I particularly liked the scenes or silhouettes projected on curtains. Cute characters too. I also have to give this place like other shows higher than a 4-star rating for the stunts and physique of the acrobats.

I thought this show would be a must-see for any Beatles fan, and a Beatles fan only, because who else would be willing to spend so much on a ticket? I finally took my mother last weekend, and I realized I was wrong. I am a die-hard fan of the Fab Four, but surely anyone would appreciate this show. It was amazing. It was my first Cirque du Soleil Experience ever, and I picked the perfect one. It was just spectacular- I don't think I can even come up with the words to describe this show to you- and I don't really want to. I think the best thing you can do in order to be able to know what I'm talking about- book your tickets as soon as possible. It's the best money you'll ever spend.  While I was aware that there was a lot of circus related acts in the show, I was surprised how much else I saw- ballet, art, Step dance, Hip Hop, gymnastics, beautiful lights and special effects, and SO much more, following an amazing story. You won't be disappointed. 

I have to say that watching ALL of my favorite songs come to life in this theater was a really comfortable experience, as well. The theater's seating is designed to so all audience members can enjoy the performances...and after all, there were acrobats dangling from the ceiling and floating past me as ""Strawberry Fields"" was amplified throughout the auditorium, which is always hard to miss. But, just saying, as a woman who of only 4'9"", it was pretty awesome to be sitting in a theater where I wasn't peering over the tall man in the seat in front of me. Everything that was happening on the floor below me (which was a lot, too!) was just as visible as everything that was happening above. It felt like my mother and were constantly pointing out new things to each other, whispering in each others ears, saying ""Oh my gosh, loo over there!"" ""Wow, what's that happening?"" And both of us sang, too. 

It was mesmerizing, a hands-down must-see. I really felt like all the boys were in the room celebrating with us at certain points...(though I'll be nice and spare you the details of why this was so...) It was so captivating that halfway through the show, I realized I hadn't even drank very much of my ""Can't buy me love"" cranberry vodka drink....I was so distracted with all the special effects. (They also sell a ""Hard Day's Night and another drink named after a song....) 

Beatles fans, young and old, will appreciate this amazing show, while other non-fans find will find themselves discovering a side of them they didn't know existed. If there's any show that I can ever recommend, it's this one. You will NOT be disappointed. 

At the end of the performance, we all stood and clapped. As we all made our way out of the theater, I saw a sea of people, and nearly every one of them held two fingers up for peace, as we all marched out with smiles plastered upon our faces. I think that was exactly the point of the show...peace and love, folks. PEACE and LOVE.

LOVE is a really entertaining show. Although it lacks a lot of the physical feats that Cirque shows have come to be known for, it more than makes up for it through innovative stage concepts. The stage, lighting, choreography and attention to detail make this one of the best live performances I've ever seen. It contains beautiful segments that feature animation, dance, and really crazy costumes. On more than one occasion, I actually said, ""no way"" out loud. I never, ever do that unless some cataclysm has occurred or they mess up my order at Chipotle.

If you wanna see superhero-style strongmen hold one another up on their abs or something, go for Absinthe or one of the other Cirque shows. Like KA, the stage is just as much of a performer here (which is cool for me but it might not be your thing).

While the very beginning of the show had a Terry Gilliam working class aspect to it, reminiscent of a Liverpool ambiance, the rest of the production was pure Las Vegas schmaltz, catering to adolescents, grandmas, and people whose concept of art is an AC-DC T Shirt.  Shame on you!

I expected the creativity of a film like Brazil.  Instead, I saw a production that would fit in well at Disneyland, with amateurish effects and lousy dancing.

On the other hand, if you are neutral or casual Beatles fan- Go for it! 
I've seen all the Vegas Cirque shows. This isn't my favorite, but it's defiantly the most pure FUN!
The Beatles were my parents generation, so I didn't live during ""Beatlemania"", but to the best of my understanding this show does a great job capturing the fun, silliness, and psychedelic touches of the Beatles world. 
Song choices are always debated in shows like this (ie. Viva Elvis & Michael Jackson: Immortal). Some people expect a ""Best of"" or get upset because their personal favorite was left out. The show can't do them all! Sgt. Pepper's gets a little extra attention, but the soundtrack samples a little from early to late. 
My pet peeve in these reviews crops up here once again: people that complain about the lack of plot. There isn't supposed to be one! Stop looking for 1st, 2nd, 3rd Act and character development. It's not a movie or theater show. Don't expect a plot. It's not there. It's not supposed to be, you'll enjoy it a lot more if you don't search for one.

The Good: Seating! Almost everything is great! Upper level has a different view and gets to see a little that the lower level doesn't and vice-versa. Nothing is all that far from the in-the-round style.
The Bad: If your a Beatles fan, it gets difficult to not sing along. Do make the effort. Rhythmic clapping and tapping is acceptable.

For the Beatles lovers out there, you will like seeing the way Cirque reinvents some of the songs and how they work the music into their acts, and how complimentary their costumes are with everything.

I've seen all the cirque shows in vegas and was quite impressed with this performance. not only was i delighted with the MO, but really enjoyed the storyline presented in this show which is somewhat different than their other shows.

I also cannot RAVE enough about the props used in this show and variety of stunts =D

i will admit, i am not a beatles music fan, but i really grooved down to this show.

I don't think you need to be a diehard Beatles fan to enjoy it, as I am not, and I definitely enjoyed all 90 minutes. I'd say LOVE was more dance centric than acrobatic, but there was still plenty of the latter.

I suppose it would be inconsiderate to spoil anything, but I do want to parrot what another reviewer mentioned and say try to sit toward the back. I had aisle seats in the very last row on the lower level (which is still very close as it's a small theater, and the balcony does not cover you). Only about 5 rows from the back and the balcony get to see something which was really, really cool.

Zarkana, and many of their traveling shows like OVO, emphasize the Cirque's more traditional circus performances, but have been dressed up in Cirque du Soleil style with ostentatious costumes and extravagant set designs. Your focus while watching these shows is often on the act on stage -- whether its a high-wire act or two acrobats on a spinning wheel -- and less so about what is happening around them.

LOVE pulls you in from every angle imaginable, and more than just literally. 

The seating is set up like a Maltese cross, where everyone gets a different view and angle of what's happening on the stage. But you're also surrounded by giant digital screens that display video wallpaper that complements each performance, hanging semi-transparent fabric screens that drop down every so often when projected silhouettes of the Beatles are needed to put an era of Beatlemania into context, and sound effects and live music that emanate from the theatre and your seat's headrest, which creates a fully immersive, panoramic experience.

What's more, the performances on stage that meld dance and acrobatics to the musical legacy of the Beatles often feature multiple performers on stage at the same time. This creates a somewhat frenetic and disorienting effect at first, as your eyes and brain try to reconcile how all the elements you are seeing fit together, and you wonder where to focus your attention -- like trying to focus on a single popcorn kernel in a large pot, with all of the other kernels popping over each other at the same time. 

But if you allow yourself to let go, and stop thinking, and enjoy the ride, your rewarded with a very magical mystery tour that starts resonating with you emotionally, and this is what really makes this show so memorable.

LOVE's music, performances, and its aural and visual aesthetics simply move you throughout, from song to song, as its loose story takes you through the sad and sorrowful WWII blitz bombing of England with ""Because"", some exhilarating high-energy roller skating stunts paired with ""Help"", the whimsical and mercurial teeter-totter and trapeze act performed to the equally whimsical and mercurial ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", and the ever-so-poignant ""Hey Jude"" that follows the heart-breaking story told on stage in ""A Day in the Life"".

As far as being a Beatles tribute, I think you can safely say it is a good tribute and throughout, is a tribute to the visual aspects of the Beatles - the colors, images, cartoons, etc we associate with the band. They are not trying to tell the story of the Beatles, just A story of their music.

In fact everybody in my group hated it.  It was a loud annoying acid trip.  I struggled between falling asleep of boredom and being blasted awake by annoying jumping-and-twitching dance interpretations of Beatles music re-cut and re-mastered in a manner that would make Lennon and Harrison roll over in their graves (they certainly couldn't sleep through it).

Next, it's Cirque du Soleil...a circus for goodness sake!  Where are the circus acrobatics? No story, no acrobatics to speak of, and no semblance of order whatsoever.  Most of the time there were so many people on stage that there was NO focal point what-so-ever.

I wouldn't recommend it at all.  I'm sorry.  I wish I could.  It's very expensive and we left feeling ripped off.  I don't know why people would rate this show so highly, honestly.  Go see O, or Mystere, or Zumanity, they're all great.  I wish I had my time and money back.",3,0,1

With all of the Cirq shows there comes a point where there's so much going on that even with the max dose of A.D.D. medication, you still feel like you missed a few things. BUT this show is worth the concentration, that is if you like the music of the Beatles. 

Lets discuss the stage.. WOW! The intricacies of this stage could very well be even more impressive than the performers (almost). 

I don't recommend a front row seat to this show, or any Cirq show for that matter, it's just too close and you'll miss all of the grandness happening on a larger wider scale. Midway up and pretty much anywhere in the showroom would work, the further up you sit, the more you see. 

OK people, it's just not possible to describe in detail my entire experience that evening at The Beatles LOVE show, but I will leave you with this. 

IF you are a fan of Beatles music you MUST see this show! It will leave your feet tapping and I guarantee you will have to fight the urge to want to sing along..or punch the person sitting next to you for singing along (poorly).

I'll tell you what its the best show i've seen on the strip! Well the fact is that I haven't seen KA, O, Blue Man Group or any other Cirque du Soleil shows in Sin City. This show will mesmerize the mind in some way and it as a fun kick to it.

When you first walk inside before ticketing, WOW the lobby corridor is GrooOOVE!!! Psychedelic! its like being in Austin Powers British world, Yeah Baby! now strike a pose and take pics! Make sure you get some of that Strawberry Fields drink at the bar before seating and keep your souvenir cup (I left mine behind the first time).

We all sat a few rows down from the top on one of those 200 sections, it was easy to see, no matter how far you are because the stage is round.

Early part of the show your gonna hear the beats thumpin' rolling into the track ""get back"" it got me bobbin my head. At the start, the music is slow, and soothing and so forth. The performances are great! the Choreography is Cirque Du Soleil splendid! they all flow accordingly of some of the Beatles greatest hits.

Before all of this, I had little knowledge of Beatle Music and knowing that its my parents teenage years of their generation, was the craze!  I remember seeing some those old Beatles records my dad kept at his childhood home but it must be golden.

I recommend seeing this show, it got me to be a believer that's why I've been wanting to take my woman this time around and that's why I played the Beatles Love CD soundtrack (provided from my company swagbag) like non-stop on our road trip back home from conference and again I played the music soundtrack non-stop on a road trip to Arizona. The music is catchy and it would make you appreciate Beatles Music more after watching this show. It even got me playing Rock Band Beatles on my XBOX 360! for crying out loud!

Is a bit creepy remembering the character in the show who was convicted of murder for dismembering and encasing in cement the body of his girlfriend in real life. I remember the guy from the show, and was stunned when I watched the news and saw his mug shot.

Like some other reviewers, I am not a Beatles fan. I can hum a tune, but I can't name every song off the White album. For the duration of LOVE, however, I was the biggest Beatles fan in the world.

The one part of the show loved, is when the song, Something (Something in the way she moves) was played. The song was interpreted through acrobatics and romance.

Lucked into some amazing second-row seats via a generous Yelper (thanks Janel!) and spent the evening swiveling my head back and forth and up and everywhere trying to take in all of the action. At times there are up to 30 performers on stage or in the air with no central focus point, as such it seems like it would translate to one of the few shows worth seeing more than once, as you could easily see things you missed before.

Favorite parts:
""Strawberry Fields Forever"" with bubbles
""Here Comes The Sun"" with candles
""Octopus's Garden"" with lights
""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" almost a literal interpretation

i got my tickets on groupon , or one of those coupon things, i have a bunch of them, show was only $80 including the service fees and tax! 

i would give it a 5 star, however these older ladies in front of us decide to CUT us and then we called them out politely, however they decided to exchange really really really rude words, i am glad i was not drunk enough to put these ladies in place.

Love is spectacular. Not only because it's a cirque show, but because the vibe it gives you. You leave the show happy, thinking you can actually change the world (of course this spell goes away as soon as you hit the tables and get a couple scotchs on the rocks).

The theater is very nice. Everyone that works is dressed up to match with the show. Everyone is wearing some kind of old school british outfit. One thing I don't understand is why people rush through the doors. The place is seat assigned and it doesn't matter if you get there 20 minutes early or right on time. Seriously it reminds me of the lion king scene where mufasa dies. Weird how people still do this nowayds isn't it?

When the show starts you inmediatly get summerged in the whole experience. As usual when you go to a ciruqe show, keep your eyes wide open and look all around you as things are happeing all over the place. But the main story is in the center of course. This accompanied with the best beatles songs gives the show a feeling. First its sad, then funny, then love(no pun intended), then war, thenhate, etc I mean

honestly you are in a trip through England since the beginning of the last century. The music makes it extra special.

Tickets are not cheap, but you can sometimes find some good deals online. But even if you pay full priceit totally worth it. The cirque experience is a magnificent one and if you are a beatles fan this is definetly the show for you. Ive seen the show plenty of times and can tell you that it made me feel good every single one of them.

We ended up getting free tickets through Southwest and nothing beats free. 

Side note: It was kinda funny that half of our family got tickets the same way and were only in Vegas for our wedding, yet they ended up in the front section. We were in the last row of the whole stinking auditorium. We're still not quite sure how that happened, but they were still amazing seats and we didn't have any problems hearing or seeing anything.

I've had the soundtrack since the show debuted, and just finally was able to go to the show this past weekend.

The show was amazing and I want to take my entire family. I'm sure plenty of people before me have reviewed the content and the technical aspects, so let me throw around some tips about the actual experience of seeing this show in particular and what stood out to me.

1) There really is no bad seat (unless you get one of the cheap-o seats that SAY ""restricted viewing"" when you book.) The theater is smaller than I had anticipated, and although I was in the highest section, still had a fantastic view.

2) The lobby is really fun and unique and there are a lot of cool drinks to buy (just be prepared to spend around $20 on a large drink in a souvenir cup). Having said that - there is NO BATHROOM in the lobby. So if you're like me, and you decide to guzzle down your entire large drink in the show, and then race out when it's over because you need to pee, be prepared to navigate all the way out the lobby, past the gift shop, and around the corner from the box office!

3) It's not what I had in my head of a typical Cirque show (although I haven't seen any others.) The acrobatics were fun but mostly not jaw-dropping. There was a lot of dancing and some fun running around. Don't expect to be mesmerized by crazy body-bending and mind blowing feats. That's not what this is about; it's about the music and telling the stories of the Beatles' history and music. That's not a negative thing - it's just a note about the content and style of the show.

4) Try to get into the lobby a bit early so you can take pictures with all the fun decor before it gets too crowded. Grab your drink and take a selfie - you sure won't be able to after the performance when it's packed!",4,0,3

Love is much more intimate than O and Iris. Although there might not be as many acrobatic tricks the show has its own uniqueness with the special effects that pay tribute to the Beatles.

If you are a fan of the Beatles, then this show is a no brainer. It's a must.

In our group we have a couple who only knew of one or two songs prior to attending LOVE, and not particularly fans of the Four. They enjoyed the show, but not to the same degree as those who has listened to multiple albums (i.e. Me). 

The show is definitely more eye-candy than acrobatics than other Cirque shows. As one girl put it, ""This is probably the closest I'll get to tripping on acid"". During many moments, there is an explosion of action on the stage and in the air. Color lights the walls, splashes all over the floor, performers don every color of the rainbow. The music is exactly what you expect, great songs from the Beatles. 

Much thanks to a previous review, I highly recommend buying tickets on the top balcony on the front row. You get to see the whole picture, especially during ""That"" scene. I didn't give this 5 stars is because it doesn't cater to everyone, my girl said she would rather see KA again than LOVE.

Instead, Love takes an interpretive approach to story telling, acting out the inspiration or personifying the stories told in the amazing catalog of music that the show highlights. The music is also played chronologically which I thought was the coolest part as you can easily see the evolution of The Beatles as artists and people. 
The sets are beautifully designed, with themes ranging from Mod to Indian. The stage is pretty cool- constantly changing shapes and revealing new things.

I recently watched a documentary on the making of ""Love"" and they said it was not typical of the cirque formula, but instead was more like a musical. I wholeheartedly agree with that statement. I thought it was AMAZING, but very different from other cirques I've seen.

The music really set it apart, and the creators set out to make the performance enhance the music. There are so many things going on at the same time throughout the performance sometimes it's hard to know where to look! I like how they varied the pace throughout the show, using fast or slow songs, and I also loved the variety of performances. You had acrobats, gymnasts, a section where performers were rollerblading on a ramp...the whole thing felt like sensory overload by the time we left!

I am dying to see this again - we bought the CD when we left, and the way they mixed the music was amazing. If you like Beatles paraphenalia, be sure to check out the Love store. I always find something cool to buy there!",0,0,0

Hubbie and I have seen all the Cirque show, but weren't interested in this, as I don't care for Beatles music. I know, I know, cut me some slack, lol. But I kept hearing that this show was the best Cirque show. So we finally went. 

And everyone was right. This was by far the BEST Cirque show there is. 

Just one word of caution. If you are LEAST bit sensitive to weird lights or prone to seizures don't go to a Cirque show.  I had to keep closing my eyes because of the blinking lights. I just know to do this, so it didn't diminish my experience much. 

I can't even begin to tell you how much in awe I was of the mechanicals of this show and the engineering it must have taken to get this show running. Kudos to the designers and engineers behind the scenes as the incredible performers often get the only acknowledgment. 

The ONLY negative I have is the cattle call to get in the theater. You would think there would be a better way of getting 2000 people into the theater than just everyone standing around, and then the theater opening and having people cut in line, or jump in front of those that have been respectfully standing in line.  But I think that's just rude people overall.",0,0,0

""Blackbird"" twirling gracefully around the stage, a very sexually charged hippie love fest to ""come together,"" clowns, cars, motorcycles, ""sargent pepper's lonely hearts club band"" marching about the stage, boisterous jumping and wall-climbing to ""Back in the USSR,"" A beautifully choreographed trapeze act to ""something in the way.""

As I have said before, I have seen all the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas, some multiple times, and most all of their road shows. All of them are well worth seeing. As with all their shows the music, sets, costumes, performers are outstanding and meld together a magical theme.

In this case the story is made of remastered Beatles recordings from the original tapes and those involved in those original sessions-or their wives. There is even a documentary out that actually follows this process of recreating the music and putting the show together that I found very enlightening. Keep an eye out for it on cable. 

Incredible job of merging the feel and actual music to the performances on stage. A complete experience that even includes the lobby.

Granted, I'm sure I didn't fully grasp *all* the symbolism myself, but it was definitely food for thought and a lot of fun to see how Cirque interpreted Beatles music. Now on to my review...

In Vegas to celebrate birthdays for a friend and me... wanted to see a show.. couldn't get tix to see Kevin James\/Ray Romano show with our friends... saw that Love was playing at the same place (Mirage). Bought tix through the half price ticket stand on the Strip. All I can say is....

WOW! What a spectacular show! This was my first time seeing any Cirque de Soleil show and I was so impressed with the athleticism, grace and talent of every performer. And of course, the music was excellent!

The symbolism behind the visuals brought to new dimensions (or gave me a better understanding of the dimensions that were always there) to the phenomenal music of the Beatles.

The production, performance and artistry was moving, engaging and kept my attention for the entire 90 minute performance. Some of the music includes studio out takes and rare mixes of Beatles songs. My toes were tapping the whole show through.

LOVE was absolutely amazing. I'm a big Beatles fan, but even if I hadn't had a prior personal connection to the music, I still would have been blown away. The show was visually stimulating -- there was always something to see and the fact that it was a theatre in the round made it interesting and exciting because you never knew where to look next.

Compared to other Cirque shows, there wasn't the typical strength displays and death defying acts, but the music made up for that.  This show made me so genuinely happy and I couldn't stop smiling the entire time.

I've never been in a theater-in-the-round before, so that was a pretty good experience. The theater itself wasn't that packed at all for a 9:30pm show, but it was a pretty dead week in Las Vegas.

As for the show itself, this show was the perfect amount of Beatles music, with acrobatics, with performances on the stage. The show goes through the history of the Beatles and plays all of their big songs, as well as some of the songs I've never really heard before. I had a friend who was disappointed a little, because he thought it was going to be a cover band like setup, but instead it was all just their original songs playing to them putting on a show (I enjoyed the fact that they didn't do a cover band).

This show is located at the Mirage Hotel Casino. Featured in the movie ""Vegas Vacation"" This is where the ""Love"" show is at and the ambience is casual and cool.

I recommend getting there at least 30mins. early. That means you have given the ushers your tickets and you are deciding on what drink to get. I recommend ""Here comes the sun"" a tequila sunrise in a commemorative Beatles Cup a bit pricey like $20 or around that. You get a nice size drink and ""what the hay"" have something to remember the show by in addition to all the very cool memories. Plus the show is over a hour long and you might get thirsty.

This show has amazing energy and so many fantastic trapeze artists and acrobatics going on that you are bound to be smiling from ear to ear or be in complete ""awe"" for sure. Of course you will hear the Beatles music being played the entire time,but it is not being done by impersonators. The music is playing and the performers are putting on short stories, acts if you will. Cirque du Soleil is so amazing in almost everything they do in this show. With top notch performers it never disappoints. 5 star show :) Yay!!

 I cant wait to see the show again :) Now,every time I hear a song by the Beatles, I can picture the show and what was being done during that song. *smile... Ahh good times. 

We have been to ""Zumanity"" which was OK. I wouldn't go again, it just was not my thing. ""Mystere"" just irritated me with the big guy dressed like a baby.

I had only seen one Cirque show before, which was Totem. Totem is a traveling show, which had already amazed me with its quality of performance. I was expecting around the same for this show, but it completely blew my expectations out of the water.

We chose The Beatles LOVE because it was in a reasonable price range and seemed the most entertaining. I had grown up listening to The Beatles (I grew up in Berkeley). My boyfriend wasn't as excited about it since he didn't but he enjoyed it a lot anyways.

Everything from the beginning to the end was just amazing. Even the opening scene had captured me. It was mind-blowingly beautiful. Everything about it was just pure art... The music, the dancing, the aerial tricks, the theater, the special effects. The funny thing is, when you hear the lyrics to some Beatles songs now such as ""I want to be in an octopus's garden in the shade"", you think in your head ""what were they thinking??..."". And from watching this show, you can almost understand what was going through their head as they were writing these songs.

I love the stylistic art in this show. It really captured the whole peace, love, and psychedelic movement of the Beatles. It has something for everyone. It is wholly entertaining on the outer surface, and yet there seems to be some deep meaning behind it. If you pay attention to the reoccurring themes and symbolism, there is a whole different story playing out aside from all the tricks and stunts that are going on.

My only regret is that we didn't get better seats. We were in section 304, and the best seats in the house are the 200s, not the 100s. There is so much stuff going on and they utilize the entire stage. The sound is outstanding since the speakers are built into the seats. I was really blown away by how much the special effects make a difference. The visuals and the sound were just amazing in creating the perfect psychedelic experience.

I would highly recommend this show to anyone, Beatles fan or not.",1,0,0

The show is lighter on jaw-dropping acrobatics than Cirque is famed for.  And it doesn't have much of a focus--most of the time there's so much happening on stage that it's not clear what to focus on.  In the end it probably doesn't matter--the show leans heavy on the charm of the music and the Beatles' chatter.

A friend of mine loved it because it allowed her to pretend she was at a Beatles concert.  I liked how they mixed all the songs and tidbits from various outtakes into one 90-minute flow. 

There are no bad seats, probably, but there are better seats than others.  My guess is the closer you are to the middle, or front-middle, the better.  If you're too close to the stage, you may be too close to get the effect of all the synchronization between the cast.  If you're too far, it's fine, but you may lose out on some detail.

After being stood up by Barry Manilow, Sis & I frantically searched for a last minute show we could see & Beatles LOVE came through 

I guess I've become a sort of Cirque snob b\/c I was expecting the usual grand feats of absurdly-wonderful acrobatics & death-defying stunts 

But alas, this was more of a dance performance to Beatles tunes 

Too many people all over the stage doing different things that have no rhyme or reason & it was impossible to follow what anyone was doing. There didn't appear to be a story \/ theme to be told & usually Cirques have an underlying story that unfolds throughout each performance 

Not here..... 

There was a good stint w\/ roller blades & another of lesser awe-factor w\/ trampolines but other than that - it was dance, dance, dance 

Dancers & costumes were super but the show was not what I expected (Sis really liked it.... I'm harder to please)

1) It's called ""Love"", but it had little to do with love.
2) There was too much modern dance and too little circus.
3) There were some disturbing themes and decades old poli-social issues covered.
4) Audience interaction was minimal.
5) Tickets were over-priced.

I liked it because I knew every song and was able to sing along. For my son who doesn't know the music, the show wasn't really a wow. 

If I were to do it over again, I'd go to the 1st showing of the evening when the theater is more full and buy tickets at a discount and not worry too much about getting the most expensive seats. I think the show would have been as nearly as enjoyable from the rear as it was from the front. Some shows are worth paying extra for premium seats. Not this one in my opinion. Would I recommend this show? Sure, but only if you're a Beatles fan.",0,0,0

cirque du soleil and muse in one weekend. 

i am almost convinced this will be better then my wedding day.

edit 10-30-07
unlike some of the other Cirque shows, this one is a little more dance oriented and not as traditional in terms of clowns. For example in O, and Allegria the clowns actually have scenes where they indeed are clowns. Here its approached more from a character perspective.
The aerial acts were stunning, the music was delivered awesomely, and there was a more clear story line than in most other Cirque shows.
I agree with Jenn T in that you have to be a Beatles fan at least a little to give a shit about this show, because so much of it is about the music and history of the Beatles, and not so much about insane acts.. although I'm sorry, the acts are still insane. i can't do 1\/16Th of what they do.

I first saw this show in previews and there were changes made in the first months following the opening to tailor the show to fix some of the negatively received bits.  I think they've done that very well.  The one part that I thought was hysterical was not received well by early audiences.  I guess you had to have a sick sense of humor.

The acrobatics and dance movements of the crew is amazing!  I love the car, the telephone booths, and so many moments that I can't name them all.

In all, I've seen the show three times, and I have been enthralled each time.  There isn't much interaction with the audience before hand.  It seemed like that reached its height with Mystère and ""O"" and has been slowly left out of newer Cirque productions.

Love contains great visuals and amazing music, but in reality it's a lot of dancing with a bit of acrobatics thrown in. Honestly though, I expected more. I walked out of the other Cirque shows thinking ""how they hell did they do that?"" This one I walked out thinking ""the music was really cool.""

Like all other Cirque shows, it would be better on shrooms. But if everyone showed up on shrooms, someone would probably get seriously injured every show . Think about it. Hundreds of people on shrooms in the same room as a Cirque set. I can't even fathom it. Horror film or comedy?

I have also seen many other productions such as Blue Man Group, Beauty and the Beast, Titanic, Grease, Sigfried and Roy, etc, etc, etc. 

This is absolutely the most phenomenal show that I have ever seen, bar NONE!

Don't listen to the knuckleheads below giving 4 stars because of the lack of acrobatics. Not only are there plenty of those in this show, THEY ARE UNIQUE. If you're like me, you don't like the fact that some other Cirque shows are basically nothing more than glorified circus acts. I like shows that show me something I haven't seen before and tell a story with awesome costumes and effects... if I want acrobatics, there are Shows Ad Nauseum enough for that already.

I was concerned about seeing this show before booking it since even though it was a Cirque show, it just seemed like kind of a campy idea... I mean the Beatles and Cirque... dumb. 
But, Wow! From the word Go! this production grabs your senses and just doesn't let up. 
Amazing- no where near enough.
Breathtaking- getting there for sure.
Awe-inspiring- okay, 
maybe... 
Emotionally... Erect, would be better. 

I was concerned about the seats, but I think we had the best ones in the house. Section 204 Row O seats 15 and 16 were awesome. You're just above the level of the parachute trick so you can see over it and enjoy the whole effect.
Others are right, though. This show takes place all around and above you, so there are no bad seats in the house. (Except maybe for the front rows... can't imagine looking up for an hour and a half, but even those are amazing because the act is right there... they could have touched them if they reached out. Also, the 2nd floor seats are cheaper than the 1st floor and they're just way better seats.

Don't worry about Sore Ass Syndrome at this production. This is one of the few shows where you are actually extremely disappointed when it's over. Usually, I am half way out the door by the time the first ovation ends, running to be the first one out. But I found myself cheering in amazement and not caring that I would have to be elbow to elbow with masses of human goo fighting to get out of the theater momentarily. It was that good. (It actually wasn't that bad getting out.)

Unfortunately for the guys, this is a  very family friendly show... you won't even accidentally see up an errant nighty hem on the sexy performers. Don't worry though, it's amazing enough even to entertain the most voyeuristic Las Vegan for a couple hours.

I have been to this show four times now since 2008, and each time I've been it has been just absolutely magical.  The idea of mashing up Beatles songs to some, may seem sacrilegious, but I for one found it to be absolutely GENIUS!

I've seen other peoples review of this show how the ""story is difficult to follow..."" it isn't.  It really isn't difficult.  If you know anything about the Beatles in the most simple explanations of their music and the time in which they were huge, then the show will make perfect sense to you.

Certain show pieces are directly correlated to the music that's playing, while others are just background pieces, but altogether, the show is one amazing sight to see!

Also, many have complained that none of their favorite songs are used.  That is just a very minor detail.  Remember folks, this is a Cirque du Soleil SHOW, not a Beatles concert of their Greatest Hits.  If you want to hear your favorite Beatles song, just go to Spotify\/Pandora and find it and quit complaining.

I love the performers that come out beforehand in the audience and interact with the teapot.  They're obviously enjoying their job and they really make a wonderful effort to interact with as many people as they can before the lights go out.

I've been fortunate enough to have in the four times I've gone to have seen the show from different perspectives.  One time, my fiancée and I got a '$99 Locals Special' for a designated seating area but it was actually closed off, so for FREE, we were allowed to go sit down in the lower two front rows by the stage!  It was a blast to be able to see everyone so close and also get to be underneath the giant sheet used in the show!

Then another time, for our anniversary we had seats in an upper seating zone that was somewhat uncomfortable and since the show wasn't a sold out performance we were asked by a cast member if we'd like to move to our own individual swivel chairs in another area which we were very happy about!  Plus we had that entire area all to ourselves! Nobody else was sitting below us or next to us!

The Beatles Love by Cirque du Soleil was the ONLY Cirque show I had seen until 2015 when my fiancée and I saw Le Reve for her birthday, but it's definitely a different type of experience.  All I can say is that when it comes to repeat viewings of shows in Las Vegas, I will ALWAYS pick The Beatles Love!

From what I've read recently, they have given the show a bit of an update and made it ""more psychedelic"" and some have said it's not a good upgrade.  Well, I feel like I may just have to make trip number five to judge for myself!

Best parts of the show for me (Small spoilers ahead!)

-The opening performance for 'Get Back\/Glass Onion' when those curtains drop after Ringo's drum solo from 'The End' that really gets you in the mood for something big about to happen!

-The dancing galoshes in the 'Lady Madonna' sequence

-The Abbey Road VW Beetle both intact, then in pieces during the 'A Day in the Life' sequence

-The 'Help!' rollerbladers

-The jumpers with trampolines during the 'Revolution' sequence

-The 'Beatles Shadows' bits that show on the curtains between sequences

-The finale

A tip I learned from other reviews and am going to emphasize: cheaper seats such as the 300s and late 200s are good because there is one section of the show where a good majority of the seats are covered by a white sheet. Everyone underneath can't see a thing, but there is still a show going on above the sheets. I just feel like if you're goign to be spending 80+ dollars to see a show, you'd like to see EVERYTHING.

Maybe I'm part of the 1%, but it was too loud. I could feel the bass line in my seat! That plus the movement of the lights and effects triggered my motion sickness.

The highlights for me were the trapeze artists, roller skaters and aerial silks. The venue itself is small and the view is 360 degrees. Meaning, there's no bad seat in the house.

Cirque du Soleil brings us the spirit of the wonderful Beatles in this must see amazing performance. 

A beatles fan here so I might be bias but we all who have seen this show can agree.. It's a magnificent show, simply happiness.
In the intro, the way the music starts is so moving that it makes you want to cry out of good emotions. Don't tell anybody but I kind of tear up a little during the show. I couldn't help it! That's how good it makes you feel. 

This show has all the right elements. One moment you're laughing, the next you're shedding a happy tear then before you know it you're moving your hands and feet to the rhymth of the music right in your seat.
My girl kissed me out of nowhere during the song ""something"" and it felt awesome! It made my night even better. Well, If you're not a Beatles fan by the end you'll be showing the Beatles Love. Just go see it!

We enjoyed every moment of it. Let's just say that it brings out your sensitive side with some of the songs you hear while they're being portray on stage. Don't know how else to describe it. You just gotta see it to know what I mean. Yeah it's that good",5,2,4

This show is an amazing tapestry of the great songbook of the Beatles mixed with the story of their lives all portrayed by the amazing acrobatics, grace and athleticism of the Cirque du Soleil team.

The staff goes all out dressed in their very own Sgt Pepper garb and a few of the cast members come out to entertain the audience while you wait.

A tip too if you're going: Try to get seats that are midlevel at the back. I don't want to spoil it but something happens during the show and when you're in these seats you get to see something most people won't.  It's just a magical experience and well worth the high ticket price. I left an even bigger Beatles fan then when I came and even got a little choked up during the last number.

1) Not exactly a Beatles fan?  Neither WAS I.  Now I am.

4) The music almost feels like it was made for this production!
5) Four words: flying bed on cloud.  Pure magic.  
6) You could see this show tens of times and always find something new to watch. 
7) This production is massive and lavish!  It is really hard to believe.

The whole theater has a ""Liverpool"" ambiance, with the ushers dressed up in costumes, and every seat is a ""good"" seat, you can't go wrong where you sit! My favorite acts were ""Something"", ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" and ""Come Together"".

The only downside, not really for me, but for others would be that there is not real story or plot line being followed, so when the show ends, you're left feeling kind of puzzled. But like I said, it's not a big deal if you are a fan of the music or The Beatles themselves.",1,0,0

I bought the ""cheap"" seats row FF and two tickets were $195.00. Our seats were great. There isn't a bad seat in the house. I recommend purchasing directly from Mirage it was more expensive through the other ticket agents like Ticketmaster. I bought them before the trip and picked up the same day as the show at the box office. 

The staff were very nice and did a wonderful job getting people ushered in and out quickly. 

Also, the line is very long to get into the show. We were told to get there 30 minutes before it started. There were already hundreds of people in line.

I'm not a Vegas show kinda guy but I was able to trade in some of my myvegas slots loyalty points for a comped premium tickets. 

I purchased our seats about two months before the show date. I wanted to sit as close as possible but TM wasn't selling any of the section 100 seats to the public at that time so we ""settled"" on section 200. We sat in section 209 Row N (Just behind the soundboard) which provided a great view. 

They say every seat here at the Mirage is good but I'm not sure the 300's are for me. 

Here's the section differences 

100 - You're basically flush with the floor and there are certain parts of the show you'll be involved with
200 - Elevated view of the stage so you can look down below the stage (35 feet away) to see some of the staging that takes place. 

300 - Balcony = Upper corners of the arena - As you enter the arena, you can walk down to the 200's or take the stairs to the 300 section. You're pretty removed from the stage. 

My recommendation is 200's for the budget friendly and 100 for VIP's. I was a bit surprised that the MGM Grand was offering up a tickets to Vegas shows but the Mirage was not. We ended up staying at Caesar's which was a quick 10 walk from the Mirage.  My maps app made it seem like the walk from Caesar's to the Mirage was far but it really was an easy walk. 

I did notice the groupon had $99 tickets for section 200\/300 seats the weeks leading up to the show for the same show date.  The section 100 seats were now available for $150 per ticket which was slightly above what I paid for my ticket. My guess that the section 100 seats are released to the public much later then the 200\/300 seats but again .. it's just a guess. 

Make sure you arrive about 45 minutes before showtime if you need to pick up before your show because the lines to pick up your tickets might be long. Our wait was 20 minutes and you'll want to stop and take a few photos to add to the experience. There's a concession stand their too just for the LOVE show.",9,0,0

What I enjoyed the most was that they did not sugar coat the Beatles. They really showed the message that the Beatles were all about in the 60s, fighting inequality, the war and hate. 

In one moment you felt like you were feeling the same pain as the Beatles in their pro-love messages and the next moment you felt like you were at a Beatles concert! I never would have thought that I'd be lucky enough to experience a Beatles concert (since I was born in 1985) and this Cirque performance transported me back in time.

It's different from other shows because the audience is seated all around the stage instead of only facing the stage in a half circle. Furthermore, it practically ensures that everyone gets a good view of the show. Because of the set up of the theater, I felt physically closer to the performers and as a result I felt more connected to the whole performance.

She was so empathetic to us and never did my mom feel like a burden but a guest to the show. Leland is the kind of person who any company wants in management! She found us tickets to the ground floor, didn't accept a tip, made us feel that it was her duty to help us! She alone was worth more stars than I could give!

Also, I'm familiar with some Beatles songs, but by no means am I an avid fan so I might not be as excited about this show as some other fans might be. 
I guess the reason why I like this show less than the others is because there are a lot less of the Circus elements which I really love. There was more dancing than acrobatics so it was overall less exciting for me. 
Some pros: The theater layout is great, and it is a little smaller than the others so it seems like you have a front row seat and you're right up in the action. Also, the show is well thought out and they did use a lot of the more well known Beatles songs so like me, if you're not a die hard fan, at least you can recognize some of the tunes.",2,0,0

For tickets, I would recommend getting the cheapest tickets. We did and I thought our view was very good. We were seated in the middle at the very top row. It's a circular stage so as long as you are in the middle you will be fine. If you are located near the walkways of the stage, you will be blocked by the curtain at times. There are also discounts available; we got a discount for ordering online through our corporate discount website. Don't forget to look for those discounts!

I have seen several of the shows on DVD like La Nouba, Verekai, Solstrom and Journey of Man.  That said, Beatles Love had several elements of the other shows but in very mild forms.  This show was more about fancy choreography and the music rather than inspiring feats of human agility.  

The stage is in the center of the theater and has several moving platforms which create several unique scenes.  There is a massive aerial operation but again, nothing spectacular, mainly just performers being dragged up and down hanging with little physical rope work.  

Obviously with the show being built around existing music, there is nothing to complain soundtrack wise.  Just wish there were more awe-inspiring feats.  It was mostly just eye-candy and ear-candy.  The music was loud, crisp and felt like I was at a concert.  

As for our seats, we were a few rows from the rear but any closer and you be straining your neck to look up, left, right, behind you, under you and you'd miss half the show.  

As for entertainment value, it was pretty good.  Anything that keeps me away from the tables for 90 minutes is great for my wallet.  The show had it's moments which kept my attention.

Entertaining and touching and gorgeously directed, it's the kind of show that you'll appreciate regardless of your level of Beatle-ness or love of their music.  What I think this show does best is highlight just how iconic the Beatles truly are, and how enduring their music is and will continue to be.  I was wary of the ""re-mastered like you've never heard them before"" tagline of the show, but the sound was one of the most impressive parts of ""Love"".  The music of the Beatles comes out crisp and clear in full technicolor and from every angle.... it was sincerely awesome.  

Funny, too, how a song you've heard a hundred times before can suddenly resonate a little bit deeper when heard in a new, fresh context.

There are two extremes of circus\/acrobat-like shows. One extreme is many of the Chinese and Russian circus\/acrobatic shows - all human acrobatics, zero art. Love is pretty much the other extreme - almost all art and almost no acrobatics.

Cirque du Soleil's trademark is more balanced show with impressive human acrobatics (using many Chinese and Russian acrobats, not surprisingly) matched with compelling original art & music. Love deviates from that blend into the ""WTF is up with these random people in haphazard, colorful costumes dancing to slightly remixed Beatles music? Where are the people doing *amazing* things in an *artistic* way?""

Ka is the best Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas. Absinthe is probably the best show overall in Vegas, and I have seen more than ten of them.

I had rated Love two stars for this but changed it to one after two recent events:

It has all the wild acrobatics of the typical Cirque du Soleil show with the addition of the Beatles soundtrack remixed by Beatles producer Sir George Martin and his son Giles. One of the coolest things about the soundtrack was hearing lots of lost behind the scenes audio clips of the mop top lads from Liverpool horsing around in the studio between takes -some of which I've heard and some a brand new experience for me.

The Beatles, whatever my opinion of them, are the background sound track for many parts of my life, and whether you like them or not, they form a tapestry of meaning.  I am more of a Rock N. Roll gal myself, but this peppy production was like a trip down memory lane and into the future.
I had watched the documentary on making this Cirque show before seeing it, and felt it might have been grittier and stronger if it had not been somewhat censored by relatives of the deceased Beatles.  But as created, it is a high energy recreation of much of the music that powered the social revolutions of the 60's and 70's.

So the show starts, and after the first number that lasted about 3 minutes, an announcer announced over the speaker system that there would be a temporary interruption or something. I thought it might be part of the show. They started playing some non Beatles muzak while everyone just kind of glanced around wondering what was going on. After 10 minutes I knew this wasn't part of the act. By the 15 minute mark people were getting up and walking out. At the 20 minute mark (I'm pretty sure that's how long it was but I didn't time it with my watch), I had decided I'd had enough also and was getting ready to leave...and then of of course the lights dimmed and the show picked up where it left off. I was a bit miffed that for the amount of money I spent on my ticket ($140 ain't cheap) that I had that experience. Once again, I told myself, venues can't get it right every time, so I bit my lip and stayed for the show.
Unfortunately, my mood had been a little soured by the interruption. The rest of the show was pretty much as the other reviews have described. The dancers and performers obviously make the show. Their feats are unbelievable. If you think about just how difficult it must be for them to be pulling off what they do you can appreciate the show more. Most people can't lift their leg past their knee, and these people are trapeezing 40 feet in the air, flying all around each other, landing in car windows, stuff no human should be able to do but they seem to do it with ease. Very cool. 
As for the music, it is good. They must have remastered all of the tunes because it sounds better than if the Fab 4 were down there doing their thing in person. Also very cool. Those two things are the only things that pull my review up to 4 stars, it otherwise would have been 3.

LOVE just has the capability to appeal to all ages! My parents grew up listening to the Beatles so we bought them tickets when the show first came out as a Christmas gift. They thoroughly enjoyed the songs, dad said the whole show was ""psychedelic,"" and they would do sing alongs as well..awww!

now, fast forward to my generation...after having the parentals incessantly play the Beatles on family road trips, I too have grown to love the Beatles! Lucky for me the hubby went through a similar upbringing and we were thrilled to finally watch LOVE together at the Mirage a few weeks ago.

granted it isn't your typical Cirque show with all the crazy acrobatic stunts and death-defying tricks...but for the love of the Beatles and the fun atmosphere the show brings, it truly is an experience to remember.

the LOVE theater is circular so any seat you have offers a good view, though I'm sure the closer the better. We ended up watching the show through a Southwest Airlines promotion and noticed that all us promo peeps were in the 300's section. Yeah you're at the highest seating, but you can still see everything and be part of the party=). It's cool because each seat is equipped with its own speakers so you pretty much get the surround sound feeling. 

And despite being seated at the top we still had some up close encounters with some of the performers. They've got some little acrobatic stunts that have some performers ""gliding\/flying"" out from the corners of the theater to center stage.

Ka is the most technically complete, with a storyline, amazing stunts, creative images, stages rotating on axes, etc.  LOVE is the most fun and a very close second place.  O is the most beautiful. Mystere has the best stunts and is most ""traditional"". Zumanity is the sexiest, but stunts are just okay. And Viva Elvis could be sooo much better.  You can read my other reviews for more info...

LOVE is sooo much fun. The music, of course, is great. The theater is great, and there are no bad seats.  The choreography with the songs is so creative. I particularly love the Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Blackbird, and the ""Parachute Blanket"" portion of the show. Neat Beatles shadows.  Such great production value to this show.

1. Aerobatics are not up to par with other Cirque shows.  This is more of a spectacular dance show.  Several times they put performers in the position to really hit a gymnastic or aerobatic home run and they stick with more simple choreography instead.  If you have seen several Cirque shows and then see LOVE, you will know what I mean.

I've seen most of the Cirque shows and The Beatles LOVE is so far my favorite. Probably because The Beatles are TEN THOUSAND TIMES BETTER than the Cirque house band playing quasi-rock with the operatic singer. It's not that the house band is bad, it's just I've never really left a Cirque show thinking, ""Hey, I really want to buy that KA soundtrack."" 

The seating for LOVE was circular with the stage in the middle. We sat around 2\/3's up and the seats were excellent. I think even the highest ""cheap"" seats (and by cheap I mean expensive) are probably pretty decent. Conversely, if you sit in the first row, right next to the stage, although you'll be able to see the sweat stains on the performers (how cool is that?), you'll probably miss the 75% of the show that's behind them. 

The show was awesome. Lights, sounds, dancers, acrobats, trampolines, smoke, color... Volkswagens (i.e., Beetles). A Fahrvergnügen on the senses. 

The only downside were the couple of guys next to us who for some reason thought this was an audience participation karaoke event. Memo to singers: ""Uh, just 'cuz you know the words doesn't mean you're obligated to sing."" Just saying.

Who doesn't love The Beatles? Whether you do or
You don't - add an a circular stage, with speakers that surround the entire theatre for an amazing crystal clear sound & a Cirque di Soleil show to that and you're gonna love it even more!

Conveniently located inside The Mirage Hotel, LOVE opened about 15 years ago. Actually it opened as soon as I got home from my first trip to Vegas and I was quite upset to hear that I just missed it. Needless to say I've been wanting to go back to Vegas & when I do I wanna see LOVE.

The original version made me cry before the majesty and beauty of the show.  A strange dream inside a dark corner of the Yellow Submarine.  Where nothing was real.

To be fair I saw that version about 5 times.  The last time I looked at my partner and said, ""Well... we've seen it, haven't we?""  I never see any shows that often (or even twice) but the original Beatles LOVE earned these return visits.  It was really that good.  One of the best shows of anything on the planet.

This new version... is broken.  

Was too much changed?  No.  But enough?  Yeah.  I've seen this version twice now.  The changes didn't grow on me.  I can't name one that was an improvement -- except for seeing the many African American faces during Blackbird.  And Beatles faces everywhere.  But even the Beatles mugs were ruined by lowering down TV screens here and there which is an aesthetic anachronism.  A show that's set in several pre-digital periods shouldn't be invaded by post digital tech.

In general I'd say the new production boldly tries to fix sleepy parts of the original show.  Why do I say sleepy?  Because as the years went on I discovered (much to my shock) certain drunken audience members snoozing away around song 5 or 6.  SLEEPING.   Which is NEVER good. 

So I believe Cirque decided to insert alarm clocks.  TWIST AND SHOUT, for instance, was added to keep things peppy.  Several problems.  It's just shoved between two songs that are already up and bouncy, rendering it ineffective in this department.  It was simply in the wrong place.  Also it's not even a Lennon and McCartney song.

LADY MADONNA used to be a very clever and fun dance number.  The dancing became simplified and the floor comes to life with projected splotches of color.  What was a 'fun and exciting change' the first time became a Disney broad brush stroke.  And therein --

-- lies the problem with this Beatles LOVE.  Every change bashes you in the head.  Like those ludicrous spinning things in OCTOPUS'S GARDEN.  All the subtlety of the first show jack-hammered away.   

Don't believe me?  Someone added HUGE pink balls that are suddenly thrown at the audience.  Like giant beach balls we're invited to toss them about.  Again a way to force the audience to remain 'attentive' while the explanation of which is baffling.  It comes off as desperate and distracted.

And while all these obvious changes to the veteran stare you in the face -- subtle changes irk.  Is it just me or did they let about 7-12 cast members go?   That the new faces aren't just new faces but are doubling up to save the show money?  I swear Mr. Kite was missing half the circus folk it used to have.  It used to be intricate and clever.  It seems sparse now.

I appreciate that change is good.  And necessary.  This last viewing it occurred to me that any young people in the audience would have no real idea why the Volkswagon bugs and bus come and go.  For me it's memory lane but for them they might wonder why we're in a vintage VW showroom.  Way too much of that.  They should all come and go in one song and then bye bye.

Cirque.  You broke one of the best shows on the planet.

The theatre is round so that all seats are surrounding the stage. It didn't seem like there was a bad seat in the theatre except for maybe the couple of rows closest to the stage. The stage was uniquely shaped with moving parts to recreate the shape of the stage frequently. 

This is a Beatles show so obviously there is great music. The costumes were great and true to the era of Beatles music. The performers were energetic and came together for a great show. Every act included perfectly coordinated dancing which was fascinating. There weren't any dull moments. 

One of the unique elements of this show was the audience interaction. I won't give away details to make it more fun for those that haven't seen the show, but there are some fun ways that the audience is made to feel included. 

Since most of the Cirque shows include spectacular physical stunts it should be noted that this show includes very little of that. Beatles Love focuses more on dancing and music than the typical awe of Cirque shows. It's truly a great show, but it could be disappointing for those looking for the awe they experienced at shows like Ka.",6,2,2

The Beatles have been such an impact in my life since childhood. My dad would always turn on the radio every Sunday morning to hear Breakfast with the Beatles and even blast their songs on the cassette player in the car. Growing up listening to them was like a rite of passage. And now that they have a show in Vegas it has been a dream of mine to finally hear their music live. 

The bf found a great deal on travelzoo.com for $70 each (service fees\/taxes already included). It was the best offer since other shows like O, Zumanity and Michael Jackson's One were more than $100. We wanted to stay budget-friendly so it was the ideal choice for us.

Our seats were all the way in the back but don't be fooled because they were still perfect. The view of the center stage still seemed close and for someone that has a pretty bad astigmatism that means a lot! It really is true--there is no such thing as a bad seat.

The show promptly started at 7 pm and it was THE best and THE most entertaining 90 minutes that I have got to experience in such a long time. I won't get into specific details because I don't want to ruin it for any that haven't seen it but I will say that it was an incredibly emotional journey through their music. However, my only gripe was the weak story or lack thereof. I'm not sure if that's intentional but it just seemed kind of odd--it wasn't very smooth transitions into the next song--but all-in-all I still enjoyed the music, vibrant colors and dancing.

It's not as acrobatic as the rest that I've seen; it's much more romantic, with an eclectic range of dancers moving in sensual rhythm to Beatles music.

There are so many aspects of this show that are mind blowing, and it all happens in three dimensions.  The show on the floor is not the same as the show in the air.  But I promise it's all engaging.

The stage setup and audience seating was not what I expected it to be. The audience surrounds the stage from all sides (and the stage itself has a very strange shape), and compared to the KA and O theaters, it's not as big. But it works very well for all the performances and choreography.

Some neat factors about this stage, theater, and production:

1. Imbedded in the back of each seat is a sound system speaker which is designed to provide a ""feel it in your bones"" surround sound effect for each and every single paying audience member. First time I've been to a theater that has this kind of system implemented.

2. Lots of ""trippy"" and ""wow"" visual effects in a few of the numbers (not going to give any away).

The show starts off a bit slow the first few opening minutes, which adds to the build up if you're a first time audience member. Then it explodes into a collection of non-stop high energy performances from that point until the end...filled with your traditional wacky Cirque set pieces and performers mixed with 60's flair.

I relished every single minute of this show. Super entertaining.

I am a HUGE fan of The Beatles. Over the years, I've memorized just about every one of their songs. Unfortunately, I wasn't born in time to watch them perform live. Beatles LOVE is about as close you could get to a great Beatles show with many acrobatic stunts and visuals that make their songs come to life. I wouldn't recommend just about everyone to watch it though, especially if you're not that big on Beatles - at least, pass this show off till you've watch other Cirque performances.

The show's soundtrack is a mash-up mix of many of the band's hits including Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, Blackbird, St. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Back In The USSR, A Day In The Life and snippets of lesser known songs such as Blue Jay Way, etc. I was especially driven by the Taxman\/Drive My Car\/The Word trio mash up and Papa, who's an even bigger fan than me, had a big smile on his face the whole way through. Drapes, actual voices retrieved from old recording sessions and moving silhouettes of John, Paul, George and Ringo made it feel like they were actually there

Stunts were not as elaborate as the ones I've seen at KA, O, or La Reve. However, this one reached the heart more than the others. I watched this show about 3 years ago and till today, they're still playing at the Mirage.

The Beatles LOVE was my first Cirque dus Soleil show so I didn't know exactly what to expect. I appreciate theater & the performing arts, but I'm the kind of person more inclined to go to a pro sporting event, stand-up comedy routine or a concert. I have always wanted to watch a Cirque show though & in Vegas, it's Cirque du-palooza!  

That being said, I thoroughly loved The Beatles LOVE Cirque show. In 1.5 hours, the audience was completely captivated by the cast & crew's interpretation of all the Beatle's greatest hits (including my fave, Eleanor Rigby) through their ornate costumes, stunning stage props, dynamite dancing\/choreography, and jaw-dropping acrobats & stunts.

FYI: The Beatles LOVE Cirque show is located in the Mirage Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. I sat in Section 204 as advised by the Mirage ticket agent as being the best seats in the house to view this show. I agree you can see everything perfectly without having to strain your neck like you'd have to if you were any closer. There is no intermission, but the show flies by & I think it's the perfect length at 1.5 hrs, any longer would be overkill! There are concessions & beer available for purchase before the show, doors open 30 min prior to show time. No pictures or video are allowed during the show...but ya know, see my pics!

There are a lot of Cirque shows to choose from in Vegas, so let me yelp you out if you're unsure whether The Beatles LOVE show is gonna be up your alley. I loved this show because it has a gemazing team of performers that does a fantastic rendition of The Fab Four without being overly dancy, froofy, boring or too long!

My only complaint is that there were not enough acrobatic stunts, which you'll find in shows like Mystere and O.  But Love is definitely a very large and very well-executed theatrical production that is not to be missed.    

The theater for Love is smaller than most other Cirque du Soleil productions, so there really is no bad seat in the house.  But I'd advise not to sit in the very front (you don't want to be at eye level with the stage) and not in the balcony seats (you want to be close enough to see the littlest of the many little details).

Certain people probably really enjoyed the show myself as well as my husband did until they depicted Muddy waters as a black dead beat father who could not support his numerous children( just a side note muddy only fathered 4 children). His numerous children with magical yellow rainboots and a pregnant black mother dancing around chasing muddy waters for money was astonishing due to all his contribution to the Blues and the Beatles.  Remember the Beatles wanted to meet Muddy waters they were fans.  The Beatles didn't see color, but how sad to see a legend presented poorly in Vegas .

By this, I mean I enjoyed their music but I only knew a few of their hits and couldn't sing along with the lyrics if my life depended on it.

I had great seats - center row, a few aisles back. However, the show works in such a way that no matter what your seat is, you'll have an amazing time. They really do their best to engage the senses of those in the front and in the very far back - worth every penny, no matter where you are in the audience!

The backdrops, the acrobatics, and most importantly the songs draw you in to the storyline. You can't help but be pulled in and be amazed. My heart immediately fell in love with LOVE! 

The soundtrack is amazing, even to a non-Beatles fan.

I had already heard the soundtrack a few times, so I was a huge fan of that specifically going in. I loved that George Harrison composed the whole complication and was super stoked to come. In fact, it was the sole reason I came to Vegas after having not been here since I was 11. I am now 34 and knew that The Beatles would be the only thing to make me go there as an adult. It's true, there seemed to be no bad seats and the overall ambiance was pretty cool looking. We sat like 7 seats from the stage. The shows performance did not match the soundtrack, however. It was lacking in many areas and beyond slow for at least 60% of it. The creepy as all get out little Beatles with blank faces was unnecessary and freaky and the Blackbird scene was probably one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. Totally took away from the beautiful song. There was nothing about the show that was worth $127! That is what the person who bought my ticket paid. It was worth about $80 and that;s what I would pay if I ever went again. I would also never sit near the stage again because I do not enjoy massive sheets dragging over my head for 5 minutes, which is what happens if you sit near the first 20 rows or so. If you went in with a hair style, you will leave those rows void of one. 
Go for the soundtrack and overall show, but don't pay more than $80.

We went to the preview show in mid-June because I love the Beatles and was also impressed by the 25% discount on tickets.....

The costumes are exquisite, certainly flights of fancy and color, and the acrobatics and choreography to music that really means something (to me) made this a wonderful experience.  The show is not as ""circus-y"" as the others, like Mystere, but the rest compensates you for it, if you happen to even notice this point.  Without giving too much away, Yellow Submarine and Blackbird were my favorites, although the opening groovy dancing was so cool...I seriously thought Austin Powers was going to leap out at any moment.

The theatre is rather cosy so you still get value from sitting in the nosebleed section (Balcony, but Upper Orchestra might be optimal) as you can take in all the visual stimulation from up there...and I mean ALL, as there are fabulous things in the air, film projections on the walls and the pervasive voices of John, Paul, George and Ringo.

We sat in the Lower Orchestra and the benefit is that the performers can see you - I swear they were looking straight at us most of the time!  And we could closely examine their tattoos, armpits, muscular legs, arms, etc. and any other area you wish to ogle.

The nostalgia of having bought my very first record, which was a Beatles record of course, shook me up but it was simply a very happy experience.   Folks of all ages seemed to be having a good time, though kids are not permitted to the show (under the age of 5), but I think you'd want to take kids over 10 to really get value of spending that kind of money on the ticket.

I agree with the website marketing of the show:  the listener is immersed in the world of the Beatles.

The huge screens they kept bringing in and out really helped capture the Beatles through image and sound. I won't give away too many details but they do some pretty big, audience involved pieces that are really cool.

The drinks are HUGE and they have popcorn, which I enjoyed. Also, pretty much all the seats are good. Personally, I would sit at least 10 rows back to really see it all. Down low seems like it might be too close and you might miss some of the action.

The stage is in the center of the auditorium so there are no bad seats. They make excellent use of the stage - at any given moment there are dancers twirling in the air and flying in from the sides, and performers on the stage. It's a literal feast for the eyes. And this show went beyond just impressive acrobatics. There was a very touching storyline, told through The Beatles' music. It offered a mixture of acrobatics, dance, comedic and dramatic skits, and a little bit of rock and roll ;) 

The visuals were amazing. ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" made the audience feel like the auditorium had disappeared and we were literally suspended in the sky with stars flashing all around us, as Lucy and her lover elegantly floated in a cat-and-mouse love chase. And the rollerblading daredevils skating to ""Help"" were beyond impressive. The bittersweet flower exchange in ""Hey Jude"" made me shed a tear. It was simply a stunning show all around.

The show also gave the audience a peek into the Beatles' lives and what they stood for in terms of human rights and equality. Thus the show is so appropriately named, LOVE. I highly recommend this show to anyone, whether you are a Beatles fan or not.",10,7,9

Unless you're a hard-core Beatles fan, you will find this mildly entertaining at times and trying to stay awake the rest.

At first, I'd thought that I accidentally stumbled in to an off-Broadway revival of ""Hair"", with it's way over-done tribute to the 60's and 70's.  

Then there is a VERY weird and pretty dark segment that can only be described as anti-Christian.  With a horned devil-like trapeze artist and a Cross surrounded by fire and screeching hell-like noise.  

There are a couple of really beautiful adagio numbers that try to off-set the rest of the blah-blah attempts at comedy and repetitious tricks.  But mostly, I was bored!  And not just our group.  There was a prevailing lack of energy in the room and the whole audience could sense it.

There were a few songs that I really enjoyed including Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds with the bling and aerials.  Here Comes the Sun was another favourite of mine.  I also liked how they incorporated some imagery on the screens of the Beatles talking.

(The comments you see in negative reviews talking about needing to be on acid or have lost your mind to enjoy this show are just about the most inane things I have read on Yelp.)

My girlfriend and I booked our flights as we did just to make sure we would be in Vegas in time to pick up our tickets the day of.. and I was prepared to risk jail time to call the box office from the airplane if we were going to be late for some reason.

To start, the theatre is beautiful situated in the Mirage. We spent a lot of time in and around the gift shop and in the bar close to it. There is plenty of LOVE related swag. We even grabbed a few small things. There is a few solid places to snap a photo, and the staff is really good to allow people to do that as the show is going on and in the chaos between shows.

It's a little bit of a cattle herding start, but we just sort of ended up at the front of the bus and got let in first, to be able to get to the concession stand (things are little pricy) but the bartender was good enough to fill up our keeper glasses we had with water for a tip.

Then you wait with great anticipation for the next gate opening, as they usher you into the theatre. It's dark and a little hard to navigate but there are plenty of staff there to assist you.

We were situated in the middle of section B. I got a ticket for free because of MLife's app called MyVegas which saved us over $100 bucks in the end. (And I got this on the last day I would have a chance before we actually left for Vegas)

Section B is where it's at.. Sure there is not a bad seat in the house as this theatre was built for the show itself... but you are just high enough that you don't miss anything over your head or behind you.. and you are close enough to really catch all the subtles. 

The girlfriend and I have tried a few times to decide what our favorite scene was.. and it changes by the hour it seems. The Lucy in the Sky scene was just so memorable.. but in the Octopus' Garden is right up there too.

There is not really a story persay. A few characters along the way you can follow, Sargent Peppers, and the four boys are a constant. But honestly, if you want a movie, go see one in a theatre... this show is just some of the best music you will ever hear in a show, and pure ""eye porn"" for your senses.

Don't go into this show expecting a traditional musical with beginning, middle and end---you're not going to get that. There's no storyline. 

""Love"" is really all about taking the audience on a unique multi-sensory experience. It is a series of unique, artistic (mind-blowing!) interpretations of Beatles songs. It's more like the best concert you've ever been to, and less like what you might recognize as ""traditional theater."" 

It's about feelings and experiences, not about a storyline.

At the risk of throwing around a cliche, it was truly a ""feast for the eyes."" It was packed full of every kind of entertainment: beloved Beatles tunes, dance, trapeze artists, clowns, contortionists, gymnasts, roller skaters, and more--each more impressive than the one before.

The use (and creative manipulation!) of stage space, lighting, costumes and props really blew our minds. It's clear that sooooo much creativity went into the making of this show. The way that the show transformed the environment and welcomed the audience to participate in the production was really unique. There was one part where the stage and audience was almost entirely enveloped in a huge parachute, onto which a lazer show was projected. It was incredible and just one small example of how mind-altering the show is. 

""Love"" was filled with so many impressive, awe-inspiring, and truly amazing moments. (I can't tell you how many times I accidentally said ""Oh my god"" audibly out loud during the show.) I was hesitant to see this show because I'd heard so many folks say that the Beatles ""Love"" is  only so-so in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows ... but I'm glad I did! Me and my husband (in our 30s) saw it with my parents (both in their 60s) and we all absolutely LOVED every moment of it.

1) For the Benefit of Mr. Kite - amazing circus tricks, particularly the dude at the very top on the big hamster wheel thing. I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety hoping and praying he wouldn't fall to his death because those feats he performed were just too incredible. 

2) HELP - with the roller skaters! so, so, so much fun.

3) Octopus' Garden - whimsical and lovely, loved the giant floating jellyfish.

4) Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - any act with the aerial silks is just beautiful, but this one really was the most magnificent display of elegance.

I sat in the back row but the surround-seating layout of the theatre made it seem like a very intimate performing area, so don't be disappointed if those are the only seats you can score.",5,0,2

You do not want to sit in the front row. This is another show that you need to sit back further to catch everything. (Not too far back) but still- enough to see things in widescreen as i explained in my 'O' review. 
Tickets for these shows are around 150-250.00  You'd be better off getting the 150.00-175.00 seats.  You'll thank me later.  There is so much to see, and the colors and costumes are visually stimulating.

It pains me to give this such a low score.

I remember growing up a  Beatles fan, I appreciated the music and their contributions they made to the world.  My father would sit me down as a kid and  set up some old LP's and play it on his stereo system.  He told me about their history and I grew an appreciation for their music and lyrics.  As I walked in and got seated, we were seated in the middle of section 200, dead center stage.  We were really happy and excited with the tickets.  At first glance the stage venue is extremely impressive, it's massive and sits in a arena styled format.  I got seated and got to enjoy listening to some of the house music of the Beatles work, and I also enjoyed seeing a few of the circus performers take to form of John, George, Paul and Ringo all dressed from their different eras.  I especially liked the interactions that the butler with the silver teapot, made with the spectators while we waited for the show to start.  

The show started out fine, but maybe about 20 minutes in, after the second or third song, all the dancers cleared the stage and some of the music resumed.  For about 5 minutes we sat there in the dark waiting for something to happen.  Nothing, we sat in the dark listening to Beatles music.  A few minutes later the house reports that there will be a temporary break and it will resume momentarily.  I'm not sure if one of the actors got hurt or if there was something wrong with the stage, but we sat there for 25 more minutes, in the dark listening to music.  The users didn't make it any easier, they tried to discourage us from getting up, insisting that the show will resume shortly.  They eventually got whatever they needed to be fixed, but with the show running behind schedule and in talking to a couple other people who have saw the review, have told me that they saw things that may have been cut out of our show, so they could catch up and make up time that they lost so they could be ready for the next show that was to come.  I was not interested in shelling out a 130 bucks again to find out.

Despite the technical difficulties they had, there were some really glaring issues that I had that I couldn't over look.  First of all, this was Cirque du Soleil, I was expecting so see more acrobatics and other circus feats, but compared to shows like Ka, Zumanity and O, they seemed to have skimped on this aspect.  I understand they wanted to focus on the Beatles music, but, I know Beatles music, I would have rather wanted to see the interpretation that Cirque would have done with it.

The other issue I had was due to the stage, at times, even from our central position in section 200, there were times the layout of the stage was cut out to accommodate more seating, as a result you got little corners that were obscured from view.  I found this flaw annoying especially, when some of the audience may have seen something really cool due to all the Ooohs and Ahhhs... and we couldn't see what happened.  Or there were quite a few times that there were so many performers on stage, that it began to look like a giant mob on stage and it became very easy to lose track on what you were supposed to look at.

I think the thing that was probably most confusing was the lack luster story line, it felt as though they were trying to tell a story but failed to make it clear to the audience.  It was extremely loose and it seemed the director decided it would be a good idea for the audience to fill in the blanks.   It's not a good sign during  our forced intermission that we heard 6 conversations around us, asking about what the story line was.  If you want to be that abstract do what most ballets do and give us a freaking playbill with a background storyline.  This issue was significantly apparent in the first 4 scenes of the show.  There were also pretty of ""what the hell"" scenes as well, but I think that may have been due to the fact that they we trying to materialize the imagination of these four musicians when they were under LSD influences.

I know for a fact most people will go see this show, regardless of my experience and if you appreciate the music, you should.  Just make sure you keep your expectations in check.  I made the mistake of building it up in head, but if I look at it objectively, as a Cirque du Soleil, it isn't in my top three productions, it's not even in my top five, it's probably my one least favorite of the Cirques.  I don't think I could shell 130 bucks on seeing the show again and see what I may have missed from another seating angle, instead I think I would rather go onto amazon.com and go ahead and buy the digitally remastered, Beatles Stereo Box Set...  It costs about the same.  I know I won't have any technical difficulties on my home stereo.",8,3,3

I am however a big fan of The Beatles. I went to the show on the 7th of July. I was more than impressed. I've got the soundtrack playing right now. As far as the seating went, we were on the front row of the balcony section. I don't think I would have wanted to be any higher than that but not really a bad seat in the house. I'm also glad I wasn't in the front row. Middle the road would have been absolutely the best. This is a must see show for ANY Beatles fan. 

My only complaint and suggestion is this - Because this show was so great, I left in great pain. DO NOT drink anything before sitting down for the show. Make sure you hit the bathrooms before it starts. I think it was 10 minutes into the show and it hit me. Heed my advice!!

A Cirque de Soleil show that's actually fun!

Housed inside the Mirage resort, The Beatles Love is a breath of fresh air in the Las Vegas Cirque scene.  After seeing one too many Cirque shows that take themselves too damn seriously, I found Love to be a magnificent change of pace.

Unlike most other Cirque shows, Love will have you bobbing your head and smiling from ear to ear.  Want to see a multicolored circus with outrageous costumes and dance routines, creative and elaborate props, impressive feats of strength, aerial rollerblading (!!!), trampolining (!!!!!) -- all set to a wicked awesome soundtrack of the Beatles' greatest hits, see Love.

(On the other hand, are you In the mood for somber and generic-sounding New Age coupled with yawn-inducing acrobatics and costumes?  Then go to one of those *other* Cirque shows.)

The ""plot"" -- if you can really call it that -- follows historical events very loosely, starting after WWII and ending in the 70s.   Each vignette flows seamlessly from the last in a way that's quite impressive.  I especially enjoyed seeing the silhouettes of John, Paul, George, and Ringo chime in every once in a while with amusing commentary and random chitchat lifted from their recording sessions.

The theater is fantastic.  It's square-shaped, and all the sides have equally lovely views of the stage.  It's also small enough that everybody -- even those in the back row -- feel like they're part of the action.  (There's also a concession stand out front along with a well-stocked gift shop with Beatles stuff, but I skipped those.)

My biggest gripe with Love is the lack of a live band.  If this show is really meant to be a tribute to the music of the Beatles, then simply setting it to recorded music feels like a cheap cop-out.  A live band covering the Beatles' music would really take this show to the next level.

Despite that complaint, Love is still the best and most exhilarating Cirque show in Vegas.",11,7,7

The only other thing I can add to the reviews already here is that the music in the show focuses on the 60's era of Beatles music.  The show spends maybe 20 minutes max on the Beatles' 50's era, and the next 70 minutes is all 60's.  This was a little disappointing for me, since I prefer the Beatles' music from the 50's.  But for the show's pomp and spectacular visuals, I can understand why they wanted to focus on the wild and colorful themes from Sgt. Pepper as inspiration.  The acrobatics and stunts throughout the show were all superb.  There were some slow parts in the middle involving strictly dance routines, as I momentarily felt myself awaiting the return of the acrobats.  All in all this was one of the most awe-inducing stage shows that I've seen and I highly recommend it even to those who are not Beatles fans.",0,0,1

Would have been much better with a live band, dressed as The Beatles, rather than piped in prerecorded songs. 

This production is not up to all the other Cirque shows out there. Here is the secret tip off to even the venue knowing it is not up to par; they will offer you big discounts on the tickets without you even asking for a discount. 

The choreography was stale and when you see one aerialist you have pretty much seen them all. And this show was just filled with cast members being raised and lowered from the ceiling. 

The bright spots were the Octopus's Garden number and the All You Need Is Love finale. 

Even the supposed clowns were boring and unimaginative. Would love to have the hour and a half back. 

Do yourself a favor and check out Ka, O or La Reve. These will not disappoint you and will leave you exiting the venue smiling and in awe of the creativity and talent of all of those involved in the productions.",0,0,0

You catch yourself and others singing along with familiar tunes and  discovering others that you probably never heard of if you are not a hardcore Beatles fan like myself.  The use of props (the assembly of the volkswagen bug, the white sheet covering the audience, etc.) was amazing.  The performers were nothing short of spectacular though at times I thought there were too many people on stage at one time.  You tend to see too many acts happening at one time and feel like you missed something if you focus on any one act.  I would really like to see LOVE again, mainly to catch things I missed the 1st time around.  In the meantime, I continue to listen to the CD\/DVD that I purchased after the show.

The Mirage is home to the spectacle that is LOVE and by having this show performed in the round is absolutely brilliant.  The round stage offers a remarkably good view to all guests no matter what seat you purchase (although their is one minor interactive element exclusive to those who sit closer during the show but I wont spoil it).  The music is prefect and covers songs throughout the entire Beatles catalog of music and the story flows seamlessly throughout.  For those saying this has less high gravity and death defying acts than your normal Cirque du Soleil show is fair perhaps but the show definitely still deliver in this aspect as well.  There is so much going on at one time it is sometimes hard to keep up with it all and you go into overload mode but in a good way.

The Beatles have had such an impact on many peoples lives in one way, shape or form and for me their music resonates big time in me and is often playing loudly in my head.  I enjoyed the entire show but the several of the scenes such as Hey Jude and Lucy in the Sky really stood out above some of the rest.  The show will take you through the entire gambit of emotions as you embark on the roller coaster ride that is this show.  You will feel the happiness and joy that many songs convey one second while being brought back down into a more somber, melodic and melancholy feel the next.  The show moves at a breakneck pace but never fails to keep you thinking and watching at every turn.  

The special effects and props used were done to absolute perfection and really have to be seen firsthand to be believed.  They did an excellent job of weaving in world events and other periods of Beatlemania into the story which really gave the show a complete feel.  The Beatles are one of those bands who like them or not whose music will be around forever and will continue to resonate with people in different ways.  They truly were a once in a lifetime band that will love on forever and this show is a perfect homage to them.  If you are in Vegas and looking for a show this would definitely top my list.  Beatles and non Beatles fans alike will fall in LOVE with this show (pun intended).",24,15,25

The theme of love is lost in the current version of the show.  It was much more prevalent prior to the revamp and wished it still remained.  

The amazing music of the Beatles remains filling the air of the genius circular layout of the theater.  There isn't a bad seat in the house.  Actually seeing it from various points allows you to recognize a new part of the show you may have missed.  I love the ever changing stage and platforms for the changing acts.

For every spectacular visually stunning number there were a few that were kind of boring, just many costumed people dancing around on the stage.  I wasn't sure to look to find the great acrobatics I was expected but often times there weren't any.  That's right...far less acrobatics than I've come to expect from smaller Cirque shows.  

Yes, there were two very good numbers in the middle of the show (one with unicycles flying) but that turned out to be the climax of thrills.  After that it was back to amazing visuals and a lot of wandering around onstage.  The attempt at a story was unfortunate.  Better to skip storytelling than attempt it so poorly.

BTW: there were really young children performing too! Wow!

Favorite parts for me were ""Blackbird"" and ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"". Next fun moment was when the audience got to be covered over with a huge billowing sheet (like playing Parachute in pre-school).

Cirque du Soleil is, first and foremost, a unique art form that provides jaw-dropping, unforgettable displays of physical human ability.  It's not just my opinion; their own website proclaims as much.  This incredible experience is what causes people to book pricey shows weeks in advance. 

But there were almost none of the signature Cirque du Soleil acrobatics.  Instead there were lots and lots of interpretive dance moves, running around in elaborate costumes, nonsensical random artsy monologue and dialogue - and, oddly, grunting.  (At least three of us thought said grunting had an awkward racial tinge.)  As a result, the show felt less like Cirque and more like a live action re-enactment of the multi-media displays of Beatles' memorabilia that I'd seen recently, of all places, interspersed between gameplay in the video game Beatles Rock Band.

This version of ""Cirque du Soleil light"" seemed to answer the question I had going in: how does one maintain the Cirque identity without upstaging the legendary Beatles?  Apparently the producers answer was ""We won't.""

While costumes, interpretive dance, and general weirdness are indeed part of Cirque du Soleil's identity, I don't think they're the parts that people come to shows for.  And based on the applause I heard, it seemed like I wasn't the only one in the audience that felt this way.  Not once was applause instantaneous, the way it is when a crowd is wowed by a performance.  And, to my own disappointment for the dutiful and energetic performers, not once was the applause prolonged beyond that required by courtesy.  In an earlier life, I spent a lot of time onstage myself, and weak ovations like this are heartbreaking, especially when the disappointment is not the fault of the performer.

Yet as I left the theater, I overheard at least four patrons (all women) remark on how much they loved the show.  It was unclear to me if this was genuine awe at the overall experience, a rekindled infatuation with the Beatles, denied guilt at having just paid $132 to watch a big music video with some interpretive dancers, or something else.  To some extent, I understood those who enjoyed the show. The Beatles songs I adore most - 'While my Guitar Gently Weeps' and 'Hey Jude' among them - were the ones I remembered most fondly.  It suggested to me that those who thought they loved the show actually just loved the music.  The sound quality was impeccable, delivered through a massive custom audio setup including stereo in-seat speakers that made the Beatles' music come alive in a way even my higher end multi-speaker car stereo cannot.  When combined with the light show and special effects, it was often a better-than-average way to experience Beatles' recordings.

But the standard should be much higher than beating your car stereo.  To receive 5 stars, this show needs some changes: first, drop the ""Cirque du Soleil"" branding.  Second, advertise it as an interpretive dance plus Beatles music multimedia show.  Third, lower the price by 3x to be cheaper than the Beatles Rock Band video game.  Finally, have the surviving Beatles make cameos.

I imagine none of this will happen anytime soon.  In the meantime, Beatles fans, rest assured that Cirque du Soleil did not upstage the Beatles.  And Cirque du Soleil fans, make sure you get tickets to a different Cirque show.",4,3,1

The only other Cirque du Soleil show I had ever seen was Le Reve at the Wynn. I thought that was kinda boring since it felt so repetitive with guys just jumping in and out of the water. LOVE was a much more diverse show using bungee chords, trampolines, skate ramps, etc. The costumes were a lot more diverse and they also used a lot of video projections. There is so much going on, that it is almost too much to see. But since there is no real central story to follow, you can just look around the stage at whatever is the most interesting thing going on at that moment. 

It really helps to be a Beatles fan.

Just the reality in music back then is so much more moving especially when all you hear on the radio is about drinking,sex,strippers,drugs.

So back to LOVE.  Why the 2-star?

VALUE
First of all, unless you adore the Beatles, this is really not one of the better values in Vegas.  At $120\/ticket minimum, going up to $200+, this is a serious headshaker.  At any given Cirque show whether it be the touring company or in Vegas, you can expect:
1) Live music performed by an orchestra
2) Dazzling acrobatics & amazing feats of athleticism
3) Beautiful costumes and dramatic artistic performances
LOVE has just ONE of these and I'll let you guess which one it is.  Any one of the other Cirque shows in Vegas - Ka, O, Mystere, Zumanity, Believe - have all 3.

COULDN'T WORK WITHOUT THE (recorded) MUSIC
While I recognize that the Beatles are\/were an exceptional talent, I'm not THAT gah-gah for their music.  So the thing I have to ask is, could this show stand on it's own without the CD recording playing in the background and the answer is abso-frickin'-lutely not.  It might sound unfair being that the whole show is themed around the Beatles but c'mon:  It's a recording.  At least with ""Mamma Mia"" you hear ABBA music but it's sung LIVE and there's a story.   Meanwhile, I can play these Beatles songs off of iTunes for $18 permanently and get the same thing that everyone seems to be raving about with regard to this show and paying $120.
Frankly, if this line of thinking really works, why not have the next Cirque show highlight the music of Elvis.  And the next be U2.  $120\/ticket.  Cha-CHING, baby.

CHOREOGRAPHY?
This one is weird.  Granted I'm not performance arts major but I've seen my share of live performances which has me asking:  Can someone tell me what sort of relationship the dance choreography had to the music other than tempo?  This could have been performed to a Earth Wind & Fire album and made about the same amount of sense.  If there's one word I could use to describe the dancing in this show, it'd be ""ARMS"".  Lots and lots of ARMS.  Arms flailing about.  

I'm confused by the majority of the reviews of LOVE. Have these folks been to any other Cirque shows?  Are people just that nostolgic for Beatles recordings?  Did they drink too many of the $18 ""LOVE""-branded souvenir beverages from the concession stand?",6,6,3

This show shattered my expectations, and they were set incredibly high to begin with. The acrobatics were out of control. The illusions that were created were incredible.

I was suckered in by the flashing lights, happy faces and great reviews. We went to Vegas twice in 6 months, once in November and again last month, in March. In November, we saw Boys II Men, also at the Mirage and pasted by LOVE. It looked amazing and I wished we could have seen it then, but due to time constraints, we simply couldn't. I also like the Beatles, so this seemed like an instant ""love"" connection. I was so wrong. 

On with the positives... The production spares no expense on set, decor, costume or lights. This is one of the more elaborate shows. There is always something happening on set and your attention will be pulled in a thousand directions. This circque de sole show pulls out all the bells and whistles. 

The not so good... Of all the amazing songs that the Beatles created, they choose a wide variety of popular and no so popular to convey their messages.  For example, there was one scene during the show that references the civil rights era in America and had actors dressed in Ku Klux Klan costumes... That was a little unexpected, but it somehow ties into the story line. How it ties in exactly, I don't really know. There is a lot going on (and not in a good way). There were a few acts that just had me completely confused.",4,2,1

Unfortunately for us, the LOVE Cirque didn't follow the Beatles tune quite THAT closely. It started out good...the opener is a showstopper, but then didn't really get better.

This is a bit of a different-type of Cirque. It's got Cirquelike elements, and there are some seriously spectacular numbers, like their opening and last 2 closing numbers, and a few in the middle like Here Comes the Sun and then the fun Baby You Can Drive my Car...but other than that, they could have made it so much better than it is.

There are SO many Beatles songs to choose from... even I know that, and I am not even a real Beatles fan...and they chose some random slow ones that just did not work with the dance and character numbers they paired them with. 

And the slow contemporary, reflective dance numbers in gauzy white linen?? Hello, I can see that on So You Think You Can Dance for free. Give me WAY more fun, jazzy, crazy Idontknowwheretolookrightnow numbers that are going to keep me from zzzz'ing during a 10pm show.

I admit to nodding off for a few minutes here and there as did the gal pals who were with me, so it wasn't just me being a tired old lady.

Not on my absolute 'must see' list for Vegas, but if you get stuck there in a pinch, it's a fairly entertaining 1.5 hours for $110.  Not sure about the ROI...kinda expensive for balcony seats though we had a good view.

BUT, gotta give props since it's a Cirque and the actors and dancers are seriously talented regardless of the choreography. The music was also awesome piped in super loud and jazzed up with some modern beats that worked.",8,8,9

There were three great unusual and\/or fast paced acts, though - a skaters' ramp, trampoline act, and a giant sheet that enveloped the audience for Yellow Submarine.

First off, every detail was well-planned, down to the people who scanned my ticket, offered me a program, or led me to my seat.  (""Joseph and the Technicolor Raincoat"" style tunics, girls wearing '60s mod police officer ""Bobby"" outfits, and fur-collared coats a la Sergeant Pepper, respectively).    The venue itself was unlike anything I'd ever seen before, following through with the color scheme and aesthetics of the show.  I was already thoroughly entertained before the show even started.

Then, still, I was even more amazed.  Little details, like following the rapid mechanization of British culture was demonstrated by remote control tricycles, or machines which had pedals that made lots of pairs of galoshes dance simultaneously.  A housewife displayed her identity by hauling a fishing pole over her back, from which hung many pairs of baby clothes, like a clothesline.  Beatlemania cleverly depicted rabid fans by giving them dozens of hands or legs, all in motion, all the time: physical chaos.  Drug experimentation, racism, the plight of the single mother and war were all similarly depicted: so cleverly, that I wanted to write a letter to people who came up with all of this.

My husband has read about Cirque shows and said that typically, the costumers, makeup artists, choreographers, prop designers, set designers, etc., all do their parts separately first.  I can't believe a group of people could all work together to make something that jives so harmoniously.  I seriously think I smiled through every second of the entire show, from when an entire VW Bug went from driving across stage into lots of men holding sheet metal, all the way to when an alcohol-fueled party girl accidentally bopped her own head off.  It was uplifting and really really smart.  Excellent work, Cirque!",0,0,0

I've heard this show is not like most of the other Cirque shows. Definitely less acrobatics and awe factor, and more about the dancing, artistry, and music.  Sometimes there was so much going on in the stage, my brain was overwhelmed with what to watch.  

You know the show's a ""winner"" when you fall asleep during it. Which is what happened to me.

I mean, seriously, what an amazing experience and production!  It was the only show I saw in Vegas, but it was by far the best show I've seen in a long time, and that includes NYC productions.  You gotta get some Beatles Love when you're in LV.  

I tried to get discounted tickets, but that didn't work out, so we're staying at the Mirage and head back there to check on availability on a Sunday night.  Shows remaining = 7:00p and 9:30p.  We opted for the 9:30p show so we could catch dinner beforehand.  Much to our surprise they had tickets available.  

The guy at the Mirage ticket counter was really cool, he talked about the seat offerings and mentioned how the back seats were not that far from the stage and you're higher up and can see everything as opposed to the front seats which are set lower than the stage.  You can pick what you want, but we were pretty happy w\/ our seats in the back row.  Another bonus - - he even offered us a 20% discount...that rocked.  He said they were 98% sold out, when we got in there we saw several rows of open seating, so lesson's learned - - everything's negotiable, it doesn't hurt to ask, you may get your wish.  

The show was spectacular to say the least.  If you're a Beatles fan then you have to go, if you're not then you'll become one regardless.  As for the show itself, it's like a combination of Harry Potter, Technocolor Coat, Willy Wonka, Stomp, and Tim Burton.  There's singing, plenty of different styles of dancing, a little acrobatics, rollerblading, and lots of props and fun.  The dancing is eloquent and graceful.  They match it all w\/ the various Beatles hits and also play some vintage film at the end of the show.

For those not familiar with the Beatles, you will be lost in a daze...sort of like a ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" head trip.  But I guess that might have been their intent - ""LSD"" being the name of the song and the show centered around the hippy phase of the Beatle's long, storied, history.  Do not expect the ""Bowl"" Haircut, Ed Sullivan version of the Beatles on this show, but do expect the ""60's Free Love"" version of the Beatles.  You know, the psychedelic, bell bottom, big-hair version as typified by their Sergeant Pepper"" phase of their history.

Well let me start from the beginning.  The weekday shows will generally not be sold out and there are typically two per day when showing.  Weekend shows will be more of a challenge.  There is a 7pm for older folks and 9:30pm for less older folks.  Doors open a half-hour before the show and you always want to be there early in order to not get ""clowned"".  Pricing options are: MLife members get around a 30% discount, a sometime available two-for-one deal through on-line Vegas Slots, sometimes half-price deals at the Mirage ticket office, or supposed same day cheaper tickets at the Strip discount ticket kiosks \/ booths.  So many ticket options, as in, so many ""dealers"" in Vegas.  In Vegas, someone is always dealing; albeit, card dealers, time-share free-show dealers, half-naked girly business card on the sidewalk dealers, etc...  Yeah, everyone has got some deal going on so check around before buying.

When making your deal or buying your tickets, try to sit higher than Row Q and in Sections 200 and 209 which are centered.  The stage is oval and seating is in the round or should I say ""oval"".  You will want to sit further back to take in the entire spectacle.  Additionally, there is a point in the show where a large fabric covering is lowered to simulate the ""open sea"" and you'll be pissed if you're sitting underneath this fabric in Rows P and lower.  Therefore, sit higher and enjoy this simulation...it is really one of the highlights.

If you've seen many Cirque shows, this one differs as there is a ""lot"" of dancing.  More like out of controlled dancing mayhem with performers situated all over the large stage.  A little too much like a church revival to me.  The show also has skaters and trampoline \/ net climbing acrobats.  Yes, there is employment hope for your out-of-controlled teen head banger.

Three nits... One - Lone Contortionist facing one direction for all of his moves.  Suggest turning a quarter, four times to allow the entire audience to enjoy your feats facing you.  Two - half of your audience is lost underneath the sea of fabric for the important boat-on-the-sea period of the show.  This portion of the show is a must-see and should be seen from above Row P.  Three - what were the kid performers supposed to be doing?  They really don't add any value and I kept expecting them to do something amazing other than run around.

Overall, worth seeing for the visual special effects and hearing Beatles' music from their druggie phase of their lives.",2,0,0

Maybe it's because I saw O the night before, which I love and which is SO FULL of gymnastic\/acrobatic talent, but The Beatles LOVE hardly even struck me as a Cirque show. So the show is pretty much great if you worship The Beatles, but not as exciting if you're a big Cirque fan.

I was sad that there was zero live music - I know it's a Beatles show, but I thought there might be some live accompaniment added. Nope.

On top of that, the show is very dance-oriented, and there's not much acrobatic stuff going on. There are half or maybe even fewer circus acts as you might find in a more traditional Cirque show. I only remember 3 actual acts. 

I still enjoyed it, and the show truly made me think about some Beatles songs differently than I have before. I particularly loved Something In The Way She Moves and Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.

Also, the main clown in this show seemed really cute. I wish I could meet him. Haha.

I have been to more than 5 Cirque shows and have always been overwhelmed with wonder and emotion. This show left me wondering how they could have messed up a slam dunk production with such a great set of music to choose from.  Perhaps I am biased in that I never liked the Sargent Peppers genre, (the movie,  I love the  music).  Love has a sergeant Pepper trippy, bizarre vibe which follows the story of Sgt. Pepper and his band of street characters. The set Is a cross between 19th century London and dark Alice in Wonderland which uses 360 degree videos from the Beatles first tv appearances with giant video screens behind the audience as an enhancement to the live performers, 

Perhaps they were trying to save money on the extensive use of live performers that are required for typical Cirque productions, but the audio & video made the performance mechanical and cold. In this age where we rely so much on video for our entertainment, the Beatles vids were disappointing. 

The show contained some of the usual Cirque du Soleil acrobatics however it was more trampolines and jumping from suspended platforms then anything truly interesting. Due to the small size of the auditorium and extensive reliance on video, I believe they were unable to include more of the truly amazing acrobatics in this production. 

One tip-off  that I should've picked up on was the audience was about half full on a peak night, it made me wonder how this show is still surviving? perhaps Mirage doesn't want to invest the millions of dollars it requires for a new show and is trying to milk this investment. Certainly it looks like they put a lot in developing the audio and video screens in this theater, which is rather small to try to make up by selling $20 drinks and Beatles trinkets in the lobby.

Why does the show have so many great reviews on Yelp? All I can guess is that Cirque du Soleil has great public relations spin doctors. Skip this show and go see one of the other amazing Cirque du Soleil performances on the strip.  My current favorite is the Michael Jackson, One or Mystere.",0,3,0

Growing up I wasn't a Beatles fan. That changed several years ago when I saw VH1's Greatest 100 Rock & Roll Albums. I noticed that five of the Beatles' albums were in the Top 11 (#1 Revolver, #6 Rubber Soul, #8 Abbey Road, #10 Sgt. Pepper, #11 White Album). Surprisingly Chuck D of Public Enemy said his favorite Beatles' album is Revolver. He also said what makes a great album is that not every song is a hit song. When I started listening to those albums I understood what he was saying. What made the Beatles great wasn't that they wrote great songs, but they created great albums, which is considered a lost art in today's music.

I didn't know what to expect from this show. I've never seen a Las Vegas show before. My boss saw this show a few years back and didn't like it. I haven't seen any Cirque du Soleil show but I wasn't sure if I would like the theatrics from the show. Also I wasn't sure if contemporary dance will be performed. Being someone who's fan of hip hop dance I'm not particular fond of contemporary dance. Also I heard there was montage or collage of Beatles' songs meaning a whole song will not be fully played. I set myself for low expectations.

After watching the show I was blown away. Without detailing every song or moves, for those who are interested in watching the show, I will depict the highlights. I love the mood in the opening scene of Liverpool in WWII. For the song ""I am the Walrus"" there were some hip hop and b-boy moves. In sense I was shocked for this show to see a lot more b-boy moves like lock and pop as I assume the dance form for this show would be contemporary dance. Even though I'm not a fan of contemporary dance for the song ""Something"" there were b-boy moves yet the emotion felt through the dance moves had a contemporary dance vibe to it. If I had to summarize the choreography of the whole show there were mixtures of hip hop and b-boy moves yet there was an emotional contemporary dance feeling to it.

In terms of acrobatics there was guy on a swing that was raised high in the roof. The acrobatics he did without a cable and safety net astonished me. If you're afraid of heights you will be aghast what he was doing. I'll be honest for those who are interested in more Cirque du Soleil acrobatics this show doesn't have a lot of them. This show is more about the choreography through Beatles songs. What is amazing is that the later Beatles' songs weren't meant for dancing in clubs like today's music. Their songs had pure emotion. What makes this show entertaining is the choreography telling a story through The Beatles' songs. 

I've performed in several hip hop showcases. The reason I was blown away after watching this show is seeing the timing of the choreography of this show amazes me because I know how much the time these dancers put in. To get the timing and sequence right, if done correctly, makes the show entertaining. That takes a lot of practice. 

You know are enjoying a show when you don't have to look at your watch to hope and see when the show will end. Never once had I looked at my watch while I was watching this show. 

Picking a Cirque du Soleil show can be difficult. I recommend picking a theme that interests you. If you love the Beatles then you will love this show.",11,3,8

We were two couples and a seventeen-year-old high school exchange student. The show was perfect for everyone. The volume was perfect, the seats are very comfortable (which is important when you're moving around so much to look at everything that is going on), and the performers cannot be beaten.

Without giving anything away I'll say that in the beginning I was a little overwhelmed. My husband looked over and said, ""I don't know where to look!"" But eventually we all kind of fell into a rhythm for watching. There is LOTS going on.

My favorite selections were ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Revolution"" but all of it was brilliant. There was one section before ""Lady Madonna"" that struck me as racist, or at least insensitive, but I can be hypersensitive. While I am NOT a fan of contemporary dance, I loved the acrobatics - both the actual feats and the variety. 

The costumes were amazing... There was a dress and also a skirt\/sweater combo I was tempted to sneak into the dressing room and steal. The entire show is very colorful and over the top and the costumes highlight the songs and performances. 

Truly brilliant although the curtain call is awkwardly long.

So why take off a star? There is a section of the show when part of the audience, those in the premium seats, miss an entire number due to being covered by a prop. I found that ridiculous.

I'm not the biggest Beatles fan, but this show gave me a completely renewed appreciation for their music. 

Some of the highlights, without spoiling anything for future audiences: 
- The lighting effects during 'Come Together' where absolutely amazing. 
- Same comment on lighting for 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds'
- I love that there are speakers built-in to the back of the seats, it adds to the show. The overall sound production for the show was amazing. 
- The show is extremely colorful, the sets and costumes were amazing.

Since I have been a life long Beatles fan, I was very curious as what I should expect? And then my wife literally said, ""Let It Be!"" , and I did...I just relaxed and let go of any expectations from any other show that had seen in the past. Once the music began, I was knocked into the back of my seat.

The audio and visual presentation is awesome. In addition to the theaters dynamic audio system, you have high end audio speakers that are embedded in the headrest of your very comfortable theater chairs, plus the seats that are in front of you have the speakers directed towards you as well!  The main body of the show starts off very solemn,  and as the crescendo builds....it EXPLODES on to the scene with a re-mastered version of ""Get Back"". With performers  dancing and running around the middle of the stage, skaters skating, and acrobats literally falling and flying from the sky.....Whew! 

I was on a high like no other!  My wife was used to listening to the Beatles only through me...strangely enough she quickly became a fan of the Beatles after the show. But I almost think that she was overwhelmed...it was kinda cute, but she kept saying, Hey D, I know that song!  They creators of this show wanted to start this one off with a bang, and they do an OUTSTANDING job of doing it!  You cannot help appreciate the genius not only of Lennon and McCartney, but the FAB FOUR are a part of music history and this was just a way that Cirque du Soleil was able to pay tribute to their contributions to the music, not of their own generation, but all that followed!

Granted, I'm a huge Beatles fan.  I am also easily amused and generally easily impressed by theatrical performances.

But Beatles LOVE was amazing!  I loved the mixes\/remixes of classic Beatles songs used in somewhat unexpected ways.  I especially loved the opening act and the Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds act.  The first had so much energy!  And the second was so gorgeous and disorienting, perfect for the song.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this show.  It was gorgeous, fun, and a great Beatles tribute.  The interplay between video footage\/silhouettes\/live actors\/recurring characters from Beatles' songs, etc was just amazing.  And the strange-quirky sensibility of the Cirque aesthetic was perfect for a show centered around the Beatles.

If there was one Cirque show we were going to - this was it.  I purchased tickets well in advance to secure our seats, and the tickets were expensive but definitely did not feel like we missed out by purchasing the tickets priced mid-range vs. the ones down front.  

The stage is unique and very busy.   Once the show begins - there are people and moving parts flying all over the place.  There are a lot of great props, outfits, stage sets, characters...lighting and sound.  LOVE is a sensory overload on all fronts.  Honestly, I don't feel as though you have to be an avid Beatles fan.  I am a moderate fan, but the show and music create such a unique theatrical environment.  Being a Beatles lover is not a requirement.  

It seemed to go by so quickly and had that....what just happened stare in my eyes after the finale was over.  Just a great show to experience.

We were seated about one third of the way up and as mentioned by other reviewers, all seats have a great view!  They have speakers in the head rest, but the volume is perfectly balanced as not to blast your ears, it's quite subtle.  The music and visuals left me smiling and singing to myself, it was euphoric!

And listening to ""Revolution"" brought me back to grade school when I played our 45 rpm record of it over and over and over!

This particular Cirque Du Soleil didn't have as much of the amazing acrobatics that you usually see in one of their productions, there was a whole lot of floor work. They did make up for this with a few pretty neat props (loved the galoshes).

Best seats in my opinion are the top 5 rows.  NOT the balcony seating though.  I guess you might call it orchestra?  Reasoning?  There is a sequence in the show where they cover the audience with a HUGE sheet.  It has this ripple effect and looks so awesome.  Also when the sheet gets pulled down into the stage it looks AMAZING, almost like it's water going down a sink.  To miss that because the sheet is covering you I think cheats you out of that experience.  BTW, if you happen to be at the edge of the sheet-DO NOT HOLD ON TO IT!!!!!  The sheet is supposed to wave loosely.  People were trying to grab onto it like it was a parachute.  There are ushers that will do this job so don't try to take over for them!  The stage is 360 degree and performers come in from above, down the stairs, at the sides and from underneath.  Like I said, top five rows of orchestra seating are the best IMO.

We stopped to get beverages beforehand and noticed the drink menu items were named after popular Beatles. Made me want to try every Beatles influenced cocktail!!! We got the Hello Goodbye beverage along with a pina colada (cuz I wanted something cold and sweet). You can add a shot for $4 into your beverages ($12 12oz or $17 32oz). The pina colada was VERY sweet but also very strong. So be forewarned if you're a lightweight. The bar lines are ridiculous. Took us at least 20 minutes to get two beverages. 

The staff were excellent. They were able to direct us efficiently to our seats before the show started (we only had a 2 minute window before the show started).

Seating is easy to find and the auditorium has a 360 degree view, so ANY seat has a good view. I have to say the farther you're seated the better because you will be able to see the entire show from a higher view. The production is amazing. The story line was entertaining and about...LOVE! The performers were excellent and their human strength inspires me. My favorite scene was the chain of bubbles which reminds me of how effervescent the Beatles are and will be for ever. I also want a freaking bubble piano in my house now because it'll definitely be a conversation starter.

I am also considering a career change and joining cirque du soleil. Wish me luck guys!!! I highly recommend seeing this show. They have daily deals (50% off tickets), so just call and ask! :)",5,3,3

MAJESTIC! Yes that will be the one word I will use to describe the whole show. I've always wanted to go see their show but never had the chance. But this time I finally put down my foot and decided to give it a shot along with my wonderful parents. 

I had the most wonder experience from the beginning till the end. Everyone was extremely friendly. This show is located inside Mirage. We all know how classy mirage is so I wasn't surprise it will be at this hotel. The show was around 1 and a half hours and it was in a decent size theater (I honestly don't even know if that's the right word to describe the circus lol). This one is different than other because they plan along with all the famous Beatles songs. So if you're not so much of a Beatles fan or know any song from them then this wouldn't be a big WOW to you. But I still think it's a good idea to check it out. 

The play 2 times a day. I got the decent seats which was around $125 per person. Being in Vegas it's coincided average price. I definitely encourage everyone to check it out. They really know how to engage with the audience and make us feel like we are apart of the show. I think personally that's my favorite part about it. 

Overall 5 stars for everything. Would love to check it out again in the future.",8,2,5

Even if you only like a few Beatles tunes, you'll enjoy this presentation (sonic mash-ups of their recorded catalog). It's a psychedelic circus for the eyes and packs an emotional wallop too.

There is a lot going on at once which is why I would recommend to sit further back to enjoy all the performances. I also want to add that it if you're looking for more acrobatics go watch ""O"", ""Le Rêve"", or even ""Zumanity"". Now those are ones to watch!

The music and show was good, there was one scene that was a bit uncomfortable for me. Unlike a lot of people on here I thought there was a lot of acrobatics. They just were not the hold your breath kind like the other show I saw.

Prior to Beatles LOVE, I have seen La Reve, O, and Mystere and I have LOVE in 3rd only ahead of O (even more suprising I know). 

The show was a graceful display of dancing, acrobats, and theatre. They often tie their acts with historical events when the songs originally came out so audiences may need a general awareness of societal happenings during The Beatles era to find more meaning to the show. 

I definitely recommend this show for all Beatles fans. I think they will find a lot of meaning to the show and can take a trip down memory lane while reminiscing through these performances. For the casual Beatles fan like myself or those who don't know much about the Beatles, I would not recommend this show. I feel like if you don't get the references throughout the show, it becomes nothing more than a typical dance show with occasional acrobats here and there. Your money would be better spent watching La Reve at the Wynn, where the art and acrobats shine in their most magical form (lol). 

The good part about this show is there is not a bad seat in the house. The venue is circular so you can see the show from many angles and there is no seat that is too far from the stage. I agree with the person who said to buy tickets to the cheapest seat you can get because it makes little difference to be up close and personal. You will have a clear view regardless of where you sit. The only issue with sitting up at the balcony is the leg room is a bit cramped.

If you're not a huge Beatles fan then just move out of the way for those that are. I prefer to be seated in the middle then top or bottom levels.

The songs honestly put me to sleep, especially if I'm tired. Some people love the show even if they're not a fan of the Beatles, but it just doesn't apply to me.

Granted, depending on how many Cirque shows you've seen, your opinion will differ. If it's a first Cirque show, or even their first acrobatics show, this'll probably blow their mind.

It's just not my thing. Each specific Beatles song has choreography made just for that song so all the action is in relation to the song and how Cirque interprets it. All the music is digitally remastered (or something along those lines - don't remember well from the backstage tour) so no one is singing live, as opposed to some of the other Cirque shows.

I've watched this a total of 3 times and it's honestly not my thing, but if you're a Beatles fan, I'd recommend it. Heck, if you want this to be your first Cirque show, go for it; you'll enjoy it a lot more than I, someone who's watched all the Cirque shows in Vegas. A lot of people honestly love this show (they've watched like 8+ times).

AS FAR AS BUYING TICKETS\/PRICES:
There are multiple avenues to buying tickets but if you need to switch your seats later or need some sort of accommodation (maybe you need a different day or you have some sort of emergency), then you'll want to buy it directly from the Mirage \/ MGM Resorts. If you're going to buy it from a third party vendor (kiosks or non-mirage websites), you're out of luck for that for the most part, even if they are cheaper. However, the counter sometimes offers discounts and it doesn't hurt to ask what the discount for the day is. Sign up for the MLIFE players card and you get discounts & points for buying tickets. Military, student, & hotel guests also get discounts. You just have to ask for it. BE NICE to the reps because they're the ones showing & giving you the seats.",4,0,0

From the moment when we walked up to the Box Office, I felt as if I was being transported into an Austin Powers Movie...the bright colors, the British flag, the dressed up cadettes that greet you.

As other yelpers have discussed. This is definitely different than other Cirque shows because weren't too much acrobatics. If you want and expect that, I suggest watching another show. Since there's a bunch of 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm guessing most people are open minded. It was more a variety show with all types of dance (hip hop, breaking, modern, and artistic) to various Beatles songs. It was honestly kind of weird to have roller blades on ramps....but okay....Even though I am not that big of a Beatles fan, I still knew alot of the songs. I was swaying my head back and forth during a good majority of the show.  I honestly didn't get every scene....a bit artsy and way out there for me (but I guess you don't have to)....MAN OH MAN THE VISUAL EFFECTS WERE AMAZING!!!...MY FAVORITE SCENE WAS THE JELLYFISH SCENE.

The only main downside to the show was that I actually got dizzy during the show moving my head from one thing to another. We sat up front thinking that the closer, the better but there was so many things happening all at once. I was trying to see everything and moving my head all over the place.

SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS SHOW FROM A DISTANCE IN ORDER TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE. ALSO TRY TO GET DISCOUNTS ANY WAY YOU CAN...THIS IS A REAL EXPENSIVE SHOW ESPECIALLY TO SIT UP FRONT (AT ABOUT $170\/SEAT....OUCH!!!....BUT THANKS TO MY BF I DIDN'T HAVE TO DIG DEEP INTO THE POCKETS). THERE PROBABLY ISN'T A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE....SO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE CHEAPER SEATS.  If you know anyone that lives in Vegas, residents get approximately 1\/2 off tickets.

Although this isn't my favorite Cirque Show, I overall still had a fun time.

We loved beatles music and we love Cirque Du soleil so of course we would enjoy this show right? wrong!

This isn't like other cirque shows (mystere, ka, corteo, kooza), this is more like a dance show to beatles music. There are very little trapeze acts, contortionists, and things that amaze you. Instead people dance and walk around, come down from bungies, and rollerblade. Nothing here is truly amazing.

I was bored when watching this and couldn't wait for it to end. 
after paying $150 for tickets we felt ripped off! We had to see another show to feel satisfied and saw the blue man group the next night (which was awesome by the way). 

If you haven't seen a cirque show you will probably like this show, but if you've seen other traditional shows you will probably be bored. It seems Cirque is just lending their name out to new dance shows (viva Elvis, Chris angel believe), so I won't see any of these shows since I heard they're basically the same.

First off, I am not a die hard Beatles fan.  I like their music, and listen to it on the radio when it comes on, but by no means a fan.  I know some diehards and we almost had to break off our friendship when I told them I didn't like this show.

Secondly, I think you were supposed to take LSD or acid or something loopy to know what is going on.  Now all Cirque shows or at least the 5 I have seen are a little out there and require you to go on a crazy journey with them, but this was just too weird for me.  With LOVE though, I just felt I had missed a memo or something the entire show.  And the little shoes that walk out by themselves totally freaked me out and gave me a nightmare after seeing the show.

Thirdly, it was just way too much Beatles stuff.  Many of the things referenced parts of the Beatles history that a layperson probably wouldn't know or care about.  My diehard friends had to explain some of the things to me and it made a little more sense afterward I got the run down from them, but during the show I was just confused.

The show was incredible. After the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. It was so polished and beautiful. The music had a nice flow and was mixed very well. Also, the pacing was excellent. I had heard that O had dull parts, which I wanted to avoid. This one had very few breaks in the action. There were so many things to watch that I couldn't possibly see everything. I chose C section seats as some of the reviews suggested, and they were a perfect view of the action. To be clear, this wasn't about a major storyline. There were some interesting recurring characters. But to me, it had themes of unrequited love, fighting against unjust authority, celebrating individuality, and embracing and loving your fellow man.

I haven't seen LOVE prior, so it may be interesting for anyone else who has seen it previously to compare how the acts have changed and\/or improved. 

I laughed, I almost cried, and I sang along often. I knew enough of the Beatles songs in the show, and I'm sure that the songs are in a rotation for every iteration. I also found that the songs were used appropriately. I thought it was cool how interactive the stage and props were. I don't want to give anything away, but the octopus' garden was an amazing, psychedelic spectacle.  

What I look for in a good Cirque du Soleil show is story development. In most (if not all) Cirque du Soleil shows, a clown goes through this wild ride through a different world. For LOVE, a sad clown goes on a journey where he experiences war, a crazy devil circus, death, etc. Love, however, always triumphs.

As soon as you walk in you're immersed in Beatles history. A huge multi-colored light up walkway takes you towards the bar serving several Beatles-themed cocktails. Entering the arena (in the round) you're confronted by four large sheets with projected images of the Beatles on them. In the background you can hear mostly instrumental Beatles songs, which put me in the mood to hear an hour and a half of Beatles music. They did exactly what I would have done; they played almost exclusively Beatles songs NOT featured in the show itself, which I appreciated.

Everything about the pre-show sets you up for the fun and exhilarating show to follow. An actor walking in the crowd snuck behind an audience member and sat in his seat before he could. It was this type of unnecessary fun that made the entire experience fantastic. The show itself starts with a haunting display of acrobats slowly descending from the ceiling and ascending from the floor on wires in slow motion to the song ""Because"" but only the vocals.

Soon after the show bursts to life. I won't ruin it for you. You should go see it. There was so much visual spectacle happening at once that my girlfriend and I often didn't even know which amazing stunt to look at!

Beatles Love is definitely different from these two shows as there aren't nearly the same amount of trapeze stunts and such that Cirque is well known for. This show is all about the music! I don't want to give away too much info, but the show has some sights and images that will trip you out! 

We were sitting in the front, so there were multiple times when the cast interacted with us! (Which, of course, was fun and memorable!)

Some personal highlights include: the Blackbird segment, Revolution\/Back in the USSR, Hey Jude, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Ticket to Ride,  and Yesterday.

Instead, I got an interpretive dance show with (admittedly great) Beatles music. Only two real ""Cirque"" acts; the rest was almost two hours of interpretive dance and floorshow. Not what I have come to expect from the folks who did Mystere and Zumanity.

The remixed Beatles songs were phenomenal, as were the outtakes that were scripted to shadow performers acting it out. However, there were so many areas this show failed. Lady Madonna ended up being a modern African dance number with pregnant women. Here Comes The Sun was completely out of sync: the choreography had nothing to do with the music (music moved fast, they moved slow, etc.). I mean, the list goes on and on.

One note: if you have to go, get the upper balcony seats. Yes, they are less expensive, but you will actually get to see the action without a crick in your neck. Not to mention there is one ""number"" where the entire lower seats are covered with a sheet for over 2 minutes.

The set design, creativity and talent on display in any Cirque show are always incredibly beautiful, leaving us to wonder, 'How the hell did they do THAT?'  

The stage for this show was a basic X design, large ""curtains"" with projected images of the Beatles members tell a little story, which is sometimes followed up by the performers on stage.

Unlike a typical Cirque show which will have people floating, flying, hanging and gyrating in mid-air, this show combines the floaty elements with a lot of singing and dancing - in other words, a typical Vegas show.  Except, typically Cirque.  

For a Vegas show, Cirque certainly delivers.  But if you're looking for a more traditional Cirque du Soleil with death-defying stunts that will leave you cross-eyed, this is not the show for you.

Of course, if you're a Beatles fan, you have a vision of what the show should be, but you have to let the artist in you go and watch the show as Cirque interprets it. 

The theater entrance is a fabulous splash of technicolor LED floors and blares Beatles music. People are dancing outside the theater before and after the show.  I did. *blush* 

They even have speakers behind every seat! If you go for any show, I always recommend getting the best seats that you can. For this show it is defiantly worth it. I sat in the second row and could almost touch and feel the expressions on the casts faces. This is the way the show should be experienced!

I wasn't sure how they were going to incorporate the music with their skills, but I ended up becoming a fan of the show and would love to watch it again.

FYI: if you plan on watching the show, don't bother with orchestra seats because the higher up you are, the better.  With all Cirque du Soleil shows, there's a lot of things going on at once so it's better if you're higher up so you don't strain your neck watching.",1,0,0

I got the ticket online and paid $60.5 for section 201 row R through special online discount. However, there is a certain part of the show that will be involved with section 100 audiences (a pretty passive participation because you are technically not doing anything). I would recommend section 200 seats... they give you better views from above (and not to mention tickets are cheaper). 

Performance: It felt more like a musical than an actual circus acts (80% solo \/ group dancing performances and 20% circus acts). Basically the show started with WWII scene and eventually moved on to 2 hours of non-stop Beatles' music.

The best acrobatics act? Probably the roller skating part where all four skaters synchronized their movements. Most of acrobatics acts weren't as intense as other Cirque du Soleil shows. 

The downside? I do not know ALL of Beatles' songs, so I almost fell asleep on some of slow tempo songs.

I've seen it twice: once from the very last row of seats, and once from the front row. My advice would be to sit halfway! Front row is below stage level, so you can't see everything, and back row is kinda far from the action. But it was still an excellent experience both times.

I hate to admit this, but this show is kinda uplifting...and might even touch you on an emotional level! I've heard Beatles schlock in so many commercials and movies and other spiritually bankrupt settings that I didn't think the music would have much effect on me... but it did! Despite the fact that it's just a bunch of hardbodied dancers in freaky makeup going through the motions twice a night, five nights a week...somehow the lights, effects, music and choreography all come together to make it feel really genuine and interesting.

the sound was awesome and the acrobatics were really fun. 
we had the balcony seats and they were just fine. sometimes a screen would block your view of half the stage, but there wasnt that much going on at those times anyway. had friends that had lower seats before and they said both locations had their advantages and was just as good.

I think this is a show meant for more ""seasoned"" Cirque fans. Most will want to ""ooohh and aaahh"" watching dangerous acrobatics, and for that, I recommend Mystere or O. For shows with a storyline or serious overtones, then check out KA or Le Reve.

I know certain Beatles songs, at least the most catchy ones, and the show didn't disappoint in playing these songs throughout the show. Whereas other Cirque shows let you focus on one act in the center of the stage, LOVE is a bit of sensory overload. There are dozens of performers everywhere, with different costumes, and different props. 

It takes a little getting used to, but having a balcony seat helps. Sitting at the very front row of the balcony section, I felt we had a great overview of everything. I won't give away anything, but there are things ""flying"" in from everywhere, which was pretty cool. Having a higher vantage point made it easier to focus on things. 

Plus, balcony seats were cheaper anyway, if you're on a budget (35% off through their website now). Overall, LOVE has some great music that'll have you tapping your feet or bobbing your head throughout the show. If you're more of a fan of performance arts versus circus arts, definitely check it out.",4,3,4

Pepper playing on the in-dash eight track player (yes, my dad was king of the Seventies). I know these songs intimately, and yet the music of LOVE was a delightful surprise. Pieces of the master tracks are combined in unexpected ways, creating a sound unheard before but at the same time totally familiar. The audio is enhanced by a sound system that I think even surpasses the one in the KA theatre at the MGM, with speakers in the seats, in front of each row, above, below, and in the surround. The theatre seating is in the round, which at first had me concerned that we would miss elements of the show, but the stage direction was so well coordinated that there could not be a bad seat in the house. Maintaining the standard of the other resident Cirque shows, the costuming, props, dancing, and acrobatics are a feast for the eyes. Simply amazing.

-There is a snack bar which sells food and beverages both non-alcoholic\/ alcoholic
-There is a retail shop where you can buy souvenirs as well as a lot of other Beatles stuff.

Suggestions:

-I think it's best to not sit in the front row!!! Not even in the lower section. The middle section allows you to see the whole arena. 

We sat in section 207 row O which was perfect because the restroom was right up the stairs, also we were in the perfect position to fully experience certain special effects.

-Make sure you arrive at least 30 minutes before the show. If you arrive late, they make you wait until there is an appropriate time for you to enter.

There was a group of 10 of us and we took up half a row! We all met at the REVOLution Bar before the show for drinks. It's a fun bar and you can sit in the letters of revolution. Nice and cute server too and it's pricey, but it's Vegas!

For the show we had the perfect seats. We were 6 rows up (above the VIP section) and right in the center. I will say this again- for Cirque Du Soleil, you do not want to be too close. Last time I went to a show and sat VIP I constantly had to move my head back and forth to see what was happening and felt that I missed a lot for lack of peripheral vision. This time this did not happen. We were far enough back that we could see the whole stage and all that was happening. Cirque shows usually have so much going on at the same time, and this show was no exception. I definitely recommend sitting further back to try and catch all that is going on.

So the show was awesome. Obviously if you LOVE the Beatles (and who doesn't?) you will enjoy it that much more. The whole show was very artsy and more like a choreographed dance\/play than another show I've been to. It was very trippy and every song had it's own different interpretation. It gave you a lot to think about and also had a lot of moments where you say, "" how did they do that??!!""

So although I would have preffered a little more acrobatics and crazy stunts, the show was still very intertaining and pretty incredible.

Ever since I was a tween I absolutely loved the Beatles, When I saw this show was in Vegas I knew I had to check it out. 

The 200 Sections are a great view for the price, Beatles love sometimes has a 50% OFF promo via online, that's the best time to grab some tickets. 

Price: Level 3 I paid $88.00 for section 203, row N Seat 1 

Oh my goodness the male contortionist with 100 abs got me all hot, Ugh just him alone is worthy of 5 stars. 

The music, Props, Dancing and Acrobatics were entertaining and kept my interest the entire time! I found myself singing along the entire time. 

This show is like a story, I can dig that, If you can appreciate music videos I think you will love this show but if your looking for acrobatics the entire show then look elsewhere.

This show wasn't as acrobatic as the others that we have seen but the song, props, dancing, set changes really ties in together and there is a lot to take in from many angles.

By Kelly Vohnn

Picture yourself in a seat at the Mirage, with curtains around looking like marmalade skies.  Somebody calls you, you answer quite cheerful, the clowns mime their way and soar incredibly high. 

I know, I know, I'm a little corny.  You can't tell me you've never heard of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...  The Beatles timeless music has lasted through the decades and acquired many new fans young and old alike.  If you weren't a huge fan of the Beatles before seeing Love, afterwards you will walk away with a whole new appreciation for everything that they have contributed to the music industry.  The band that took America by storm introduced a whole new look and era which opened the doors for a refreshing change in the music industry.  Their ever changing music grew more popular every generation. 

Cirque du Soleil went out on a stretch and coupled popular music to their world renowned human circus shows.  Love is my second favorite Cirque show.  You'll eventually find out my first.  Cirque has uniquely interpreted each hit the Beatles ever made making you sit on the edge of your seat during the whole production.  They really tried to appeal to a younger audience with astonishing aerial performances, the remarkable extreme sports and incredible urban freestyle dance.

I was escorted to my seat by a heavy set girl with a British accent wearing psychedelic British police clothes.  All the ushers had British accents.  One of Cirques signature trade marks is that they will search the world for the right cast and encourage foreigners to enhance their productions.  They use 60 international artists in Love.  I find their use of music very lulling and entrancing in most Cirque shows.  Where as Love brought back childhood memories and I was singing along to some of the tunes.  They mesh in a tribute to the Fab Four using panoramic visual and surround sound in the Mirages custom built theatre.  The end leaves a delightful longing to learn more about The Beatles and to appreciate them. 

Of course you have your Cirque du Soleil die hards who believe that using words AND pop songs with a Cirque show is unacceptable.  I say things change and when they do we should embrace them.  It was very different from all of the other Cirque shows I've seen and I really enjoyed it.",0,0,0

Bottom line is that based on the stage and performance area there really isn't what one would consider a bad seat anywhere to be honest..I was in the lower level towards one of the entrance sections so that was definitely pretty nifty to get an added take on things!

Love certainly seemed to be one of the more complete themed story lines compared to the ones I've seen previously..On top of that even picking up the tickets was pretty seamless..We went a few hours before the show and got in\/out effortlessly which is always a plus! 

My highlight was seeing this young man (probably around 9-12 years old?) just ripping up the stage..He saw me point to him and admire his popping and other earth shattering moves and when he went to leave the stage at the end reached out for a high five..I guess little things like that go a long way in their minds, but honestly each member left their heart on the stage that night!

Saw ""Love,"" with some friends on 7\/22\/12.  We purchased our tickets from the ""Tix for Tonight"" booth at the Fashion Show Mall.  I am glad we did this as we were able to trim off about $52 per ticket by doing so.  

I have seen just about every Cirque show in Vegas:  KA, Zumanity, O, Mystere and this one kept me entertained the whole time!  (BTW, I fell asleep through parts of O and KA).  I was never really into Beatles music, but it didn't matter because the content of the show was very fun and filled with energy.  I just remember smiling throughout the show.  :)

The performers are super talented and there is not a bad seat in the house.

I recommend the The Range just across the street from the Mirage at Harrah's.

It's an hour and a half show of non-stop music and action.

It's cool that they have actual masters of the music and can splice it so that it fits the show.

- there's less acrobatic acts than other cirque shows, but more emphasis on choreography, sets, and other action on stage. Depends on what you like.
- most of the acrobatic displays are aerial, and no stunt type acts
- read up a bit on Beatles history before going to fully appreciate
- it's a very small theatre, so even the worse seats are pretty close to the stage!
- there's also loads of half price offers floating around all the time, so check those out before booking

Fans of the Beatles should absolutely see this show.  It's an amazing tribute of their work. The storyline is loose, but tells you how the band got together, their psychedelic experiences in the 60's and their break-up in the 70's.  All throughout the show, interpretations of their famous songs like ""Here Comes the Sun"", ""Strawberry Fields"", etc. come alive.  Sergeant Pepper is a central character in the show.  

Unlike Ka or O, there isn't a live orchestra here, but the pre-recorded music blends seamlessly from one song to the next.  The built-in speakers on your seat make sure you fully enjoy the music (or at least don't fall asleep!) Although there are acrobatics here, don't expect full on craziness like Ka. 

There really isn't a bad seat in the house, the best ones in my opinion are in the section 200 (the middle part).  You'll appreciate that fact when the bed scene comes. It's truly a wonderful sight!

I would recommend this show to those who are Beatles die-hards (such as myself) and enjoy many elements of dancing (hip hop, ballet, street, tap, etc.).

The interpretations of the Beatles' songs were beautiful, tasteful, and best of all, artful. To be honest, I can care less about trampolines and rope tricks, I was all about the built-in speakers in the headrests, costumes, and lights. 

My favorite interpretations were Lucy in the Sky and Something. OMG, amazing. 

As the lyrics poured onto the stage . . .""something in the way she moves, attracts me like no other lover"" was like watching a love story unfold in a magical way . . . sent chills up my spine.

The show was more choreographed on the ground to the beats of Beatles music. I think O may have been more of my cup of tea.

I would sit a little bit higher up just to view everything on stage. People expect closer seats to be amazing, but your viewing angles are bad and not worth the price you pay IMO.",3,0,0

The synchronized inline skating was something I had never seen in a Cirque show.  They were so fun to watch!

Good Job Cirque du Soleil for creating quality shows that is worth every penny!

FYI..... I also hear that Cirque du Soleil are getting new set of  performers for the Beatles Love show in June 2008 and changing it up a little bit.  Other notes for fans of Cirque du Soleil, they are creating a Criss Angel show at Luxor and an Elvis based show at the MGM.",0,0,1

Just wait until the curtain drops after the first song!! It has more dancing than acrobatics but still very entertaining. I wish it was longer!

I've seen it twice, once in the very back and once in the very front - both views are fantastic and I really don't have a preference. The audience sits in the middle of the show so there's a lot going on \/everywhere\/ like all around you. I was worried when I sat in the front that I would be craning my neck to see what's going on the in the air but I worried for nothing. There's also a SURPRISE that happens during the show and I was afraid that sitting in the front, I wouldn't get much of a view BUT it was even cooler being there than in the back! It was very psychedelic... You'll see what I mean when you see the show. Every seat has a good view (in my opinion).

I recommend going earlier in the day if you want to buy souvenirs because it gets super crowded right before and after the show. If you end up loving the show, I also recommend buying the soundtrack because, even though it's the same songs you probably already have, it's mixed so brilliantly (BY THE SIR GEORGE MARTIN BTW) that you'll hear the songs in a whole new way. For example, ""For the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" ""I Want You (She's So Heavy),"" and ""Helter Skelter"" all mixed into one song... What!

Also, the snack bar is pretty cool. They have tasty cocktails named after Beatles songs, candy, popcorn, and other stuff. I've noticed that I buy snacks but I don't even eat them because I'm so engrossed in the show!

Also also, I love the fact that the show was kind of George Harrison's idea and Paul\/Ringo\/Yoko\/Cynthia and Julian Lennon\/Olivia and Dhani Harrison\/Apple Corps Ltd approve of & support it. Makes it ~that~ much more special.

Cirque's LOVE is the most amazing live show I've ever seen!  I saw it in July of 2007 with a friend of mine.  Our seats were in the second row from the center of the stage, and it was absolutely fabulous.  I sat on the innermost seat of the row, and FELT the WOOSH of the bladers as they skated by me (I'll admit it, I did slightly fear for my life at that point).  Sitting that close to the stage really gets you involved in the show, and if you don't mind the splurge, do it!

LOVE is truly a work of genius--the struggles of life and rock n roll are put on display in a magnificently choreographed story told through the words of the Beatles' music.  I laughed, I gasped, I cried, I even blushed!  (The narrator of the show..the fat man...kept kissing my hand as he exited stage and presented me with flowers..is that just part of the show?  I felt the LOVE!)  The creativity and athleticism of the performers is outstanding.  The music is amazing.  The stage and props are incredible.

Usually with most Cirque shows, I usually have to figure out what the f___ the story is and et cetera.  With LOVE, we know what the story is and are there to see the show's ""interpretation"" of the songs and their meanings.  All in all, there were many cool moments of physical daring and skill and lots of sound bites of the Fab 4 during their careers.  A few of my favorite Beatles songs like ""Here Comes The Sun"" and ""Hey Jude"" were played.  There was one moment where they had a strobelight flashing  for 10 seconds straight.  At that point, I didn't close my eyes but I wish I did because I felt like I almost could have had a seizure.  Memo to the show management: Flashing lights from a Japanese cartoon had caused a few kids to have actual seizures!  Maybe tone it down a bit...

Our Concierge prefaced the ticket purchase with the statement: ""This show is a busy body, that I can say for sure."" Well, she wasn't joking, but I will get to that in a moment. 

As you walk up to the theater, in the circa 1994 hotel and casino that is The Mirage, you can see that money was spent on this theater and this Cirque production. The UK flag on the ceiling, as you approach the theater, and the shiny color changing lit up floor. Spectacular!!! The photo shoot that each guest has a chance to take part in, before you head inside? Smashing!!!

I do not reveal spoilers, even if a show has been in production for over a decade. I respect the Cirque experience and I want each ticket holder to be surprised when the show begins.

That said, this show was more musical than the standard Cirque acrobatic performance and that's fine. I just don't think The Beatles are my thing and that likely has more to do with my age group than anything else. I was a stoner, but the kinda stoners I ran with were more consumed with The Doors, Jimmy and Janis than The Beatles.

Although not as large scale a stage as the likes of CDS's such as 'O' LOVE was no less fun, high energy, colorful, and exciting to watch. There were such awesome stage technology, character performances, and Beatles music.....oftentimes heart pounding.....wait a minute, that could've been the awesome sound system you could actually feel in pounding on your chest. The performers were so incredibly skilled with every acrobatic and dance move that it just keeps you awed throughout. 

For those who thought there was no story line to this performance probably don't understand what the the production is all about. It's not a literal story like you may see at a movie. It's an artistic and loose interpretation of the Beatles' life and times. Just because an abstract painting by Van Gogh doesn't look like a Mona Lisa doesn't mean it has no meaning or story behind it. Every work of art has a meaning behind it and CDS's The Beatles LOVE production is no different.

I had actually wanted to watch the show the day before and had asked our hotel concierge for help with the tickets. However, we were a bit too late and the prices were rather high just a few hours before the performance. According to him, prices will typically go up the closer it gets to the performance time. So we opted to go watch the show the following night. We had reserved a balcony seat for just over $100, but when we got to the theater, we were met at the door by the usher who informed us that they had closed the balcony section and that we would be re-seated at a much better seat closer to the stage....wow....a $200 seat for $100!.....then again, I have seen this done before when there are plenty of empty prime seats to fill.....our view of the stage and performance was absolutely awesome as we were literally just feet from the stage and could watch every detail up close. The only problem I had was that there is very little leg room for taller people and I was a bit uncomfortable with my knees pressing up against the back of the seat in front for the 1-1\/2 hour performance.

The entire cast of characters, performances, effects, music all literally made me feel like I was in a dream. In fact, although I'd never tried this it myself, I can only just imagine that this is precisely how it feels to be high on magic shrooms without actually having taken the stuff :)",6,1,1

I have been to 85% of all cirque du soleil shows, and this one was by far the most waste of time and money. I don't know what everyone is raving about for this ""Beetles- Love"" show, but all I can say is that if you enjoy elementary school or high school plays, and enjoy watching people walking across the stage, stomping their feet, then this show is good for you. 

We were a party of 4 people attending this show, the past Saturday night, and 2 of the people with me got up halfway through the show and walked out. It was that boring and that bad of a show. I swear I would have walked out too, but I kept telling myself, ""it will get better, it will get better."" NOPE. It did NOT get any better. I was so shocked. If I had no shame, I probably would have booed the performers midway through as well. 

The performers DO NOT do any acrobatics, or anything amazing on stage. All you see is a bunch actors on stage at various times, in costume, running around, and spinning to the Beetles music. Here and there they would pull out props, rolling though the stage from one end to the other. . . so ridiculous, and it didn't even add anything to the show. I did not pay $200 to go watch others dance to music and jump around. It was so unbelievably stupid that words cannot describe what I am saying. They would have people sitting on rings, floating in the sky, and you would wait and expect them to do a trick, or hang from the ring, or spin around or do something, But NOOOOO, they just sat there floating like a statue. It was such boring acting and childish performing. I truly felt like I was watching a high school play, but at least at the high school play you don't have the ""cirque du soleil"" expectations. 

The music was nice, but the performance was really unprofessional and had not a single special act in it that was enjoyable. I think walking on the las vegas strip and watching the Bellagio and Treasure Island shows would have been more worthwhile than this.

awesome performance, music, dancing, and little bit acrobatics. 
nice stage floor designs. 
we're sitting at the balcony 1st row, enjoy it very much, because we can see everything from this angle. although i think the best view are from section 2 (200 & 209), section 1 would be to close and you'll miss some of the performance around you, that's just my opinion.
the theater is not that big so don't worry about having bad seats.

most parts\/ songs are beautifully arranged and choreographed, but few are loosing the 'grips' that why i gave four stars, overall it's an amazing experience.

Integration of Beatles music to the performace was nice, but it lacked a coherent story line. It is as if each piece of Beatle love songs stood alone. I felt that integration of the music could have been better. In the beginning, the performance was almost too overwhelming with a hectic pace of performance, but I locked in with the rhythm within two songs. I especially fell in love with a dance between a male and a female dancer (I think, to the tune of Something). Despite seemingly disjointed songs, I loved each individual act and loved the energy of CdS. I didn't care for one performance of portrayal of the violence and racial tension, but I concede that it is relevant to the 60s.

The outside is very well done. All the workers are dressed in  Beatle-esque fashion and come along w\/ fake British accent. Good job getting the feel right. 

The show - Although I did enjoy the show, my expectations were not met. I thought it would be a Cirque masterpiece, but instead found it to be somewhat of a letdown. Throughout the whole show I kept thinking in my head if it was ever going to get better. There aren't any over-the-top feats, and nothing that left me thinking ""wow."" 

The show revolves around the history of the Beatles and is packed with symbolism dealing with the groups musical and personal lives. I think someone who isn't such a BIG fan wouldn't grasp some of this symbolism. I had purchased the soundtrack months before I went and it only got my even more excited. Fantastic job by the Martin's on the mixing of the music.

There's no audience interaction of any kind like a lot of the other Cirque shows though, which can be the best\/funniest part!

The visuals are pure psychedelic eye-candy, with a set crazy set that can transform the 'in the round' stage into a surprising number of variations. And, of course the performers were amazing.  Acrobats, dances, skaters, comedians, gymnasts, etc.  Above all this, there is some narrative, which is something I don't normally associate with Cirque Du Soleil.   There are some genuinely moving moments that deal with important moments in the lives of the Beatles, both as a band and as individuals.  There is a particularly heartbreaking moment involving John's Mom, which segue's into a moment about young John and young Julian Lennon at the same time.

Cirque does such a wonderful job of bringing the Beatles' music to life. They're able to complement and embellish beautiful lyrics with visuals that are equally as great.

What was I doing...oh yeah, writing a review. 

Being an avid Cirque-goer, I'm going to borrow from someone else's review to say that I was underwhelmed by the acrobatics. The sets and costumes were cool as always, although sometimes very cluttered and confused-looking. But there were very few noteworthy acts--the only two I remembered liking were the guys on skates and the dude trampolining around (I think during USSR?). And I was pissed at the lameness of ""Come Together."" If you are traversing long stretches of stage on foot in a Cirque show, you damn well had better be doing it via flips or cartwheels. DAFUQ? The choreography was meh. If they're going in the hip-hop direction they need to amp up their routines. Where's Mia Michaels when you need her?

It helps if you go into this without thinking of it as a cirque show, and instead as a multi-sensory Beatles concert sans the Fab Four. It's not like it was awful, but I left thinking I could've been at a Mystere show (two for the price of Love). My mom (the Beatles fan in the family) wasn't too impressed either (then again, she's not impressed by a lot of things...). 

I will give them credit though: I found out I don't dislike the Beatles as much as I do. And the dancified remixes of some of the songs sound pretty awesome (Glass Onion comes to mind).

The funny thing is that most of the people who give the show 5 stars are not Beatles fans!  If you're not a Beatles fan, maybe you've never really been exposed to the music before.  I am a big Cirque fan and a HUGE Beatles fan.  I can recite every lyric from every Beatles song as well as tell you what album and track any song is from.  I already know Beatles music is great.  Maybe that's why I was so disappointed by the show.

To me it just seemed like a bunch of people jumping up and down to the rhythm of Beatles music.  They were literally bouncing up and down on trampolines to Beatles songs.  There was too much of too little going on at the same time -- it all seemed a bit disorganized and schizophrenic (perhaps they were just trying to make the audience feel like they were on acid?).

When I walk away from a Cirque show, I usually grab my friends and say, ""Can you believe the guys who did X?""  ""Weren't the girls who did Y amazing?""  Cirque shows are supposed to be about acrobats pushing the envelope of what the human body can do.  It's hard for me to get excited about people bouncing up and down.

I can name 5 jaw-dropping feats from O.  I can name 5 eye-rubbing feats from Mystere.  I loved the Chinese Diabolo (yo-yo) girls from Quidam.  What do I remember about LOVE?  There was one cool thing that they did with a Transformer-like VW Bug, although there was nothing acrobatic about it.  They also ran a giant tarp over the entire audience that got sucked up by a vacuum cleaner or something -- interesting to watch, but I remember doing the same thing playing ""parachute"" in elementary school.

I don't like being the only person with bad things to say about this show, but there you have it.  The show is a good introduction to the music if you've never really been a Beatles fan, but I think if you're already a fan, the dancing is just a distraction.  Like I said, I am a big Cirque fan and a big Beatles fan, but I don't think the world needed a combination of the two...To me, it's kinda like the episode of 30 Rock where Tracy Morgan tried to combine video games and porn.",12,6,5

I got introduced to these shows not too long ago and ever since I watch my first ever show maybe 2 years ago, I'm hooked! I've been wanting to see The Beatles show for some time now so we decided to score some tickets on our last Vegas trip.

Upon walking into the theatre, I seriously loved the psychedelic runway into the entrance!! It was all very '70s! We got the lowest priced tickets were in the seating area c or d. They were only $70 so we didn't really care where we ended up seating. However, when we arrived inside, they moved us closer to the stage because they were some empty seats in the theatre! Score!

One thing I absolutely loved about the The Beatles show was the way the theatre is set up. The stage is right in the center and the seats are surrounded around the stage al wherever you're sitting you're going to get a good view. Even if you the balcony seats you're going to be able to see the stage pretty well. I actually recommend getting the seats a little bit further up bc sometimes the acrobat will be up in the air and you won't be able to see them sitting so close to the stage. 

The show itself was pretty good. They focus more on the songs and the themes of each song than they do for stunts and tricks. I admit the other Cirque shows had way more impressive stunts but I really enjoyed watching them perform to some of the old Beatles classics.

If you're a Beatles fan you're going go absolutely love this show. It does a good job on representing each song and doing justice by adding some creative and impressive choreography to each song.",3,0,2

While selecting which cirque show to attend, my first choice Ka was unfortunately dark on the chosen night. Damn. With my remaining options, I had it narrowed to Mystere and Love. I figured-you only live one-bite the bullet, pay the major ticket price, and go for the one with the music you know rocks.

This show was a feast for the eyes to be certain.  That said, it was also a visual clusterfuck.  Again, since I haven't been to a Cirque show before it is difficult to know if they're all like this, but it just didn't seem like there was the high quantity of high flying antics and acrobatics as those that I've seen on TV.  

Most of the aerialists were in harnesses and were more doing ballet than what I would typically associate with aerialists.  

That said, the athletic ability of the artists is undeniable.  Absolutely stunning dancers and displays of strength.  The dancing and choreography was inspired, however I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. 

Since I was expecting more cirus and less Twyla Tharp, I felt a little bit burned by the ticket price.  It was exactly twice what I've ever spent to see the best broadway productions with the most renound performers in the country and sometimes even in the world, and worked on by the most acclaimed choreographers.  

And really? I spend $140 and still get limited view seating?  The layout of the entire theater is in a way that no matter what, you will be in a position to miss some of the action that is happening. I'm glad I paid the extra 30 bucks, however painful it was, to get these seats though-because the limited view balcony seats looked awful and like you wouldn't see anythign at all.

The sound design and light design were amazing.  Very innovative use of stagecraft like I would have expected from a cirque show.  All in all very enjoyable performance once I adjusted to seeing more of a ballet than a high flying show.

Besides, have you ever wanted to know what it was like to have ADD? This show will help you with that. There is so much to look at on all different areas of the stage, so many colors and movements, it's difficult to focus on anything in particular.

Please note, this is not your typical Cirque show. The stunts, acrobatics, aerials are minimal. The focus here is the music, the costumes, the set, and a whole lot of dancing. If you want to know what songs will be played, check out the Wiki on ""Love, Beatles Album"" for the full list in order (I think).

I was not impressed with any of the few stunts and aerials that were performed. They didn't exactly ""wow"" me, but they did look like a blast to perform. The costumes are fun as heck and the set looks like the person had to go on an acid trip as a job requirement to come up with the things they did. In between some of the songs were some awkward voice recordings of the band, which really broke the flow of the show, if you ask me. Some didn't make sense. Maybe that was the point. 

Controversial: Yes, there was at least one or two characters at one point in the show dressed up as KKK members. Uncomfortable? Yes. But the decade these guys were writing music was jam-packed with racial tension and social unrest. I think part of the show's goal is to take a snapshot of that time period, show you what was going on, and in the drug-inspired music and performance, kind of pervert the whole thing to be one freaky trip. There's a point where a giant white tarp\/sheet is pulled over the audience. Dude, am I the only one who thought it alluded to a hotbox? I can't be. Because that's totally what it was, it was hilarious.

Overall, I'd recommend if you love the Beatles. If you don't, it's still worth going to if you get really discounted tickets. I used tix4tonight and got front row seats. I actually would not recommend sitting in the front because you don't get a full view of the stage. Luckily, a majority of the performance done on one side of the stage is mirrored on the other, but for one or two sets, you can't see everything. Honestly, sit somewhere in the middle or further back to get a great view. Even the last row of the place isn't that far, so don't rule it out if that's the option you're considering.",1,0,1

When the show started, I immediately got goose bumps. The Beatles music was so powerful and moving.. And listening to their awesome music at the Mirage theater while being beautifully and artistically interpreted by Cirque was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. 

The performers were all lovely and incredible to watch. Dancers\/Acrobats were coming from all sides and angles of the stage and it was all so amazing to see. The glitter, the life, the movements and all the props jived to make the show successful and enjoyable to watch for people from all walks of life. 

The whole show is perfection to me but my most favorite parts are the intro ""Because"", ""Something"", ""I am the Walrus"" and of course my all time fave ""While my guitar gently weeps."" Call me sappy, corny, crazy or whatever but I got all teary-eyed during the show and all I could think of was bringing my dad to the show. If there was one person in the world who would appreciate this show to its core, it's my Dad. The reason I learned ""While my guitar"" on the electric guitar and my love for music, I owe all to him. I guess I raved about the show so much that 5 months later, I found myself in the theater watching it for the second time, this time my Dad was there! =)

Third time I saw the show was just this last Sunday. My friend who shares the same love for music and The Beatles witnessed the amazing performance with me this time. The show had always been a lil pricey but my friend knew somebody who performs for the Cirque so he was able to hook us up with tickets for half the price! Woohoo!!

Would highly recommend this to anyone, and a must watch for people that feel all cirque shows seem the same after you've seen a couple.",0,0,0

I had seen one Cirque show previously, and even as a 10 year old I knew what I was experiencing was art at its finest. So when I heard there was a Cirque show that featured one of my favorite bands I jumped on the opportunity. 

At first I was a little apprehensive. Our seats were close enough to the stage, but there were scrims from the ceiling that appeared to be blocking our view. After the first downbeat however, these were raised, and I unwrapped a vibrant, lucious, masterpiece. 

I had to pick my jaw up from the floor multiple times. 

Everything was stunning. The remastered music, the visuals on the screens above, the speakers situated all around, and the sheer talent displayed. 

  If I called myself a Beatles fan before, I'm definitely more of a ""fanatic"" now after seeing LOVE. It's a theatrical feast.",0,0,3

I got last minute tickets for this show since it was New Year's day and not a lot of shows were available. I had wanted to check this show out and decided to see it. I got a good deal even though tickets did go fast for this show. The entrance is fantastic to see and it makes you feel like you are entering England during the BEATLES era. The people who worked there were in costume and the stage was beautiful. The show was breathtaking, the music they used to create their scenes were phenomenal. It's a feast for the ears and the eyes. The performers were sensational and this show left me wanting more and more. You may have to see it several times to take in the different scenes and small details you may have missed at first. 

Get there early before the show, so if you decide to get snacks and drinks for the show you get them in due time. The lines can get long at the snack place and you may have to wait a while. If you love the BEATLES or you are a Cirque fan this is a good show to watch.

Love love love love...

Doing my best to turn off my mind, relax, and float downstream, what I couldn't quite figure out was the purpose for the two white-robed KKK members part of the ""Benefit for Mr. Kite"" segment. I'd like to think they were just whirling dervishes with strange triangular shaped headdresses, but the burning cross on the side of the half-pipe used by the elaborate rollerblades (a mindlessly entertaining scene might I add) made my companion and I think otherwise. Another baffling scene was that of the step-dancing rain boots to the tune of another McCartney throw-a-way, ""Lady Madonna."" During this segment, a troop of African-Americans clobber their way through lyrics such as ""Lady Madonna children at your feet\/wonder how you manage to make ends meet\/who finds the money when you pay the rent?\/Did you think that money was heaven sent?"" while surrounding a pregnant lady. I was a caught off guard and to be honest, flat out offended that the director of Love assumed that a person in such a perilous financial situation as Lady Madonna would have to be African-American. It has been rumored that ""Blackbird"" is a song about the civil rights movement, encouraging it which makes me think that the scene was an attempt of the director to prove that the Beatles demolished all moral barriers and crossed the thresholds of repression, but if so, it was not very effective and possibly too abstract for a Vegas show that, no offense fellow yelpers, but the majority of reviews offer little on the context of the show, sticking more along the lines of ""I loved love and paid a lot to see it."" But then again, a later scene explores a war protest on trampolines, praising communism as a youngster holds a Warhol-esque picture of Mao while the notorious song ""Revolution"" blurts out ""Well you know, you better free your mind instead!"" Oh well, everyone great was always contradicting themselves. Later during the spectacle, during the mystical sounds of ""Here Comes the Sun"" a stereotypical Buddhist (well, eastern oriented) spiritual meditation occurs where raiders of the lost arc looking cirque members proceed into sun salutations looking up in wonder to the sky as candles burn in front of them. Really, I don't think George Harrison would have been too fond of the execution of his most revered track. I could have also done without the ""Octupus' Garden"" scene.

The intricate details of dream-like props such as a model train on a track carrying lit tea candles, tiny rubber boots on strings, cast-ironed framed Volkswagen bugs, Michelin man titanium pants, and fog-generating umbrellas it undeniable that the set ornamentation of Love is spectacular.  

A theatre teacher rammed home that a re-occurring theme is always something to be aware of and the most prevalent of these in Love was the lost young man with a bouquet of flowers the audience becomes acquainted with before the show even begins as he aimlessly walks through the crowd as they take their seats.  It is unclear whether he is searching for a particular recipient for his daisies and he is the most clown-like character on stage. For those who have seen it, I would love ideas as to what he symbolizes. 

During the standing-ovation that the circque du soleil ensemble receive at the end of the show, the artists point to the monitors where full-sized george, paul, ringo and john are displayed in life-like video. For some odd reason, the audience stops clapping at this point, which sings to me that the Beatles' music has been so thoroughly absorbed into our consciousness that what occurred on stage surpasses sound. That throughout the process of watching Love the audience becomes desensitized to who made the music or the fact that anyone made the music at all, theoretically the performers and the set are all that mattered during the full-fledged Vegas production that is the Love spectacle.",6,3,6

It is what you get when you combine the well known theatrical acrobatic of Cirque Du Soleil with pop culture that is Beatles music. The result? Mesmerizing performance that you see while tapping you feet in rhythm. It is entertaining. Especially with speakers in your own seat, making you feel engulfed in music. So this is how Beatles music sounds like with 21st century speakers, and gosh I want that seat in my house!

I like the stage settings in the middle of the podium and screens all around. Because of this, there are no real bad seats in this show. I was at the front row of balcony seats, which is in the cheapest tickets category and I still feel as part of the performance. In fact, I think I could see the lighting affects better from up there. 

Some comments though, I feel that Love doesn't have as impressive acrobatic stunts as Ka and Mystere, and some scenes have so much things going on, it's hard to grab the storyline. Despite of this, I enjoyed the whole show. The lighting effects are superb! I feel this is a must-see Cirque Du Soleil, even if you are not The Beatles die-hard fan. I rank it above Mystere and slightly below Ka, which is the best Cirque Du Soleil for me.

There are many ways to lose money in Vegas...Blackjack, Paigow, Craps...and unfortunately...LOVE. I've never felt so ripped off in my life! well, besides that time I ordered sea monkeys but I digress...

LOVE is basically like listening to a Beatles CD at home while watching Soul Train and flipping to the X-games during commercial breaks. Ugh! If you want to pay $100 bucks to do this, be my guest. But do not deceive others by saying this was a great show for the money. 

Trust me, I've seen every Cirque show in Vegas...spend the extra money to watch ""O"" or less to watch Mystere even. You will be amazed, entertained, and witness to true death defying acts...Most importantly, you'll feel that it was worth the price.

Yes it was different from other shows in the sense that the music isn't perform live, but then again, no one other than the Beatles could truly do their music justice.

If you have ever seen the show previous to February 2016, you would be in complete shock of the state of the show is in now. It is almost completely unrecognizable. The show has been redone for its 10th anniversary. It has been ""revamped"" with a new mix of music, change in acts, addition of a few characters, etc. 

The new show has bits and pieces of its former self, but the story is completely lost and hard to follow now. The popular Mr. Kite performance, is more politically charged and the high flying performance is forgettable and a shadow of its former self. The show is disjointed and doesn't flow smoothly. Worst of all, the show relies to heavily on dancing and the use of video technology. Don't get me wrong , they do a great job on some bits, but when you go to see a Cirque show, watching a TV screen shouldn't be your main focus.

The price is to steep for what once was a great show called Love. Sadly I can give you no more love in your current state. If you must go and see this show, under no circumstances should you pay full price, go to a discounted ticket site or Tix4tonight and save yourself some money.",4,0,2

I am a huge fan of cirque du soleil shows and I'm an even huger fan of the beatles. I've been dying to watch this show since forever. To put it into context, I have watched totem, zumanity, ka, and Zarkana and this show blows all of them out of the water!

This theater definitely has one of the nicest lobbies and I really recommend you take photos here before the show starts because it gets crazy packed. The theater itself is small and intimate, I highly recommend the areas that are right across from the screens because they really set the mood. Also, every chair has a built in speaker so the music you hear is crisp to perfection.

I was moved by every single act. From the moment I heard the iconic string strum in A hard day's night, I was hooked! I have to admit, being a huge beatles fan really helps because you can immerse yourself in the lyrics and the recognize the time period undertones. The show is very deep compared to the other shows and it tackles racism, the berlin wall, heart breaks, and world war 2. It's not the most acrobatic or jaw dropping show rather it's the most immersive show. 

In order to not reveal spoilers, some of my favorite acts were Lucy in the sky, black bird, Something and Hey Jude. This show is a visual and audio overload, so much going on the stage at a time!

The show itself lacks a bit of cohesiveness, and sometimes there's a bit too much happening on stage all at once. I know the show is probably meant to be a bit more on the abstract side, but some semblance of story progression would have been helpful. The transitions between acts is actually pretty seamless, but it's kinda hard to tell what's going on at times. Some of the segments were a little too long for my taste, which led to a bit of repetitive dancing. Also, there were a lot of acrobatics, but not quite as impressive as some of the other Cirque du Soleil shows that I've seen. Tip: you don't really have to go for the most expensive\/closest seats in the house. Each seating area probably is a different experience on its own, and it's not necessarily enhanced if you sit closer. We had seats right in the front, but I'm not sure the experience was any better than those sitting closer back.

That being said, the performance was very exciting, the decor and costumes were pretty well done, and I found myself enjoying the soundtrack, obviously. The overall choreography is very meticulous and they obviously don't recruit slouches as the performers. I thought it was pretty funny that some of the performers will steal your popcorn if you hold it out too far. They also ended the show with my favorite Beatles song, which I was waiting for them to play the entire show. They know how to end it right.

I saw it in 2009 during my pre-Yelping days and had the opportunity to see it again when my parents were in town. They asked which show to see and I had to choose this one. You get to sing along, dance in your seat and watch Cirque interpret the evolution of The Beatles and their songs. 

We ordered our seats and found they didn't offer a  Las Vegas 'locals' discount any longer (sad face). However, we still got a deal and sat in section 205 - row N - Seats 12-15 and were happy with our selection. I would recommend sitting in a similar section and not too close to the stage.  There is a lot going on at all times and being in the mid-section allows for you to see all angles. 

The costumes, the stage sets, the music, the performers are all awe inspiring!  They blend acrobatics and choreography seamlessly in their 90 min performance. There is so much to look at and watch during the show. The music is pulsing through the speakers in your seats and you're swept away into another place and time. It's awesome.

It's mainly just dancing, dancing, dancing... then a rope stunt. Repeat. With other Cirque shows, they make you sweat with how scary the stunts are. This one? It's like JV Cirque, nothing that puts you on the edge of your seat. Also, they keep doing variations of the same wire\/ropes stunts. You think it's great at first but after a while, it's, ""This AGAIN!?""

I will say that if you are a Beatles fan, you'll love it for that. A number of fans we're rocking out for sure. Just go in not thinking of it as a Cirque show and, instead, a Beatles show.",1,0,0

We're planning out our anniversary vacation around the night we see the show. We ordered the tickets a year in advance, I couldn't wait for this night to see The Beatles LOVE interpreted by the Cirque du Soleil performers.

We had dinner at Rao's located in the Caesar hotel. I told our waiter, don't chit chat just give me the bill dagnabit! Once we paid, we hightailed it out of the hotel. Crowds of people on the strip, slap card people, street performers, get out of my way! We finally get to the Mirage Hotel ticket booth with 10 minutes to spare. Now there's a line. My wife, CUTS the line and gets our tickets. That's my girl from Brooklyn. Heh heh...

We're seated and the show starts. The visuals. The soundtrack. The movie clips. The special effects. Are all mind blowing. We're both huge Beatles fans, this is a magical mystery tour for us.

*Spoiler I did raise an eyebrow with the large cross. 1966, John Lennon being English and not understanding us Yanks, said ""We're more popular than Jesus now"". Back then, people were losing their minds. Burning and breaking records, public opinions passed but The Beatles were shunned, mostly down south. The Cirque du Soleil performance had a dig on that and me just receiving a new cross of gold? I may have to slap a few folks. Out of Love of course!

This is my second Cirque du Soleil show, my first being at Disney (Of course) I HIGHLY recommend the show. It really was mind blowing. 

After the show my wife was on cloud 9! Filled with Beatles Love, she couldn't stop raving over the show. Once we got home, I had her to listen to a song she never heard called 'How Do You Sleep"" by John Lennon.

It seems, not every Beatle had love in their hearts. That's ok. Paul made Silly Love Songs and kinda stuck his nose at John",12,9,16

Although I am not a big Beatles fan, I do know a few of their songs which helped a bit.

OBSERVATIONS:
- Unlike most of the Cirque shows, they did not have entertainment as you are waiting for the show to begin.
- If you are watching the show from the third level, you probably aren't enjoying the show to its fullest.
- The show lasts for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Plan accordingly.

THE SHOW
- Overall, it was a good show.  Is it better than Mystere?  YES!!  (I fell asleep during that show, a first!)  Is it better than O?  NO!!!
- If you enjoy Beatles hits, then you will enjoy watching this show since it's sort of like a real life music video.  Not a whole lot of really crazy stunts since it's more of a theatrical interpretation of the music.  Think musical\/music video.
- The highlight of the show featured the roller blading act.  That is all that I am going to say so that I don't spoil it for Yelpers.  In addition, there were two instances where confetti\/streamers descended upon the crown.  One at the beginning for those in closer to the stage and at the very end.

A few Beatles numbers were staged really well and contributed a new visual poetry to my appreciation of the familiar songs. However too much of the show featured 30 or so performers with various props aimlessly moving about the stage for apparently no reason, as if  only to impress the audience with a large population filling the stage. During these times the show lacked focus and simply rambled along leaving me wondering how this early  70's style ""experimental theatre"" related at all to a tribute to the Beatles. Cirque has diluted its original concept by creating too many shows that do not live up to the vision of the original creators. 
Half-price tickets were easily purchased throughout Las Vegas, but even then I felt it was overpriced. There were many empty seats on a week night in mid-January.",0,0,0

I've seen many of the other Cirque shows and each of them has a different flavor that I've found great appreciation for. In this show, it start off very solemn, then out of no where it EXPLODES. People running around the middle, acrobats literally falling from the sky. They wanted to start this one off with a bang, and they do an amazing job of it.

Some of the characters take a little bit of knowledge regarding the time period Beatles music is set in as well as the historical events happening then. Beyond that, every song has something you can easily connect with.

The is one act which I still can't believe I saw. There is a guy on a platform at the top, and its rotating all the way round. He keeps doing these mid air jumps and staying on the platform without any wires. Crazy!

Whether you're a Beatles fan or not, this performance will amaze you and be a great highlight of your Vegas trip.

I'm not a huge Cirque expert- the only other show I've seen in person (read: not on Bravo) is Zumanity, which was AMAZING- but Love didn't feel very Cirque-y to me. Love is more of a spectacle than a circus, which is understandable given its inspiration, but there were a couple of performances within the show proper that I felt didn't quite gel. Still, there were more performances that left my jaw on the floor than made my forehead crinkle.

The sound is fantastic, and the reworkings of the songs will make you want to run out and buy the soundtrack and an overpriced $40 Beatles t-shirt... if you manage to worm your way into the store on the way out without being trampled to death by old men screaming that ""we're in America and I prefer to pass on the right!""

I've never seen anything like this before. I was stunned. Blown away. This is completely unique, and incredibly awesome. This was my first Cirque du Soleil show, and I was mesmerized! 
The show is put on in a circular theater, that has been built especially for the show. There are no bad seats in the house. We got our tickets comped to us by the Mirage, because we're such high rollers. When we arrived, they comped us an upgrade because I just seem to have that John Lennon quality to me. Peace. We ended up with incredible seats. 
The show blew me away. The performers were flawless, and the show was the most original, most brilliantly choreographed display that I've ever seen, hands down. 
I was incredibly surprised by the show. Going in, I thought that there'd be four dudes with mop top wigs lip syncing to the Beatles. Boy, was I wrong! It was all dancing, acrobatics, and amazing technical displays. 
The set changes were almost instantaneous. Every song was more amazing than the last. They took great creative license on how to interpret the songs, and how to express the mood and theme of the music. I learned a bit about who the Beatles were, and got to explore their music in ways that I never thought was possible. 
The dancers were all spot on, performing feats that I know took countless hours to perfect. I was beyond stunned with the way that they could throw dancers in the air, break dance, and bounce around like the laws of gravity had been momentarily repealed. 
I won't give away the show, but it was absolutely delightful. 
I highly recommend this performance. Even if you're not a Beatles fan, this show is completely beyond belief.",10,5,6

I agree with some of the reviews that there was a balance between dancing vs. acrobatics, but both were done very well. Some segments were perhaps a bit more mesmerizing, like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, but the whole show is very well choreographed. 

I'm not sure I followed the story very well - is there a story? - but there are definitely some moments that are beautifully portrayed, like Lennon's death.

The theater is in the round, which is a first for me with Cirque Du Soleil.  I've seen 4 of their other shows on the strip, and have never seen an ""in the round"" performance before...I thought it worked really well. 

This show seemed, to me anyway, to be much more dancing, and less acrobatics.  There were still plenty of acrobatic acts:  aerial\/tissue, rope climbing, trampolines, and these AMAZING roller blade tricks!!  It seemed to be more focused on dancing to the music though, and I liked it.  

I'm a huge Cirque du Soleil fan, so I knew that the quality of the performances would be second to none.  

Hats off to the performers, you all did an incredible job!

The theater staff was great too.  Everyone was very friendly, and cracked jokes with us.

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" & the act featuring ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

However, we weren't disappointed at all and both my husband as well as family agreed that this was the highlight of our trip. The stage is centered which is really nice. You can sit up close or far but still have an acceptable view. We bought our tickets at one of the discount ticket shops on the strip (approx. $100 per ticket), and as a rare treat, we sat front row. The view was spectacular and it was such a special experience to see the performers THAT close. While it was hard to focus your attention (since so many things were happening all at once), it was really cool once in awhile to see up-close all the performer's costumes and even makeup...you know a lot of hard work went into a production like this and it seriously paid off!

The theater is really small, and you really can see everything from anywhere in it, but if you're anything like me, you'll read ten reviews that say that and still wanna sit as close as possible, but really, it's a tiny theater. Probably why tickets are so much.

I will admit I didn't start really getting into the show until the ""Something"" sequence, which was very well choreographed, but about fifteen minutes in. My favorite, hands down, was the ""Tomorrow Never Knows\/Within You Without You"" sequence-- it was really surprising and such a cool effect, I would imagine, from both sides (we were above the effect).

Everybody loves the Beatles, and anyone who says they don't is just trying to be cool, but they're dumb. How can you not like this show?

The ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" sequence was also pretty crazy and unexpected!

Overall, I was very entertained. I don't know if I would be willing to pay to see the show again, but I really enjoyed it. I also really want that silver Beetle that's in the show.

Oh, some of the characters were kind of weird and unexplainable. The Father McKenzie character? WTF? The guy all in white that kept pouring tea? The KKK? Kinda freaky circus-y. I guess that's what makes it Cirque.

Still incredible performances. Five stars!",1,1,1

You're taken on a musical & theatrical journey throughout the various Beatles eras.. From their Liverpool days, to the Ed Sullivan Show, to the Psychedelic time of Peace & Love. 

The timeless yet catchy guitar riffs n' rhythms along with the blissful unison of John & Paul's vocals were a delight on the ears. Although they didn't play EVERY Beatles hit, they definitely covered enough ground to portray how much music the fab 4 tossed together and how much of an impact they had back then and today - all within the one hour and 45 minute show. 

I'm kind of in between era's as far as my taste for the group goes. I'm a fan of most the Beatles music, but I'd say I prefer the simplistic She Loves You \/ Hold Your Hand time frame. My first school dance was at a roller rink and ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" came on. My crush, Lauren, didn't have a partner.. The song blasted and expressed exactly what I was feeling at that moment.. so I rolled over on all 8 wheels and the rest was history. Our relationship IS history, but the song stuck with me and so did that era of The Beatles. So naturally when the song blasted.. I felt like I was on Ed Sullivan.. turning into a little 15 year old girl and started screaming at the top of my lungs.

They created a sound-of-light style show where the lights were of various colors and were coordinated to react to the music and those on stage. The auditorium is cylindrical with a circular stage directly in the middle. From what I can tell every seat in the building was decent and you really don't feel as if the performers are performing to one side of the room only. You truly FEEL the show with surround sound, gusts of air, floating props, flashy dancers on set busting moves as well as others on rafters above dancing and flying across the set. The performers were phenomenal; dressed from prim to rustic, posh to prissy, they definitely had the crowd groovin' and up and out of our seats on more than one occasion! I felt various emotional stages; from my palms sweating to goosebumps and moments of pure awe. There were instances where it felt like my brain waves and positive vibes were oozing out of me towards the entire audience I could literally see it happening. Chill out, it was all visual & SFX effects, of course, but my mind goes off into another world during performances as such.

Beginning to end I found myself cheering, singing, bobbing my head and clapping throughout each set. I left with a euphoric feeling and was in such a great mood that the partied continued on into the next day. It's worth checking out whether you're a Beatles fan or not!!",11,8,9

The acrobatics were minimal and it seemed like the focus was much more on drama and dancing: the only ""d"" words I hate more than the Denver Broncos and Dallas Cowboys!

The music was fantastic of course, with classic Beatles songs remixed by famed Beatles producer George Martin. Fortunately Phil Spector's garbage Wall of Sound abominations were not used. The seats were great from even our nosebleed section, but after seeing O and Mystere, I thought this show was a bit of a letdown from an entertainment and wow-factor perspective. Perhaps it is enough for other fans of the band, but at around 150 bucks a ticket, I could have built a time machine and boated back in time (my time machine is shaped like a powerboat) to physically see the Beatles in person at Shea Stadium (the only good thing to ever happen in that forsaken piece of garbage...but I digress) instead of paying for my wife, two kids, and me to go. Little Johnny has to go to community college now. Hope you're happy, Mr. du Soleil.

There is one part where an acrobat is swinging around on a gigantic swing that reminds me of my youth spent on the playground, only multiplied by about 50,000. That was by far the coolest moment. Outside of that, save your money and buy a nice porch swing and the deluxe stereo-mixed Beatles Box Set that came out a few years ago, you will have pretty much the same effect for less money. With the money you save, you could pay neighborhood kids to even push you a little bit to feel the breeze in your hair.",1,0,0

I'm a hardcore Beatles fan, and I was really excited to go to this show. I was not prepared to  experience this amount of awesomeness. The show is mostly done in the artistic kinda side; compared to a regular acrobatic cirque du soleil experience. I got chills every time I heard John, Paul, George and Ringo speak during the show and kinda transport us to the different musical eras they went through. The show is stunning, lots of hints about the war and what the Fab Four felt when they were writing their music. It was a nice interpretation to their songs.

It was totally RANDOM, man. Better vibe for like Pink Floyd or Queen. The opening number was GREAT, electrifying, cleverly live-concert like, and then things fell apart from there.

Hypocritically, I thought they could do MORE. The middle sagged, unlike the zero-percent-body-fat performers. And then the scene grew dark. There was a war in the middle for the love of Ringo!

The only memorable and new thing I saw was the trampoline bit.

Dare I say it? Could it be that Cirque du Soleil is overdone? Spread too thin? They only have a different show at every single casino. Could it be that, I know it's damn near un-American to say it, that Cirque du Soleil is totally played out at this point?

As a Cirque Du Soleil show, ""Love"" has the same major ""threads"" running through it as all other Cirque Du Soleil shows:  wonderfully imaginative set design and costuming, a couple of comic\/clown-ish characters, a couple of weird\/eccentric characters, acrobatics, feats of strength and flexibility and balance and bravery, etc.  However, ""Love"" is much more of a musical and much less of a ""circus"" show than the other Cirque Du Soleil shows.

The music and the sound is kick-ass:  there are supposedly 3 speakers in *EACH* of the 2000+ seats in the place!!!  The music was re-scored by George Martin and his son, Giles Martin.

We were there for one of the ""pre-opening"" shows, and at one point, one of the big curtains got stuck in its track in the middle of the stage, and there was much (quiet) frenzy fixing it, but the show went on almost without missing a beat.

As this may very well be a subjective matter, everyone can admit a few things that I will state do in fact shows that something is girly.  

-That something has lots of pretty and cute stuff, usually in the bright colored variety.  Pretty, pink anything is magnets girl's eyes.  Why do you think the entire Barbie universe is all pink?  I highly doubt an Emo-Barbie dressed in black with all kinds of pierces and hair over her face would sell.     

-There has to be a lot of singing and dancing involved.  Ever watched an episode of Glee?  I have, and it's not my cup of tea.  Glee is the perfect example of a ""girly"" television show.  

-Boy bands are most definitely ""girly"".  I thought they were a fad.  Since realizing little girls now idolize this band called One Direction (unless that's already past), I found out boy bands aren't extinct.  Back when I actually paid attention, it was New Kids on the Block (on their way out), Backstreet Boys, and N Sync that were the popular ones.  I admit...I did like some of those songs.  
  
This brings me to this Cirque du Soleil, Beatle's Love.  The show is an eclectic mixture of their songs with acrobats and dancers moving around all over the stage.  Dancing, oh yes, there was a lot of dancing.  Singing you ask?  Throughout the show, they bring you through series of historical backdrops played out by song.  Coloring of it all was magnificent, and yes, there were a lot of bright colors.  

As one of the most popular bands ever, they were arguably the best boy band ever.  Songs sung then are still very contemporary to the ear.  One big difference between this boy band and any after them is that they actually sang some songs with meaning.  It wasn't just about the lovey, dubey bull.  

Every seat in the theatre is a good seat.  The stage is right in your face and the performance is very intimate.  For hardcore Beatles fans, this is a must.  For casual fans the enticing visuals will pull you in.  Though I didn't recognize every song, as a music fan it was a head bobbing good time.  All the ""girly"" song and dance choreography gelled with the stage design wonderfully.  If saying I liked this Call me ""girly"" if you'd like, but the show was fulfilling.",11,9,11

The show was relatively short at about 1:30, but it was enjoyable nevertheless.  For me, this was more of a celebration of the music of the Beatles rather than the colorfully clad acrobats doing their act.  Several tracks were remixed and mashed up and as a fan of their music, I could say that I found them refreshing.

The vignettes about the Fab Four were absolutely cool.  I thought they could have used more of those and maybe stretch out the show to about 2 hours.

After 4 years of living in the city and seeing many cirque shows, I finally watched LOVE this past January. I've heard nothing but raving reviews and  was far from disappointed. 

To be honest, this show is very different from the typical cirque show. I'd compare it almost to a Beatles tribute concert with fun costumes and acrobatic acts that flow and balance well with The Beatles theme. 

Without giving too much away:
- HIGHLY recommend if you're a Beatles fan. You'll be singing along and loving every minute of it. Just the mood\/memories their songs may spark puts you in a great mood while watching the show 
- The entire show is entertaining from start to finish. There's some cirque shows I've seen where there's dull\/boring parts or some acts that aren't very thrilling - The Beatles isn't one of them 
- The stage is unique where it's actually located right in the middle of the theatre with seating all around it. You have a great view no matter where you are of the entire stage! 
- I stayed awake for the entire show (which I hate admitting but is difficult for me to do)

LOVE gets a 5\/5 for me. It really isn't your ordinary cirque show but I think that's also what gives it character and makes it so great. If you want to see the ultimate cirque show in Las Vegas (crazy acts, acrobatics, aquatic art, etc.) I'd recommend ""O"" at Bellagio.

My wife and I saw a Cirque du Soleil show a few years ago and I didn't like it at all. I hated the goofy, slapstick comedy and while I can admire the gymnasts' ability to do what they do, it wasn't my thing. I vowed 'never again'. But we got a deal on the tickets this time and I'm also a Beatles fan, so I figured if I hated the show I could at least enjoy the music. I ended up liking both.

For Beatles LOVE, the comedy and goofy shtick are downplayed and the performers play it straight. At the same time, the show doesn't take itself very seriously either, which is a good thing. I still have no idea what the show is about or if it even follows a narrative of any kind. It's a 90-minute mash-up of heavily re-mixed Beatles songs and acrobatics. Each sequence of the show seems to vaguely follow the mood of whatever piece of music it's set to. The performers aren't trying to provide a literal interpretation of the lyrics so much as they're just reacting to the mood or tone of the songs. For example, ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"" is a colourful song, filled with lots of theatrical and circus references so the performers act out a theatrical, circus-y routine.

If you would like to purchase something from the Beatles LOVE gift shop I HIGHLY recommend shopping there earlier in the day, before there is a performance going on. The store is mobbed with people immediately after the show and you'll be standing in line for a while. The store is not large and it will be quite irritating having to push your way through the crowd to view the merchandise.

The same goes for the photo ops. Everyone and their dog was waiting to get a picture of themselves beside the silhouettes of John, Paul, George, and Ringo between the theatre and the gift shop when the show was done. Guess how many people are there in the afternoon - none! Pick up your tickets at the box office early in the day (that's right - to avoid the line) and do your shopping and photos at that time. That way when you come see the show all you have to do is show up - then leave.",3,0,2

More 'cirque' and less 'du soleil' please.

By that I mean less choreography and more flips and crazy stuff.

This was my first ever Cirque du Soleil show and I was so stoked because I'm a HUGE Beatles fan. Not to give too much away, but the opening was mind blowingly amazing. But after that, the show sort of slowed down, with a few pick-me-ups in the middle (ie: rollerblading X-Games style to ""Revolution""). At some points during the show, I felt like I was watching a modern dance interpretation of the Beatles, which wasn't bad, but I was just expecting a lot more of a circus vibe with more acrobats and dangerous stunts. However, the soundtrack to the show was beautifully crafted, and you could definitely tell that the makers of the show really wanted to focus on commemorating the Beatles as a band. One of the ways they did this, and one of the things I most loved about LOVE, was that they incorporated a lot of the dialog between the band members that had been caught on tape.

Don't worry about where you sit, because really there isn't a bad seat in the house. I sat pretty far back, and there is a scene where the performance comes out to the audience and it was really cool to be able to see everything, plus the stage is round so there really isn't a ""front"" or ""back"". But what was up with the leg room?! I got way more leg room on my flight into Las Vegas than I did at the LOVE theatre. If you're sitting near or on the aisle, wait until everybody in your area has sat down before you because it gets really tight and annoying when people have to go in and out. I also recommend getting a drink or two before the show, try ""Hear Comes the Sun"" a sunny blend of rums and juices.

TIP: don't sing along during the show. We all get it, you're a Beatles fan and you know the words to the songs, that's why you're here watching the show, but so are the rest of the people sitting around you. I love ""Blackbird"" as much as you do, guy.

Great show, I can't wait to go back to see more Cirque du Soleil in Vegas!",4,3,0

It isn't that great of a Cirque show.  I suppose I may have just been disappointed since everyone we know who has seen the show has raved about it.  Plus the seats actually sucked - quite narrow and minimal legroom.

Of the 3 Cirque shows I've been to, this is the weakest in terms of set, acrobatics, etc... It's quite a different setup compared to the others where you're essentially seated around a stage (more like a stadium seating) rather than facing the front.  There's not really any bad seats, but you get the advantage of seeing the facial expressions and details better in the pricier seats.

If you're there for just the music and are a Beatles fan, you'll love it.  It's pretty catchy and entertaining but I thought it was pretty average for value.  I'm definitely glad we got these at 25% off.  I was much mroe impressed with Mystere and KA.",2,0,1

Firstly, all of the ushers\/workers\/staff are dressed in what I would call ""traditional"" clothing from the music period of the Beatles heyday in England.  An English touch is also present with a large scale replica of the Union Jack on the ceiling as well.  On your way to the theatre, guests will pass the LOVE store as well as a color changing wall with a composition\/pattern depicting the ""fab four"".

The theatre itself is a spectacle as well as a technical accomplishment that befits the typical Cirque show in Vegas.  Its 360 degree stage allows the audience to view the show from different perspectives depending on their seats.  

As far as the the show itself, it's definitely an achievement and triumph in showcasing the music and period of the Beatles with all of the acts, costumes, and enjoyment that Cirque Du Soleil is renowned for.  The costumes are colorful and dramatic, the cast is full of happiness and energy, and the music may just tempt you start clapping along or dance in your seat perhaps =)  

Although all of the acts\/performers in LOVE are up to the standards Cirque shows are known for, one of my favorite parts of the show involves some ""audience participation.""  I won't give anything away except to say that if you're seated in the front rows\/section, your ""participation"" will be needed at some point.  It was quite fun to say the least and was one of the more surprising and fun aspects of the show!!

They are completely different shows, of course. The focus of the show is obviously the Beatles and their music. The acrobatics are more limited (although there are still impressive things going on), and there's more dancing.

The word that kept popping in my mind while I was watching the performance was ""cacophony,"" although I mean it in a good way. The music is almost non-stop and is blasted at full volume. There's a regular--often constant--activity level. The artists use the whole asterisk-shaped stage--people are coming and going from all points while others are acting something in the center and a few more are swinging through the air. Meanwhile, some sort of stock footage is going by on the giant screens--you know, in case you needed more sensory input. Of course, there are a few songs where they try and give the performers and audience a break and slow it down (like ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and ""Here Comes the Sun""), but a lot of the show is loud and busy, with one song leading into the next.

The shape of the stage and the way the performers use it make it kind of delightful for the audience, especially if you're at the end of a row like I was, as you can see the performers coming and going (or coming down the steps past your seat, in one case). It's very ""in your face"" (unlike something like O, where it's all occurring on a distant stage in front of you).

If you like the Beatles (or are even just OK with them), I highly recommend seeing this. (If you hate the Beatles, STAY AWAY. It will be your own personal hell. :-)) With its energy level, I recommend not going when you're drunk or hungover. It'll be a lot to take in.",2,0,0

But the integration of music, dance, effects and acrobatics was extremely sophisticated. I especially loved the musical arrangements that incorporated original recordings and soundbites with respectful alterations.

People were singing along (yes, me too) and the audience was MOVED, more than I've ever witnessed during a live production.

Amazing. I think about the show quite a bit. I had the good fortune to get my hands on the soundtrack before the show, and boss and I listened too it a few times on our drive from LA. The efforts with the music alone are monumental. I loved this soundtrack!

The spectacle was impressive in its own right. Image after mind-blowing image keeps you constantly anticipating and anxious.

I'm a gigantic Beatles purist so I wasn't sure how I'd react to their music being reconfigured, but it was done in the best way. George Martin wouldn't let it come out any way but the best. I think Lennon would be thrilled with the musical styling, as he loved to hear his work augmented and distorted in ways that added dimension and new feeling. But I heard that even Paul loved it, so great job Sir Martin!

If you haven't thought of ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" in ages, this show is guaranteed to get it stuck in your head. It's the one with the sea gull-sounding distortions that you listened to repeatedly after school when you hated everyone and everything in junior high and sticking your head in between the speakers and turning the record up loud made it all go away for a while. Very inexpensive therapy for a kid! However, this show wasn't: we paid $250 each.

I was a bit hesitant on whether I wanted to watch it because I'm not a fan of the beatles, although I did grow up listening to their music (thanks to my brother, who is a lot older than I am), so I knew most of the songs, but even if you've never heard their songs, I think you'd enjoy the music, of course I may be wrong about that. :P  Also, I didn't know what to expect, I knew that it wouldn't be like the other cirque shows, and I'm glad that it wasn't.  Wasn't really looking forward to watching one of their regula acrobatic shows.  The show is more artsy, concentrating more on the beatles songs.  There was not a boring moment.  The only thing I found annoying was the layout of the show.  We sat in the 3rd row in section 103 and I thought it wasn't centered enough and was a bit too close.  The theater is quite small, so you don't really need to sit up front.  Also, I was lucky enough to get some sort of a student discount and they also have other promotions going on.

And to be completely honest there was a bit of a creep factor during what appeared to be a floating young girl's fantasy with a shirtless muscular dude. I thought it was me but my wife said the same thing when it was over. There was nothing overtly inappropriate, but the visual was off putting.

I think it is a different show than the others, which doesn't have as much of the acrobatics going on (although it does have a good amount), and spends about a third of its time with dancing.  In a certain way, that is to be expected, as it is a show reflecting interpretations of the Beatles music, and their music just makes you want to ...  dance!  

But, I certainly understand that this is not what we expect from the brand name of Cirque du Soleil, and there were times I wished it was more like O, which totally floored me when I saw it.  Besides for these two, I have not seen any other Cirque shows, so I don't have much else to compare.  

I think what we have to remember, though, is that The Beatles music, while eclectic in many ways, is quite common to our ears as compared to the strange and worldly music that fills the atmosphere of the other Cirque shows.  The majority of us going to go see this show are very familiar with what we are hearing.  They have spiced it up a bit with new mixes of the music, and with cool little interludes of interviews and dialogue from the Fab Four.  

All in all, I can't say that I am unhappy with Love, but I think it helps to know in going that it is a horse of a slightly different color than the other big Cirque shows on the strip.",0,0,0

But this show literally blew my mind away. I've been a huge fan of the Beatles since my early teenage years and the show reminded me of how much I love their music and their story. Even though many of the songs featured were their latest work, and I tend to prefer their earlier albums, the show brought out another dimension to the music that made me appreciate it more, see it in a more vibrant and colorful light. It told a multitude of mystical stories. I particularly loved the rendition of ""For the benefit of Mr. Kite"" - magically quirky and so much more kookily demented than I had ever pictured in my head, and of ""Help"" (one of my favorite songs ever) with the four skaters - absolutely unbelievable and crazily moving. I also loved how they used live audio and video footage from the Beatles themselves in addition to the ethereally superbe special effects.

The acrobats and dancers were incredibly skilled and the scenography of utter and unique beauty. I can't even begin to imagine how much work, effort, creativity and dedication went into bringing this show to life - just wow. 

In my eyes it was a true homage to The Beatles as a group, to John, Paul, George and Ringo not only as artists but as individuals, and to performance arts in general.

The theater stage is located in the center with the audience seats surrounding. My seats were located mid-way in the second section and I absolutely feel I had one of the best spots in the house, though really I think any seat would be a great seat. There are things going on in every corner and cranny of the room as a whole, that your eyes simply cannot keep up.

The fluidity of the performance is amazing, transitioning from one scene\/song to the next with almost little to no interruption. The artistic choreography and talented performers did such an incredible job orchestrating the impact, look, and feel of every Beatles song featured.

I had never been to a Cirque du Soleil show before, but I've been hearing about them for the past 10 years. I expected some sort of bizarre, trippy experience filled with crazy acrobatics. This one had a bit of that, but for the most part it was a whole lot of dancing. Great dancing, and great music (obviously), but it wasn't quite as wild as I had imagined. Others in our group, who had seen several of their shows, agreed that it wasn't their favorite.

That being said, it was still an awesome experience that was totally worth the money. The story line was confusing to say the least (there was one, right?), but I was told that the show featured lost tapes of the Beatles bantering between each other, which was awesome.

This is the second Cirque-like show I've seen.  The first was Le Reve (we lucked into free tickets).  I have since learned Le Reve wasn't a Cirque show, but it definitely is Cirque-like.  So while I wouldn't classify myself as an aficionado, I do have a basis for comparison.  As my rating indicates, the show was OK.  It was enjoyable.  It was fun.  But it wasn't great.

First, the athleticism I saw in Le Reve was mostly missing from this show.  There was some acrobatics, but not nearly as much as I expected.  And on several occasions the action was almost frenetic.  It was difficult to focus on the performances because there was too much going on.  Le Reve did not suffer this problem.

Second, the story wasn't as clear as Le Reve.  It seemed almost like a lot of random stunts and tricks without much purpose.  Le Reve I could see the story they were telling.  I know the story of Sgt Pepper, but it was still hard to follow the story in this show.

So, even though I am a huge Beatles fan, I would recommend Le Reve before I would recommend this show.  The story was easier to follow, the show was more visually interesting, and the acrobatics were more impressive.  Only the music was better in this show, but if you already have the CDs you can listen to the music at home.",1,0,0

There was a TON going on non-stop and such high energy and beautiful music. Lighting effects gave a tone that could change the feel in the room and the stage constantly morphed. It was a bit slow starting out but by the end, I didn't want the show to stop. I could not imagine if someone saw this on some psychedelics, it would probably be the worst or best experience of their lives.
Most of the Beatles hits were represented and a few semi-deep cuts. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was my favorite because they dropped a lot of LED lines throughout and they synced on some parts and were just made to look like stars other times. 
I could not recommend this more.",1,0,1

Beatles fans won't be disappointed, the song selection was well chosen and orchestrated. The mix meshes well with the performance.

This was by far the best show that we saw in Vegas. You'll catch yourself thinking about it for days afterwards.

My bf and I went to see them for his b-day.  It didn't start well initially because we got there late, and waited 5 minutes for an elevator that did not come.  Finally, disgusted, my bf decided that bum knee or not, he was going to hobble up the steps to the mezzanine where our seats were.

Once we got in, it was a great experience.  The seats were great (P4 and P5 in the Mirage)!  The stage was in the middle and the performers dashed into the center of the stage from the bottom or were transported there from the ceiling and dropped.

The show was much, much better than seen on PBS--much more energetic and spectacular. One grouse, some of the routines were a bit too mellow--I nodded off periodically during a few of those...

My other option was Donnie and Marie at the Flamingo or Jersey Boys at the Palazzo but I decided to stick with Beatles at the Mirage. I wasn't a huge Beatles fan but I just wanted him to enjoy himself and enjoy the scenery out on the Vegas strip besides the Pai Gow, Blackjack, and video slots.

The Love show is located inside the Mirage in the old Siegfried and Roy theater (1989 - 2003). The entrance had a 1960's psychedelic theme with the vibrant lights changing on the floor and ceiling makes you want to say the word ""groovey"". On the right side is the Beatles store where they can rake more money out of you but sadly it worked on me. :o

The showroom has 2 levels and the bottom part of the arena is the pricey and the upper level the more less expensive but the best section to watch the show is the middle section because you get a good view compared to the bottom and you get to be part of the show but not really part but I'll just shut my mouth now.

The seating attendants are all dressed in LOVE show uniforms and give you programs for the show, the stage rotates like any other Vegas show I've seen like, Ka at MGM, Mystere at Treasure Island, Mama Mia at Mandalay Bay (Which was a fantastic show but is now gone) are just some examples if you have seen these kind of shows. 

The Beatles songs flow with the rhythm of the performers and the different scenes in order to capture the meaning of the song such as love, sorrow, pain, freedom, happiness and hope. 

In the end of the show, surely I have become a Beatles fan and even bought their album in iTunes and my parents loved the show and I chose. Also I'm glad my Dad didn't fall asleep during the show because the last shows he watched in Vegas were Phantom of the Opera and Ka, so I got my moneys worth here. I found promotion online on the Mirage website for the LOVE show, 2 tickets for $100 and a student price for 35% off, so I called that day and booked it and even got all 3 of us altogether. =)

After the show ends, Revolution reps will be outside handling Love ticket holders with a, ""Ticket to Ride""  2 for 1 drink coupon for the REVOLUTION Lounge but it's only good from 8pm - 10pm. 

The show was so good I decided to watch it the 2nd time with 30% discount for hotel guests but sadly I missed the first 20 minutes of the show because I passed out on the seat. =\

That being said, this is really a series of set piece stunts done without much narrative linkage one after another to a Beatles soundtrack.  Really, any troupe of acrobats could do that.

It's not like Ka.  Only Cirque du Soleil could do Ka.  All the athleticism, stunts and choreography is integral to the narrative and the telling of the story.

I am not sure I can describe or put into words how wonderful this show was..

We were searching for a show to watch and were torn between the Le Reve and the Beatles Love show. After watching the commercials of both of the shows we decided on the Beatles Love show.  We searched on-line for discounted tickets and found a couple of sites. But ultimately decided to go to the box office and try to wheel and deal with them. As you might of heard Vegas has been suffering during this ""economic downturn"" (I hate that saying) but anyhow, the shows in Vegas have been having a hard time selling out. That's a good thing for us the audience. We were able to get ticket for 50% off. Score! 
 
Upon entry of the lobby you start the whole Beatles Love experience. The lobby has all kinds of colors and different surface types. Also they have a snack bar much like a movie theater. They sell popcorn, soda, candy and Cocktails! Yeah! They sell regular drinks with one shot for $14 dollar and with very little arm twisting these mega 32oz cocktails with 3 shots in them for $20..... 3 times the alcohol for 6 bucks more, No brainier.

When you enter the theater you notice a bunch of screens\/scrims all over the place . At first I was like darn, we might have had bad seats... Later I found out I was I wrong. We were in the most perfect seats possible. Middle section and middle of the row seats. It's a 360 stage with seats all around the stage. After patiently waiting for around 25 minutes the announcement started. ""Please no photos, blah blah blah... Here it goes, I thought let's do it! Show me the money!

From the moment the show started until the very last second I was completely entertained and wowed with the design, technical execution of the show. I think the designer and producers of this show should win some award in they haven't already. I have been involved  in the production and entertainment industry for years and I was simply amazed with how well the performers performed and how well the technical and production staff put on this show.

I don't want to give away any of the details of the show but the integration of the Beatles theme and music was done wonderfully and the storyline just flowed perfectly. I don't encourage any type of drug use nor do I use any but I can only imagine how trippy this show would be if you were under the influence. I was trippin and I was completely sober.

There have been very few times I have seen a performance that just blows me away..... The Beatles Love show did just that.... If you are in the neighborhood and or just undecided on a Vegas show You Must see this one!

I was lucky enough to get a floor seat a few rows away from the stage so I felt totally immersed in the action, with performance seemingly taking place from all sides of me, especially overhead.  The theater is set up such a way that I think you would have an awesome experience anywhere you sit, though.  The stage is in the middle with the seats surrounding it like an arena.

Beatles music melds seamlessly with audio clips from the news and pop culture, sound effects, and minimal character lines. 

Like all Cirque shows, the acrobatics and light spectacles are phenomenal. There are some really great set pieces, which I will not spoil, but let me tell you, you will be amazed.  It's the sort of show that, if you let it, will take you away to another place. The carefully placed music and lighting, along with the brilliant choreography paints a unique live action picture of the world according to the Beatles music. There seems to be an interesting story too if you pay attention, commenting on aspects of history, and pop culture from the time the music was produced.

Four roller-bladers to go up & down the ramp to ""Help."" Four gigantic balloons sporting their signature mop-top haircut. Four of everything to represent the four men whose talent provided the soundtrack to my parents' courtship & to my childhood.

Each song (many from the album ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"") comes alive with the acrobatics Cirque is known for mixed with modern dance moves (breakdancing, stepping, hip hop.) 

My favorite scenes are ""A Day in the Life"" with the break-apart VW Beetle & the Indian-inspired garb worn by FOUR women (suspended in air) in ""Here Comes the Sun.""

This show was just fantastic. The sound quality is amazing and THERE ARE NO BAD SEATS. Buy cheap seats safely, nothing much gained by moving up a level. It's a circular theater so you are in a good spot.

I just had to deduct a star for two reasons:

1) The concessions were atrocious. I can kind of accept that I'm getting ripped for $12 popcorn, but at least pop the kernels. I could pay $15 for a jack and coke, just pour it fair. We paid $60 for two drinks, a pretzel, and a popcorn. The pretzel was awful, the popcorn uncooked, and the drinks weak. You gotta meet me halfway. So maybe just eat\/drink first and avoid this.
2) The seats aren't comfortable. They are oddly small. If you're 6'0+ it's going to be tight. If you're bigger (I'm a L\/XL, around 6'1) and I had to basically cross my arms to stay off the seats beside me and I didn't even have room to cross my legs.

But I imagine if I ever did, it would feel like this show. I'll admit, I'm no Beatles fan but we've seen nearly all the Cirque Vegas shows and we convinced by a tour guide at 'O' that we must see this one even if we aren't Beatles fans. 

The GOOD:
I'm so torn because this show was fun because it was so interactive.  Very cool ways for the whole audience to participate a few times which was a very pleasant plus.  The music was cool, drinks were jumbo-sized.  Was lucky to sit not too far from the bathroom which is suggested if you're drinking a jumbo-sized margarita during the performance. The theater was large with most seats in the house giving good views.  We sat in a very front row which gave us extra leg room and a couple performers came right up to us. Way cool except this one dancer who was dancing directly in front of me, and I kept looking at her feet in my face thinking she really needed a pedicure if she's going to be performing in bare feet.  Ultimately, I think it'd be a little easier on the eyes & neck to sit at least 3-4 rows back. Ultimately nearly all seats should give nice views.  


The BAD:
On the other hand, it was very trippy and make me feel kinda high but not in a good way.  Like in a there is WAY too much going on and I'm getting a headache and nauseous.  Some of the performers were great, but not nearly as many as in other Cirques shows like O (my fave), Michael Jackson ONE (also my fave), Ka, and Mystere.  It was a lot of dancing and not as much thrilling acrobatic action I've seen in other shows. It's there, but not as much.

BOTTOM-LINE:  I'm glad I saw it but it's not my favorite Cirque show by far.  If you can only see one or two while in Vegas, you must choose Michael Jackson ONE and\/or 'O' at the Bellagio.  KEEP READING IF YOU DON'T MIND SPOILERS...

The TRIPPY:  (***SPOILER ALERT***)

The show opens with WAY TOO MUCH GOING ON.  Like a ton of people on stage dancing, not the best dancing either.  If you want to see great acrobatic dancing, it's not here, it's at Michael Jackson ONE cirque show.  There are kids in pajamas, a (faux) pregnant dancer, a bald guy who looks like Dr Evil and is pouring everyone invisible tea from his tea pot, sensory overload and not in a good way.  Later there's a scene with some dancers in KKK white hooded mask outfits, then it cuts to the song black bird, then you have this actor making sounds like Eddie Murphy when he did ""In the hot tub"" SNL skit and doing step moves like from a fraternity.

The performers are all in such top gymnast shape, the strength, the balance, the flexibility, it just puts all of my own yoga exercise efforts in modest perspective...

I have come to distinguish Cirque du Soleil from any ordinary circus act by the music and sound for which they have always been known for the great job that they do and this is no exception.  The venue has speakers built into the seating and the songs that we all recognize have been remixed and sounds just incredible...

But this is not just a collection of remixed Beatles songs choreographed with The Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, there were passages where you felt that the actual Beatles were there as some of their studio dialogs were also brought in with their silhouettes to give the performance some life and make it feel as if they were actually there...

Seats were good, but I think the best seats are in section 200 and 209, front center.
The stage is divided a little funny with curtains.

Instead it was more dancing and waving.

Just festive.

Saw this show with my SO early in the year and sat towards the back. I highly recommend higher seats as, with most Cirque shows, they utilize the full stage and surrounding areas. If you have a closer seat, the harder it is to see everything going on. 

Cirque doesn't disappoint with this show. I like it even more for all the metaphor and implicit symbolism they used throughout the story told.

I'm a semi fan of the Beatles but I'm not of the right generation to be Beatles crazy.  When I was born,  Lenon had already left us and the Beatles played on the Oldies stations my parents listened to.   That being said I didn't ""get"" all of the political and historical references that showed up during this show and I had to interview my parents to get a couple aspects.   I knew many of the songs and I loved that they were there, experienced a few lesser known to me songs but the show was also visually stunning,  had a great story and was full of excitement.  Not all the cirque acts make sense in every show I've seen but the story in Love is very well done.  I can't think of an act or dance that didn't fit the beautiful journey through their music and lives.  I loved the use of technology that actually ""brought the Beatles to the stage"" mixing them into their own story as told by dancers, costumes and acrobats.   

I know the surviving members and the families were very creatively involved and I believe it.  The show is uniquely Beatles and uniquely Cirque all at once which is a pretty amazing feat to bring those two together so beautifully. 

As much as I loved this show,  my parents loved it more because they were big fans back in the day.   So if you're a fan, it's a must see and if you aren't a fan (baring a hatred of the music or story) then it's still highly recommended. 

For seating - I don't think there is a bad seat in the house and wouldn't necessarily pay top price for tickets.

This theatre is in the round, everyone sitting around the stage. The theatre is small, any seat is really a good seat. The stage itself was really neat, it breaks down, opens up, and moves all around. The cast does a great job of using the entire stage and performing using the entire theatre. 

The show is SUPER colorful. The cast's costumes are over the top with colors and representative to the era in which they are depicting. The choreography is done very well and timed out perfectly. There is a lot of dancing and movement in this show. A little bit of acrobatic work as well.

if you dont love the beatles, you may not love the show. also, compared to other cirque du soleil shows, the acrobatics were a little more dance and visual-oriented instead of being intensely complicated daredevil acrobatics (compared to, for example, the show varekai) but it meshed perfectly with the music.

My favorite routines were during Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and Octopus' Garden.  I also liked the guy on the teeter totter\/swing thing - but that's the standard cirque ""OHMYGODHE'SGOING TODIEWHATISHEDOING"" type thing.  I loved that they included clips of the Beatles talking and being silly as they recorded.  The whole show was just fun.
Would I go see it again?  No, probably not.  Did I enjoy it and think it was a great show?  Yes, absolutely.
Also, when they make the announcement for you guys NOT to touch the sheet - seriously, don't touch it, what the hell?  If it's about to decapitate you, sure, lift it up and over your head, but there is no reason to hang on to the edges after you've been specifically asked not to.  What is this, kindergarten?",2,1,2

This show offers a little of everything!  First off, the theme itself is stellar!  The Beatles, c'mon.  That's already WINNING.  There's humor and lust all accompanied with a magical experience.  Cirque Du Soleil defies gravity and the physical logics of being human.  These acrobats are are top notch and really impressed me.  I haven't seen any other Cirque show yet but hope to see them now!

Going into this show, I must say that I was a little bias.  Unlike many of the reviewers, I'm a huge fan of The Beatles.  Blackbird, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Strawberry Fields Forever, I Wanna Hold your Hand, Octopus's Garden, Hey Jude and All You Need is Love are some of my personal favorite songs performed at Love.  My one favorite song, Let It Be, was NOT performed.  Sad face.  No worries, though, because overall, this show was ON POINT and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1,0,0

The music of the Beatles touches your soul and there is so much of a message in the songs for which the performers interpreted at their physical and production best in the 360 theater.  The props and suspensions heightened the magical feel of the interpretations with memorable songs of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and a Paul Mccartney song where a performer in a red-dress performed a sensual yet strong interpretation on a suspended swing.  Performances like this make me think that the world outside after the theater is flat.  Buy the CD after the show as it is memorable and the show is enjoyable for school aged children as well.",0,0,0

Beatles music + Cirque du Soleil = The Beatles Love

This is in a circular stage so there are really no bad seats, but if you are willing to pay a bit more, seats in the lower level close to the main stage will give you the best view of most of the actions.  If you can, get an aisle seat to get some up-close-and-personal views of some bonus actions and of course, be right next to some of the absolutely gorgeous and lovely performers.

The presentation is excellent and the storyline somewhat loosely corresponds to some major World events that took place in the Beatles era.  The show really doesn't highlight the Beatles legacy, but rather, how the World changed during their legacy.

The mood and pace swing often throughout the show - from upbeat and acrobatic to soft, mellow and romantic. From bright and cheerful to dark and sorrowful.

There are some truly beautiful scenes expressed not just in absolute beauty, but also combined with sheer strength and athleticism. (For example, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, among many other interludes).

There are also scenes that are fast-paced and acrobatic, but in a creative and refreshing way. (For example, Revolution).

However, to be fair, this show really lacks the jaw-dropping, thrilling and gravity-defying high-flying actions that are typical of a top tier Vegas show - Cirque-branded or not.

Nevertheless, this show is so much fun to watch and is so emotional, memorable and entertaining that, even though it doesn't have many bodies diving and flying in the air sans wire, and it doesn't make me bite my fingernails and pray for the performers' safety,  I still have to give it 5 stars.

And the best part is that you really don't need to be a Beatles fan to love the show.  But if you are, then you'll definitely fall in love with the show.  You'll fall completely in love.  Madly in love.  Hopelessly in love.

Endlessly in love.",33,25,29

I had never seen a Cirque performance before, so I can't comment on how this one compares to the others -- but on its own, it was quite an elaborate spectacle, infusing projected images with talented dancers, acrobats, skaters, and all sorts of props to provide creative, evocative, and sometimes provocative renditions to the Lovely songs.

We bought our tickets through the Mirage website, which provided for a 25% discount. While there is a such thing as awesome seats, there are also no bad seats per se because of all the projectile action. In fact, if you're higher up, you could get a nice glimpse of the bigger picture.

In order to get to the show entrance, you have to walk down this path that leads conveniently by the Beatles store.  There are a few photo opps with Beatles memorabilia backdrops.  The ushers are dressed in Sergeant Pepper costumes and are very willing to take a picture with you.

The stage is set in the center of the auditorium with seating 360 degrees around.  Like all Cirque shows, you will find performers appearing from everywhere above and below.  I wasn't totally in love with the show but maybe I didn't have the best seat.  I will say that the best part of the show was the music.

The show was a bombastic visual assault on the senses! The highlights were many, which included giant waves that flow into the crowd...it must be seen to be believed.  Eleanor Rigby is also pretty great as the characters are on stage in the flesh; Father McKenzie & Eleanor Rigby, etc...
