The reviews were very good, the restaurant was close and there was a good time available. As I was alone, I was given a small table close to the kitchen, which was understandable. However, I didn't really enjoy the constant parade of waiters brushing my shoulder every time they went by. Service from my waiter was a bit slow and he was indifferent. Whenever I try a new steakhouse, I normally order my favorite, tenderloin Oscar Style. To me this is a perfect way to see if a steakhouse is worth its' salt. With a name like Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab expectations were understandably high. I ordered it medium rare. When it came, it came with crab on top and sauce on the side, it looked like a beautiful piece of meat but was disappointed when I cut into the middle of it and it was RAW, as in the top 1\/4"" and bottom 1\/4"" were cooked properly but the middle 1"" looked blue. When I told my waiter that it was RAW in the middle, he started an argument with me by asking me ""I thought you ordered it medium rare?"", I said ""I did, but this is RAW in the middle."" ""So you don't want it medium rare?"" I said, ""That isn't medium rare."" ""You sure?"" as he made a big show of bending down and examining the steak and then giving a patronizing look. ""So you would like your steak cooked medium, then?"" I said ""Medium rare"" He eventually took my plate back to the kitchen and 20 min later came out with it again. The steak was now overcooked, the sides were cold, which means they didn't keep my plate warm, the crab was now off to the side and not on top and the b√©arnaise sauce was cold. I know I was a single table but I didn't deserve to be treated like crap. I'm sure most people get treated better than I but I cannot recommend this place to anybody. I've had much better food and service at the Charcoal Room at Palace Station and the Steakhouse at Circus Circus. Ceasers' deserves better.",0,0,0

We went for my husband's birthday and had a great time. Obviously their signature stone crab claws are excellent. For our entrees, I had the glazed black cod, based on the recommendation of other reviewers. I was not disappointed - it was excellent! Light, flaky, but with a little bit of sweet barbecued glaze. My husband had the steak and king crab, which was also very good. I might complain about the amount of king crab (it seemed like less than one leg), but we were so stuffed, we didn't even finish everything anyway. Our sides were the corn and creamed spinach. I would not normally have ordered corn, but this was quite good, and I loved the creamed spinach. He drank, I had club soda, and we shared a dessert.

Starting with the bread basket and ending with the desert, everything was excellent. The lobster was huge and the server cracks it open for you. The bone-in filet was awesome and I was not expecting a steak this good at a seafood place. The claws, tails, and crab legs were also top notch.

When I finally narrowed down where we would be going for my Birthday dinner, I easily made a reservation via OpenTable and requested a table in the back (got this info from other Yelp reviews) and said it was going to be my Birthday. 

We took a cab to Caesar's after getting a very late start to the day, did a little gambling and then walked through the Forum Shoppes to the restaurant. We were escorted to the Host Desk for the back of the restaurant and were seated in a large booth looking onto the rest of the back room. Everyone was friendly and worked together as a team seamlessly. 

Our waiter was very reserved while still having a nice sense of humor. I ordered a Cosmo which was perfectly balanced and with a perfect punch. The bread basket was yummy with lavash to devour and an assortment of breads. Our favorite was a cheese and shallot ciabatta. We started with a medium order of  the Stone Crabs (less sweet than Dungeness but more meaty and tender). It came with a mayo based dipping sauce, but I asked for cocktail sauce and they also brought clarified butter). The cocktail sauce was awesome and had a nice kick on  its own, but what was so cool is that there was a dollop of horseradish on the side like a garnish, but to allow each guest to make their cocktail sauce a spicy as they want it. It was something I had never seen before and quite memorable.

We shared a chopped salad which was kindly split in the kitchen. It was underdressed and one of the items we wished we hadn't ordered. For our mains, the Husband opted for the Beef Wellington (as rare as possible) and I ordered the bone in ribeye- medium rare. For sides to share, we opted for the GreenBeans ammadine (not almandine) and the special of AuGratin Potatoes. My steak was beautiful. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned and truthfully probably the best rib eye I have eaten in a restaurant of any caliber (and I have had many). The Wellington was too rare for me to taste, but the husband loved it and we really liked the green beans. The only ""miss"" here were the potatoes as they were pretty unremarkable and missing cheese and proper seasoning.

I had been looking forward to the key lime pie I had been reading about as my birthday dessert, so when the waiter brought out a very rich chocolate brownie sundae with a candle, I was a bit disappointed. I am a peasant when it comes to chocolate (I consider milk See's the fancy kind I like), this brownie was so rich even my husband could only muster a few bites. When our waiter came by, I inquired about a slice of the key lime pie, and he asked if I wanted a half slice (who knew they could do that?). I was glad I spoke up and my half slice arrived promptly and was the perfect way for me to end a rich and satisfying meal. 

Winner Winner Birthday Dinner and seriously look forward to coming back here someday.

Every menu item is excellent, but a few are worth mentioning.  The stone crabs are fantastic, WHEN IN SEASON.  When they aren't in season, they are frozen, and the decline in quality can't be overstated.  

On more than one occasion, we have skipped seafood and had burgers.  The burgers are highly recommend, particularly when you add blue cheese.  They don't always have mac n cheese, but when they do it's a very good representation of this dish.  The shrimp cocktail are huge and the sauce is fantastic.

I'd been promising to take my wife to get stone crab claws since we got married but we hadn't yet gotten to South Florida yet.  This was a fine substitute.  Both my wife and our daughter loved their first experience with stone crab.  The shrimp cocktail was also very good if pricey for four admittedly large shrimp.  Pass on the cocktail and get the shrimp de jonghe instead--it was excellent.  The sides were also very good especially the mashed potatoes and four cheese mac and cheese.  But be warned, they are all a la carte and run about 10 bucks each.  Enough to share though.  Sadly, the skirt steak prevents a 5 star review.  Underseasoned and just not up to the standards set by the rest of the meal. If course, that was mine and I recognize my mistake.  Skip the turf, stick with the surf and you should really enjoy Joe's. Bring your wallet, it ain't cheap but not out of line for the venue and the menu.  Finally, do not skip dessert.

Service is always professional and you feel special. So it is perfect for impressing people or making it a memorable special occasion, such as a birthday or anniversary.

My favorite is the Grilled Madagascar Shrimp, one shrimp is like a meal in itself.   Creamed Spinach is a good side, I prefer their Snow Crabs over Stone Crabs, but you will not be disappointed with either, because they are by far the freshest you ever had. I recall having to ask for drawn butter one time, which they happily provided, but not sure they forgot it or if I really had to ask for it. 

The wine menu is extensive and there is something for everyone. The somm(s) are great.  While most Somms will not recommend a Reds don't go with seafood, we started with a fruit forward California Red that is delicious on its own as an appetizer, while waiting for your crab and seafood,. Of course if you get steak or other meats then by all means  get it a red with the meal.  The wines by the glass are excellent.  I prefer sparkling with seafood since it goes well with just about everything, except super spicy.

Our service was a British lady who was very long winded with thorough stories and explanations of every item and especially the crab and different kinds of oysters. She was fun and polite.

Pros: Food was incredible. All the oysters were delicious, my first time having stone crab and it was succulent and amazing. Steaks were cooked absolutely perfectly and delicious. Sides were all fresh and plentiful. Creme Brule was outstanding. Not a single thing to complain about. Refills came quickly, ambiance was nice, service was top notch and what you'd expect from a fine dining establishment. Joe's has it's own Valet separate from the main Forum shops so make sure you find it and use it.

Everyone employed here are friendly and informative. I've been going to this restaurant the past ten years and I still see a lot of the staff still working here so people are obviously making good money and are taken care of. 

When I come here for lunch, I generally order the lump crab salad and get a side or the mustard sauce used when they serve the stone crab claws. When I order dinner I order a couple of their massive Madagascar shrimp, tomatoes with cheese and corn. Every now and then I will get the Alaskan king crab or stone crab claws but they are also known for their steaks.

Service (4\/5): We wanted to grab a nice meal before heading back home. Came across Joes and thought, ""why not"" since we didn't take the time to have a nice sit down meal in Vegas.

Food:
Crab Bisque (4.5): We ordered a cup of the bisque to try. It had good flavor just was slightly too salty. It was served in a small bowl with some kind of veggie medley garnish. 

Wedge Salad (5\/5): The wedge salad was as good as they get. It was large enough to share between 2-3 people. The crispy pork belly was a great alternative to regular bacon. The pork belly was cut into cubes so you get thick, squarish pieces. 

Seared Sea Scallops (2\/5): It comes with 4 scallops, decent size. It is plated on mashed cauliflower with bacon jam. We were definitely anticipating this dish after ordering it but unfortunately it was a disappointment. The scallops were a little bit overcooked so they were slightly tough. And they were extremely salty. Fortunately, our server took it off our bill. 

Stone Crab (4\/5): I would say this was good crab for crab being eaten cold. We ordered the medium size which came with about 7 claws. They were pre cracked and each claw was decent size. It was served with lemon and a side of a mustard like dipping sauce. My friend and I weren't a fan of the sauce.

Main reason was due to the combination of both a seafood grille and steak house! We made reservations through Open Table for 7:30 on a Thursday. And we arrived 30 minutes late, why you might ask?! Because the dam can driver dropped us off in front of Caesar's palace and Joe's is located on the other side in the mall! With extremely sore feet the staff at Joes had no problem seating our late party. 

After being seated our waiter advised of specials and what stone crabs they had available. Just like many steak houses, items are served al carte and you can order side dishes to share. I settled on a Caesar Salad, Crab Bisque, and the 1 lb. of Stone Crab claws served with the famous Joe's mustard dipping sauce. Three people in our party ordered the bone in ribeye, while the other two ordered Crab stuffed Sole and Filet Mignon. 

With glasses of vino in hand we all chatted while waiting for our food to arrive. To our surprise our wait was very short! Salads arrived 1st and shortly after all our food was being served! Caesar salad was tasty, I always love it when it's served with anchovy...adds a saltiness. My crab bisque was sweet and savory, lots of flavor but could have used a bit more crab on the top. Stone Crab stone crab... Where have you been all my life?! My brother in law and I dove in, though my belly was getting full I had to eat this sweet wonderful crab meat. The claws come cracked so after you pull a few shells away, the meat is exposed and dunk away in the mustard sauce. The sauce was tasty but I preferred the crab with a bit of lemon. The ribeye and filet eaters loved the sear on the cut and raved about not only the tenderness but also the perfect way each was cooked!

Service was wonderful. Our waiter knew his stuff and checked on us often. Lol he earned the mandatory 18% tip for our table of six! And Whoop Whoop, he brought us complimentary deserts to share since it was our 1st time!!! 

Joe's is simple; the menu was not huge and the items are simple but the preparation along with the service was stellar! We agreed the meal was worth the kick to our pocket books! Very glad I was able to dine at Joe's!",8,3,5

However, Joe's combines the best of both worlds. Made a reservation for a Monday night while attending a conference in Vegas.  The place was crowded.  Seating in the front (outside in the Forum shops), in the middle of the restaurant with the bar, and more intimate dining in the back.  

Ordered the Caesar salad to start - nothing fancy (which is a tad ironic considering the place is located in Caesars Palace.)  Since the stone crab is so famous, also ordered some to try.  Some roasted corn on the side was a recommendation from the waiter.  And for the main course, a dry-aged bone in rib eye steak.  

The stone crab was good - not as sweet as I had imagined.  Then again, being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I get spoiled by dungeness crab.  But good nevertheless.  The steak was fantastic!  Cooked perfectly.  Seasoned perfectly.   The bone-in adds so much flavor.  Superb quality.  And the corn was really delicious with a smoky, peppery flavor.    

To top off the meal, I had to try their key lime pie which someone had said they fly in from Florida.  Not having been to Florida and not sure if this rumor was true, this was still the best key lime pie I've ever tasted.

Would really love to come back to Joe's someday.  Great experience and excellent food.",0,0,0

First of all, I asked for a cranberry juice without ice and the drink came with ice.  Then my gf's coke and her sister's coke didn't come for 15 minutes.  What's up with that?

Now on to the food...

We ordered a few sides.  The cream corn was average and had way too many ingredients in it.  The hash browns were bland and over cooked.  We also ordered the green beens amandine which were good.  All of the sides you can order as half sides for $4.95 instead of $7.95 for a full order.  We had the wedge salad which was good.

For dinner we ordered the select 6 stone crabs, the surf and turf with filet and three stone crab legs.  The stone crab legs were very average and not very sweet.  I was suggested to order the 6 premium for $40 instead of the $30 for six medium.  Not a great suggestion at all.

We had the key lime pie and the havana cream pie.  The key lime pie came out too cold.  Get that thing to room temp first before presenting it to customers!

The stone crab is a must, it's sweet and well complimented by the mustard sauce.  Just watch for small bits of shell, that stuff hurts to bite down on!

The King crab legs which were enormous, and cut for you so you only need a fork for them.  Head and shoulders above the stuff you see on buffets.

Chilean Sea Bass was fork tender, excellently prepared.

Scallops are frickin awesome.  I've had both the Joes and the bacon wrapped, both are good but I prefer the Joes since scallops are easily overpowered by something as flavorful as bacon.  Portions on these are generous, one of the better deals on the menu.

Make reservations so you don't have to wait long to get seated. I made reservations and though I was about 10 mins late, we were still seated right away. Be sure to use the Valet Parking where the Forum shop is near Las Vegas Blvd. Easier to navigate right to Joe's. 

First came the free bread. None are the same and you get 5 different types to try. In my opinion, all were great. The one with sesame I liked the most. We started with a half dozen order of oysters and though the oysters were good, I've had better. We then ordered 7 Stone Crab claws to split with my wife. Great part about this is that they come cracked already and I definitely recommend getting it. Great tasting and fresh, you can't go wrong with this.  For the main, I got their Bone-In Filet Mignon. Priced around $55, this is definitely worth it. Nice huge sized filet mignon that's cooked perfectly and they give you additional steak seasoning on the side if you need it. Bad thing is that the $55 doesn't come with any sides which I don't think any of those do. You will have to order their sides separately. Good thing is that it's a large portion so it isn't too bad if you're sharing. I recommend ordering the mashed potatoes. One of the best I've had and yet it was so good and great serving, we couldn't finish it. Place is a bit expensive but it's worth the price. Service could be a bit better but wasn't too bad.

DEF RECOMMEND the outside seating- since this location is on the bottom floor of the Entrance off the strip in the Cesars palace- and from the outside seating you get the tourist people watching attraction (strippers, escorts, bridal parties, girls going out in super short dresses) 
The best is when sitting outside and the escalator is right there: when a girl in a super short skirt\/dress walks by: all I did was watch all the guys try to get a peep. My back was faced toward the gotti shop next door and I knew every time when a girl in a short dress would walk by because every man (husbands and groups of guys) would stop what they were doing to stare at this girl going up the escalator. Super hilarious. 
Anyways onto the food: 

APPETIZERS
*** Assortment of Breads: What seemed like Pumpernickle, a lavosh- 2 kinds- a sesame seed one and another amber colored one (both were delicious), white bread rolls- all served with BIG CHUNKS OF Cold butter- recommendation- Ask for HOT drawn butter and dip your bread into that
*** THE Whale (SEAFOOD PLATTER- served cold)- Market value
- 4 legs of NON FROZEN Alaskan King Crab
-Avacado chunks\/mini scallops\/small chunks of Shrimp, red and yellow bell pepper with lime juice ceviche
-2 lobster tails cut into 4 pieces served cold
-jumbo shrimp cocktail
------The Whale comes highly recommended as per our waiter, the seafood on this platter is never Frozen. 


DINNER
1)green salads: very large portions with a light vinagrette
2)select stone crab (6 pieces): not recommended- yet it comes pre cracked and easy to eat but you can tell it is frozen. The meat on the inside was hearty but still lightly frozen and it just wasnt as sweet as the alaskan King crab legs
3) side of creamed spinach ($8.95)- NOT RECOMMENDED- tasted almost like it went bad- like sour milk- barely ate it and almost returned it
4) Filet mignon- 12 oz- $47.95- cooked rare plus- very tiny for the price
5) Filet and tail- ( 6ox Filet and 10z Atlantic Fire Grilled Lobster tail served with Drawn butter
-Very small lobster tail after its been fire grilled and truthfully much better served cold in the whale platter

DESSERT
1)Key Lime Pie- their most recommended dessert
-super super high quality lime taste, very tangy and refreshing with grahm cracker crust. Very buttery and delicious
2) Coconut Cream Pie- very sweet, creamy filling with whipped cream and shreads of dried coconut- not as good as the Key Lime Pie


Overall, the quality of food was EXCELLENT- Our server Steven was very high class and polite and prompt. He even saw that we were struggling with the dessert but knew we wanted some so he brought out the Key Lime Pie at No Charge. 
Although the service and quality of food was excellent- the price point was super high- Dinner for the 4 of us was close to 500$.

Quite overrated for what it is, a mall restaurant in an upscale mall. I'm not big into Stone Crab to begin with, but it was OK... They pre cracked them well so that was a plus (not too many shell injuries), but the mustardy-sauce for dipping was bland and tasted like Hellman's Dijonaise. There's not a ton of meat on the stone crab claw, and i personally don't see what all the hype is about. 

Perhaps it stems from the fact that when stone crabs are harvested, they just rip their arm off and throw it back to live on in the sea and re-generate another one in time. I suppose that makes it less cruel (Though I don't agree, sounds like virtual hell to me).

I didn't eat the steak though the fillet looked decent. I got Crab cakes and they were mediocre at best.

Biggest disappointment, when eating a $300 dinner for 3 (with a mediocre 4X markup wine), I don't like sitting at high-rise bar tables, even if they are disguised with a white table cloth and a napkin ring. 

If you need Stone Crab, try Del Frisco's instead! It's not a far cab-ride from Caesars, and the stone crab (which is not their specialty) comes with a WAY better version of the mustard sauce. Plus it's way classier for your money and not much if at all pricier.",1,1,0

Our server Leeann was the absolute best and happily assisted my husband, since I abdicated complete menu selection to him. (There were simply too many good choices and I was not up to decision making!). 

She was so very friendly and helpful that I knew we would have fun, but the whole evening was one of the nicest nights out we have ever had. Eddie who was assisting Leeann was also personable and it seems like he company treats staff well, since many of them have been there for years. The diamond studded crab on Eddie's jacket marked ten years of great service. We even asked to speak to the general manager, Danny who was also very pleasant and took time to listen to our rave reviews.  Hats of to this place for excellent staff!

Now, about the food...DELICIOUS.  Started with a prosciutto and melon appetizer. It was a variety of four melons, my favorite of which was the Santa Claus melon, with thinly sliced prosciutto. There were also a variety of olives (no pits!) drizzled with some EVOO and red pepper flakes.

Next came the Stone Crab and Kings Crab plates.  Ungodly good. I loved that they were perfectly prepared but the way they serve them means you can still be dressed up and not have to worry about making a mess.   The crab was sweet and delicious.

Final dish was a New York strip served with a side of fried green tomatoes. Although I was close to full, the fact that we shared everything made it okay to have some of each.  Steak came out perfectly cooked to a beautiful medium rare and was seasoned just right. Fried tomatoes were awesome and barely needed a dip in the dressing. 

A last surprise was a birthday treat, a warm gluten free brownie topped with vanilla ice cream. Leeann told me it was mandatory that you have at least a bite for birthday luck, so I had to taste it for her.  Never had anything gluten free taste that good.

If you are in Vegas, I highly recommend this place. Even though I would suggest asking for Leann and Eddie, I have a sneaking suspicion that given what I learned about the restaurant, other staff might be okay too!

Walked up at 7pm and it was a 2 hour wait for the ""restaurant"" section, and was advised to try the ""bar\/casual"" area.... where we were sat immediately.
Same menu... Same food....No wait.

Happy to see that you can get a sandwich or salad... not just steak or crab.
And... they had steaks starting at $25.... which on the strip is pretty hard to do at a nice restaurant.  So, this was a happy surprise.  

Started with Bread... good bread too.  :)

Then we tarted with stone crab as an appetizer.  I was surprised at how sweet these were.  They serve it with a cream dipping sauce which is totally not needed as the crab is good on its own.

I had Bacon wrapped Scallops for dinner.  Something about bacon and scallops.... a great combo.  The scallops were tender and grilled nicely.

The husband had the special Stripe Bass which was moist and flavorful, and topped with yummy mushrooms.

Our friends each had a steak cooked perfectly to their order.  They looked really good and they both said they were really good.

For sides, we got the Mac n Cheese, Potatoes Lyonnaisse, Mashed Potatoes, Broccolini.
The Mac n Cheese was more creamy than cheesy.
I like the Potatoes Lyonnaisse better than the Mashed.... the Lyon one came with carmelized onions on top of cubed, hash brown like potatoes.
Broccolini was nice and crunchy which is how I like my veggies so this was perfect for me.

Service was good... our water glasses were refilled regularly.
Sitting in the bar area was nice since you got to people watch or watch a game on one of their TVs.

For 4 people... plus a bottle of wine, our total before tip was $295.  In Vegas, on the strip... for a nice steak\/seafood dinner..to me that is reasonable.  I may be jaded but I like to eat out and try different places so I'm glad we went here.

We were walking the shoppes at Cesar's and had seen this before. I was jonesin' for some steak (when am I not?!). The dining area looked full and we didn't have reservations. We thought we'd have to wait a while, which was no problem. We got seated right away. The seating is divided into 3 sections ( the faux patio, bar area, and main dining area). We sat in the bar area which I actually preferred. 

We each ordered a ribeye with creamed spinach and lyonnaise potatoes. 
The steak was the best I've had so far! It was like I was eating addiction! No joke! I've had steak from Ruth's, Morton, Smith and...., and numerous other places. This was numero uno! They also provided a tiny tin of their house seasoning salt. I'd forget about the high blood pressure anytime they'd bring this out.! It made the steak that much better! Just be conservative with it. What else looked amazing was the plate of stone crab the couple next to us ordered! I thought they'd taken those claws off some monster in a Godzilla movie. That's on the realz, homie. 

Our server was always on point. Like she was a Pre-Cog from Minority Report. 

I'm in Vegas several times a year, so best believe that if I'm in town and I'm craving a steak, I'm bustin' in on Joe's. Word is bond.",3,1,3

I used opentable both times and this time the host - four years later - was super friendly with the welcome back greetings and gave us a great table.  The waitstaff are fabulous and very professional and friendly without being overbearing.  I ordered the filet Oscar and my boyfriend ordered the grilled seafood platter.  The steak was a perfect medium rare and came with huge chunks of delicious crab and asparagus.  I was asked if I wanted the bernaise drizzled over everything which I thought was nice and of course I did!  My boyfriend loved his seafood as well and the scallops were impeccable.

It gave us a reason to dress nice and enjoy the evening without all the usual chaos that comes with a Vegas weekend. I requested a nice quiet table\/booth and that's what we got. I have to thank Sarina V, Samantha L and other Yelpers that have reviewed Joe's because their reviews gave me really good insight on what to order and what to expect. And one of the better tips is to valet at the Forum Shops right outside Joe's doors. Thankfully I was familiar with this valet as I always use it when i'm in town. Shortest walk. Ever.

Bread basket has a great variety ranging from cheese bread to sourdough and a cheese cracker. Butter isnt even needed but provided. The service was excellent. Our waiter Patrick was very helpful and informative. He helped steer us in ordering the makings of a great dinner. Your water will be refilled if you take 2 sips, literally. They are on it like no one's business. We had the 1\/2 dozen kumamotos ($16.95), choice selection of stone crab (6 pieces; $49.95), I had the 24oz bone-in rib eye and she had the chilean sea bass in a miso glaze ($42.95). Ours sides during the main course were crispy onion strings ($8.95) and asparagus ($10.95). 

The stone crab was delicious. I have been wanting to try it for a long time now. Thank you to the 305 for this delicacy. So much crab meat in that stone crab claw. It's one of the wonders of the world. Squeeze some lemon and dip in their mustard\/mayo sauce. Or not... It's great either way. The kumamoto oysters were just ok. I was expecting them to be better. I would pass on them the next time. My 24 oz bone-in usda prime rib eye ($59.95) was delicious. It had so much flavor and just the right amount of fat. I ordered mine medium and it was perfect. They offer their own steak seasoning and they sure are right that a little goes a long way. It packs a lot of flavor. But it really didnt need it. The rib eye stood out on its own. It was so good. My mouth waters at the thought.

The chilean sea bass was delicious. I had a few bites of it. Great flavor. I loved the miso glaze. I recommend it. It comes with bok choy. And the sides we got were also very good. The fried onion strings and asparagus were a great compliment to our main courses.

A great dinner. Excellent service. Outstanding seafood and steak. Make sure you reserve a table in advance. And please... PLEASE. Dont be that guy in shorts and flip flops. He looked out of place and plain wrong. My opinion. It's not black tie but it's a nice dinner place. Give it the respect it deserves.

Thank you Joe's! Loved it. Will be back for sure, next time we're in town.",2,0,1

now the 3stars-the service. usually the staff is amazing.  from the ma√Ætre d' , to the reservation desk to the waiters, everyone is usually great. this last visit; however, not so hot. our waiter seemed very rushed - he practically flung silverware at us, forgot drinks,  sloshed drinks and sauces to the point that we were worried it would end up on us, and the killer: one of our friends wasn't too happy with her steak and asked that it be sent back for additional grill time. (the sucker was BLOODY!) yes, she sent it back twice, but for the price we were paying, the waiter mightve exercised the ""customer is always right"" policy rather than rudeness. now she's never going back and ill have to think twice.

I have been to Joe's numerous times, special dates, birthdays, girls day out, or just to have some really tasty food! 

Food pros: The food is delicious, fresh, perfectly prepared, hot, and filled with flavor every time! I love going during lunch for their specials. Entree, two sides and dessert! What more could you ask for? I am OBSESSED with their roasted corn side dish. It is my favorite thing on the menu. I have to have it every time I go. The lyonnaise potatoes are also at the top of my list for sides. Crispy hot potatoes with sweet savory caramelized onions on the bottom, yummmmyy!! Their crab legs are always amazing and fresh. I appreciate them being cut already. The dipping sauce is tasty and a perfect compliment. Their filet mignon is bursting with true beef flavor and always a perfect medium rare. They have the best bread bowl. The pretzel bread is my fave. I know they have a huge menu, but I always come back for the same amazing dishes every time. 

Food cons: None! 

Service: The service is beyond impeccable each and every time! I don't know if they have a special training just for their servers but you can't find better service anywhere. I wish I could remember his name, possibly matt or mark. But he was the best server I've had in my dining experiences at any restaurant. Fast but not too fast, attentive but not overbearing, professional but fun, and extremely accommodating. My mom and I love the pretzel bread in the bread bowl. We asked if we could have more. So he brought back another bread bowl filled with just pretzel bread! Plus a yummy mustard sauce. 

I will continue to dine at Joe's as long as I live in Las Vegas. It will be the first place I recommend to friends in town and the first place I take anyone for a delicious meal.

I've dined here many times, and I love it, all I really order are the stone crabs and mashed potatoes. The stone crab is moist and juicy and oOoOo so yummy! 

Service, they treat you like royalty. Attentive, they have back servers so if your server is no where around they are able to assist you. It's fine dining, it's great. Our favorite server is the one they call 'Grandma'.

The reason for the 4-Star knockoff: 
On February 25, 2006 (yes I remember the date, you'll see why) we went out to eat, because we, my (now) husband and I, had become engaged just before heading over to Joe's and we had a reservation, it was a saturday, in the winter time, it wasn't busy. The ""outdoor"" seating area was practically empty and the indoor seating area wasn't busy as well. 

Here's what ticked me off... I walk up to the hostess counter, the guy behind the counter, the one with the green bow tie, has been working there, for, FOREVER. He doesn't know who we are, since we only go to this restaurant for special occasions, as this was... Anyway, we tell him that we had a reservation for a party of 3; myself, my (now) husband and my (then 9 y\/o) son. The guy writes something down and tells us that ""It'll be a 10 minute wait"". Well, we were there for 34 minutes, yes I counted! There were people that were coming in, after us, that were being seated and we had been waiting there! I assumed that they all had reservations but when one of the people that were seated ahead of us, another party of 3, walked past me to use the restroom, I asked if they had a reservation and they said ""no"". I was FURIOUS, WTF, I just got engaged, I was so happy, way to tick me off!!! I don't know what it was, but my (now) husband at the time tried to calm me down but I used to be in the restaurant industry, I have never done this to anyone, why the hell would they?! They're a fine dining establishment?! I did not understand this crap.

I don't know what it was, could it have been that we had a child with us? (BTW, there were other children dining there, I tried to find some logical reason for this crap) Was is a racist thing? Heck if I know, it doesn't matter what it was, it was WRONG and the end result: because of that, even IF I love their food, they get a 1-Star rating. This situation really upset me, I cringe every time we go there and I see that DB.

Needless to say, this particular night, we ate at another restaurant and it goes to show, bad service can leave a bad impression that can last for YEARS.",4,1,0

It's also the only, however, so I should clarify that by saying it was very very good, even if it was a poor example of what a lobster bisque should be. 

The wife had fish tacos, which she devoured so I will assume that means they were delicious. I had the fish and chips, which was absolutely excellent. I've had plenty of fish and chips in my life so I've got some frame of reference here. Very very good.

The absolute crown jewel dish of the night wasn't even a dish at all. It was the tartar sauce that came with the fish and chips. The tartar sauce was without a doubt, far and away, bar none, the best I have ever had. Without question. Absolutely and incredibly delicious.

The sides we ordered were also very good, the fries and potatoes we got were cooked well and tasted fresh. My only issue was the asparagus. The asparagus itself was good but came out covered in tomatoes which was NOT good at all. This was because of my personal bias against tomatoes in most things.

Ambiance 5\/5
This place is inside the forum shop at Caesars, the place looks nice, really upscale and great vibe.

Service 5\/5
Top notch and professional. We didn't have a reservation, but they were fine with us, we were seated pretty quick with a party of 9 of us. 

Food 5\/5
If you come here, you MUST order the stone crab. The crab comes chilled, when you crack it open the texture is solid and when dipped into the mustard sauce that it comes with, the crab just flat out tastes delicious. I ordered the fried seafood platter that had an assortment of different seafoods like mussel, clams, scallop, fish, shrimp, it was pretty good, the batter was great. Also had the steak cooked medium rare, and that thing was really really really good, cuts nicely, perfectly cooked, melts in your mouth. You know how people say the best tasting steaks are the ones that don't need sauce, this is that kind of steak

15\/15....too good. I will be sure to make a trip to this place when I go to Vegas, if you are in town at Vegas, get up in here",1,0,0

This most recent visit at Caesars did not live up to this establishment's reputation for one reason and one reason alone: the stone crab claws were sub-par mostly because these bad boys are not in season and what was served was probably of the frozen variety which just does not live up to the billing. I would have expected the server to at least have reminded us that this was an off season item so I could take that into account in selecting my entree. Everything else was as good as it always is.,0,0,0

We begin the dinner with an appetizer of stone crabs.  If you have never eaten stone crabs before...think crab with a hint of sweetness.  The stone crabs are cracked, so you just have to peel away with ease and enjoy.  For our main entrees husband and I are all business and get steaks.  Please note that all menu items are a la carte, so any kind of side must be ordered seperately.  My husband opts for the ribeye cooked medium, and I get the filet mignon (also cooked medium).  I took one bite of my steak, closed my eyes, and I swear the restaurant went quiet. It was one of those moments. For our sides we share a serving of mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach with garlic.  Both were very delicious and complimented the steak really well.  Lastly for dessert we were unsure of what to choose from because they had such a long list of pies.  Our waiter Ben suggested we share a slice of banana creme pie with fosters sauce (apparently his favorite).  Ben..if you are reading this review...you are a genius!

The ribeye was cooked a perfect medium rare and came with a flavorful house seasoning blend that we sprinkled on top of our steak.  The seasoning really made the steak stand out. 

Our waiter recommended the roasted corn. I was skeptical about how good a side of corn could really be, but  our waiter was right! It was delish! The roasting really brought a wonderful smoky flavor to the corn. It was topped with clarified butter, cilantro, and a fresh squeeze of lime. 

 This was our first time eating stone crab, but hopefully it won't be our last! The stone crab was served cold which was a little bit uexpected but no less delicious. They cracked the claws before bringing them to table. The meat came out relatively easily, but we still had a few very hard slivers of shell that we unfortunately  ended up chomping down on.   The meat itself was succulant and slightly sweet. We would have been fine with eating the meat without any accompanyment but Joe's serves their crab with a very tasty mild mustard dipping sauce and fresh lemon.

Overall, I would say people at this place know how to make steaks.  If you ever come here, don't bring your vegetarian friends , and if you're vegetarian , you can cheat for one night.

It offers that ridiculously high end and casual all in one. They have a back room for that fine dining experience in the Forum and the outside and bar area for a more casual fling. 

I usually don't go to the high scale restaurants on the strip, but I happened to have a discount and decided to splurge. I went with a few other people and we decided to basically taste the entire menu, - drinks to dessert. 

Our total meal left us filled to the brim. Everything was great, while some dishes were simply outstanding. We began with calamari, oysters, tartare and some bread. The oysters came with some type of crystal horseradish that was simply delicious. The tartare was perfect. We then had a few salads to cross the bridge to dinner. Dinner handed us stone crab, king crab, and steak. I had never had stone crab and was actually a little disappointed in the flavor, but no doubt it was perfectly prepared. The king crab was just outstanding and the best tasting crab legs I have ever had. The steak was fantastic but I'd still go with seafood first and foremost. Finally to dessert. I don't usually venture to the dessert menu but when splurging might as well open up the belt bucket. The key lime pie, their flagship, was great. Get it - doesn't matter if you like key lime pie or not. And try one of their dessert mix drinks as well. 

Overall one of the best meals I have ever had, not just in Vegas.

Once we arrived our seat was not ready (we didn't wait long 10 minutes), so the host suggested we grab a drink at the bar. The drinks hook you! I had about 4 lemon drop martinis. 

The host is awesome...watch him as he greets people as if he's known him for a long time. The host on shift during our visit was an older guy, tall, whitish hair. He's fabulous. 

Okay so now the food. Short and sweet-crab bisque (yum) and great presentation. I had scallops wrapped in bacon. Each bunch of 4 scallops were wrapped in bacon-so delicious. My husband had rib eye...and he wasn't disappointed. And, of'course the crabs...these were awesome! We had them as an appetizer, but I suggest ordering a full order (we had never had them so we ordered just an appetizer)...if you like crab at all...order a full order...and I would order the medium size-get more meat.

The stone crabs were delicious. Already cracked, easy to peel and dipped in a tangy creamy horseradish sauce. Also from reading the menu, they explained a bit about the crab claws, how they are harvested and then released back in the wild, and apparently the claws grow back. I had no idea. 

We also tried an order of Rockefeller Oysters, which were also very good.

Surprisingly there aren't that many nice places to have lunch on the Strip: Joe's is one of the best choices, particularly if you are unsure of your companion's dining preferences or looking to find something moderately priced and moderately fast (there are small salads, sandwches and burgers on the bar menu). 

A spin-off of the Miami legend, Joe's offers three distinct environments --a bustling patio in the elegant Forum rotunda, a very large casual bar, and a huge 40s-50s era dining room that is classic (I also discovered they have two round function rooms overlooking the Strip and a elegantly old school ""Boardroom"" for private dining\/meeting).

Coat and tie not required, but common, esp. in dining room--and large parties seem to be common. It isn't surprising to run into both Casino heavy hitters (even those from competing properties, who could eat elsewhere for free) as well as visiting celebs. Tuxedoed waiters  provide detailed service...though when things get very busy, they may run by you a bit too quickly.

The menu is full of surprises--beyond the expected stone crab claws, shrimp, oysters rockafeller, shrimp dejonghe (basically breaded scampi, but made with impressively tender prawns), crab cakes and fish dishes, there is an excellent Chopped Vegetable Salad, good garlic creamed spinach and roasted corn.

The bone-in filet mignon was among the very best I've had in Vegas. And I have to tell you that I have sampled virtually all of the best steakhouses here.

Our Dover Sole was lightly breaded and gorgeously saut√©ed to a golden hue; the waiter deftly deboned it at the table and served it with a slightly carmelized lemon butter (it didn't need it).

The fried chicken was another unexpected surprise, a hefty four pieces, lightly battered and deep fried, the crispy crumb batter giving way to moist flavorful meat within. Savory but light.

In season, the Alaskan king crab legs here are far and away the best I've had: sweet, juicy, light with none of the mealy taste you get from lesser crab. 

Their pies are offered in half portions-a great option should you want to sample more than one. I have had uneven experiences with the signature key lime pie--one time it was perfect, another time, it was rock-solid frozen, and the waiter neither apologized nor replaced it when I complained.

It didn't matter what your celeb status or fame was. You waited in line just like everyone else. 
Except for me thankfully. A distant cousin of mine used to be the Captain of that restaurant. The Captain is basically the main host and in charge of the staff. 
I ate there many many times whenever I would visit and Joe would even give me a box of some stone crabs packed on ice to fly back home which was NYC back then.
My friends and I would feast as soon as I got home...LOL... 

The reviews I've read sound like it's the same ownership group or a very very good copy cat of the original. 
The original Joe's was famous for the Key Lime Pie, crab cakes and other items mentioned in some of the reviews.

Their steaks (the boys both had filets) are always cooked to perfection and the girls last night we each had ahi steaks. Which were also some of the finest tuna steaks around and again cooked to perfection!! My ahi was more customized for a more Asian flare upon request and my friend had the tuna off the menu and both were excellent!! We also both shared salads (which is easy to do as their salads are huge) so for the table we had a Joe's chop and a regular chop salad and both were perfectly dressed and delicious! Martinis were excellent and not too tiny glasses and their wine selection is great as well. All in all a must is you have to eat in the strip in Vegas!

Out of all the restaurants in Las Vegas, hubby and I chose Joe's for Valentine's day and are both so very glad we did.
Our server, Melanie, was exceptionally outstanding and made us feel as if we were the only guests in the whole restaurant, even though it was super busy. She was so informative about every single menu item and went above and beyond to take care of us. Absolutely phenomenal.
Recommendations:
Grilled seafood platter has a great variety and is perfect to share as an appetizer (they will even split it onto 2 plates for you)
Get the delicious saut√©ed mushrooms with your steak! (not on the menu)
The heavenly Dover sole comes with a tableside de-boning presentation - in the words of our server, ""who needs Cirque du Soleil?!""

The food and service were both fantastic! I had never had stone crab before but I have had other people rave to me about it so we tried some as an appetizer with some king crab as well. The stone crab definitely was good, but it was WAY too much work for me and honestly I liked the king crab better. Just a personal preference I guess.

For my entree I had the Filet Mignon and a baked potato. Usually you get separate butter, sour cream and chives with your potato, but they have it all mixed together. I was skeptical when it first arrived, but it was absolutely awesome. We also got the roasted corn for the table. I had never had that before and it was amazing, I couldn't get enough! The filet was also melt in your mouth awesome!

Add a slice of banana cream pie for dessert, which was also incredible, and I was stuffed! I ate at 3 high end restaurants (and 3 medium level spots) during this trip to Vegas, and Joe's was hands down the best!

So glad we decided to dine here for dinner because we were blown away with the seafood here. 
Staff are attentive, dressed very smart but there's no imposed dress code so we turned up in causal wear and felt comfortable dining here. 

We ordered The Whale and Select Stone Crab for appetiser, very fresh seafood. The stone crab was cracked well enough for us to peel away the shell and devour the deliciousness! Best way to enjoy crustaceans is definitely with good ole lemon juice, there were plenty of lemon slices for us. Love and highly recommend both dishes!

Mains we ordered the Filet and Tail along with a seafood pasta dish, the past was pretty average in my opinion and bland. I needed to salt it quite often, I wouldn't recommend the pasta.

We started out with oysters (fresh and delicious, and they have a unique icy mignonette that was neat) and the Select stone crab claws, which were awesome, especially with the mustard dipping sauce. Our server showed us how to extract the meat, and it was super easy because the claws are already cracked. 

The bread basket contained a nice variety and the servers kept bringing out more whenever we ran low.

For our main, we opted for the bone-in dry aged ribeye (one is enough for 2!) from the specials and it was amazing! A perfect medium rare, charred on the outside which imparted a rich, smoky flavor. In comparison, our friends' regular ribeye ($22 cheaper) seemed anemic. 

My favorite of the assortment of sides we tried was the brussels sprouts. The ""big daddy taters"" were good too, although I thought we were ordering the Lyonnaise potatoes (not sure if they're the same thing?). I'd say skip the unremarkable mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.

This is a very expensive restaurant in Vegas so get ready.  We both had their surf and turf special and the filet was dry and flavorless even though it was medium rare. (and choice not prime) The fish portion was good but small.  The corn special was pretty good as was the bread.  The salad was ok nothing special.   I would not go back as there are many other good steak or seafood places that are not that expensive.,0,0,0

The jumbo alaskan king crab legs on the other hand, fell off the shell and melted in my mouth.  Eating at buffets in vegas with these is no match compared to a single order of these pre-cracked and ready to eat.  You haven't had crab legs until you get some of these.

Lastly I closed out with a bone-in filet, the original they call it.  It was a thick piece of meat, so that meant the center was nice and rare, just the way I like it.  It was nice, tender and juicy, until I got to certain portions which were a bit to chewy because of some tendons.",0,0,0

They have an entire vegetarian and gluten free menu (that you do have to request to see) and the vegan options are labeled! I was happy as a clam. 
Our waiter was Bradley - he has a wonderful sense of humor and service as well. He kept us laughing and made sure we were all taken care of. My husband and I had to dine pretty fast because we had reservations for a helicopter tour which Bradley did an excellent job of ensuring we made it out on time. 
Now the question I'm sure you're all dying to know the answer to... What did I order?! My appetizer was the All Greens salad - a very simple salad, with literally just chopped greens and a few tomatoes. However that's all this salad needs... The dressing is really the star of the plate! It was incredible. For my entree, I got the Cauliflower Steak. I was in heaven! It was absolutely outstanding. 
My husband got one of the crab plates, which I could tell he enjoyed since he didn't say a word while he was eating it.

For starters, the stone crab appetizer is amazing. The claws are bigger than i thought they would be and very delicious. They come with a good mustard type dipping sauce. The Oysters Rockafella is the best that i ever had and I have had alot over the years. 

For the main course we had the King Crab Legs which they cut with a scissors for you a the table making them very easy to eat. They are so big and so much of them that i couldnt even finish and needed to get some to go. Every piece of crab is at least the size of a hotdog. You don't have to work to hard to enjoy them. The other main course was crab stuffed shrimp. Needless to say that was great also. 

For cocktails we had the Reisling and the Bloody Mary. Best Bloody Mary I have had that I can remember. It comes with a large shrimp in the glass and the rim is a great mixture giving it that extra flavor. 

The service was great. Very professional yet friendly to joke around with.  Make sure you ask for Troy if you want good service. He took great care of us and we will make sure to see him again next time.",2,0,1

The shrimp and lobster were good but the stone crab was difficult to eat and not very flavorful.  Next, I opted for the surf and turf special that night.  It was the signature bone-in filet plus 12 ounces of lobster (yes, 12-ounces!).  The filet was cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful, and there was so much lobster it was unreal.  I shared asparagus, broccoli, saut√©ed mushrooms, and cheesy potatoes with the table, but the sides were neither blockbuster not abysmal... just good.  Dessert was key lime pie, and it was great.

Anything you order here will exceed your expectations. I have to say, THANK YOU Joe's for coming to Las Vegas.....but I hope one day you will come to Los Angeles!

I came here with my family for dinner and had such a great experience. With superb customer service and top notch seafood, I wish I could give this restaurants 10 stars!

Crab bisque- smooth buttery soup filled with crab pieces. Just perfect to share.

Ahi Tartare- chunky pieces of ahi that were not overwhleming or too puny. Perfect in size. The ahi just melted in your mouth; not overly seasoned. 

Stone Crab- How can you not get stone crab here? It is famous...you almost want to bypass it, but you just can't resist. We got the select size since it wouldn't be too small nor too pricey! YOU MUST TRY THIS!  The crab piece just fell apart and it tasted so flavorful. 

Crab Cakes- This has got to be the best crab cake or just in par with Boston's Legal Seafood crab cakes. I don't even know what to say, but it is just tons of crab pieces and not much of a filler. You hardly ever get that anywhere. 

Alaskan King Crab Legs- You can technically buy this at any grocery store, but I wanted to see how different it would be in a restaurant. It is basically the same, serve chilled with a complementary dipping sauce. 

Seared scallops- huge scallops seared perfectly with a slight crust on top! BAM. the potato puree was the perfect addition.

Sea Bass with bok choy- you can never go wrong with sea bass. Sea bass' texture is always flaky and buttery. The sea bass probably literally melted in my mouth with every bite. 

Filet Mignon- you definitely can't go wrong with the filet mingon! perfectly grilled. Just enough tenderness and a smooth cut everytime you poke your knife in it! Flavor was on Fleek!

Key Lime Pie- Basically couldn't decide on which dessert. We heard raving reviews on the key lime pie, but their signature was the boston cream pie. The key lime flavor had the perfect balance of sweet and sour. Not one side was more overpowering than the other! I can just imagine eating another slice right now. 

Boston Cream Pie- I usually hate all that creamy stuff, but this you will not regret! The cream was light and fluffy, the cake could have been smoother but all in all, every bite was consumed

Located inside the Cesar's forum shops, the restaurant had a great refined setting. Our server was nice and very accommodating to our group of 7 busy girls.

An absolute must here is the crab claws. ABSOLUTE! We did two orders of the medium claws (7 claws per order at $39 an order). Tasty crab claws itself, the flavor is put over the top when you pair it with their special sauce. 

We tried 3 sides amongst the 7 of us to pair with our entrees and still had leftovers. The side portions are pretty big.

Sides:
Lyonnaise potatoes: perfect crisp on the outside & great flavor with the onions in the middle
Creamed Spinach: not noteworthy but decent
Sauteed Corn: probably the favorite of the sides. The flavor was really good. I would order this again

I can't speak on behalf of the other girls' entrees as I didn't try it but the restaurant was kind enough to split any entrees to two plates before it was served to us if anyone was sharing. This made things run a lot smoother & it was much appreciated. 

I split the scallops with a friend as my entree and it was definitely enough for the both of us to be full. Granted we did have a lot of sides & had snacked on the yummy bread basket that was served in the beginning. These are probably some of the best scallops I have ever had. Cooked to perfection!

After walking through the forum shops at Ceasar's we decided on Joe's. The wait to be seated was about 10 mins...that was for a tall table in the bar area, not the outer patio seating which was packed with lunch customers. We expected the wait as all the reviews warned of how busy the restaurant usually is. 

Once seated, we were greeted immediately and our drink orders were taken. I had the amazing Bloody Mary while my husband had a Stella. Everything came in a timely manner...my Bloody Mary had a gigantic shrimp in it which was fantastic. The waitress then took our order and was very helpful in explaining the menu items and seasonal pricing. My hubby decided on the Fishermans Platter (he chose grilled, you can also get fried) while I had to have the signature crab claws. We both also ordered the side ceasar salad and a cup of lobster bisque.

The ceasar salad was good. Not amazing or anything but a well put together well dressed salad. Now, the lobster bisque was EPIC. Velvety and creamy...my hubby and I were licking our spoons and wanting more. I definitely recommend the lobster bisque to anyone (besides those with shellfish allergies of course). The main courses then came out and they were nicely presented, just simple seafood and simple condiments. My husbands seafood platter was fresh, light, and delicious. The stand out star being the scallops which were super sweet and grilled perfectly. My crab claws we're delicious...definitely a bit of work to get to the meat but well worth it.

We ordered medium rare and received well done with bitter charcoal on the outside.
I don't understand how a restaurant like this can screw up a simple order like this. The only thing I can think of is carelessness. 
We ordered some crab legs, and they were served before the steaks.
They definitely left the steaks on the grill too long!

I started with an iced mocha coffee with nonfat milk.  Very happy because a lot of restaurants only offer hot coffee and since I do not drink alcohol iced coffees are my drink of choice.  I then had a blt wedge salad which I loved!  I was unsure I would like it because I like classic wedge salads but all the toppings and small cut bacon and eggs were very good.  I then had the $74 king crab legs.  I loved how the legs were cut for me to easily pull out the chunks of meat.  It was a HUGE amount of crab and sadly I could not finish.  The waitress offered to wrap the rest of the meat up for me but I was not going home for a long time so this wasn't possible.  I would recommend if you go to Joe's you share this as an entr√©e meal.  The sides were good and apparently you can get half-orders of sides.  I tried to creamed spinach which was about what I expected, as well as tried the broiled tomatoes.  You wouldn't know from the menu that broiled tomatoes are actually broiled tomatoes with spinach puree on top and then covered in Wisconsin cheddar.  I did like the tomatoes and would not have ordered them expect another person in my party wanted them.  My boyfriend had the liver which was wrapped in bacon.  He had never had liver before but we figured if he ever wanted to try it then here was a good place to try it.  He did like it!  I refused to try it.  I'm sorry I'm narrow-minded!  Since I am a local and my boyfriend is a local the waitress brought us each a slice of pie that we shared with the table.  I guess if you are a local and it is your first time you get a free piece of pie!  Yay!

The Las Vegas location is exceptional. The dining areas are upscale white table-clothed spaces with a clubby feel. You can go with a jacket or without and fit right in.

I had the famed stone crab for an appetizer. It was good, but I may have experienced a little chalky flavor\/consistency at the extreme tips of the claws. I would attribute this to the fact that the height of stone crab season is January\/February and I had my visit in April (frozen?).

For the entr√©e I had salmon drizzled with a maple glaze that jumped off the menu at me immediately. (I never would have thought of maple on salmon). It was very interesting - and good - with the salmon cooked medium (perfect). The table shared hash browns (for which Joe's is also known - and rightly so) and corn.

It wasn't until I saw a segment on the Travel Channel about stone crabs that I took interest in the restaurant.  When stone crabs are caught, one claw is torn off and the crab thrown back in the ocean.  It's mean but stone crabs have the ability to grow back their claw in about 12 to 24 months.

Three friends and I dined here on a Saturday night at 7pm for our friend's birthday.  The restaurant is more than what meets the eye, there's also a back room with a good amount of seating.  I'm not sure if it's for reservations only but making reservations is always suggested.

APPETIZERS:
*Oysters Rockefeller (4 pieces\/order) - Okay.  Though the oyster shells were good size, the oysters were small and the creamy mixture overpowered the dish.
*Stone Crabs - You can't dine here and NOT order the crabs.  I though the crabs were delicious.  They were a bit on the sweet side and tasted perfect with the accompanied special mustard sauce.  The only downer was that it seemed the claws were cracked too much making it tougher to eat trying to pick out the tiny shells.  Do note: stone crabs are more expensive than your normal crab and will cost up to $10\/claw depending on how you order (you can order medium, large, or select).
*BLT Wedge Salad - Good, but bacon makes everything taste better.  Our waiter was nice enough to split the salads so it could end up on each side of the table to be shared.  The salad consisted of blue cheese, onions, tomatoes, bacon, and topped off with a vinaigrette dressing.

 ENTR√âE:
*Veal Cutlets ""Oscar Style"" - Pass, I should've stuck to seafood.  The dish was comprised of two small veal cutlets which were breaded and fried, then sprinkled with crabmeat and chopped asparagus, and then doused with a hollandaise sauce.  The main reason this dish failed with me was the overcooked veal cutlets.  The crabmeat was deliciously sweet and the hollandaise sauce helped with the dryness of the veal.  

SIDES:
*Garlic Creamed Spinach - Delicious!  The dish was creamy and full of flavor.  I thought the garlic would be chopped into the spinach, but garlic cloves were cooked on top of the dish.  
*Sugar Snap Peas - Good and extremely fresh.  The peas were had a nice sweet crisp to them.

SERVICE:
Good and extremely professional.",5,1,2

Appetizers we had:
Calamari = Excellent, possibly the best I've had, and the table of four I was with was saying the same. Not soft and chewy, and very easy to eat. If you're stuck on what to get but want *something*, this is a good choice.
Crab bisque = first time I had it, and I guess I'm not a fan of it, because my friends thought very highly of it. 
Joe's grilled tomato = Excellent, another great choice for an appetizer. Perry said even as a someone not a fan of tomatoes he really likes it. As a fan of tomatoes myself, I also really like it. 
Petite 8 oz. filet mignon = I got mine medium, and I should have gotten it medium-rare, I think it would have made it better. They'll give you seasoning you can put on the steak which is quite good. Give it a shot. 
Stone crab claws = Friends thought it was good, not great. I didn't think much of it. Very pricey, too, but, it's one of the things they're known for. 
Chilean sea bass = Friend said it was excellent. Pretty sure they inhaled it because I barely remember seeing it on the table. 
The Sundae (not sure what the real name was -- ice cream on top of a brownie) = Very, very good. High quality dessert that we had to celebrate my wife's birthday. 
S'mores pie = Graham cracker crust, chocolate bottom half, roasted marshmallow top-half. This pie was the best pie we've ever had, the chocolate not over-powering or too rich, and the marshmallow does a lot to make this so good. As for me, this was the best part of the meal. It's so good that we're making plans to go to this place again just for the pie, and we were told this is a speciality pie only served in March. A different speciality pie for every month. 

We made a reservation for our dinner here and I think that's a good idea, place was pretty packed. Would definitely go here again.",0,0,0

Celebrated the beau and I 7 years anniversary on Jan 1st and made reservations. It wasn't too busy so if we didn't make reservations I'm pretty sure we would have gotten in quickly. They have a bar area and a fine dining seating. It was a very secluded area, kind of romantic, very elegant.

Upon seating we got a basket of breads, crackers, corn bread and butter. We were noticed right away by waiters and waitresses. They explained the menu in detail and even helped us choose what would be better for us. 

For appetizer we got The Whale which comes with Alaskian King crabs, shrimp, lobster tail and scallop shrimp ceviche. It is ordered by how many people is in your party. So the order was for two of us so it was about $24\/person. This was really already a good amount of seafood but you know we weren't going to stop there.

We both ordered petite filet mignon which was 8 oz. That was like perfect size maybe even a an oz. too much for me and we also ordered a 1 pound of alaskian king crab which was A LOT! We didn't realize that it would be that much for just the two of us. The crab was so perfect though. It is already cracked open for you and it is sooooo meaty. So much crab in each bite. The steaks were cooked to perfection of course. Very well seasoned.

Both of us absolutely love stone crab and based on the reviews and history, there apparently was no better place.  Well, after eating here, all we can say is that the Yelpers and historians are correct!

Our meal started out with a velvety bowl of bisque which if I kept a list of Top 5 bisques, this one would be on it and likely top it!  

On the recommendation of the waiter, we ordered the Madagascar shrimp which was the size of a child's hand and could have easily served as the appetizer for both of us.  It was perfectly grilled and skewered with a sugar cane.  It was as succulent as a steak but light on the stomach!

Then, the main events came to the table and they left not one tastebud unturned.  My GF dined on the large stone crabs that were cracked to perfection for ease of eats and the meat was unbelievably sweet and perfectly steamed.  I have had stone crab at many restaurants around the Houston area including Truluck's and Pappas, and as much as it pains me to say this, the stone crab at Joe's made their stone crab feel like it was eaten at a chain restaurant.

I opted to have the stone crab for my appetizer and was definitely wow'd.  However, when a man is presented with a decision of stone crab or nearly two pounds of fresh Alaskan king crab legs, the choice it easy.  The legs were steamed, served cold, and hand cut tableside for ease of eating.  The meat was sweet and melted in my mouth and only needed a dab of the drawn lemon butter that was on the side.

And because our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs, our waiter, Andrew, recommended the pan roasted corn.  The corn was fresh off the cob cut into a pan with butter, salt, pepper, and cilantro.  It had a nice bite feel, yet still tender and juicy in the center.  The best part about this side dish is that it had an aroma of fresh popcorn as you ate it.  WOW!

And as good as the food was, the service was far superior to most high end restaurants where we've dined.  Our waiter, Andrew, was extremely knowledgeable and made that great recommendation and the bus staff was extremely attentive to our drinks, and cleaning our tables.

The only thing that prevents me from giving this restaurant a full 5 stars is the $6 san pelegrino and the 2 weak woodford and diets that were ordered!  Otherwise, we say thank you Joe's for one of the best meals of all time!

The crab cakes are 95% crab chunks. And I mean chunks, none of those wimpy small pieces you get in normal crab cakes. The crabs they use must be huge! The meat was sweet and juicy, and the binding agent they use to hold it all together only added to the flavor. The cakes are roasted to a golden brown (not fried) and about the size of a tennis ball. One $16 serving comes with two cakes, making this an insanely good deal.

The crab bisque was very tasty and super rich, if a little salty. A small cup was $8, but it was so rich and filling that I could barely finish it.

The seafood salad comes with avocado, celery, asparagus, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, onions, and lobster, shrimp and crab meat. They were generous with the seafood,  and all the ingredients worked well together.

Service was excellent and the seating area is very pleasant.  The kitchen was nice enough to split both the crab cakes and the salad on two plates since we were sharing.  I will continue to return every time I'm in Vegas.",1,0,1

Service was excellent. Our server was chatty but not intrusive. He went above and beyond not once, not twice, but THREE times when we could not make up our minds--first by showing us and explaining the different sizes of stone crab claws, second by asking the sommelier when we couldn't decide on a wine, and third by suggesting we could get half portions of 2 desserts instead of choosing 1.

Food was excellent. The stone crab appetizer was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and this is from a person who doesn't usually care for cold seafood. For dinner, I had a huge piece of bone-in halibut that was seared to perfection. My husband had the bone-in fillet and pronounced it one of the top 5 steaks he has ever eaten.

Ambiance was what you would expect for an upscale steakhouse. The only negative--and I'm being very nitpicky--would be the attire of our fellow restaurant patrons.

The steak was prepared, as requested, a perfect medium rare, tender, juicy, flavorful, and a small dish of Joe's seasoning was served on the side.  Two giant, pre-cracked Alaskan King Crab legs came with it, served with a butter sauce.  Everything was delicious.

I sampled food from the others in our party, one got exactly the same as me, another got scallops, which were pretty good (I'm very picky about scallops) and my better half got the Parmesan Crusted Grouper which was quite tasty as well.

We shared an order of Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer, not the best I've had, but still quite good.

We also shared an order of the cheesy mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  I wasn't wild about the potatoes, though others in our party liked them.  The potatoes to me were mostly Parmesan cheese with a little bit of potato.  The asparagus was great, but it's pretty hard to screw up grilling asparagus.

The highlight of our experience was our waiter, I believe his name was Daniel, he was extremely helpful with the menu, descriptions, portion sizes, and drink selection.  Very friendly, there when we needed him, but didn't hover.  Daniel is one of the best waitstaff I've ever experienced.  Thanks Daniel!

I also experienced a tasty locally brewed ale thanks to Daniel's suggestion, Tenaya Creek Calico Brown Ale.  It was delicious and paired great with the steak.",0,0,0

I can honestly say after dining here last evening that this may be one of the best meals we have had in Vegas in many years.   Reservation for 8 People 7PM arrive 30 minutes early to this large multi room venue located 1st floor of the Forum Shops.  Saddle up the bar which is packed and have quite a bit of drinks over the next 30 minutes.  1st Nice surprise of the evening they are not Knee Capping you on Booze. Very reasonable priced cocktails across the board.    

With that complete we are seated promptly at 7PM in the back room of this clubby type feel steak and seafood establishment.  Its quite loud and bustling but I never felt crowded or pushed.   Menu's provided as well as special menu with today's market priced stone crabs and king crab leg pricing.  Considering they are flow in daily from Miami price points are well REASONABLE for what you pay much move for locally in South Florida and to be honest not as good.   Waiter Ryan states although we are famous for Stone Crabs steaks are their thing here as well.  So Off we go. 

1st off Basket of various homemade flatbreads, breads, pretzel breads etc with nice whipped butter await us as we sit.. Wine list is a bit. Pricey but vintages are accurate and a couple of Magnums later we are moving along.  

Crab Bisque is as good as anything as anyone has ever had.  

Chopped Joe's Salad is perfection while it's pretty tough to screw up a wedge they did not and a nice blue cheese dressing with amble bacon etc make all salads a winner. 

Some of us had orders of Stone Crabs for appetizers and they truly didn't disappoint.  Cracked to perfection, cold and clean and sweet made these as good as south Florida no question.   Large 1lb of Alaskan king crab cocktail $69.00 was as fresh and succulent as anything I've ever tasted. 

We could have stopped there but we rolled right into some Filet Mignons Petit $35.0 VERY REASONABLE.  Cooked to absolute perfection.. 

Sides Mushrooms not on menu were simply OK.... 
Onion strings Excellent
Sweet potato fries top Shelf
Garlic crusted mashed were good

Key Lime Pie for desert Sinful. 

Service was well PERFECTION... brisk without being pushy, helpful and one of our diners who was not feeling well left before eating and his order was gracefully cancelled. 

In Short This place does it right and you can see why it is absolutely packed.   For what you get in this very overpriced city it is great to see top shelf food, service and atmosphere with great pricing make it's way back here...

I have been wanting to dine here for a while -  it has been years since I first tried stone crab in Florida.  I finally had the opportunity and was going to splurge a bit, but what a waste of money.
I ordered the medium plate of stone crab claws (their smallest choice @ $34.95) and also got the cup of crab bisque to start.  
The soup tasted nice, but the texture was off.  It looked like the fat was starting to separate out of the cream soup.  I know bisque is fattening, but I really don't want to see the oil slick at the top of the bowl.
My main disappointment was in the stone crab claws.  The texture of the crab meat was wet.  Now, I probably should have guessed that they would have been previously frozen, but somehow I expected them  to have a way of doing this that wouldn't hurt the texture of the crab so noticeably.  
The shell on stone crabs is quite thick, so they pre-crack the claws for you.  I don't remember ever having this problem before, but  with about every other bite, I was getting small bits of shell in my mouth  that I was then trying to discreetly spit out.  It just wasn't worth the $50 for my lunch.  About half way through the meal I grew tired of the crab and didn't even finish it.  That hurts me just to type it.",1,0,0

but....we went on a Friday night with a group of 13 for a surprise 40th birthday. We got the private back room which was great, and the waitress was ok. The problem started after our meal. The waitress brought out a bill for 13 people, we all sat next to our significant other and thought she had been paying attention to the orders but the bill came and she refused to separate it. To make it even worse we were only then informed that they can only take 3 credit cards and the rest had to be cash. We were all from Canada and don't carry that much cash as we spent around 125$ each. 
We asked to speak to the Manager as there were 6 couples and 1 single that needed to pay and most needed cards. They wouldn't accept this and said there was nothing they could do about separating the bills. After 20 minutes of arguing with management one of our group members divided the bill into each member's total for their incompetent staff. We then had to figure out how to pay. After dealing with this absurd rule we eventually just told management we can only pay with credit for the most part and each group was separated. After sensing the frustration they reluctantly allowed more than 3 people to pay with credit. 
When paying the waitress said to one of our group members, ""you university students must not eat at restaurants like this much"" and that ""you just don't know how its done"". First of all, after refusing to separate bills a waitress is not likely a mathematician and the room had multiple doctors and university lecturers. No students.

It is usually customary to inform the guests that there is an automatic 20% gratuity with groups, We realized this after closely examining our bills but she was sure fishing for an extra tip. I am always happy to pay for good service, but this was an absolute nightmare. 

So needless to say all our other meals at ""nice"" restaurants started off with asking the wait staff, can we get separate bills and can we each pay with credit cards? To which the staff looked dumbfounded and replied: ""yes of course, why?""

For a much better experience go to Toa or anywhere else.

I have made sure to tell everyone I know going to Vegas to avoid Joe's. I'm sure it would be great for couples, but a group of any size should avoid it at all costs.

The second time we went to Joes Stone Crab was on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch.

Back to why you're probably interested in Joe's, the seafood. The Stone Crab is always cold and fresh and the mustard dipping sauce it on point. But do be warned that if you make a late reservation they can and do run out of it. The rest of the menu like King crab legs, seafood platters, steaks and salads are pretty solid offerings as well. Last time I had the Filet oscar- steak topped with crab- and it was delicious.

Came here for the famous stone crabs and enjoyed them. I hear that stone crabs are a Florida thing so I bet they are better fresh there but these were pretty darn good. They give you a plate full of just the claws BINGO or should I say KENO since it's Vegas.  It's my favorite part of the crab and the meat has a nice sweetness to it.  To top it all off the crabs come already cracked for you. No more man vs. crab, a battle I've lost many times. You practically just slide the shell right off.   I left with no chipped teeth and without any scratches yea-ah. 

Also had a nice ahi salad and the crab bisque. Both were delicious.  A nice light lunch except for the Bloody Mary. 

The Bloody Mary here was the best I've ever had and I don't normally like bloody mary. It was like a meal in itself. Came with a large stalk of celery and these excellent tomato olives.  Asked for it spicy so it had a nice kick to it. Very flavorful and went well with the crab. No cocktail sauce needed after drinking that cocktail.

All in all a good place. It's not a hole in the wall type of place but it does burn a hole in your pocket. It's a bit on the pricy side but that's to be expected.

My colleagues had the Mahi Mahi which was a daily special and I went with a seafood salad. We split some saut√©ed spinach and onion rings as sides.

Both the food and service were above average.  1 star deduction is due to being seated at 7:40 PM for our 6:30 PM reservation and cold bisque.   The reservation system in a restaurant of this caliber should run more smoothly (in my opinion).

Items ordered and shared:

Crab Bisque: $9.95.  Lump crab brought out in a bowl and the bisque is poured over the crab table-side.  This would have been better if it was hot, but it was cold and cold cream based soup is not the best.

Colossal Lump Crab Cake: $17.95 Mostly crab, hardly any filler and very delectable!

Bread Basket: Dinner roll, onion loaf, soft pretzel stick, olive bread.  The soft pretzel was amazing, but the other breads were just okay.  That was fine with me, it just left more room for all the other marvelous items we had!

1 LB of Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs: Market Price, $59.95 that night.  Fantastic!  Pre-cracked so you just had to gently pry them apart.  Steamed perfectly.  Texture and taste were great, I didn't even need to dip them in butter.

'Select' Stone Crab Claws (6 per order): Market price, $64.95 that night.  These were very good, however they pre-crack the claws before they are brought to you, and the way they were cracked caused the shells to shatter like glass, so it was a little tricky to eat them without chomping on a shell fragment.

Petite Filet (8 oz): $35.95.  Quite possibly one of the best filet I've had in Vegas.  It was cooked perfectly Medium Rare.  Juicy light red in the center with a fantastic crust on top.  

Fried Asparagus: $10.95. Because why just have regular old healthy asparagus?  Let's bread it and fry it.  Okay, well, as much as I wanted to mock this when it was ordered, it was freaking amazing.  

Joe's Big Daddy Potato: $10.95 (not on the menu, suggested by our waitress).  We tried a couple bites of this, but had so much other delicious items to choose from, that we pretty much neglected it.  It was basically just a loaded baked potato and you can get that anywhere.

Parking note:  If you don't want to walk through Caesar's Forum Shops, you can valet right in front if the restaurant.  Pull in off LV BLVD and instead of going down the hill towards the Forum Shops valet, turn right into the lot with the ""One Way"" sign.  It is super easy and gratis.",16,5,10

Me and my boy ordered medium-rare while another one of us ordered medium-well.  The steaks all came medium-well.  Then to top it all off it took FOREVER to get our food in a place that wasn't even half full.

Appetizers: We had crab, oysters and calamari at the table.  I didn't eat the first two (not my thing) but others said crab was good, not mind-blowing.  The calamari was fantastic, no chewiness and cocktail sauce was great.  

Main course:  I had grilled halibut steak, which was absolutely kickass; cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and HUGE. I could barely eat half of it.  Others had parmesan halibut (she loved it) Mahi (he liked it very much) and steak (she loved it). 

Sides:  Everything here shined.  Roasted corn was BOMB, green beans were perfect, and their signature mashed taters with crunchy topping were great.  Why I don't make my mashed potatoes with a crunchy topping I don't know. 

Dessert:  we each had a few bites of their tres-leches-like cake (not sure what the actual name was) with a caramel sauce on top which I could've eaten two servings of.  We also tried their key lime pie, which was good, but not out-of-this-world or anything.

Overall, very good experience and I would definitely go back!",0,0,0

Just in case you are also having trouble finding it, begin entering the Forum shops from the registration lobby and then turn right until you reach the escalators leading down to Las Vegas Blvd. The restaurant is located there. 

The appetizers and sides were tasty and filling. The Tuna Tartar was the favorite among the group. It was fresh and you could also add the tuna on top of the chip for that fresh crunchy texture. I had the Chilean Sea Bass dish and I liked it. It was tender and flavorful with the miso glaze. However, I did find myself comparing it to the Season 52's Chilean Sea Bass dish from their 2016 Spring menu and thought that their dish was slightly better than this one. 

Note that an automatic 18% gratuity is added to the bill. My group and I were surprised, but were fine with it since we enjoyed our food and our server was energetic and helpful.",1,0,0

Joe's is a place I will visit every time i'm in LV whether i'm winning or losing. If you're going to eat the stone crabs, do splurge and go for the large sized claws. I tried the medium sized ones but they're not as meaty or succulent as the large claws. These large stone claws are slap your mama good and the dipping sauce everyone is raving about makes it even more unique.

Follow it up with the Oysters Rockefeller which is better than Acme Oysters and Drago's that you will find in New Orleans. 

The crab cake is cooked to perfection. They are very generous with the lump crab and it is lightly battered unlike a lot of places who tend to over-batter crab cakes.

I tried the rib-eye here the first time but it was forgettable so I just stick to the seafood now.

The wine. When your server recommends starting with a bottle of wine, he's not trying to call you lush. He just knows what's best. The wine selection is vast. We split a bottle of some kind of merlot. I am not a wine person and I cannot quite remember what it was called, but I do remember what the label looked like. Point being: the bottle was worth it. Especially since we were at a different restaurant the night before we ended up getting two glasses each and it cost more than the price of that fine bottle.

The food. I had the oscar-style filet mignon and he had the rib-eye. Mine was so good, he did not get to taste the magical surf and turf on my plate. But, I snuck a taste of the rib-eye and almost cried. I couldn't believe it. It was so yummy. We split the ginormous baked-potato for a side and the peanut butter pie for dessert. The pie was like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup on steroids with whipped cream. ::drool::

The restaurant itself was like eating at your rich friend's mansion's dining room except with a bunch of strangers. The lighting was dim, but inviting. The walls had pictures of old people and sports teams and boats.

I had no expectations whatsoever but my mom was in a pissy mood. So we get here and the ""patio"" seating was currently closed off because the outside doors nearby were open and letting in a freezing wind and the patio wasn't heated. So we were seated inside at this tiny table sitting on high bar stool leveled seats and my mom threw a fit to our waiter venting how it was ""ridiculous that the patio isn't heated"" and how it was ""my daughter's 25th birthday and was supposed to be special"" giving off this snotty vibe like this place was just SO beneath her. I felt so bad and so embarrassed because it's not like it was his problem. But he apologized and brought his manager over and the manager handled my mom amazingly (bless his poor soul, ugh) and apologized and gave us a discount and completely surprised me by bringing me a complimentary alcoholic beverage AND an ice cream and brownie sundae with a candle and everything. WOW talk about amazing service, when he had every right to disregard my mom's horribleness.
Even with the discount and free stuff, our bill was over $300...to be honest I do not think the food was worth the price so i like to think we paid for amazing customer service.

I started with an order of stone crab claws. I've been to Joe's in Miami so I was looking forward to that particular dish. The waiter brought me 4 instead of the usual order of 6.  Not sure if that's because they were running out of claws or he really thought 6 would be too many. In either case, it worked out and was less expensive. The order of 6 was $47 I think. I also had the large seafood salad as my entree. It was fresh, but unremarkable. I probably wouldn't order that again. I wish I'd had space in my belly for a slice of key lime pie! Had it in Miami and it was epic :-). 

Other highlights at the table were the crab cakes and crab legs. The portions are very generous. I heard that the steak and some of the sides were salty, but I didn't have them myself. Again, the service was top notch and the staff was very gracious. I look forward to eating at Joe's again.",1,0,0

We had to try the stone crabs of course and the 20 oz rib eyes. We also order some lobster bisque... oh man I only ordered a cup of this stuff but I could've eaten a gallon of it. So rich and flavorful each bite had tons of lobster meat..yumm-mo!! The stone crabs came out next and we each got 2....pretty damn expensive but it was a great piece of claw. Super fresh and amazingly easy to get every single piece of meat.  Not sure if I would get this again since it was about $47 for 2 claws.... =P  Either way once in a lifetime type of deal for all of us.  
Our main entrees came next...I ordered the 20 oz rib eye medium well and my wife ordered the veal.  Oh man the rib eye was huge!! Didn't have to put much effort in cutting that bad boy.  The taste was perfect no A1 or sauce or anything.  Loved it My wife's veal was super tender and tasted great. The veal was breaded and had a great flavor and crunchiness to it.  Our friend got the pound of Alaskan crab legs.. oh man those were great.. I wish they had that and a small side of rib eye.  Hint hint!! They even cut open every single crab leg.  Fancchee!!  We also ordered our sides, creamed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, and roasted corn.  All were fantastic..We found out if you mix all three it creates complete happiness in your mouth. Hahaha  
Although we were stuffed I wanted to order some dessert for everyone.  So we shared some banana foster cake and some chiffon type cake. Both were so good and ended our night perfectly.  Great way to end our Vegas trip!!   For all 7 of us the bill was only $600ish.. So not bad.  Great service and great food! Must try guys!!",0,0,0

The service was excellent and so was the food.

Overall the seafood was fresh and I would imagine most everything on the menu would be a safe bet.  Personally i'd avoid the non seafood items since this place is called Joe's SEAFOOD Prime Steak & Stone Crab.

We just ordered a single large crab claw to try it (it's really pricey like 5-7 bucks for one claw).   I have to say that it was delicious though, and it makes me wish I was rich and could just order a giant tub of the claws and go to town.  :P",1,0,0

Enjoyed the stone crab apetizer, followed by a sauteed John Dory. Not inexpensive, but a generous portion and very tasty. My wife enjoyed an above-average petite filet. Fortunately, she had me eat some of it, because she had  enjoyed too much of that great bread basket. For our apetizer and my John Dory, we ordered a '09  Chateau Perenchere Bordeaux blanc -- and our fine server, John Lucas, said it was an unappreciated bottle. It went very well with the crab and my fish. For the filet, and after some discussion with John, we ordered a glass of a nice Bethel Heights pinot noir, ' 08 (as I recall).

Long story.

You have to order seafood or beef here that is what they do.

My husband ordered the rib eye sandwich and I ordered the maui maui lunch plate. My waitress suggest that I order a side dish because she thought it wouldn't be enough food so I ordered the heirloom tomatoes.

Someone soon brings out a bread basket, I do have to say that it was a very good above average bread basket with yummy pretzel bread, a cheese and onion roll and other breads.

We received the tomatoes and I do note that the tomatoes were stunning great tomatoes but I hated the vinaigrette because it had chunks of gelatin in it and I thought that was gross. My husband didn't mind the chunks of gelatin so some people might like it that way. I was able to eat the tomatoes if I scraped the gelatin chunks off.

We receive the meals and my husband said the rib eye was pretty good but had a lot of butter poured on it. My maui maui was nice and fresh but was DROWNING in butter. The jicama slaw that came with my meal was almost good but I couldn't eat it after I tasted it because it was totally oil saturated.

If you like LOTS of BUTTER or OIL with your food and a great bread basket EAT AT JOE'S!",1,1,1

The crab claws were good, but we prefer the  COLOSSAL LUMP CRAB CAKE ($14.95) because it comes with the same tasty mustard dipping sauce and you don't have to get your hands all messy.  

The SEAFOOD CHOPPED SALAD ($16.95) a great salad to split with someone else, just let your waiter know you'll be sharing it and it comes out with 2 huge portions.

We're locals, but we decided to spend a night on the strip to celebrate our anniversary. After looking at many reviews and asking friends for suggestions, we decided to check out Joe's. 

Everything about Joe's was great. Our server, can't remember his name , was wonderful. We told him it was our first time at Joe's and he went through the menu with us and made some great suggestions. We started with an heirloom tomato salad and some king crab legs for an appetizer. Both items were delicious. My husband and I were both impressed with the amount of crab legs received in the appetizer portion. For our entrees we ordered herb roasted chicken and a filet with lobster tail. Again, very impressed with portion sizes. We shared mashed potatoes and saut√©ed spinach for sides. Everything tasted amazing! After we finished our last bite of food and decided we couldn't possibly eat another bite, our waiter brought us complimentary key lime pie and banana cream pie; he said they like to treat their first time customers to their most popular desserts. Neither are desserts I would normally order, but just like all the other food, delicious!

We made a reservation and was seated pretty quickly. It was nice and quiet with low lights so we could actually have a conversation, I felt very grown up. The service was impeccable, and the food great. They initially served a bread basket which was average. We ordered the stone crab claws and shared as an appetizer, and in retrospect, as a crab lover I should have just gone with this as my entire meal. Still, I had the seared scallops which were very good with a potato puree and an amazing lobster buerre blanc sauce. My husband had the sea bass which was SO moist and good. We also ordered 5 sides and shared with everyone. I think the wild mushroom mac and cheese was my favorite, though we tried lyonnaise potatoes, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and brussel sprouts as well. 

It was a friend's birthday and they were nice enough to serve a chocolate dessert with a candle on it. I also had a glass of malbec which was delightful and hubs had a grapefruit-y cocktail. All in all, I think I'd like to come back and just gorge myself on the stone crab claws.",3,1,3

He even shared with me about an app called lettuce eat that tracks how much you spend at the different locations and you received rewards.

I used to love this restaurant. The last time I was in Vegas, I stayed for 3 month - I take a long vacation every year,,, about 2 years ago. I went to Joe's probably 5 times to eat king\/stone crabs and shrimps and such. It was amazing. 5 stars back then.

This time I have been staying in Vegas for over 2 month already, eating out everyday and night - spending a lot of $$$$. Sadly enough, I have found quality of Vegas restaurant business has gone pretty bad. Maybe it's because of the depression. Maybe they've found easier way to get more money - like night club. Well, whatever the reason was, I decided to go to Joe's to refresh myself,,,, hopefully not to waste money anymore.

Service - Outstanding. They are the professionals.

Atmosphere - 3 stars as always. Not so special but it is all ok with me.

Food - 

Crabs - Not good anymore. They are pretty much tasteless. I don't know what happened to them. Simply tasteless. Not worth eating it even if it's $5.

Ceviche - Terrible. It was amazing last time, tho, this time it was like stuffing out of a cheap seafood taco made by hole in the wall type of place in LA. They don't even use cilantro and red onion. They made it with some sort of salsa. Shrimps and scallops didn't have any flavor. They were just chewy thing without any taste. TERRIBLE.

Lobsters - flavorless again. It doesn't even smell like a lobster. 

Oysters - It is OK. 2 years ago, it was MUCH BETTER, tho.

We have to walk away as soon as we finished drinking wines. All we order was just appetizer - ended up paying more than $100 for these small items. 

I was gonna rate it 3 stars for the service, but no,,,, I have to be honest because I don't want you to be disappointed. Don't get crabs and shrimps this year (they were saying it was very seasonal, fresh, and good. Turned out to be pretty crappy). Maybe next year, they may able to find good seafood.

Tip you order main courses and sides separately and our amazing waiter (John) said that the sides are large enough to share. 

Our friends ordered a salad to share, followed by the fried chicken and fish. I can't remember what kind of fish, but she said it was good.

DESSERT: Yummy! We had a cherry pie with a scoop of ice cream. Our friends did not order a dessert but were surprised with a key lime pie, how sweet is that!!!

They break one claw off and throw the rest of the crab back to regrow the claw so the harvesting is sustainable. They don't server other parts of the stone crab. The claws are very meaty compared to other species wiht a delicate sweetness unique and different from snow and dungeness. Stone crab claws paired with a Sancerre was a mind blowing experience. The flavors are different when chewing the crab with some Sancerre in the mouth at the same time. Changes the flavor of the crab. Excellent pairing. Without the wine pairing I wouldn't have enjoyed the crab. Cold crab claws with mayo based sauce wasn't that appealing to my palate. I echo what other reviews say about this. 

Signature Item: Sole with browned butter. Reminds me of the burned butter taste in creme br√ªl√©e without the sugary sweetness. Excellent sauce. Unique on fish. Never had it before Fantastic presentation. They have one person specially trained to debone the whole fish in front of you.  The server counts the bones to make sure they don't leave anything behind. Never seen this before.  I thought the sole was too salty. Couldn't eat it after a couple bites. 

Signature Item: Key lime pie: very memorable. Ordered from the waiter's suggestion. The serve it ice cold so it doesn't melt. Almost like a custard or panne cotta in texture signature item. All about the texture. Must try. The tartness lingers and evolves as the custard is warmed up in your mouth. 

Great experience. A lot cheaper than flying to Florida. I have a small understanding why this place is famous. Great people\/service running the operation. Food may not appeal to all palates\/styles. I can understand the variation in reviews. $150.00\/person. Couldn't finish everything.",2,1,1

Just so that there is no confusion for people coming in the off months. Yes this place is a Joe's but it's NOT Joe's Stone Crab in Miami. They are technically not the same restaurant, according to our lovely, and very knowledgeable, waitress. 

Either way, it may seem weird to be a place with stone crab in the name and then not have it sometimes. Stone crabs are seasonal though so...the more you know. I don't think this place merits low ratings just because people are not aware of this fact.

Luckily we came right at the start of the season so we had our fill of stone crabs claws and Alaskan king crab legs. 
Service here was spectacular and we were seated at the most perfect booth off in the corner. It felt very private and secluded but we were still able to see the whole restaurant and were never ignored by the staff. 

Everything was brought out at the perfect time, at the right temperature and we had everything we needed. All the crab was well cracked and easy to eat, and that mustard sauce was as good as I remember it being in Miami. 

I would recommend the steaks or the sole with the brown butter sauce. They filet it at the table and it is absolutely delicious.

She was friendly, helpful, and frankly delightful.  She has this lovely London accent, and it was very pleasant chatting with her - at length and on topics ranging far beyond the menu.  But she was also serious about wanting us to enjoy every aspect of our meal.  This was not the typical waiter mumbling ""is everything okay?"" as he speeds past your table.  Linda was seriously concerned that everything was perfect, and anxious to fix anything that wasn't.  She even told us about a shortcut that shaved 15 minutes off of our trek back to the Caesar's Palace parking lot, without having to walk all the way through the Forum Shops.  (By the way, we also learned that the better way to come by car is to park with Joe's own valet at the entrance off the Strip.)

As this was our first visit to Joe's, our first impression of the food was going to be the bread basket.  Check.  A very nice assortment of fresh bread, rolls, and flatbread.  I was not prepared to do the laborious claw-cracking that would have come with ordering the house specialty Stone Crabs, but I did want to try the crab so I started with the crab cake appetizer.  I don't really expect to find Maryland-quality crab cakes anywhere in Vegas, and I still don't, but this crab cake was quite good.  Plump lumps of crab without too much filler.  Still focused on the crab, my next course was a small cup of the crab bisque.  It was excellent.  Just the right amount of crab flavor.  (Actually, the small cup was not on the menu, but Linda to the rescue - she arranged for a cup rather than a bowl of the soup, so I could save appetite for the main course.)  Which was... Chilean Sea Bass.  A very nice piece of fish, perfectly cooked.  My only quibble is that the Miso glaze, although flavorful, left the top of the fish tasting a bit over-salty.  If I was awarding Michelin stars, this small imperfection might have been an issue.  But these are Yelp! stars, and I'm still giving 5 of them.

My wife had the seafood salad.  My wife is a bit picky about her ingredients, but there was Linda again - going over each component of the salad, and getting the kitchen to hold all the ingredients that were not to my wife's taste.  She loved the salad.  We also shared a side of hash brown potatoes, which was plenty big for two people - we couldn't finish it.  The hash browns were unusual - a mound of potatoes that was very crispy on top, but light and fluffy inside.  My wife and I both enjoyed them very much.

Joe's is very popular, but also very large.  Don't be fooled by the small bar area and patio, which is what you see as you walk in.  After 5 p.m. the main dining rooms open, with lots of tables.  Somehow Joe's does a good job of packing a lot of tables into their space, without making it feel crowded and still keeping down the noise level.  I found the decor to be very comfortable, without much decoration.  A mural-sized photo of the original Joe's in Miami, and a few photographs on one wall, were the extent of the adornments in our dining room, and that was fine for me.

Finally, price...  I thought our meal was a very good value.  Even with cocktails and wine, we were out the door for well under $200.  That's pretty good for a restaurant that Yelp! rates with three $$$.  There are a lot of good values on the menu, and you could easily eat at Joe's on a reasonable budget.  Give it a try.",1,0,0

After all the great food (Four Seasons room service and catering, Sonic) I wasn't sure what we were going to do.  The Girl had to make a return to the James Perse store so we made our trek after checkout (amen for having a rental car this time) to the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  It was insanely crowded being Saturday afternoon of Memorial Day weekend so we had to park pretty far.  We had about 2 hours to find something to eat so after much deliberation we decided on Joe's Seafood because it was near James Perse.

The wait was long but when we went up the maitre'd looked at me and said ""You look familiar, have you been here a few times?"".  Of course, me being the honest fellow but not wanting to upset the dood and just wanting to get a leg up on everyone else, I said ""Yes!""  So it APPEARS he put us at the bottom of the top sheet where there were clearly no open spots left.  w00t.

After about a 30-minute wait (by the time we got in, the wait was up to a hour ... this was 2pm), we got seated.  Service was a bit slow but the food was pretty good.  You have to get the stone crab claws.  They're served cold but with a little lemon and sauce and they are just fantastic.  They crack the claws for you so it's on hassle, just be careful not to inhale small pieces.  The bread is good as well and the onion strings are light and crispy and highly seasoned but insanely addictive.  We also shared a ribeye which looks amusing like Salisbury steak on a cafeteria plate but was decent.

The place is a bit pricey but it's pretty good.  You really should try it if you get the chance.

We ordered the lunch special which had king crab legs, a side of potatoes, and a side of corn. I can't remember the exact name, but the corn was sooo tasty. The sides were plenty for us to share. We ordered the medium stone crabs, too. It was our first time trying that but I think I prefer king crab legs. Ohh.. the lunch special included dessert for each of us, too. Even though we were full, the server insisted we at least try a small piece of the desserts. We ended up spending much less than we figured we would (and we were plenty full) which is a plus!",0,0,0

We were there at 3:10 PM so we decided to have lunch instead of dinner. I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered the fish tacos. The fish served with the fish and chips was horribly over cooked, there were 3 pieces of fish each weighed maybe an ounce each, they were full size pieces, just over cooked so badly that there was nothing left, the chips were just the standard steak fries that are served at about every nickel and dime restaurant across the country, nothing special. At $21.95 I expected something better than this.
My wife said the fish tacos were just ok, there were 2 tacos and some broccoli, nothing special, you can get better at Applebee's or Denny's for about $8.00, we paid $17.95 at Joe's. Add in $3.50 each for a couple of iced teas and our bill came to $50.70 less tip.

The food was pretty bad. The house favorite, butter seared scallops were god awful. As was the veal. The fish sandwich looked like something you got at a fast food joint.

We went here for a late lunch.  So because I was dining with a group this time, I got to try more food shared by others around the table.  I got to try their Hashed Brown and Fried Asparagus. Both were good and had surprisingly huge portions for side dishes.  I don't have any pics of them unfortunately, but the Hashed Brown was interesting since it was shaped like an armadillo.

The last two visits here had me ordering their Large Size Crab Claws.  This time around I was little more frugal and opted for the Select Size Crab Claws (http:\/\/bit.ly\/2iy9cdN).  Even though it was just slightly smaller and one more claw than the Large Size, Select Size was still a good portion size.  But there was definitely a lot more labor involved in removing the shells.  Nonetheless, it was still enjoyable and I love dipping the sweet crab meat in Joe's signature mustard sauce.

They no longer dry-age their steak.  They now wet-age their steak.  This new method of vacuum sealing their meat does not hurt the taste or change the complexity of flavor.  There still is a rich meaty like taste.  The bone-in is the best cut, especially when you get to chew on the bone.

We also got Brocollini and Potatoes.  It was okay, but nothing special.  Finally, the Key Lime Pie is outstanding!  It's cold and it's creamy.  The flavors of the tart lime, creamy whipped cream, and textured graham cracker crust work in harmony together.

So, imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw the Las Vegas destination listed on OpenTable.  I made a note of this exciting fact and convinced my friend to try it during our trip to the crazy city.

The lunch hour brought a substantial crowd to the outpost at Casear's Palace, and we had to wait quite a while only to grab two stools at the packed bar.  Our busy and bland waitress\/bartender did little to speed up our dining adventure.  We dug through our varied bread basket, each new roll or flat bread an exciting discovery.  

We each ordered the Seafood Chopped Salad, the dish that Joe's had won me over with.  The large bowl of mixed greens was topped with slices of hard-boiled egg, cubes of cheese, and various fresh vegetables.  Large succulent shrimp, flavorful lobster claw meat, and chunky Alaskan King Crab were scattered throughout the plate.  The shellfish tasted fresh from the sea, perfectly crisp and tender.  In terms of dressing, I had requested the Joe's Vinaigrette on the side, but was told that it usually comes with the creamy Italian instead.  However, the waitress offered to bring me a cup of each, which I was so thankful for.  The house dressing was more like an oily, garlicky salsa with chunks of ripe tomato.  The Italian vinaigrette was also delicious, with a light-bodied seasoning.  Since the Joe's version contained vegetable pieces, you could basically spice up your salad with drizzles of each.  This fresh meal was what health food dreams are made of, and the bread basket alone is reason enough to dine here.

1.  Kushi Oysters on a half shell - These are my favorite type of oysters.  Slightly sweet with a firm meaty texture.  They were on the smaller side size wise, but the flavor was great.
2.  Select Stone Crabs with Joe's Mustard Sauce - Stone crabs are always awesome.  They're already cracked for you and you dip it in their rich and creamy mustard sauce.  With it being so creamy and rich, it's almost as if they whipped it with butter and cream.
3.  Bone-in Filet Mignon - We ordered this ""rare plus.""  It was eye rolling fantastic.  Super tender and cooked to perfection.
4.  Sweet Corn (Pan Roasted) - the sweet corn just barely charred and tossed in oh so fabulous butter.  buttaaahhhhh

Same fantastic service we experienced over Christmas.  The staff go out of their way to provide quality service. 

I had the Alaskan King Crab and Fillet  (AMAZING) and my wife had the giant crab cakes.... she loved them. A couple of sides and desert... wow what a great meal!

I went to Joe's this past weekend to celebrate my girlfriends birthday.  She loves crab, so I thought the perfect restaurant would be Joe's Stone Crab. Neither of us have ever had stone crabs before.  We had a 9PM reservation on Saturday night. After ordering, the waiter came back and informed us that they had run out of stone crabs. At first I thought he was joking, but then I realized he was completely serious.  I was initially shocked and then thoroughly disappointed that the special plans I made were now ruined.  So we canceled the stone crabs we had ordered, and the stone crabs that were in the ""Whale"" appetizer were substituted with a small piece of Alaskan King Crab (I felt they could have done a lot more than that).  Is a 9PM dinner in Las Vegas on a Saturday night really that late of a dinner - should I have anticipated this shortage? I don't think I should have. Let this be a warning to all that come for the claws - come early or else!

I understand that the logistics of flying in a perishable product fresh every day. I do get that - I'm a rational\/logical person. It doesn't change the fact that I was initially very upset, which just turned into major disappointment on this special occasion.  I mean, it's called ""Joe's Stone Crab"".  It's in the freaking name!  How can you run out of the very product you're named after? (That's a tongue in cheek, rhetorical question by the way - I've already acknowledged understanding the logistics.)

For what it's worth, the food and service were good. Although my lobster was a bit dry on the edges (especially given the price), the sides and dessert were very good. The other food that I had sampled (NY Strip) was good as well, but if you can't cook a steak properly in Vegas, you may just as well shut your doors.  My friends all enjoyed their food and drink (although since I was footing the bill, they wouldn't have said otherwise so, who knows!). The highlights were the loaded roasted corn (excellent), hashbrowns, and the peanut butter pie (skip the banana cream pie).  They were nice enough to bring my girlfriend a dessert at the end for her birthday (although this was after we had ordered two desserts to share among five of us). I guess it was a nice gesture, but why didn't they offer that before we ordered dessert? We just took it with us, and it wasn't very good the next day.

The service was friendly and unobtrusive.  The waiter deterred us from getting two different versions of the hashbrowns as they portions are very large, and we were very glad he did. The restaurant added an automatic gratuity of 18% for our table of five, which I'm glad the waiter pointed out to me. I found this a little odd, because I think in the long run, automatic gratuity for small parties doesn't favor the waitstaff. I typically tip about 20% on the pre-tax subtotal because it's easy to calculate, so I wasn't taken back by it either.

I feel like I could have had the same steak and lobster type dinner at one of two dozen restaurants in Vegas, without the long walk through the Caesar's mall (ten-fifteen minute walk from taxi to restaurant) and the bitter disappointment at the beginning of the meal.  Would I have gone to this restaurant knowing they didn't have Stone Crabs? Certainly not.  Will I attempt to dine there again in the future?  Probably not at that location. I will wait until I make it to Miami so I can have reasonable assurance they will not run out of stone crabs.",4,1,1

We have never made (nor needed) a reservation. The d√©cor is reminiscent of a refined private club, although it is not at all stuffy. There are televisions in the bar, but they are neither loud nor intrusive. Several time we have enjoyed the same bartender, who is just the right combination of friendly and professional.

I can see that dinner might be pricey, but lunch is reasonable, likely because we usually order two appetizers each, or a sandwich and an appetizer. My favourite is the ""Second Mortgage"", which includes stone crab, jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail and shrimp and scallop ceviche served cracked on ice. It was approximately sixteen dollars on our last trip. 

As I have allergies and cannot eat the ceviche, they always put on the side for my dining companion. Allergy alert: I always explain it in detail, and they always get it right. Recognizing that we might share, when his food comes out,  they point out what I cannot have from his plate, unsolicited. Those of you with allergies will recognize these as two signs of a good restaurant. They will provide you with a lovely bread basket on request. 

Do order a gin-and-tonic, as they use a premium tonic (Stirrings), and it does make a difference.

The decor of the restaurant is very classy and upscale. The mood is lounge-like due to ambient lighting and Dark-wood furniture. Our waiter was very nice and he reviewed all the specials, provided the wine list, bread, and informed us of crab selection (which Joe's is known for.) He was helpful in answering our questions about specific menu items and promptly took our order.

I personally had the crabcakes and the Joe's coleslaw. Both were amazing!!! The crabcakes had a nice big chunks of crab and it tasted super fresh! The coleslaw had vinegar base but it's still had a sweetness to it and then they added tomato which changed up the taste that it was still great! I also had a glass of Moscato which was smooth and sweet and very light just as I asked. (Additional notes on the food....

For dinner, I ordered the Beef Tenderloin Sandwich and substituted sweet potato fries for regular (at no additional cost).  Joe's serves this sandwich akin to sliders, with three small sandwiches on the plate.  The tenderloin was excellent quality, and the bread it was served on was phenomenal.  One other person in my party ordered the Ribeye Sandwich, also from the Bar Menu, and was able to substitute a salad for fries.  This sandwich is served on a sub-type roll.  A very good quality sandwich as well.  We ordered grilled asparagus as a side, which I would say was the only disappointing part of the meal.  It's not that the asparagus was bad, but I feel they charge too much for the quantity given.  When it came time for dessert, the waitress explained they are all homemade.  I had several questions, which she patiently answered and described in further detail the desserts I asked about.  She also explained that each dessert is large enough to share, and they also have ""half sizes"" not listed on the menu.  I decided to share the Chocolate Fudge cake, which was heavenly.

I've been to Cut and other super expensive steakhouses.  I've had steaks that are $100 + (steak should never be that much).  When the steakhouse is that expensive, everything else is pricy too.  The total cost of one meal would be close to $150 per person at those places.  The quality is also good but nothing spectacular.

Joe's steaks, filet mignon, lamb chops, glazed cod, etc. are all excellent!  The prices are reasonable.  The sides are great.  The stone crabs are delicious as well.  The atmosphere is nice too.

Everything at Joe's is quality and delicious.  You can try a bunch of entrees (steak, crab, lamb, cod) and sides (lobster bisque, salads, cream corn, jeanies potatoes) with a party of 5 and only pay $50 per person.

I've never had a mealy crab before. I didn't like the texture. The flavor was good.

According to the menu, one crab claw was ripped from each crab on the boat, and the crab was then released. I'm guessing that the claw has to be frozen with this technique.  I'm accustomed to having the whole crab just boiled live. Maybe mealy crab is something to get accustomed to for sustainability?",1,2,0

BF wanted to get some real quality Alaskan King Crab Legs and I wanted raw oysters

~ The Order ~

Alaskan King Crab Legs - $59.95
-  First, the order was huge..I mean I know it is only 1lb but damn..
-  He usually loves the crabs at the Wynn but these are so much more fresh, less waterly, and sweeter
- Waiter said they are flown in everyday fresh

Oysters on the Half Shell - $13.95
 - Small but very plump & yummy

Mac & Cheese - $7.95
- This was soo good..it was creamy and little crunch topping
- I forget ..it was a white cheese..think it was gorgonzola or something not cheddar

Half Peanut Butter Pie - $3.95
- if you love PB this is for you cuz it is very very rich and creamy
- best part is the half size is still pretty big & sharable

~ Other Comments ~
- Service was great
- Nice to sit in the bar area & watch TV and chill
- half size for most of their desert

Joe's is my favorite Vegas restaurant and for good restaurant. They offer some of the best and freshest seafood around and they offer one of the best seafood items in Stone Crab Claws. The restaurant became famous from their original location in Florida and has since branched off with locations in DC, Vegas and Chicago. Joe's in Vegas is an absolute must visit for their amazing food, their amazing service and their great ambiance. Unfortunately, with all three being an integral part of the success of the restaurant, the prices are on the high side but completely worth the splurge.

The food:

Stone Crab Claws- These are the reason you visit and they are exceptional. The claws are cracked three times making them easy to eat and they have a nice sweet flavor with a really nice meaty texture. The Joe's Mustard Sauce, which is basically a Remoulade sauce, makes the perfect pairing to the crab. Remoulude is kinda like a spicy mayo with herbs, Remoulade is my favorite sauce and it is magic with the crab.They offer three different sizes for the claws and I tried the Select and Large. There is a pretty big difference in price but I did like the Large the best. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=svdUJuyjnV2Th5mT9ocCfg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Colossal Lump Crab Cakes- I love crab cakes and these were perfect. I say this is either one or two for the best crab cakes I ever had with the other being Faidley's out in Baltimore, Maryland. The crab cakes were so perfectly moist with very little filling with a very nice outer crust. The bread crumb had a great texture with a slight crunch and the Remoulade went perfectly, but honestly, I don't even know if it was even necessary since the crab cakes were so perfect, as is. This crab cake had so much crab in it, it was heaven. This is a must get. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=42v3Dc8Wnocfe98Vso1Aug&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Half Dozen Kumamoto from Humboldt Bay, California- These were great, they had so much flavor and were so perfectly creamy and delicious. I didn't think I would ever say this since Kumamtos are my fav oyster but the previous two items almost made the oysters irrelevant, even though they were great. The above two items were just that magical. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=9RdQSoZ4MulGnoaJp-ryOg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Key Lime Pie- Their famous dessert is their Key Lime Pie and it was excellent. I really loved the smooth texture and great mouth feel, I typically love crunchier crust so the one here was perfect for me. The filling had a good subtle tart flavor but I was expecting it to be a tad more tarty. The one thing that did surprise me was how god damn cold the pie came out, it was basically brain blacking out cold. lol https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=rmUq6Fk1nhjF2zx7H4YyFw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA",18,10,10

We sat ""outside"" so we could people watch and the host was quite entertaining as he interacted with everyone.

Food we ordered:

Crab bisque - on the salty side, but a generous portion and great with the bread assortment. we could have done without it. 

Stone crab legs (medium) - 1000x yes! I got the smallest ones due to the lowest price but I didn't have a problem deshelling these and I typically don't eat crab due to that hurdle. 

Pork shank - For a turf choice, this was amazing. Fall off the bone tender and the rich red wine sauce was perfect. 

Creamed spinach - Salted perfectly and exactly what I wanted it to be. They give a good portion so was probably a heavy choice given the entrees we ordered though. 

Key lime pie - Packed with lime flavor! It is really a great way to end the meal, though the sourness did shock me in the first bite. Subsequent bites got better. Even though I was stuffed to the brim, I was able to stomach about half of it, due to the tart light nature. 

Service was impeccable. Never had to ask for a water refill! I'm that person who drinks a few cups (or several) during a meal. The waiter was friendly and gave us positive reinforcement after we ordered which left me excited to try the meal and I wasn't let down at all.

The portions were large enough that everyone had at least a few bites of each.  They were all excellent, perfectly seasoned and cooked right. Even the spinach didn't taste like mush.
 
Next, we had the Madagascar shrimp, which was THE best I've had...period.  The shrimp was HUGE and very tasty.  It had the smell of being fresh off the grill.  Finally, came the stone crabs...one of their signature items.  Now, I know the place is known for their stone crabs, but I still think the shrimp was better. Anyway, we had a huge order of it, so we all dug in. Now, since most of the others weren't big eaters (more for me), I was able to pig out.

Me and my colleague both got branzino. It was so good we devoured it. Great entree. The best entree that my other colleague got was their mixed seafood grill. I was so happy he gave me one of his scallops. From other reviews, I must say one of the best I've had. 

The entrees ain't cheap ($32-$39 range) and it doesn't come with any sides. We got sweet corn and asparagus. The corn was so flavorful I've could have eaten the side dish on my own.

Have made it a little tradition to stop by Joe's Seafood whenever possible. Each time we come here, we splurge. The last time we got to eat here, came with a party of 8, got a back room and went to town on steaks, crab, oysters, wine, the works. Didn't mind spending the money due to excellent service and food. This past visit, I arrived with my wife and 1 year old around 1:30pm. An older man greeted us at the entrance and asked how many in our party. I replied 2 adults and a baby. He said it would be at least an hour but that we could have been seated immediately in the bar area if the baby wasn't with us. I thought the comment odd and I could see that there were at least 3 open tables behind him, but didn't think much of it and gave him my name. We walk around the mall for a bit and my wife wondered if the guy thought we needed a table for four. Our baby is not found of high chairs so my wife usually sits him in her lap. We go back to Joe's and I ask the man if it would make any difference if it was only a table for two. He says it would not make a difference but sees me glancing behind him at the empty tables. He then tells me that we would need extra room for our stroller and the reiterates that if we didn't have our baby, we could sit at the bar. This makes absolutely no sense to me as I know that Joe's has room in the back for coat checks and our stroller folds up... and more than that, you want us to get rid of our baby to eat at your restaurant? 

At this point I could have made a scene, talked to the manager, yada yada yada. But did I want to fight with an old timer about spending several hundred dollars on lunch? (yeah, we go all out when we come here). I was about to thank the man but he was already looking past me to the next group of people. So my wife and I go upstairs to eat at sushi roku, which was surprisingly good and they were super friendly. The kicker is that after we ate, we went downstairs and passed by Joe's. The same tables were empty. 

The way he was talking to me I could chalk it up to a lot of things, racism (I'm not white), the way I was dressed (shorts and tshirt since we were on our way to the airport) or a couple with a really young kid (not appropriate for this venue). Bottom line is that he wasn't talking to me like a person but talking at me like an obstacle. 

Wouldn't be writing this but to say that Joe's has lost a customer for life. Go to conventions here every other year and our vendors give us a choice of restaurants. Used to recommend Joe's, but not anymore. Their food is good, sometimes even great on their on days, but part of the whole experience is the service. You can get good seafood and good food at plenty of places in Vegas. Number 1 rule is that you treat your customers with respect. I didn't get that here, and for me, that is enough to say never again.

I was a bit disappointed by this but realized I shouldn't be, as we had no reservations & didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes. 

The bread they bring to the table is really excellent, with various types including one that's much like a soft pretzel. Yum!

This place makes me drool just thinking about it. I love seafood, and with that being said, Joe's has ah-mazing crab legs. I've been here one other time a couple years back and remember the service being impeccable. (Literally, picked up a glass of water and by the time we set it down someone was there to refill it.)

This time we waited about 10-15 minutes after arriving right on time for our reservation at 8:30pm. We were seated in a cozy corner. Suzanne was the one who took care of us and she was great! She really knew the menu and gave us great advice on which wine we should pair with our food.

We ended up ordering a half order of the King Crab Legs as an appetizer, and they cut it fresh at the table. They were so easy to eat; all I had to do was lift off the outer shell and the meat fell out. It was so sweet and succulent. (Haha, another one of those dishes that I couldn't wait to eat, so there is no picture)

Then we had the 12oz Filet Mignon (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=uMtv5iEcifz9Jz4yFgtbsA&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw) cooked at Medium. They brought it out sliced for us to share (neither one of us were as hungry as we thought). We were also advised by Suzanne that the sides are very big so that we should probably do two half orders. We had corn and mashed potatoes (you see them both in the picture). 

Suzanne also had advised that the house wines were great choices, so we ordered a red and a white. (Pinot Noir & Sauvignon Blanc) Both paired wonderfully with our meal.

I'm not sure what they crusted over the mashed potatoes, pretty sure it's something cheesy. But whatever it is, it made the mashed potatoes to die for...

Lastly, for desert we decided to try the Havana Dream Pie (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=s_nMDYnX3GWgbQkpAthbWg&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw) I can't remember if she had said it's like or it is Tres Leches Cake. It was pretty good, I'm not big on desserts so it was alright.

Clam chowder - no complaint

Stone crabs - 70.45 market price for 6 large claws. I've definitely eaten better crab claws that are meatier, juicier and more fresh elsewhere in the world; namely Japan and Vancouver. I think it's overrated and not worth the money.

Dry aged rib-eye - not bad, cooked to medium as requested. 

Service - waiter is attentive. However I don't like how they brought all the dishes at the same time when I clearly told him that we will eat the stone crabs as an appetiser. By the time we were finished with the crabs the rib-eye got cold, think it would have tasted better warmer.

The host seated Craig and me outside on the patio, in a great location where we could people-watch. 

The free bread basket is artfully arranged and comes with 5 varieties of rolls and bread. My favorite was a thick, chewy pretzel stick....when I asked for another one our server brought us 3 more which I totally appreciated.

 It was about 100 degrees outside, and I was chugging water like a parched camel. They were wonderful about refilling our glasses quickly, and they brought me a little bowl of lemons to put in it. 

Although the bottle wine list is extensive, I  was the lone drinker at my table so a bottle was out of the question; I wish they had a few more options for single glasses. The Pinot Gris I tried was fairly good and paired nicely with my food, but it was the only option for Pinot Gris.I am not a huge fan of Chardonnay so I would have liked a few more options of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, etc.

The food was amazing though, which is why it still gets 5 stars. Craig is an unfortunately picky eater, but he absolutely gobbled up his steak sandwich. It came out beautifully grilled, and the fries were crispy and perfect. I ordered the seafood salad, and was impressed by the presentation and flavor. It had perfectly cooked juicy scallops, shrimp, and shreds of Alaskan King Crab on it, and the amount of dressing on it was just right and not overpowering. 

Between the glass of wine, his soda, my salad, and his sandwich, our bill was about $65...but it was a relaxing, leisurely lunch on our vacation, and the service was wonderful. I loved it and will definitely go back next time I am in Las Vegas.",3,1,2

Maybe I didn't get enough sleep the night before, maybe it was the wait on the runway flying here that seemed like an eternity, maybe it was the taxi driver that took a super long route to get to our hotel, or maybe the stone crabs just didn't live up to expectations. 

The main reason I chose to dine here over other steakhouses for the night (also because Tom Colicchio's new Heritage Steakhouse at the Mirage, which was supposed to open in July, hasn't yet --- August 19th straight from his twitter *crossing fingers*) was for the STONE CRABS. Look at the pictures, they look soooo gooood. I called them earlier in the day and they said I had em, in which case I was excited to try these bad boys. It was fortunate I made reservations in advance, this place was packed. 

When it came time to order, we asked about the infamous stone crabs and were told that they were frozen and she suggested another type of crab legs. The fact that she recommended something else made me a little hesitant but if we came here for the stone crabs, we're gonna get em no matter what. Turned out to be a bit of a mistake, as they were served noticeably thawed and while they were easy to peel, they lacked the WOW factor I was hoping for. I was told before I ordered them that they weren't in season right now and I understood the risk, so i take full responsibility for us not having the best first stone crab experience. I kinda wish I knew when I called in earlier though that they were frozen...oh wells.

I ordered the salmon, which was okay and nothing special. The steak looked really good and the house sea salt mixture that they brought with it was supposedly 'game changing.' Unfortunately, I was just too tired from everything that happened earlier that day that I wasn't in the mood for steak and didn't get to try it. We ordered some sides as well but I don't remember what they were LOL (i do remember sweet corn...that was good) Almost forgot but the lobster salad was very fresh and was big enough to share.

The restaurant itself is nicely lit and was very busy, even as we were leaving. I might come back another day when the stone crabs are in season and I'll order the steak, as it seemed to be well prepared. For now, I am earnestly waiting to try Heritage steakhouse when I head back in September.",5,1,2

While planning a great trip to the lovely Las Vegas area, Joe's crossed my list as one of the top places to eat--thanks to my fellow yelpers! I wanted to impress the hubby with a romantic dinner and amazing steak. And after much debt-- I decided Joe's would be it!

Let me say if you come in the main entrance of the Caesars Palace you are jacked and I hope you have on comfortable shoes! The restaurant is on the far end of the hotel and located in the shopping and eating plaza of the hotel. Make sure you ask somebody if you are not sure, or you will get an amazing amount of exercise before you eat. After our long hike from the beginning of the hotel to the restaurant, we finally made it to JOE'S (AHHHHH*** angel music in the background). There was a gentlemen hostess outside the restaurant behind a booth --who was taking seating request for people as they came up to the restaurant (there was a wait). Luckily for the hubby and I, I made reservations a few days in advance. The host escorted us into the restaurant and into a second check in area and a second dining room area for those who made reservations. This area was kind of sectioned off and I felt very exclusive! After the second host confirmed our name we were immediately seated. The set up and decorations of Joe's is so upscale, I felt like I traveled back in time to the early 1900s and dining at the classist establishment in Vegas. The lighting is dim and romantic and the waiters all wear full tuxedos. 

The hubby and I were seated in a cushiony booth and immediately given water and bread from the sub server. After a couple of minutes our waiter made his way to our table and went through the menu and what the day's specials were. I placed an order for a glass of wine and the hubby ordered water (not sure what wine I ordered--its Vegas and I had a few before I got there). The wine was very good-- I do know that much. Everything sounded so good on the menu, I couldn't decide what to order. I ended up ordering the King Crab Louis Salad and the Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs. The hubby ordered the filet mignon steak. The salad was so amazing and fresh! It was the best crab salad I have ever had! The Jumbo crab legs I could have gone without-- the market price was 20 or 30 bucks and I only received like a piece of 2 legs--it looked like an appetizer--but I guess that's what is served at upscale places. We also ordered a side of steamed asparagus and mac and cheese. Everything was just amazing and mouth watering and our server was on point from the time we came till the very end of our meal. My husband's water was never empty and we were completely tended to by the waiter and the servers. His steak was also made to perfection and very juicy. This was an excellent restaurant and I will def. go again when I visit the Vegas area.

Their stone crab offering was pitiful I guess.  From San Diego, I can goto the docks and pickup stone crab for $2.50 per stone crab, and I eat the whole thing (not just the big claw).  Here they were essentially charging $5 per claw, and that's it.  

So ignoring the ridiculous stone crab, we ate this family style.  We came with a party of 10.  We ordered a few 24oz dry aged rib eyes which were very tasty.  They pre-sliced them into strips for us which was great for sharing. 

We ordered enough King Crab legs for everyone to get a leg and some knuckles.  

We ordered pretty much 1 of every side, along with some pork belly, shrimps and scallops.  We made quite a dent.  Someone had gotten lucky at the tables and paid for dinner, but I'm going to guess we spent about $100\/head, and the food was great and we all left extremely stuffed. 

They comped us some free spring onions, which were also pretty tasty :)


From everything we tried, I'd definitely recommend the dry aged rib eye (although you can get good steak almost everywhere on the strip these days.. I'm not gonna lie and say their steak was better than what you could have gotten at CraftSteak, Carnevino, Cut, Delmonico, Prime, etc...) and the king crab was good.  For the sides, I wasn't a huge fan of the fried asparagus, but I did enjoy the spring onions and broccolini.

Service was fast and professional. We were given our drinks and a complimentary bread assortments right away. We ordered Crab Cake, Fillet Mignon 8oz, and Lobster Tail. 

The Crab Cake was really good, and it was a nice start to our meal. It was served with a creamy sauce with a little horseradish kick at the end. 

The Lobster Tail was exquisite! Our server, Thomas, was nice enough to mention that they have changed the style of how they cook their lobsters so that it is now more tender than it was before. 

The Fillet Mignon was good, but a little under seasoned for my liking. It came with a salt based seasoning on the side, but I wasn't a big fan of it and I asked for steak sauce instead. They only had A1 sauce, which was alright with me. Perhaps my opinion of the steak is biased because my last steak I had was real Kobe beef in Japan, which was hands down the best steak I'll ever have lol

Our total was about $140, which I think is reasonable. Overall, I highly recommend Joe's, and I'll definitely be coming back!",0,0,0

As locals, we go to Joe's 5-6 times a year for pleasure and business, usually the food and service is outstanding, last night, for Christmas dinner, it was horrendous on both fronts. We made reservations about a week in advance.  They called us that morning to confirm - then told us they could not find our reservation on the phone.  When we arrived, they told my wife they could not find the reservation, when my wife offered to show the confirmation number on her mobile phone the host says ""let me do my job.""  After 3 minutes he then asks to see the confirmation number.  We finally get seated, and it gets worse.

We order dinner, drinks, and appetizers.  25 minutes after taking our order we are informed that the whole maine lobster is no longer available, we had ordered 2.  We then re-order. lobster tails and chiliean sea bass.  When the food arrives, our side dishes are missing.  One lobster tail was over-cooked, one under-cooked, and the seabass was bland.  The sides finally arrived more than mid-way through our entrees - the waitress apologizes, and says the sides will be taken off the bill.  We had also asked for refills on the bread - three times, which finally arrives when the plates are cleared.

The manager comes over, and acts annoyed that he has to apologize for the service and food.  Naturally when the bill comes, the sides are not taken off.   We were so bothered by the lack of concern, we paid the bill and left.  It will be awhile before we return to Joe's.",10,1,1

I got the Filet and Lobster-tail, Hash Brown Potatoes, Crispy Brussels Sprouts. He then introduced me to the best dessert I've ever had- the Havana Dream Pie. We also got Key Lime Pie and Boston Cream Pie. One thing they don't tell you on the menu is that you can get half slices of the pie. And the desserts are very reasonably priced at $4.50 per half slice. Everything we had was amazing with the exception of the filet that didn't really impress me. The hash brown potatoes, crispy Brussels sprouts, and Havana Dream Pie are all to die for!

With my parents in town this week, i decided to go again and also bring the wife along. 

For the appetizer we went with the calamari. In all honesty, the best I've ever had. The bread they bring out before the meal is exceptional. I'm not positive but it must be baked in house. SO fresh. My favorites are the regular roll, the pretzel roll, and the cornbread. You will not be disappointed! 

This time for the entree, I decided to go with the bone-in ribeye. It was definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had. Highly recommend it! My wife got the skirt steak which she really loved and I had a piece of it and can concur that it was also very good. My parents also went with the ribeye but without the bone. Again, we got the hash brown potatoes and crispy brussels sprouts which were awesome.

Havana Dream and Banana Cream again for desert. Half slices again, which are plenty. I can't even believe full slices are an option as big as the halves are. 

The service is grade A, as you expect at this type of establishment. 

Hands down, my favorite steakhouse right now and I highly recommend you go if you're looking for a great dining experience in Vegas.",3,0,4

I agree with Keith, the food is a bit pricey--those little stone crab claws are reaching for the loot.  Though, I think $36 for a 12oz USDA Prime filet mignon is a great deal!

Starting from the beginning, we were seated immediately (being a Tuesday evening, things on the Strip aren't too lively).  The wait staff are very neatly dressed in suits with white linen napkins draped over their arms.  We were told the specials and were even given recommendations from our knowledgable waiter.  Let it be known, he never tried to up-sell us or push menu items on us, which I think is very professional.

We share a caesar which was nothing fancy.  It consisted of the normal chopped romaine, croutons, and large thin slices of parmesan, all tossed in a very light caesar dressing (almost similar to a vinigrette).  It seemed like a small portion, even for being the ""shared"" size.

My entree was the 12oz filet mignon which was cooked to perfection--medium.  It was at least an 1 1\/2"" thick!  Todd ordered the petite filet with stone crab.  This was the first time Todd has eaten stone crab and he isn't quite sure what all the hype is about?  While he had his own petite filet, he also tried mine and said, ""I think my steak was better.""  Overall, our entrees were plated very nicely but kind of lacked flavor.  

Our sides with our meals consisted of:
1) pan roasted sweet corn--simple, yet good
2) steamed asparagus with lemon butter--needed seasoning, bland
3) macaroni & cheese--very good, baked, light crumb topping

It's an old warhorse of Vegas, and well....it might not be at the top trend of 'look how cool we are' but it still kicks ass when it comes to delivering a meal. I've only been once and that night was with my family and a few family friends. We'd started at the bar drinking and had spent the entire day drinking and continued drinking...so there might be a bit of a memory lapse here...because we ended up drinking at Casa Fuente right after too. 

Joe's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Vegas thus far, and absolutely one of my favorite steakhouses I've ever been too (I'd say second favorite behind a Kansas City place). We did just about everything off the menu. Everyone save for myself got crab appetizers (I don't do seafood) 

By then, I'd had a few scotches in me and we were opening up the wine. This was a big trip for everyone; trade show for me, trade show for dad, youngest brother just turned 21. We'd been planning on this trip for over a year as it was the first time all of us had been together since last Thanksgiving. 

Joe's is the go-to place for many in workspace my dad is in; they've been going here for close to 20 years. Hilariously enough everyone in the industry basically was there, either eating on the 'exterior' area or in the actual restaurant. I'd wager some of the staff probably got to see really expensive knives :\/. I was in town for SHOT, so I was exhausted as hell. 

This place basically propelled what was an amazing trip into one of the best family vacations any of us had been on, and that's including trips to the Caribbean and the EU. Why, you ask? 

Service put up with us because half of us were well-dressed inebriated mid-20-something kids hanging during trade show season on a Saturday night. Our server, who's name I do forget, was fantastic and she did her job well. Right up there with what you expect for this town, if not more. 

The steak is the best steak in Vegas I've had thus far. Sure, haven't been to Robuchon or Delmonico...but hearing anecdotal stories from family\/friends most everyone continues to talk up Joe's. Every single male at our table ordered the NY Strip because that's how you do a damn steakhouse. We ordered about every potato option I think, and most of the veggies. 

Nothing made it out alive. I seriously watched my brother cry happily in the corner as we were all having a meal none of us were going to forget. Mind you, we're from KC and we eat out a lot....we've had it nice and it's hard to impress every member of my family. This place was nothing new to the older crowd, who were all having their favorite steak in Vegas already, but my two brothers and I were having an experience. 

Basically; Joe's definitely is one of the best steaks in the country. 

Going to Casa Fuente afterwards and then to some electronica concert at the MGM made this one of the best nights ever.

I ordered the colossal crab cakes for my main dish and was surprised it was only two crab cakes, kind of disappointed, but realized after the first bite that it's very filling, all crab meat and not much filler!

So when I had a chance to try it in Vegas at the very  restaurant I saw it on 5 years ago, (the original is in Miami ) I did not hesitate. Mind you this is my thanksgiving dinner,and expectations were quite high. We were greeted warmly and from the beginning treated like we were valued guests. Our waiter whose name is Perry deserves 6 stars because he was probably the best waiter I  have encountered in my life. He passion for food  and friendly advice made our experience unparalleled. Now let actually talk about the food.  They started us of with a bread basket which contains 4 different selections, the  best in my opinion was the cracker bread followed closely by the pretzel roll. We ordered spinach stuffed  mushrooms and they are amazing! We both had the select stone crab about  one pound,  and my God  are they delicious. Being from San Francisco I have always thought dungeness crab was the best . But as of right now I give the nod to the stone crab. It is served with Joe's special mustard which is great, but I asked for some cocktail sauce,  which hands down the best I have ever had. For  our  side we tried the lyonais potatoes very good.

This is one of the few places I know that serves the Florida Stone Crab claws. The first time I had them I was amazed at how sweet and fresh the claw meat taste. I have eaten my share of crabs, and I think these claws are by far the best. They are served with a unique, sweet mustard sauce.

The stone crab claws are considered sustainable seafood. This means the seafood is harvested with consideration of the environment and the future of the species. The stone crabs are found in the waters along the coast of south Florida. Fishermen catch and release the crab after taking one of it's claws. The second claw is left intact so the crab can survive while it regenerates the missing claw. It is nice to know that steps are being taken to preserve the futre of stone crabs, and that a crab didn't die in vain.

One of my associates made a reservation for the six of us attending a trade show at the convention center and picked Joe's for dinner one night. I really never had the chance to read the reviews so I really walked in blind. We arrived a little late for our scheduled time but we were immediately seated and from that moment on it was incredible. 

Our server greeted us and took our drink orders and interacted with our entire group like she had known us for years. I started with my usual Ketel One Martini up, a little dirty with cheese stuffed olives it came out ice cold and filled to the brim. Although it's a rather simple drink to make some struggle, so by no means are they all created equal. The way I see it the difference between the okay ones and the outstanding ones are some are just poured and some are crafted it was apparent after the first sip this was definitely a crafted one that was executed by a professional mixologist. I validated this by enjoying several more and they all were outstanding as the first.

I ordered raw oysters on the half shell for my appetizer from a impressive selection of oysters that are flown in daily, they came out very clean with most of the natural liquor retained requiring nothing but a slight dash of Tabasco and a hint of horseradish. There was plenty of time to enjoy these along with our first round of refreshments since they we're delivered and eaten before our salads orders were taken absolutely no rush here our server's timing was impeccable.  We had our second round of cocktails delivered while we place our second course selections - I chose the Pork Belly Wedge Salad with ranch dressing, a hint of balsamic vinegar, vine ripened tomatoes and may-tag blue cheese crumbles. Again I can't stress enough this salad was a creation in itself perfectly assembled on a chill plate with exact portions of each ingredient. The pork belly was crisp, succulent and plentiful this is nothing remotely similar to the typical BLT wedge salad so common at so many restaurants. 

Once we had a few moments to enjoy these wonderful salads we were advised to put in our entree orders. The steak and seafood selections are amazing and I'm sure anything I'd pick would be wonderful but the Prime Cut Bone-in Filet was taunting my palette and having this special cut prepared a few degrees over rare was impossible to resist, this accompanied by grilled verse steam asparagus my experience was only going to improve by leaps and bounds if that was possible after experience the first two courses. It's such a treat to have a server who understands her clientele and being this was a business meeting she was very attentive but was able to break in at precisely the right times to explain the specials, take the drink orders or to simple ensure our evening was proceeding as we had hoped and update us on the delivery of our food. 

The entrees arrived fresh from the kitchen warm and accurate the portions were extreme, we also had multiple sides to share amongst the 6 of us and really there was more food than any of us could have eaten no matter the time frame. I decided to pass on the shared sides and focus my attention on the bone-in filet which was prepared to my exact specifications (if you've never experience this cut its a bucket list item for sure) fortunately I've been able to have this cut many times over the years even though it not a common cut you can find at just any Steakhouse. 

These Bone-in, Prime Grade, Filet Mignons are at the top of my list when it comes to that magical blend of tender, juicy, and flavorful.Trimmed perfectly and generously portioned, this steak is begging for a rare to medium rare preparation. Unlike a Filet Mignon on it's own, this steak is best cooked slow to maximize the flavor that comes from a bone-in steak and this was one of the best examples I've ever cut into. After experiencing this grand finale of a steak it would be pointless to continue, Joe's far exceeded any expectations I had and this meal will surely be mentioned in future conversations with my small group of associates when we're looking for our next exquisite dining adventure...enjoy!",22,13,20

I don't gamble...
This was the first time I've been to Vegas since...
well... before I was 21.

I still didn't gamble and I had TWO drinks at the lounge earlier tonight O_O

I thought to myself, at first, that Vegas should have decent food right???

After a couple days of culinary disappointment, I found myself very glad to have Saturday night dinner be at my place of choice.

The bread basket, though cold, was still enjoyable.

Appetizer: Crab bisque was delightful; rich, creamy, and filled with chunks of crab.
I was thoroughly satisfied.

Entree: My 20 oz bone-in rib eye, per James L.'s recommendation, was the piece of culinary delight I had been waiting for since my trip began. I was even lucky enough to have at least two bites of that delicious, creamy steak fat with the crispy edges. I enjoyed the steak so much that I intentionally spilled some steak juices on my shirt so that I could enjoy my steak later that night. 

Tip: Use the salt seasoning that accompanies the steak very conservatively!
Our server offered me a side of bernaise sauce which complimented the steak rather nicely ^_^

Dessert: Oh my my...
Key Lime Pie is one of my favorite desserts and Joe's is the best I've ever had!
The perfectly balanced sweet and sour, lime filling was supported by the most perfectly crumbly graham cracker crust...

I moaned so loud that an older couple turned around in shock\/abhorrence;
I guess they did not deem such pleasured moans appropriate within of confines of the restaurant. My server, Darrel, however, was more than thrilled that we enjoyed our meals.

My friend got the ""Havanna Dream"" which was Joe's rendition of a Tres Leches cake that was almost as orgasmic as my key lime pie.

My portion of the bill only added up to about $80ish after tip... :)
I was more than happy with what I paid for.

From this point on, trips to Vegas will never be complete without a proper meal at Joe's.",11,13,10

With all the ridiculous ""National ____ Days"" dedicated to superfluous foods like cheese doodles (March 5th) and stupid specific eats like cherry popsicles (August 26th), it's about time you stepped in and made executive decisions on something that is clearly getting out of hand.  Who the hell is rejoicing over a cheese doodle that isn't still living in their parents basement playing N64?  What if I choose to have a blue flavored popsicle on 8\/26?  Will Destiny's Child come out of nowhere and start singing ""No, No, No""? 

October 15th is WIDE OPEN.  It's the officially the first day of Florida stone crab season!  I am sure you have sampled these incredible claws at a fancy dinner or two during your tenure as the leader of the free world.  You cannot deny that they are some of the most delicious crustaceans on the planet!

So in love with these claws I am, here is my proposal:

- 10\/15 will be a federal holiday and be known as ""National Stone Crab Day"".  Even for vegetarians.   

- Instead of only celebrating the day with bullshit Facebook posts, I was thinking something more along the lines of New Year's Eve.  There would be fireworks, confetti, and instead of holding a glass of champagne, everyone will have a large crab claw from Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  They will bite in it when the clock strikes midnight.  

- I've already drafted letters to several high standing Nevada officials about closing Las Vegas Boulevard that evening to throw a parade that will end at Joe's at Caesars Palace.  Judging by my persuasive and emotionally charged message, I am confident this will be granted.  

- A live televised east coast party at the original one, Joe's Stone Crab, in Miami hosted by Ryan Seacrest with Pitbull as the musical guest.

- The dip for the crab is almost equally as magnificent and should be considered for its own day.  We could go with the extremely catchy phrase: Happy National ""amazing crab dip sauce from Joe's that is pretty much crack sauce and should accompany every single bite of claw meat"" Day!  


I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We were greeted by an older gentleman who smiled and said he be happy to have us join them for dinner.

We were promptly seated at one of the ""outside"" tables that are in the mall.  Our server was named Joe.  I wondered if that was a coincidence given the restaurants name but forgot to ask.  Joe was super friendly and after some small talk gave us a rundown of the menu and specials for the evening.  He also told us that portions were large so sharing is recommended.  We wanted to keep it light so we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with a side of saut√©ed broccolini to share.  While we waited for the food we were sent out a bread basket and everything was delicious.  Our favorites were the pretzel bread, the cheese crisp and the corn bread.  The corn bread was amazing, you could taste the freshness.  Our fish was cooked perfectly and the Asian style sauce mixed with butter yielded some decadent mouthfuls that were perfectly balanced.  The broccolini was seasoned well served as a good compliment to the bass.  I would have loved to try a desert but we needed to head out.  Before we left Joe told us about a shortcut to get to Omnia that saved us a good deal of time in life.

First off the crab claws are awesome and meaty and the serve them with a creamy spicy mustard sauce and it all works real good. 

Ok now the reason I gave this place 5 stars is because they serve the best steak I have ever had (three times), it is there signature cut 16oz aged bone in prime filet. I mean big, super tender, and a great aged flavor. Being bone in it is more flavorful than others. Their sides are all the standards but all are excellent and of course plenty big enought to share. 

By todays strip standards this place has pretty good prices.  Sides are between 5 and 8 bucks and the signature bone in steaks between 42 and 49  so all considered this place is about as reasonable as a steak house gets nowadays.

Make no mistake folks, this is NOT them!

I've probably dined here at least 4 times a month for 3 years straight, mostly tending to  out of town clients coming in for a conference or a little R&R. The location is great simply because it's in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, which is on Flamingo, conveniently located halfway to everything on the strip. Lots of people watching, distractions, shopping, etc, just feet away. Valet is right in front of the restaurant, which is also another plus. Make sure to arrive and exit the back way onto Frank Sinatra drive, behind the casino, otherwise you will face the cluster F*** that is the main 4 way stop into the casino from the strip. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to this 4 way, as it is not optimally shaped, lacks signs or signals, and funnels you right into the main casino valet, taxi line, pedestrian lines, etc. No one really knows what they are in for going through this thing. You will inevitably play chicken with your vehicle. If you have a sick sense of humor,  you might get a kick out of watching the action and riot level tempers erupt up during peak weekend hours in and around this bastard...if you're into that sort of thing...haha..

So the rib eye is pretty spot on and on par with most fare of this caliber on the strip. But the real headliner (literally) is the Stone crab, hence the name of the restaurant... Orders come in 3 sizes, small, medium and large, and I usually order one plate of each size. Believe me it sounds like alot, but it really isn't. You might get 3-4 legs depending on the size of the plate you order. You will devour these things, and when you've just begun to exhale, they will be gone. Everything you love about the sea is well represented....cold, succulent, briny, smooth and slippery textures...wash it down with a nicely chilled grey goose martini and it's either the start or end (depending on the company you keep) of a great evening. And if there is such a thing as ""food porn"" this might qualify as ""food foreplay""..It's tough to put into words how delicious these thing are. I've had clients, after taking them to this place, call me mid day asking me the name of it, just to tell a friend of a friend to go there, so they can be ""that guy"" and reap bragging rights the next day..good food is truly unforgettable.",5,4,3

I've never had a bad experience. The food has always been delicious and there's nothing that I've ordered that has been bad. Service has always been outstanding.

I came here on a Thursday afternoon for a lunch date with my mother. We walked up to the host stand and were seated  immediately in the ""patio"" area. Jon was our server and I do not have enough positive superlatives to describe his service. He was friendly, helpful, efficient, and funny. Without a doubt, five stars.

Make sure you take a good look at the market card that the server hands you at greeting. It has the market prices for oysters and stone crabs plus any seasonal entrees and sides that are available. We both ordered from the card with my mom receiving a generous, nicely cooked portion of Alaskan halibut ($28.95) and a side of white asparagus ($9.95) which my mother consumed so fast that I did not even get a taste. I started with 6 stellar bay oysters ($16.95) followed by the classic two course lunch ($34.95) which consisted of 5 medium stone crab claws, hash brown potatoes, cole slaw which was mixed table side by Jon, and key lime pie for dessert. The two course lunch is a steal in my book.

I've been here for dinner also and their steaks are just as satisfying as the seafood. Yes, it's pricey, but well worth it to pay extra for fresh seafood in the middle of the desert.",3,0,1

Now have been to various steakhouses throughout Vegas...some better, some worse.
But what i had to appreciate with Joe's was the crisp and timely attention they provide when it comes to service.
Water always refilled, used dishes promptly removed, spot on with recommendations, etc.
And the food was simple in presentation and solid in quality. Really enjoyed the pretzel bread, their bisque is spot on, steak is cooked well, king crab is fresh...but the highlight is their Havana Creme cake which is similar to. Tres Leches.
Our exceptional waiter - Raul - steered me towards that dessert but I only asked for a half slice. To my surprise this was the best creme cake I have ever had bar none. It was quickly demolished by the table so I had to ask for another half slice for myself to enjoy. Raul saw that I enjoyed it so much that he gave me a slice on the house.

My Hungarian waiter informed me that ""We have no stone crab, but we *may* have some at five.""  I ordered scallops, only to see a neighboring table be served a pile of stone crab claws.  So thereafter, I called my waiter back over, only to be informed, ""It is now five, and we have them.  We never know before hand.""

If you have ""stone crab"" in your restaurant's name, I suggest you get on top of the availability of primary menu items.  I felt like a character in the Monty Python cheese shop skit.

My waiter informed me he would comp me for the scallops (which were pretty meh... 15 or more on the plate, too tough, too salty).  When the bill arrived, I was comped instead for a slice of pie (Marie Callander style frozen pie with cardboard crust) and a cup of coffee.

I hope my experience was out of the ordinary, but I paid $80 for dinner for one, and felt like I could have had a better experience for that price at a dozen other places in Vegas.

they were out of stone crabs so we got rock crab instead.  pretty good.  I still want to try stone crab though since its in their name so it must be what they're known for.

we got 24 oysters. wow they were soo good and fresh! must get if you come here.

we also got like a seafood sampler.  the seafood tasted fresh and I really liked the scallops cerviche.

I also got the bone in rib eye. it was soo good!! very tender and the seasoning was really good.

also got the mashed potatoes.  it looked pretty fancy.  came with cheese and the crunchy bread crumbs on top.  I didn't like how the cheese got stuck together so I would get this without the cheese on top, or less cheese if you can?

We'd had reservations at Top of the World for weeks, but changed our minds at the last minute after reading reviews on both spots. I am so glad we did!!
The only problem we had was parking. Self park is too far away. We finally asked someone who was working at the forum shops valet (full) and they directed us to the Valet right by Joe's. Never would have known it was back there otherwise.
Our last minute reservations were honored as soon as we arrived. Our booth was in a great location. Everyone congratulated us and was very kind. It took us a while to decide on our meals and our waiter was very patient. The little bread basket was adorable. We started with the chopped salad and the dressing was divine. It was just lettuce, tomatoes and onions (The salad is overpriced in my opinion) Although we cringed at the $79 price on the king crab legs, I encouraged my husband to indulge himself and they were REALLY good! I had the petite filet and it cut like butter. Fantastic flavor. The grilled corn was super yummy. The Jenny's mashed potatoes tasted good, but they were barely even warm. That was a disappointment, but we ate them anyways. We were given complimentary desserts. I had the key lime pie, he had the bananas foster pie. Both were delicious.
I can honestly say that I will return to Joe's in the future, but only for special occasions as we do not make it a habit to spend $225 on meals for two",0,0,0

We ordered one of each, and I couldn't wait for some claws. Greta told us that there were only jumbos available, $75 for 3 was just too much for me.

We did the 3 course lunch and it was phenomenal, possibly the best meal I have ever enjoyed! I had the king crab with lyonnaise potatoes and roasted corn. My sweetheart had the tenderloin with the Jennie's special potatoes. The lunches came with pie that we took back to the room but it didn't survive the night unfortunately.

Every time we go to Vegas (From Los angeles) we have to eat at Joe's.  It's beautiful, classy and delicious.  

To start : Dirty Martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  

Appetizer : Madagascar Shrimp - You can order just one, cause it's that BIG.  We shared it as an appetizer.  Sweet and tender.  Served with a side of aoili sauce, however, I didn't hardly use it as the shrimp was so delicious.

Entree - Large stone crab; Melts right in your mouth.  You don't need any dipping sauce or butter.  The taste is pure heaven.  Steaks - All steaks are perfecto.  They are lightly seasoned and then brought to the table with a side of herbs, pepper and salt for you to drizzle over yourself.

Sides - Lyonnaise Mashed potatoes.  Oh MY Yumminess.  Creamy, buttery and cheesy.

Dessert - Peanut Butter Cream pie - Good, but VERY rich.  I could seriously only have like 3-4 big bites and I was done.

SERVICE  here is top NOTCH.  I never have to ask twice or wave anybody down.  Each table comes with a server and like 2 other staff members to help take away plates and clean up bread crumbs.

I am a HUGE seafood lover, and this is probably one of the best seafood places I've had in CA or NV.  The food is fresh and very good, though a bit pricey.

It's located at the very end of the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace on the bottom\/street level.  If you are coming from Caesar's, it'll be in the right wing at the very end.  You'll need to take the escalator down one level.  

I tried to make a reservation the day before on Open Table, but nothing was available for the entire evening for even just 2 people.

So I called to ask what the wait would be for 2 people w\/o reservations.  They said they don't like to give estimates on the phone because the wait times can change so quickly.  So I asked them what the average wait time would be overall, and they said anywhere from 10 - 45 minutes.

So we walked over there to do a walk-in to see if they could accommodate.  At first, we got there at 6:45 pm and they told us it would be a 45 min wait.  But seeing there weren't a lot of people waiting around, we walked back up to check in on the wait at 7:05, and they were able to seat us at that time.  So our wait was just 20 minutes.

Since I'm from So Cal, I can get stone crabs pretty easily at the Fisherman's Wharf in Redondo Beach or even at 99 Ranch supermarket.  They are fairly cheap to buy whole (Santa Barbara stone crabs are about $5\/lb depending on the season), and the wharf or supermarket will steam them for free for you.  So that's why I didn't get stone crabs at Joe's.  But if you haven't had stone crabs before, you should definitely get them because they are probably one of my favorite types of crab to eat (and I've had all kinds).  They are meaty, easy to break because of the stone-like shell, and have a sweet flavor.  

Half-dozen oysters (1 order):
- I forgot what kind they were, but they were delicious.  Even my husband who isn't a fan of oysters liked these.  I think what really made it good was their fresh tasting vinegar sauce that we used with it.  The oysters were very fresh tasting with no fishy taste.  I could've probably eaten a whole dozen by myself easily.

Fisherman's Platter - Grilled:
- I got this and loved it.  It was a fair amount of food, though not a whole lot.  The server told me ahead of time when I asked how big the plate was that the amount of seafood added up to about 8 oz - the size of fish that they would give you on a fish plate.  With the mashed potato side we got, it was definitely enough food.  My husband tasted the scallops and remarked that they were probably some of the best he's ever had.  The seafood was very fresh, grilled with butter and maybe a bit of parsley and a bit of seasoning.  The shrimp were big and crunchy.  The squid pieces didn't taste rubbery or fishy.  The flavor was overall very good.  I would definitely get this dish again.  

Lobster-stuffed Sole:
My husband got this and loved it.  In fact, I was debating getting this in the beginning, and upon tasting it was kinda wishing that I had.  The sauce was like a hollandaise sauce, but not as heavy.  The fish was very tender and the sauce with the lobster was really good.  

Jennie's Mashed Potatoes:
These were special mashed potatoes that were very good!  They had a crunchy, cheese bread crumb type topping on them that was amazing.  The combination of the mashed potatoes with the crunchy topping was absolutely delicious.  It went perfectly with our meal, and I would definitely get these again.  I don't think I've run into any other place that makes their mashed potatoes like this.  Very good and filling!

Overall, this is a great seafood place.  If there was one of these places in So Cal, I would probably frequent it for most special occasions.  It's a bit pricey, but well worth it if you're wanting a nice good meal.  The service was great and the food was great.  The only thing was that we were seated at a table near the bar and there was a HUGE group of like 20 people that came in and were standing around by the bar (and hence our table).  Our poor server had to squeeze by them each time she walked over to us.  So it got pretty loud in there, though we were still able to enjoy our food.",2,1,0

My friends C and J and I went in looking for lunch. I had heard of Joe's and J's parents had been a few weeks before and loved it. So we knew it was probably pretty darned good.
   The menu is pretty big and the prices can be off putting if you're expecting something from the old Vegas ($15 for fish and chips could freak some people out). C had a cheeseburger and asked for it to be medium but it came out a little closer to medium rare which I know he wasn't happy about. J and I had the Joe's Classic Lunch which is five stone crab claws, hash browns, cole slaw and key lime pie. The stone crabs were sweet and didn't really need the dipping sauce that came with it. The hash browns were super crispy outside and flavourfully tender inside. The cole slaw was less successful despite the tableside dressing it got from our waiter - it was better than KFC but still a bit underwhelming. I wasn't a fan of key lime pie before but that little sliver with it's massive dollop of not overly sweetened whipped cream was really wonderfully tart with a great buttery crumbly crust.

The food was excellent- my steak was perfectly cooked- medium rare. Then the dessert came- banana cream pie and the waitress surprised us with a birthday brownie with a big scoop of ice cream. What a treat it is to go to Joe's. We are going to make sure we come back again!

My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary here and our experience was absolutely phenomenal.  Food was delicious and service was perfection.

This is what we ordered:
- Crab bisque
I am so glad that I found another place in town that has awesome crab bisque because my favorite is actually a lobster bisque that I had once at Treasures (Yeah...not someplace don't find myself returning to just for bisque =P ) It is super rich and flavors are just right.  I loved dipping some of the bread from the bread basket in it. My husband had a few spoonfuls and loved it.

- BLT Wedge salad
From what I tasted, it was OK. Definitely had better.  Still love the ""bacon salad"" at Del Frisco's Double Eagle steakhouse though.

- Stone crab (medium)
You get 7 nice size claws. Definitely enough to share between two people.  The best part was the mustard dipping sauce!

- Copper river sockeye salmon w\/ key lime butter
Ever since I had this kind of salmon in Alaska, I've been hooked.  It has just the right amount of fat and is not dry.  Mine was cooked to perfection at medium.

- Dry aged bone in rib eye
Delicious, no complaints here. 

After all of that, there was barely any room for dessert; however, we were presented with a complimentary anniversary dessert.  The brownie and vanilla ice cream was basic, nothing special.  We did ask our server about dessert recommendations for next time.  The key lime pie is a gimme and we were intrigued our servers description of the Havana pie (like tres leches!!).

Unfortunately, when I made it to Joe's in Las Vegas, it was late and having just attended a cocktail party, I was not very hungry.

While I would have liked to have tried everything on the menu, I had the petite filet mignon and a side of crispy brussels sprouts. The filet was cooked to perfection and so tender it was like eating butter. The brussels sprouts were outstanding. They were flash fried and drizzled with a prune vinegar reduction. My boss had the crab bisque, which was rich and flavorful. The bread basket was full of a variety of bread and rolls, which I'm sure were all very tasty and I regret not having tried them all.

Has to be the best seafood place on the strip! Both because of the food and the service, our waitress leanne (sp?) was amazing!!! She provided so much interesting history about the restaurant since it has been around for awhile, also made recommendations and told us even not to order certain things because she knows her stuff and she was being honest.

Can I also just say the bread basket was amazing, I could've ate that all night. I seriously love bread and butter so much, the one with the roasted onions and cheese on it was my FAV!

Ordered a dozen oysters of course, which included some kumamoto and fanny bay, delish and super fresh (5 stars)

Also ordered some crab legs and they were the best I've ever tasted, so incredibly fresh, she told us they come straight to the restaurant unlike some other places where they first need to preserve them with a bunch of chemicals. That was awesome. (5 stars)

Stone crab claw (2 stars)- Our waitress actually suggested we don't order this because of the season they aren't as fresh as normal, my brother really wanted to try one since they're known for it, he did, and I def liked the legs better, so she was on fireeeeee!

I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with the Miso Glaze (4.5 stars)- DIVINE. The flavors were all there- my only mark off was that it was slightly overcooked. My brother got the same thing and even said so, too bad they made a mistake on mine. It wasn't chewy or anything so I ate it, but I do like my fish almost medium. 

Dover Sole (4 stars)- My dad and brother got this, they served this table side, I enjoyed the sea bass more, but this was still pretty good, the sauce does the trick ;)

Sides:

Roasted Corn (2 stars)- This is one thing I didn't enjoy- tasted way better before, they need to add something to make this stand out more. My brother makes a creamy kind of corn dish at home which is fantastic, wish I had that!

Mashed potatoes (4 stars)- Good some crunch goodness on the top too, wish there was some garlic in there though ;)

Dessert- it was all pies! I'm not a huge pie person, but you can order halves, which my brother did of the banana creme pie, pretty good and I think she gave us a whole slice and charged us for half which was nice and we tipped her very well :)

Word of advice- they have valet right outside the restaurant so DO NOT valet in the lobby, it's a long horrendous walk in heels, trust me. Wish we knew that ahead of time!",6,5,5

My friends and I came here pretty late with reservations at 9:30PM. (PS: Make sure to have reservations). I'll tell you now, but this restaurant is in Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. For some reason, when we called the restaurant to ask where the restaurant was, I was told it was in the Cosmopolitan. When I called a second time, I was told it was near Planet Hollywood. FINALLY, on the THIRD call, (keep in mind I was in a taxi the whole time) I was told that it was at Caesar's Palace. Ugh. Come on now. You don't even know where you're working at!? The service, even at 9:30PM, was just alright, which is a bit disappoint since it is Vegas. We had to flag down someone several times to get our water cups filled and the food came out slowly. Our server looked and acted doubtful toward us as if he was judging us by how young we looked. (Asians just naturally look younger, but we ARE legal!!) 

The food itself is definitely high quality and somewhat small portions; on top of the fact that it is Vegas, the prices were definitely price-y. The Stone Crab was sold out (tip: come early if you want to try), so we settled for the king crab, six oysters, and salt and pepper shrimp. What I enjoyed was that with the crab, there was someone who would open the crab in front of you. Served with butter and lemon, the crab had a nice, sweet flavor with great texture. The oysters were creamy and came with a vinegarette and tabasco sauce. Lastly, our salt and pepper shrimp was fried and paired well with the creamy lemon aioli dip and lemon juice.

The ambiance is extremely classy and has an upscale vibe. The interior decor is beautiful and seems slightly antique. Suited for both groups or dates; it's both intimate and comfortable. It is dimly light, but somehow the room glows; I'm assuming the light bounces off the decor. 

Overall, would return to try Stone Crab and steak, in addition to their seafood selection; although when I do come back, I hope service to be better considering their reputation is of high quality.",3,1,2

The seafood here is too good to be true.  I went there this past weekend for my Valentine's dinner.  We had the medium order of Stone Crab, and the order of King crab legs.  The stone crab is kind of tedious to eat since the meat really sticks to the shell, but it tastes so fresh, you will want to make sure you get every single piece of meat off the claws.  The sauce it comes with is very flavorful too.  MM hmm..to die for!  The king crabs....are definitely KING.  They're huge!  They are not your average size crab legs you find in the buffet.  These are like 1 inch in diamater thick crab legs.  They come pre cracked so you don't have to deal with cracking them yourself.  Instead, enjoy them with your bowl of drawn butter.  So fresh, so good, so meaty, and well worth the $60 you'll pay for them.  

For sides, we had the steamed asparagus, and the pan roasted corn. The asparagus was bland, but the corn was delicious!  I've never had pan roasted.  I like the texture!

We saw that there was an appetizer version with 2 claws and that was what we ordered... one for each of us. I WISH I had room to fit more because it was so yummy.  The mustard sauce that you dip the crab in is SOOOO delish!  I can slather it on everything and eat it.  You also get an awesome bread basket to start off with and unfortunately we couldn't even eat that!  I had a bite of a pretzel bread and I just couldn't eat anymore.

Lately I have been coming here for lunch, they have an amazing lunch menu, and my favorite is the Chopped Seafood Salad that has shrimp, lobster and Alaskan king crab. The dressing is amazing, not heavy at all. For $16.95 you really can't beat this! Oh and the bread basket, SO GOOD! I love the cracker with everything on it, my friend and I usually fight over it.

For cocktails, if you feel like drinking a days calories in liquid form, you have to try the Key Lime Martini, it has a graham cracker crusted rim and is made with the same ingredients they make the actual key lime pies. It's amazing. My other favorite is the French 75, served in a champagne flute, Bombay Saphire Gin, Prosecco, fresh lemon juice.

My boyfriend and I made a reservation here for our anniversary. When I called to make the reservation the woman who helped me was so delightful, it made us excited for our visit!

When I called and spoke to the Maitre d , he seemed flustered. When I told him we apologized for us being late. He said, ""Just get here when you get here and we'll figure it out."" He was abrupt and quite cold. I was kind of thrown off guard, and when we finally got there, when we approached the host stand, no one even looked at us for a good minute or two, they were busy having conversations amongst themselves. 
Even though we weren't too happy with that,  we were seated right away, they brought over champaign to celebrate our Anniversary! We were soooo ecstatic and very grateful.

The fish and chips were some of the best I've ever had. You could tell the fish was fresh and the batter very crispy but not overwhelming most of the fish.

The atmosphere of this place just exudes class. As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was transported to a beautiful ballroom in the Titanic where all the upper class elite are dining. 

The service here is impeccable and the food is the epitome of what every restaurant should aspire to be. 

I started off with a peach flavored martini rimmed with sugar that was delicious. I could barely taste the alcohol and it went down so smoothly.

Our first appetizer was a 12-piece Rockefeller oyster rack. I am in awe at how fresh and tasty it was! I feel like they had just plucked the oysters from the ocean and brought it right to my plate. All of the oysters were perfectly chilled and the mix of sauces it came with made my mouth water. This was definitely the highlight of the night. 

The crab bisque is a must have! I loved every second of this soup. The flavors were so complex and at every corner I tasted a different flavor. It is creamy and hearty all in one. 

I ordered the pan saut√©ed branzino fish with lemon and capers. I enjoyed it. It's a healthy option and the sauce they use is drool worthy. 

We ordered the key lime pie for dessert and it was bomb! Tart and sweet with a kick ass crust. I salute Joe's for creating the best key lime pie in California. 

Overall, this was an amazing meal and I am so happy we came here for dinner! With all of the options in Vegas, I think we definitely made the right choice.",9,4,8

The wine suggestions were great too.  Oh man!  I'm drooling.

Let's see. . . tips for Joe's:

1)  expect to pay for quality
2)  medium crabs are better than the super humongous crabs

I will say, that i tried Joe's scallops this time, and wasnt a big fan. I don't like the flour dusted layer on them. I loooooove the taste of scallops, and felt it took away from the great flavour. But otherwise everything else at the table was soooo gooood!

My Mom had the dover sole, which had tremendous table side service. They fileted the fish right at the table, and not a single bone to be found!

If you want something new and exciting this isn't the place for it, but if you want fresh, classic seafood and excellent steaks in a nice ambiance for some event, this is a great pick.

The waiter was very helpful with making wine recommendations for a white and a red.

Our group of 10 shared 2 of the Whale appetizer, each of which serves 4.  It comes with lobster tail, cocktail shrimp, crab, and scallop and shrimp ceviche.  No surprises here, just great classic chilled seafood.  The servings aren't too filling, but everything is super fresh.

The ribeye steak was also excellent.  Maybe not the best I've ever had in my life, but still really, really good and top tier.  Not much to say, just a very normal but perfectly executed steak.

For 3 bottles of wine, a few beers, 2 sides, 2 The Whale appetizer platters, and everyone getting their own steak or seafood entrees, it was $100\/person for 10 people.

There are pictures in the restaurant from Miami Beach, FL however their website only mentions a sister restaurant in Chicago so I'm not sure if this is truly related to the Miami Beach location.

You have your pick of reviews and opinions, including the 1 and 2 star anomolies. So outside of raving about the food, and what is usually very organized and pro-steakhouse service, I'd like to talk about two of my favorite things.....

First, this restauraunt, although it's crazy-popular, and located on the strip, is one of the easiest to drive to and park. There's a small driveway at the South end of the forum shops off the strip. You pull in there, hand over your ride to the valet, and just walk into that South end entrance and ""wha-lah""... Joe's is right there on your left, across from the ""$75 Shave and Haircut Shoppe.""

My second best thing about Joe's? The KEY LIME PIE. I've visited Joe's several times, usually when hosting clients from trade shows in which we're participating. And every time, our small groups will start the ordering with drinks, (or carry them in from the bar). Then we'll order one of the two large seafood layden appetizer trays, a few sides for our entrees, and then steaks and\/or more seafood. But after it's all done, there are two more items I look forward to. It's my coffee and a huge slice of their Key Lime Pie! And if anyone thinks they might want a bite, or starts in with, ""Oh, I'm so full, I'll just have a bite of yours""... I order another slice for the table. (I don't share! And these ""light eaters"" are usually first-timers that aren't yet ""keylime addicts!"")

At Joe's, with a party of 4, you'll average about $75 to $150 per person with moderate wine choices. The food is very good to great, and the servers are all trained to a very high ""prime steakhouse level."" I've almost always made reservations, and have always enjoyed the overall experience.",10,5,9

First we had to try the stone crab, so we got two stone crabs and for two is was $22.95. But they were unlike any crab i have ever had, the texture was a little more solid then other crabs and they serve it with this chilled mustard sauce, which is ummmmmmmmmm so good. We even saved the sauce to try it with the petite filet mignon. 

My wife ordered the Filet mignon which i had a bite and it was very good, she ordered it with a creamy horseradish sauce, but combine the mustard and the horseradish sauce together and you have a match made in heaven.

BEST. CRAB. EVER.

This place better be five stars after you look at the prices on the menu, right?? 

Came here for my friends birthday. Had a reservation so we were seated right away without a problem. 

Service was excellent and came right away to take drink orders and give everyone water. I don't remember our server's name, but she was really on top of things. She gave us the run down of the menu and was patient with our questions and orders. 

Our table kind of shared a few things. I had some wedge salad, two different kinds of crab, and three different kinds of desserts. It's been a week or so now and I can't stop dreaming about the crab. The first crab I got was meant to be cold and it was just the claws. Had to work for the meat, but it was worth it. The second crab I tried, was meant to be hot and it was amazing and rich. I could only eat three pieces because it was that rich. I wish I remembered the desserts we tried because vise were also amazing. At that point, I was so full, but couldn't stop eating.

As mentioned earlier, the service was amazing. Any time my water started to go down, someone would come out of no where and fill it back up.

Definitely want to come back, but this is the type of place that should be saved for a special occasion. Hopefully something comes up soon :P",2,2,1

He gave us some suggestions that made our dinner amazing. The crab legs he suggested were the best we have ever had. At the end of our amazing meal I had no room for dessert but he said their key lime pie is famous and brought me out a taste.

I've been to the Joes in Chicago numerous times and have NEVER had a bad experience there. At this location, however, it could not have been more different. Let's start from the beginning...

Upon entry I was met by this uptight and rude host named Tim. Despite having a reservation and arriving 5 minutes early, Tim did his absolute best to make sure we were treated like and felt like complete crap. He was demeaning and talked down to us. I wanted to leave. Unfortunately it was the only place we had a reservation so we could not go anywhere else. So I just sucked it up and sat down. 

Our waiter was fine. He did a good job of explaining the various specials as well as making recommendations that fit our mood. While the food sounded good when he explained it, that was not the case when we ate it. I had the filet...YUCK. I'm not sure if they used old or bad meat but it tasted like an old shoe. It was over cooked and had no flavor. Disgusting. I also had the stone crab which was supposed to be an appetizer but it took forever to arrive. In fact, it arrived AFTER our main course. What a joke! 

At this point I was so fed up I did not want to bother with dessert. So I left. I know for a fact I will NEVER come back to this location...at least not until that @$$ hole Tim is fired. What a prick.

King Crab legs were really great. They crack them at the table for you and one order is a lot so I would share between 2 people. Very meaty. It's served cold which was different than what I'm used to, but it was still great. It says market price but it was $79 last night and I couldn't tell you the poundage, but we also ordered scallops, shrimp cocktail and a cup of soup, all to share, and couldn't finish the crab! 
The scallops were very delicate and melt in your mouth yummy. One did have some sand in it, crunch crunch, but I guess that's expected sometimes. 

The lobster bisque was delish! We shared it, it's very rich but yummy. Would be awesome on a rainy day (still good with 115 degrees outside) 

If there has to be a con... The shrimp cocktail was really really good.., but each shrimp is basically $4 each! But fresh, cold and meaty. Haha funny I'm ok spending $80 on crab but not $16 for shrimp. 

Maybe I watch too many Gordon Ramsay shows, but I agree that the tuxedo attire for wait staff is a little funeral home. Our server was super sweet and very great at her job though. A little stuffy overall but elegant. 

Service was fast and friendly, we would go back if we're wanting great seafood and paying for it ($140 before a tip for 1 soup, 1 shrimp cocktail, 1 order scallops, 1 order king crab legs) the bread basket was amazing too!! Carb heaven!",0,0,0

I didn't like that they were served chilled.  Didn't taste fresh and the meat of the claws clung to the shell and was a bit flakey.  Not even sweet or rich in flavor...just eh.

On the otherhand Joe's famous scallops is a FIVE PLUS!  Oh my goodness...there is nothing bad i can say about these...except that perhaps the portion they give is TOO MUCH thus making me overeat :)  I have no self control when it comes to these scallops.

Shrimp scampi: 5...pasta is cooked on the al dente side...perfect amt of lemon, garlic, and butter, and the scrimp is plentiful and fresh.

Hashbrowns:  FIVE stars!  Hashbrown lyonese (just has grilled onions on top) five stars PLUS.  :)  Just try them...and you'll understand why they standout from the breakfast hash browns from any breakfast place...

Key lime pie:  FOUR.  More ""cream cheesy\/cheescakey"" flavor than just tart sweet lime...which is why i favor it.  It's amazingly refreshing and wonderfully balanced.  Do not expect it to have a ""lemon bar"" kick.  I didn't give it a 5 because it was once served to me not fully defrosted...yes, that's right...it was frozen...nevertheless, all the other times I had it it was amazing.

Coleslaw:  mmmm!  sweet and tart and comes with juicy high quality tomato quarters

As a solo diner with limited stomach real estate, I was really glad to hear that I could order Joe's stone crabs by the claw instead of finding myself required to commit to an order of 5-7 based on size for $39.95+.

While I awaited my meal, they brought out a rather lavish bread basket of five different options at which I picked at selectively in order to not overstuff the belly.

That evening I dined lightly on a single large claw $13.99 and a side of sauteed broccolini $9.95.  The crab shell was quite thick, but fortunately they serve it cracked up for the picking.  For something labeled ""large,"" it wasn't actually all that large, so I was glad that I had opted for this size claw over both the medium and the select, which resulted in more meat for the same work exerted.  The broccolini was the first green thing I ate in Vegas and I found it crisp tender, garlicky and quite good.

I was seated in the dining area by the bar where they have a set up of tall round tables paired up with tall chairs.  At the end of my meal, a lemon water dampened cloth was brought over for me to wipe my hands.  For additional cleaning, the bathroom was up a flight of stairs.

Its a hand full of Romain lettuce chopped with asparagus, red and yellow bell pepper, hearts of palm, red onion, cucumber, carrots, green onion, celery, cherry tomatoes, topped with shrimp, crab, lobster, avocado and croutons and lightly tossed with a vinaigrette for $13 at lunch. 

I have had the king crab, super yummy, and the crab bisque which they actually serve hot unlike most places.

I took my parents, sis, and bro-in-law here so we had the opportunity to sample and share more of the menu.  Service was top-notch - all the servers wearing tuxes were attentive and expert at breaking and pre-cutting the king crab legs.  Our main waiter Patrick was awesome and very sociable.  Here's a guide to having an awesome, memorable dinner at Joe's, especially with a party of 6:

1. Have them prepare an appetizer plate with 12 large stone crab claws and 3 king crab legs (break into halves).  Some of the sweetest shellfish you'll ever had, and still having nice texture.  Shells peel off with minimal effort.  When I told my family I booked Joe's at Caesar, they almost expected plastic bibs and wooden mallets.  LOL!

2. Ask for more cornbread!  The pretzel is also good but that cornbread is soft and filled with corn for sweet and jalape√±o for heat.

3. Each person orders an entree.  My ahi filet mignon was truly massive, almost the size of a big fist.  Good outer sear and pink, tender center.  Mom got the lighter option with four sea scallops on potato cake.  Wife and Dad each got the Miso-Soy sea bass which was really good this time - still a bit rich but they eased up on the sauce which is good.  Sis and bro-in-law each got the Grilled Seafood Platter which is a solid choice if you want more shellfish: half lobster, shrimp, and scallops.

4. Share a few sides: broccolini (2 orders), sweet potato with praline butter (almost like dessert), and lyonnaise potato (like a gigantic hash brown with caramelized onions on top).

5. Lastly, share some pies for dessert.  We got the key lime (signature dessert) and butterscotch chiffon.  Since we were also celebrating dad's birthday, Patrick sent us a chocolate brownie ice cream cake with a lit candle.  Now that's service!  Be sure to enjoy with espresso or their black coffee.

It was our last dinner of our 3-night Vegas stay.  Between eating at Twist, L'Atelier, and Joe's you could say we went 3 for 3.",12,5,8

We ordered family style, 4 large rock crab claws and a seafood chopped salad.  They split the salad without extra charge and made each plate look very nice.  Anyway, on with the food:

(Actually, before the main dishes: The complimentary bread basket -- so fresh and addicting that I had to control myself from eating too much of it so I have room for the actual meal!)

Rock crab claws:  Wow, I loved it! So fresh, sweet and juicy! I guess this place isn't famous for its claws for nothing! Each claw was huge and had so much meat and I think 2 claws per person is the perfect amount.  And they go perfectly with Joe's mustard sauce. It's so worth the $$! 

Seafood chopped salad:  Delicious salad! All the seafood - lobster, crab, shrimp - in the salad are also sooo fresh and sweet. It was so light yet so satisfying!

And because we were too full we didn't order dessert, but the waiter surprised us with a complimentary dessert -- brownies and ice cream!  And yes, we made room for dessert and it was a great way to finish a wonderful meal!

The night was started off by looking for a seafood place to go and eat at. Mainly looking through yelp to find one. I didn't really want to get a buffet but I wanted a nice classy sit down and order your food ! I got what I wanted and called Joe's Seafood up. 

They said they could take us in a few hours and indeed they did. While walking through this place you will notice that every server is wearing a nice black suit and it seems formal but hey we are in Vegas and I saw many patrons wearing just flip flops and t shirts. 

I did call about the dress code but they said they do prefer business but doesn't matter if you are dressed in casual. So off we went on this find adventure!!

The Order: 
Crab Cake- It is one large crab cake which is cooked or pan fried lightly for a little bit of crisp on the outside. The inside is nice and soft with a hint of mayo. The taste is amazing and I would say this is on my top 10 list of crab cakes. 

Stone Crab Claw- Had two of these and they are served chilled with a wedge of lemon but you really don't need anything. Just try it without and you can tell that this is really good crab. The flavor is nice and and amazing. I wish I could just eat more...but we wanted to try everything!

Crab Bisque- Not my favorite thing on my meal. I didn't even finish it because it just had a very bad buttery flavor. It tasted way too fatty for me and I just didn't like it. 

Parmesan Crusted Halibut- Need to order this, the crust was just perfect amount of crispiness in each bite with the fish. Also the fish was not at all dry and it just had an awesome flavor. Love love it!! Must order if you come here. 

Half order of mashed potatoes- On the top of it was some very crispy cheese topping. I can tell you the half order was huge. we didn't even finish most of the sides because we were just stuffed with food!!

Half order of mac and cheese- I see mushrooms yeah !! :) I liked how the texture of the pasta is and also how they did the mac and cheese, it is defiantly a different style. Not from Kraft and it does taste a whole lot better. 

Overall the meal was perfect, the server that we had was a very nice lady and she didn't hassle us about what we ordered or if we needed to order more. I know some places might be a little bit on the mad side if you only order one meal but seriously..I can't eat a whole lot and the portion size is out of this world!! Most places feed you a very large size and this is one of them!! Everything was large and good !! The only thing I would suggest not getting is the crab bisque.

The fish was served in a brown butter sauce that was quite heavy.

We got the traditional mustard sauce and drawn butter for dipping. I liked the mustard sauce best! Lastly the bread basket everyone raves about. They give you a nice assortment.

If you want stone crab, I think a good way to go is to get either their Seafood Chopped Salad or the Stone Crab Louie.  The helping of seafood is generous and you get a salad to break up the flavors.

Calamari was fine and the cocktail sauce with straight horseradish made it good.

As for the main dish, I ordered the Filet Oscar which consists of a 6 oz Filet Mignon, Asparagus, and Alaskan King Crab Legs.

It was very disappointing that they only gave one leg, especially since the crab was so appetizing! 

We also ordered the stone crab legs. This was my first time trying stone crab legs and I didn't know what to expect. I thought the stone crab legs were pretty good. It was just really different from what I'm used to. It has a bitter kind of taste, I can't exactly pinpoint it. 

Another reason why I deducted a star was because on the bill they automatically add 18% for tip. Before we got the bill we were planning to tip more than 18%, but we were kind of disappointed when got the bill. I feel that a person should tip at least 10%, and if the service is excellent then that determines how much more a person should tip.",1,0,0

Now I must preface this review by saying my mom is the pickiest eater I know. I've taken her out to eat at many places. I was so happy to hear her saying that this was the best place I've ever taken her and the best sea food she's ever had! She went home and told my dad all about it and got him all jealous he missed out--he's allergic to shellfish!

We ordered 4 servings of manhattan clam chowder, 1 grilled seafood platter , 1 pound of the smallest stone crab claws, some brocollini for a side, and 2 kids meals. The seafood platter came with scallops, lobster tail, and Madagascar shrimp. WOW, this is the first time I've actually LIKED scallops! They were big and meaty! The stone crab claws were cold but the meat was sweet and even the small ones had lots of meat! It was like a classier version of the Atlantic blue crab that I am so used to eating on the East Coast. I was not a fan of the mustard dip that it came with but the crab meat in itself had great flavor. Just some lemon juice was enough!

What I love about this restaurant is their affordable kids menu so you can bring your kids here and have them eat nice stuff, too! If they can't finish it, you can just get more food for yourself because these kids meals are basically slightly smaller portioned adult meals at like less than half the cost. Sure the selection is not as extensive, but if you want filet mignon or crab cakes, these meals are a great price! I brought two younger siblings and one ordered a 6oz filet mignon and the other mac and cheese. Joe's have $17 kids meals with steak and crab cake and $9 meals with some kind of starch or chicken nuggets, etc, you know the usual kids stuff. Stay away from the $9 meals. The mac and cheese was total crap. Easy mac would have been better!! It was more like hard, dry pasta shells and butter. My sister couldn't finish it. The steak however was the same quality as the adult version and cost 1\/3 the price for a slightly smaller portion! Each kids meal also came with a free side. One sibling picked broccolini and it was the same serving size as the appetizer portion I paid $9 for if not bigger!! Seriously (look at the picture I posted). The only difference was the brocollini that came with the kids meal was steamed and the other off the menu was grilled with olive oil. Each kids meal also came with the brownie sundae, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same thing they charge adults $8 for on the dessert menu! Needless to say, the sundae was delicious. Seriously, if you have kids, just use that as an excuse order some stuff for less than half the price on the regular menu.

As for the more adult stuff, I don't think you can go wrong ordering shellfish here. Everything tasted amazingly exotic and fresh. You must get the stone crab claws! I didn't know that they harvested the claws by taking one claw and throwing the crab back in the ocean! The claw regenerates! Gasp! Do they rotate which claw they take from the crab? Is it the left or right one? I digress. I tried my other sister's steak and it was good but not something amazing (nothing I can't cook at home with a good cut of meat), so I can't say I would recommend the steak over the seafood. Stay away from starches like pasta because based on the mac and cheese my sister had, I don't have faith in those dishes. Why would you pray premium prices for starch dishes anyway? 

Oh and the complimentary bread was crap. Olive garden probably has better. Again, I don't think they know how to cook their carbs here.

Service was good. Our waitress, Mindy, was very knowledgeable about the menu, had good recommendations and checked on us often. She didn't seem super accommodating, however. My mom didn't like her wine and she didn't offer to comp it or take it back. It wasn't that expensive glass of wine either, $8. Usually nice restaurants just take stuff you really don't like off the bill and offer to replace it with something else.

Oh, and don't worry about how to dress at this restaurant. My family showed up in hoodies and jeans and there was no problems getting service. This is touristy Vegas!

In the end my bill after tax and tip was over $230. It was worth it though because we left stuffed as a party of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) and it included alcohol, dessert, and coffee, too! Yum!",2,1,2

Even though there were about 10 servers milling around I had to get up and go to the bar to get my own drink.  The drink was great, and the atmosphere of the bar and dining room was very nice and welcoming.
Sat down to the table and met our waiter who was very nice and gave us the history of the restaurant and suggested some appetizers and entrees since it was our first visit .  We started off with the Stone Crab Claws which were out of this world and the Mustard Dipping Sauce was from the heavens.  We also had the Shrimp De Jonge which was ok.
I had the Ribeye which was OK, nothing fantastic.  It was a bit on the small side for a Bone In Ribeye, but since I was still on east coast time so it was really late.  Sweetie had the Sea Bass and liked it.  The side dishes were also very nice we had the Lyonaise Potatoes, creamed spinach, sweet potato fries, onion straws and maybe one other, all were tasty.
For dessert someone ordered the Peanut Butter Pie which was VERY tasty and to call it rich would be an understatement.  Since there was 10 of us they added a percentage to the bill for a tip, which is normal but then the waiter made a point to let the member of our party that was paying know that he had to share the tip with the other people who participated in our service so it was customary to add more so that he gets his fair share.  I thought this was tasteless and uncalled for he was also pretty persistent about it and it left a bad taste in my mouth.
This meal was nice, and I would go back for the stone crab claws.  There were parts that were great and parts that were not so great about this experience.",2,0,0

If you were like me and had never even heard of stone crab before, then you have to come here. If you're a little more budget-conscious (if such a thing exists in Vegas) go for lunch because they are usually running great lunch specials where you can get stone crab, they're melt-in-your-mouth potatoes, a side of tomato and a dessert for a very reasonable price. If you want to splurge, check it out for dinner. Both times it has a great swanky yet casual vibe. But for either one...be sure to make a reservation.

I've been going for about 3 years now and it's always been the same host standing at the front podium. He even recognizes my mom and I when we come. The waitstaff has been the same for a long time too which is nice when you come back to a place annually and you see the same friendly faces.

I recommend the large stone crab (it's a bit of an effort to eat I warn you). But once you get inside those shells, the buttery deliciousness that awaits will make it all worthwhile. Order any one of their many kinds of mashed potatoes...there's nothing like them. And for dessert, everything is good but the key lime pie...WOW! It's the perfect refreshing finisher on a hot summer Vegas day too.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm getting in my car to take off for Vegas as I just made myself desperately starving for some Joe's Stone Crab!",2,0,2

The host wished us a happy anniversary when he looked up our reservation.  We were seated right on time.   Waiter was attentive and helpful.  Ordered a bottle of champagne and started with crab-cake appetizer and Caesar salad.  The crab-cake was very good except for one piece of lump crab that was slightly fishy.  Caesar salad was excellent.  However before we finished half of the appetizers they delivered our main courses.  As soon as our waiter noticed (he did not deliver the main courses) he came over.  We mentioned that never in all of our dinning experiences in up scale restaurants had we had our main courses delivered while we were still eating our appetizers.  By the way, we are reasonably fast eaters and were not dawdling other than to enjoy the champagne with the appetizers.  Our waiter apologized and took the main courses away.

Once we finished the appetizers he brought our main courses- the large size stone crabs and Joe's famous scallops.  The stone crab claws were excellent, the scallops uninspired.

We finished with one of their key lime pies and one of their coconut pies.  Both excellent.  Though we were surprised that no mention was made of our anniversary by the waiter nor a token candled cupcake as was delivered to a few nearby tables in celebration of birthdays.

So all in all an OK experience marred by the rush delivery of our main course.  Certainly not what we expect when spending several hundred dollars on a dinner.",0,0,0

Stone Crab- My Husband said this was delicious and he could have ate a whole bowl filled with their claws! He ordered two claws and devoured them. He said it wasn't as rich as King or Snow Crab so he could easily eat a ton of it.

Black Bass- My Husband loved this as well! It was coated in philo dough and cooked perfectly. He said it has great flavor and was a good sized portion.

Cauliflower Gratin- This was cauliflower served with cheese and a little horseradish. I thought it was OK (I'm not a big cauliflower fan) but my Husband loved this too.

Macaroni and Cheese- So yummy! I really liked this and I almost finished the entire thing myself! A bowl of this is good enough for two or three people. Super cheesy with good flavor.

Tender Greens Salad- This was pretty much lettuce and dressing. It was good, and a huge portion. Vegetarians don't have too many options here!

Manhattan Clam Chowder-  My Husband's latest obsession. He thought this was amazing and put all the other chowders he has had to shame. Said the stuff that he buys in the can will forever be ruined after tasting this perfection.

Moscow Mule- Really good and mixed perfectly! I have never had a Moscow Mule before (shocking I know) but this was delicious. It tasted herbal. Yummmmmm.

-the miso sea bass: seriously beyond phenomenal! I have had miso before but put together with the sea bass and the way they prepared it it was hands down the best we have ever had. 

- 16oz sirloin: cook medium, husband thought it was good and cooked perfectly. It was served with a sea salt herb mix on the side that was a great addition to a typical ribeye. 

- lyonnaise side dish: if I were to describe this in simple terms it is a large hash brown with caramelized onions. However, it was the crunchiest hash brown (outside only) I have ever had...in a good way. Then it is topped with an amazingly sweet caramelized pile of onions. In all honesty I won't be getting this again because it want spectacular like the other Items we had. However, I did eat all the onions because they were that good. Also just to mention the portion was huge! We probably are 1\/5 of the side. Although I can see a couple eating 1\/3 if they were really hungry. 

-key lime pie: if you have never had real key lime pie made from real key lime juice then this is going to be similar to what you have had except that I notice it was more sweet than tart. The crust was extremely rich and buttery. If you have never had true key lime pie then you have to try this be it is really good. 

-banana fosters cream pie: this was my favorite dessert between the two (but only because the key lime I have had at other restaurants that were equally as good) it was a banana cream pie that was more cream than bananas topped with thick Carmel and candied pecans.

I had the pleasure of coordinatiing the office xmas party as did every year.  The firm decided to take the staff and their spouses to LV for the weekend.  I decided to book the dinner party at Joe's.  The photos on the website is oh so mouth-watering.  Everyone couldn't wait to taste the food.  We decided on a pre-fix menu.

Course 1:  The 2nd Mortgage
It's probably the best course, but it was just so so.  It was a medley of 2 inch king crab legs, 1 jumbo shrimp, half of a very small lobster, and a ceviche of shrimp and scaIlop.  I am used to having at least 3 sauces with my seafood medley.  it came with just cocktail sauce.

Course 2:  Vegetable Chopped Salad
A mix of celery, lettuce, cheese.....  it was flavorless.

Course 3:  filet mignon
My was medium rare and hers was medium.  I came close to choking to death on the first bite bc it was so dry.  I decided to cut down the center and saw that it was red and not overcooked.  I started eating it from the inside.  It was dry and powdery with no beef flavor.  I left a third of it bc I couldn't take it anymore.  Her steak was dry and she left half uneaten.  The sides were mash and grille tomatos.  Both were mediocre.

Course 4:  Dessert
After all that, I decided to play safe.  I got the chocolate fudge pie.  You can't go wrong with chocolate.  With that said, it was nothing to write home about.  She got the banana cream pie.  That was just okay.

I would not go here again.  I discourage anyone to go there.  At close to 80 bucks per person, I can eat a lot better than that.  I was so disappointed.  The staff will have to wait a year for me to make up to them.",1,1,0

We also got their mashed potatoes and I figured they'd just be regular potatoes nothing special. But wow...they put all sorts of cheese on it and bake it i believe. I got the large size and it's way too much for two people. We had to take the rest home!

They include two sides and dessert and there is usually a filet and a stone crab offering.  To my dismay on this visit...no stone crabs.  As a big fan of this sustainable food,  I'm well aware of the national shortage due to the squid infestation so I understood but was disappointed since it was the reason I was there.  Instead they were substituting king crab legs.  Our waiter did a good job of explaining the situation and eventually convinced me to give it a try.

It was a very good decision.  Still not the stone crabs I was craving but a very good option.  The legs were already split and full of cold, sweet crab meat.  The sides included their delicious roasted sweet corn along with equally as good lyonnaise potatoes.  For dessert the crab lunch came with Havanna Dream Pie which is more cake-like as in boston cream pie but which I really enjoyed.  Two of us had ordered the crab lunch and the waiter was nice enough to substitute key lime pie for one of us.  Overall, an excellent meal.

Others in our party had the fish and chips and the scallops.  None were disappointed and everybody loved their meal. My 90-year old Stepdad called them  ""The best scallops I've ever had.""  Would I have preferred the stone crabs that I came for?  Of course! The meal did not disappoint though.  

As for the location in the Forum Shops, it can be a little tricky to find but they do offer valet parking right outside the Joe's entrance to the mall which is great and worth the effort to find.  At lunch, the seating options are the bar or a cafe setting that is open to the mall and can be loud.  Not ideal but you won't care.  The food is that good.",1,0,0

Granted, this is Vegas.

We had originally wanted to eat at the Miami location, but was closed on a Monday.  I had called for a reservation and the manager was very cool asked for a nice table, ie. not near the bathrooms. He told me he would take care of me.  And he did the table was a private corner table and he remembered me too. Nice guy.

We ordered a side of the large Stone Crabs 5 for $59.95. No need to order the crab legs. 

And then me and my sis split the lobster tail and filet combo. Her man had the crab legs and filet combo. We ordered a side of mac n cheese, creamed spinach, and brocollini. OKAYYYY I never like American styled lobster... (rubber dipped with butter no thx) however this was not the case. The lobster was the star of the nite. So flavorful and delicious. Even splitting the combo the portion was huge. Mac n Cheese awesome yumminess, better than Gordon Ramsey Steak and dare I say Mastro's. Ordered the dulce leche dessert which was surprising light and sooo yummy. 

Ohhh I forgot the cocktails... I forget the name but it is made with fresh peaches. A signature drink. Forget all others only order this drink. You wont be disappointed. I would come back just to drink at this classy bar.

The waiter did give us a tip bc we raved about the lobster. Always order the size that comes with the combo bc the bigger one you can order itself is not goood. I guess good things do come in small sizes... Lolx! 

What can I say one of the best steakhouses on my list!! Great service and even better food. Stick to my tips people! You will eat good and save money from my mistakes",0,0,0

Without a doubt I'd been looking forward to our 5pm reservation for a couple of weeks... 

Our waiter was a nice fella whose name escapes me...but he'd no doubt made a career for himself on knowing the specials and knowing them well. A little bit snoot, but still a whole lotta nice. 

We ordered drinks and I decided on one of the fancy schmancy specialty cocktails called ""Daddy's Key Lime Pie"" - a yummy concoction that yes - tastes like liquid Key lime pie and no doubt could turn deadly very quickly... (No wonder the recipe is top secret!) All I know is it's made with Skyy Vodka, half & half or some other cream, I'm guessing a lime liqueur because it was sweeter than if it were just lime juice and it's served in a martini glass rimmed in a sugary graham cracker dust. Bottoms Up! It was deeeelicious. 

Before I forget, too, I have to mention the bread basket! There is the OMGAH cutest mini loaf pretzel bread in that basket. I LOVES it!!!

Even though we all pretty much knew what we wanted as our entrees...we took our time looking over the menu to determine our starters and sides. In fact, I ordered well after appetizers were set on our table because I didn't think I was hungry enough to justify that and an entr√©e. However, once I caught sight of the Jumbo Crab Cake I knew I couldn't resist.

That Jumbo Crab Cake was SO GOOD... chunks of flaky, white crab meat. It practically melted in my mouth! The next time I'm at Joe's I'm going to order the Jumbo Crab Cake dinner. (my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it!)

Rob & Jolene ordered the 2nd Mortgage, an appetizer that lives up to its name! A plate of Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Cocktail, Alaskan King Crab, and a Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche.  I tried some of the ceviche and it was flavored so nicely...light with just the right amount of acidity with chunks of scallops and shrimp... very, very good. 

Now... the main course... 

I knew IMMEDIATELY that I wanted the Bacon-wrapped Scallops. Have you seen them? Oh my goodness! TEN scallops in total; served in a ""pair"" of five since they are wrapped in bacon... oh my goodness...oh my goodness... heavenly! I could only eat five of them which worked out perfectly for me since I had leftovers for dinner last night! The scallops are fantastic. I didn't much care for the bacon itself but the flavor the bacon gave the scallops was FANTASTIC and they were perfectly cooked. 

For sides I ordered the Pan Roasted Sweet Corn, which I absolutely loved, and the Deep Fried Asparagus. How could I resist it? Even our waiter made a comment that they took a perfectly healthy vegetable and umm... made it unhealthy... and it was divine! Good thing the sides are generous in portion and can be shared easily between a party of even four, I'd say...

I tried the Garlic Creamed Spinach, also, and it was nice... but the Asparagus was the clear front runner. 

After our leftovers were boxed up, we ordered coffee... I really wanted dessert...but I had no room whatsoever. I was so stuffed I even considered for a second, sprinting to the opposite end of the Forum Shops to H&M to purchase a pair of elastic waistband pants... *tee hee* 

Two in our party of six did order dessert... I had a bite of both the Key Lime Pie and the Havana Dream Pie... which, oh yes... was certainly that. Both were decadent... I woulda needed a pair of elastic waistband pants AND a couch (a stretcher? and two strong mens?) had I indulged in a whole piece.

It was a lovely meal... with great friends that are near and dear to me... and a great send off for 2010... 

I know we're not QUITE there yet...but I don't see another $30 entr√©e a'happenin for me before Friday so... there you go.",8,8,8

My wife and I ordered fried oysters as an appetizer. My wife and I do not like oysters, but I thought maybe this would taste like calamari. Well, it was still very briny and tasted too much like oysters lol. If you don't like oysters, don't order this. 

We also ordered the medium sized stone crab and a rib eye with asparagus. The crab was tasty, pre-cracked, and came with some mustard sauce. The crab was meaty and good, but to be honest, it's overpriced for what it is. The rib eye was delicious as expected, but I was weirded out with the asparagus. The stalks appeared to be shaved down, so it looks like some weird white root. It didn't taste bad, but it was just weird to see an asparagus that didn't look like one. 

Also, soda lovers beware, if you order a soft drink, it comes in a small ass bottle like at Mastro's, if you've ever eaten there. If you want refillable drinks, get the lemonade or iced tea. 

Also, our waiter(don't remember his name), seemed like he used to work for the mob or something. He just had this mean mug on his face all night. He looked like he just came back from dragging a body into a lake or something. For spending so much money at a restaurant, you expect a friendly face and service, but unfortunately that wasn't our experience with the guy.",3,5,2

We had a dozen of the oysters, their world-famous scallops, the shrimp and scallop ceviche and of course the stone crabs.  

The oysters were smaller than the ones that I am used to eating.  But these oysters tasted a whole lot better.  It came with a cocktail sauce and another one that looked like italian dressing.  Just eat it without the sauce.  It's that good.  Their world famous scallops were very good.  Very sweet and buttery.  Nice texture to them also.  Get them.  The ceviche was alright.  A little to acidic for my taste.  I don't think I would order that again.  Now onto the reason we came here, the stone crabs.  We got the Select stone crabs.  6 to an order.  Our server said the different types were just the size of the claws, not the taste.  She said all the orders usually come out to a pound.  Might as well get the bigger claws which make it easier to get the meat and eat.  It came with Joes mustard sauce but I just squeezed some lemon juice on them and it was perfect.  Winner!

The sauce that comes along with it compliments the sweetness of the crab meat so well!  We also ordered a Baked sweet potato and Mac & cheese.  They were both delicious!

 For an appetizer we of course did have the infamous stone crab which was everything I hoped it would be. Big chunks of crab that dont even need butter. But This place is far more than its namesake stone crab.  I had one of the best steaks I have ever had that night. It had a nice lightly charred layer on the outside and was buttery and tender on the inside. It makes me sad that I cant have it every time I have a steak. For sides I had there butter nut squash which was a bit to sweet for a side but I was warned by the waiter that most people order it as a dessert. For dessert they made me a wonderful birthday brownie sundae that was amazingly decadent. 

The staff was great. They were friendly and informative. We asked for a nice table that was more secluded when we made our reservation and that is what we got!",1,1,0

I've gone to Joe's several times now and I can safely say that it is the best place to eat on the strip hands down! The restaurant is easy to find, right off the strip. Took a couple of friends here to eat during my last visit to Las Vegas, and the experience yet again was exceptional. Got seated immediately and soon after was introduced to our waitress. Forgot her name but, her hospitality was great! I ordered the stone crab bisque and some crab claws. My friends had the Miso Glazed Seabass and Ribeye Steaks. Everything came out in a timely manner. The food was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! After our main courses we had some banana cream pie, which was some of the best pie I have ever had in my life!

The service was great, the food was delicious, and the prices are very fair. Also, what stood out was that everybody in that restaurant seemed like they enjoyed their job and weren't snobby. Which, in my opinion created a comfortable atmosphere.

Our waitress was amazing - she recommended all the best items beginning with the cucumber martini (AMAZING DRINK, like HEAVEN with seafood, just like she said and it got me tipsy) and my BF, being a whiskey man, ordered an extremely aged whiskey which he said was unbelievable. Started out with the 2nd Mortage featuring a little bit of everything ( their famous Alaskan King Crab, Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Cocktail, Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche) - holy moly, SO worth the money!!! They are known for their crab for a reason- I could have had a giant plate of that alone and be satisfied! Glad I didn't tho...

We also got Oysters Rockefeller which may be the BEST Oysters I have ever had

And for the main course, Surf N' Turf! So far, we are drunk, stuffed, and in HEAVEN!

Waitress is still very attentive and although we are so full, my sweet tooth could not pass up the dessert menu. The waitress was kind enough to offer a half slice of their home-made chocolate fudge pie. NO GOOD! Literally could not stop eating.

Not to mention, it is conveniently located right next to Vosges Haut Chocolat (I highly recommend their boxes of truffles). 

My dining experience can be best described as mediocre. Great intentions, questionable execution. I really wanted to like this restaurant but my expectations were not met. Two of the things I absolutely love is steak and seafood. When you have a restaurant that is known for both, you'd think this is food heaven. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. 

Bread basket- I usually don't talk about the bread but this one deserves it's own review. It is delicious. The variety is great. The pretzel mini loaf is really cute. 

Filet mignon- sadly, it is unimpressive. It had a slight off flavor to it and too salty. And a pet peeve of mine at steak houses is when I asked for steak to be on the rare side, it comes out dry and well done. 

Alaskan king crab- also quite salty as well and nothing special. Served with lemon and butter. 

Jennie's mashed potatoes- Not too bad but it also wasn't memorable either. 

Lyonnaise potatoes- Pretty good. I enjoyed eating it. 

Key Lime Pie- signature dessert was okay. Not my personal preference. 

Havana Dream Pie- Yum. This one is delicious. Might be a bit too sweet but still good. Served with slices of strawberries. It is soft, creamy, and sweet. 

Banana Cream Pie- This one is my favorite dessert. It is delicious. Not too sweet. Great banana flavor. light and airy. 

The service here is friendly and efficient. A tad bit unrefined and awkward at times. Slapping a spoon on a plate and served our side dishes cafeteria style. An elbow almost knocking someone out. And taking someone's eating utensils while they were still using them. Maybe I'm being overly picky but I'm comparing the service with other $$$ restaurants and it does lack a certain refinement. 

Would I come back again? I might just to give this place one more chance. I really wanted to like it but it was way below expectations.",5,2,2

We splurged a bit for the 24oz bone-in ribeye, and let me just say... this thing is HUGE! The steak is finished with a beautiful, perfect crust that would surely make any home cook jealous.

The stone crab claws are sweet, succulent, and juicy and come with an amazing mustard sauce. The shells effortlessly fall off the meat since they're pre-cracked. However, I found the medium claws a bit too small for me, so next time I would probably get the larger, more expensive claws which have more meat.

The key lime pie is another must-have. This thing is chilled to the point of almost being frozen, with an elastic, malleable texture akin to a gelato. It's really good.

The New York strip was expertly prepared and had great flavor. The hamburger was terrific and the hamburger patty melted in your mouth. The stone crab was tasty, but we only got a few claws as an appetizer (better with cocktail sauce in my opinion than with the mustard-based sauce that comes with it).

I wish they had a little deeper selection of craft beers to choose from, but aside from that it was a perfect meal and we will go back... Joe's seems different to me than the typical Las Vegas ""flashy"" restaurant.

In the end the 12oz steak only 8oz was edible, by edible I mean not eating charred burnt pieces of FILET MIGNION.

By the time I was 1\/2 way through the huge king crab legs and the rock crab claws, I had enough.  Both were really good but I reached a point where I lost the savory satisfaction and just wanted to finish it because it was so expensive.  Don't get me wrong, the first bite of the meaty king crab legs was exquisite but in the middle of the second leg, I think I was done.  

The rock crab legs are a lot firmer than I expected (like it had been frozen) but it was also tasty.  I thought the king crab legs were better though.  

The mustard sauce is not as good as it is made out to be.  It was really disappointing so I stuck with the drawn butter.

Pork Chop ~ This was delicious as well.  The best pork chop I've had in my life.  It was a huge thick piece.  Perfect amount of meat and fat.  

Steak ~ Had this last time we came here.  Also wouldn't expect the steak to be so delicious, but it was one of the best steaks I've had.  

Side dishes
~ Pan-fried sweet corn - Delicious.  Not the most special, but a great compliment to the meal
~ Sauteed garlic spinach - also delicious.  Something that could be made elsewhere, but another great compliment to the meal.

Arriving here is a little difficult if you don't know where to go.  Best is to park at Caesar's palace and walk through the shops.  We did valet off the strip, but we were late our first time since there was so much traffic.  Last night we walked from our room at the Bellagio and arrived early.

We went to Joe's Seafood while we were in Vegas for a friend's 40th birthday. 

FOOD

The food was really tasty.  We had crab bisque, seafood pasta and a Filet & Tail.  We were not hungry enough for sides but the rest of the table enjoyed the selection. 

The Crab Bisque was prepared better than the majority of restaurants. The only thing it was lacking was a little extra Crab.  I had the Filet & Tail.  The steak was prepared medium rare how I like it and had an excellent side seasoning which you don't need to much of but is good to bring the flavor together. The Lobster tail was good but a little over salted.  My girlfriend has the Seafood pasta and said it tasted too healthy.  That is not a real complaint unless you are anti healthy options.  The pasta had a subtle pesto flavor and was cooked perfectly. The Seafood was also prepared very well and combined with the pasta to bring the tastes together very well. 

Overall the food was about 3\/4 of a star. I am taking a little off for the over salting of the lobster and lack of crab in the bisque. 

ALCOHOL

The alcohol was pretty good. We are big Bourbon drinkers and they had a good selection of bourbons and my girlfriend had Amador neat which was the first time we tried it and it was a great sipping Bourbon.  

I had an Old Fashioned which was made very well. My girlfriend found it a tad too sweet. However it was one of the better Old Fashioned I have had compared to other seafood and steak houses. 

Our friend had their version of a Cosmo and said it was very good.  

Overall I would give the restaurant 1\/2 a star for alcohol. 

CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE 

The restaurant was very clean which is to be expected since it is a Seafood and Steak place in Las Vegas. Since I complained about the restroom in a previous review I will note that this one was very clean. 

The ambiance is great although a little loud but that is to be expected in a steakhouse with a large dining area.  This is not the romantic dinner for two stop.  

Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets one star. 

SERVICE

The service was great the waitress was excellent and gave good suggestions when asked.  She was also patient with me when I was breaking down the bill for three different payments.  Since I end up doing this at every outing, her patience was very much appreciated. 

Overall the service deserves one star. 

VALUE\/PRICE

The restaurant is priced appropriately for being a Seafood and Steak Restaurant in Las Vegas. We had four drink, two meals and a appetizer and with tip the check came to $200 which is absolutely reasonable.  My one comment on this though would be for that money there are better options in Las Vegas.  If I was at their D.C. location I might visit again.  

Overall the value\/price receives 3\/4 of a star. 

In conclusion the restaurant is about 4 stars.   There are far better options in Las Vegas and I probably won't be back unless someone reserves there again. However, the food, drinks and service were very good and should be recognized and rated appropriately.",0,0,0

My sister & I wanted to eat a nice steak for dinner but since our mom wanted seafood, we settled for Joe's (we were debating between Lawry's & Joe's). 

Ordered the tuna tartare, seafood platter, filet mignon, bone-in ribeye, creamed corn & mashed potatoes. The portions were A LOT smaller than anticipated. Definitely incomparable to Lawry's prime rib & sides. 

Tuna tartare- 3\/5 The appetizer was TINY with mediocre pieces of fish. The cracker? Used for the tartare was a bit like pork rinds without the pork. Was a good combo with the fish but definitely wouldn't order again. 

Seafood platter- 4\/5 Came with maybe 6 pieces of scallop, 2 shrimp, and 3 lobster tails? This was a lot smaller than was expected as well. The buttery sauce it came with was delicious but nothing spectacular. My mom, however, was satisfied so thus we were as well. 

Filet mignon- 2\/5 We asked for a medium rare but instead we got more of a medium, which was quite chewy. The steak was seasoned well but some parts were very salty. Definitely wouldn't order again. 

Bone-in ribeye 4\/5 The best part of the meal. Asked for medium rare plus and got exactly that. It was juicy, flavorful & tender. Since we shared all our plates, this was the first to go. 

Mashed potatoes & creamed corn! 4\/5 
Both tasted very good but again, small portions. The mashed potatoes contained some cheese and was topped with some kind of flakes that were amazing. The creamed corn was just absolutely phenomenal. DEFINITELY WILL ORDER BOTH AGAIN.

 Finally, dessert! Key lime pie & banana cream pie. 4\/5 Key lime pie was sour but the crust was delish! And the banana cream pie had a lot of cream in it but it was good as well. Had to order it since it's like. Only my favorite dessert ever. Also ordered the coffee (from Intelligentsia!) but it was so watered down & weak. Asked for an espresso instead. 

Service 2\/5 Our server was not very friendly and was quite slow to tend to our needs. He kept saying he would get back to us but seemed uninterested in serving us. 

Probably will never come here again.",4,2,2

One star for atmosphere, one more for the food. There really is nothing outstanding here and it's expensive. Perhaps upwards of $60 for a ribeye is standard these days, but to me that's a freakin' ripoff.

One of my dining companions, who lived in FL for many years and had regularly been to original branch of Joe's in Miami, said this did not stack up. 

The claws were decently prepared and the mustard sauce for dipping was tasty, but I've been to other similar restaurants that are far better. For $100 per person, including tip with an average of one drink and a dessert split by the entire table of 6, it felt overpriced for what we received.

While perhaps a few years ago, before the economy went south, it would seem that the prices being charged were symptomatic of a worthwhile premium for eating at a certain caliber of restaurant here in Las Vegas and simply having to pay the freight in order to do so, it now seems more like desperation borne of a need to squeeze every dollar out of customers in a city that has no real gravitas. 

Turn up the heat, Las Vegas, you can't be a world class city unless you mind the details and stop charging for the sake of charging. It's just not that cool here.",2,1,1

I came with a group of 4 and we were all starving so we decided to just order a bunch of food and share it family style due to it being all put first time dining here.

Food 

MAC & CHEESE - too cheesy imo and was mediocre at best. Definitely needs some hot sauce or something, but hard to eat just by itself. (NOT RECOMMEND IT)

SHRIMP AND SCALLOP CEVICHE - was pretty decent at first bite, but it has this exotic very strong tangy aftertaste that was too much for me. I'm not sure what flavors made it that tangy but it wasn't too delicious. (NOT RECOMMEND IT)

CRAB CAKE - this was simply delicious. has LOTS of crab and the flavors are amazing. only downfall is that the portion is small but I prefer quality over quantity at a higher end restaurant like this. Comes with their sauce and drizzle the lime on top to get the maximum flavor. (WOULD RECOMMEND)

STONE CRAB MEDIUM SIZE - these stone claw crabs, what they are known for, are not worth the price. It is abour $50 for I believe 6 pieces and it is not that good. Maybe it is because it is served cold, but I like my crab served warm. Taste is okay but would (NOT RECOMMEND IT)

RIBEYE STEAK - This is the holy grail along with the crab cake. It is about a $60 steak and it was amazing. Cooked perfectly medium rare and tasted 10x better than the stone crab legs. Steak is soft and does not need any sauce; just eat as served. (WOULD RECOMMEND)

TENDERLOIN SANDWICH - I was actually surprised by how good this was. The bread was tasty and the meat was extremely soft. Complemented by arugula and horseradish sauce, this dish was definitely my favorite if you consider price. For about $20 you get a delicious sandwich for a third of the price of the ribeye and almost just as yummy. (DEFINITELY RECOMMEND)

Lastly was the amazing service. Overall I think for the cost of the food doesn't match the quality of the food. Food wasn't so amazing that I would want to come back here. For how much I spent, I would rather eat at the Bacchanal Buffet for about the same price. I only rated this a 4 star instead of 3 because of the great service we had here.",1,0,1

Hubby and I had discussed well before we left for Las Vegas that we would try new restaurants this trip which meant skipping Joe's, but as we sashayed through the doors of the Forum Shops, there was Joe's smack dab in front of us, and he was calling our name . . . we thought there was no way on a Friday night without reservations we would get in without a long wait, but we looked at each other, each of us with puppy dog eyes, imploring each other to break the rule we already made and try to get into Joe's. Amazingly enough, they had availability for two in the back dining room in an hour which meant shopping a little longer than expected, but we were entirely grateful for the extra time to spend more money! Ha!

We really didn't have to look at the menu. We knew that a plate of select stone crabs was in order. As many others have said, they come in sizes from small to large and then ""select"". We always get the select. We are never disappointed. The stone crabs, meaty and succulent, are the star, but the mustard sauce is the kicker. Oh how I love that sauce . . . so much so that when I ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail as my meal, I asked for the mustard sauce instead of the cocktail sauce. Hubby had the Chilean sea bass. It was the best we've ever had in any restaurant. We also ordered the four cheese mac and cheese which was so delectable and creamy. As an aside, you could pick any item from their list of sides and be thoroughly entranced.

Atmosphere at Joe's runs the gamut and can please just about anyone. They have the ""outside"" patio which provides a casual experience and is perfect for people-watching. Just about everyone who walks into the Forum Shops from Las Vegas Boulevard walks past you. There is the bar room and can watch your favorite game while you drink, dine and root for the home team. And then, my favorite, the back dining room which reminds me of an old Italian steakhouse where your servers are dressed in tuxes and provide some of the best service in Las Vegas.

This place is high end in decor, service and quality, so expect to lay out about $100\/person for drinks, salads, entree, etc.  But if you have never had a stone crab (I hadn't), it was a great experience.  Had to go with the 4 piece appetizer crab, which comes peeled like a hard boiled egg.  Really superior crab and you get their secret or not so secret mustard sauce, which was so good, I wouldn't let them take it after the appetizer.  Plenty of other things to dip in that sauce.

I am not sure why they have such a high rating. Service was really good and the waiter knew his stuff the price-point is a bit high but quality of food is lacking!!!!!! 

The bread they bring out as an appetizer was standard some pieces though tasted like hospital bread, you know the bread they serve in a plastic bag at the hospitals. NOT IMPRESSED. 

I ordered the Filet Mingon and I was not impressed more so disappointed ... I ordered it medium on the bone. Half the steak was cooked well and the inside was cooked medium.The filet was chewy at the end and not packed with that juicy flavor you suppose to get out of a filet. The ends toward the bone were very very fatty. POORLY COOKED FILET MINGON.
The swordfish was not good. Did not taste fresh and was a bit on the rubbery side. Just so wrong. The sauce that comes on top was flavorless. 

The stuffed mushrooms with spinach were very good and tasted great, perfect play between cheesy and crunchy.

I believe there specialty is stone crab but we didn't try it. Its supposedly these crabs that they tear off one claw and throw them back into the ocean....

My suggestion though is with a bill close to 160 dollars for food the quality of two entrees 2 deserts and a cappuccino did not deliver great quality food for value. 

THE ONLY REASON I WOULD GO BACK IS FOR THERE AMAZING PIE. WHILE THE BANANA FOSTER IS GOOD THE KEY LIME PIE IS JUST HEAVEN ON EARTH MADE BY THE KEY LIME PIE GDS. ITS BEYOND AMAZING. I'm a huge fan of key lime pie and this is in the top two best key lime pies Ive ever had in my life. GO THERE AND JUST ASK FOR A SLICE OF KEY LIME PIE. They have a baker that comes in every morning and specifically bakes THE PIES. It delivers freshness and this thick graham crust, its scary to say PERFECT. 


KEY POINTS TO KNOW ABOUT SEATING: 

IF YOU ARE GOING THERE FOR DINNER EVEN AFTER I SUGGEST YOU LOOK FOR ANOTHER PLACE WITH BETTER QUALITY FOOD AND YOU WANT THE WHITE TABLECLOTH DARK DINNER FEEL, WALK TO THE BACK......ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK. IF YOU SPEAK WITH THE MAN THAT SITS YOU IN FRONT HE WILL SIT YOU AT TABLES NEAR THE BAR AREA OR OUTSIDE BY THE FRONT WHICH IS GREAT FOR LUNCH BUT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE EAT DINNER OVERLOOKING MALL SHOPS EXPERIENCE FOR LATE DINNER.

I believe every single casino has a steak house and to me they are all beat by Joe's.  At least the ones i've been too (reviews to come).

Joe's is known for their Stone Crab, which I enjoy but each steak I have had there has just been amazing.  Which says something for their attention to quality.   This consistent quality has kept me coming back and stopped me from trying other places as I can only eat steak once in a weekend. 

The only reason Joe's doesn't get 5 starts is some of their sides haven't been the best.  My favorite of the side dishes is the sweet corn. The Stone crab is always on point but I keep coming back for the bone in rib-eye.  Which is served with some sort of seasoning which just brings out the flavor in every bite.

As I stated earlier, there are steak houses everywhere in vegas.  What puts Joe's on top for me is their Key Lime Pie!  It may not be for everyone but for me it has the perfect amount of sweet to tart ratio.  A thing you notice is that it is not a light green color but a yellow.  So if you ever get a key lime pie that is green just send it back!  Once you have had Joe's your standard in pie will have gone up I promise.",0,0,0

The Stone Crabs and the mustard sauce are amazing ....so amazing they deserve a SHAM WOW!!!!

Well we went with a big group of 9 adults and two kids.... We were seated in the private dining room to the very very back... we had the whole room to ourselves and there was a TV to watch the UCLA get demolished that night....

Usually we eat at the bar area and this was the first time sitting in the dining room.


Service was spot on by the waiter... he gave us some hints at what to was good on the sides for the table and the specials...

Well I had the Bone in New York strip Med Rare... it came out nice and juicy...
Well worth it and packed with flavor...
They waiter also gave me a seasoning mix that they make if i wanted to season my steak a little more then they had..and instead of using the table salt and pepper..

This seasoning was good... wish I could get the recipe...

For sides we ordered mushrooms.. they were very good
Lyonnaise potatoes... just like they should be made... I tried to take more them my fair share... The special side was some corn dish... so good we ordered an extra for the table... well worth it....

OOOHH I forgot my BLT Wedge Salad.... this salad had a nice sweet twist that went well with the salty bacon.... a must try for wedge lovers.


And for desert... the waiter steered us clear of several of the items... and said their signature desert was the Key lime pie...made with Key limes shipped in from Florida

Great choice nice and tart and the graham cracker crust was nice and solid...not soggy like others...

While on our honeymoon, my husband and I wanted to spoil ourselves with one night out to a really great restaurant. After much research, we decided on Joe's. We made a reservation online.
We showed up right on time and waited about 5 minutes to be seated. I have never seen a place so packed in my life. The restaurant is huge.

We were seated at a booth in their back room. Our waitor was fantastic. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the food.

We ordered calamari for an appetizer. I love calamari and order it almost anywhere I can. I'm from New England so I love seafood. This was probably some of the best cooked calamari I've ever had. It wasn't chewy at all, with a melt in your mouth texture. The seasoning was perfect.

My husband ordered the petite filet. It was, also, cooked perfect. Warm red center and didn't even need a steak knife to cut through.

I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp. It was really good. Not the best thing I've ever eaten, but still really good. I do wish I would have ordered the petite filet after tasting my husbands, though. It was that good.
We ordered a side of Jennie's mashed potatoes which were fantastic.

But, to my favorite part... dessert....
I ordered the apple pie and my husband ordered the coconut cream pie.
His was good. Mine was incredible. The piece of pie they gave my was GIANT with a generous helping of vanilla ice cream. My husband ate all of his and then some of mine it was so big.
I dream about that apple pie now.

I didn't send it back since it had already taken a while and we had a show reservation after dinner.  I didn't want to risk the time.

The price is commensurate with any top-end steak house, but the result wasn't.

We also had some of their famous crabs and they were very good.  The claws were pre-cut enough to make it pretty easy to get the meat out.  Their mustard sauce for the crab was very good, though honestly I prefer them with just butter.

After having our dinner here, I have decided Joe's is actually a 3-star restaurant hidden behind their parade of waiters in suits and their famous Stone Crab. 

In a city bustling with celebrity chef restaurants, Joe's fails to scratch at the surface of the upper echelon that consists of places like SW Steakhouse or Joel Robuchon. There's no single bad element that defines Joe's, but it was a combination of little miscues that diminished my experience here. 

1) mac & cheese was too runny for my liking. I thought gourmet mac & cheese would have more texture, but this side dish was slathered in Kraft-like liquid cheese.

2) Most upscale joints have their waiters\/assistants scrap off bread crumbs off the white tablecloth onto a pan. Details like that are supposed to enhance your fine-dining experience. But this particular evening, the assistant to our waiter just scraped the breadcrumbs onto the ground. I felt that small detail made my dinner less-than-memorable. 

3) The complimentary bread was less than stellar. I have had better bread at lower $$ establishments. I liked that there was variety to the bread basket, but some of the choices tasted stale. 

Pops and I both ordered the steak & lobster dinner. Dinner tasted delicious, but it fails to distinguish itself from previous steak and seafood joints I have eaten at.

You can't go wrong with Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab if steak, crab, and carbs is on your meal plan.  The gf and I came here for a Halloween dinner date.  This wasn't our original pick, but I'm glad we ended at Joe's for dinner.  From start to finish, the service was excellent.  We had reservations, which meant no wait.  Our orders were taken care of quick.  But most importantly, we were taken care of good.  

Like most restaurants, we started with a bread basket.  Their mix of bread and carbs didn't have a chance. We killed every piece of bread in that basket.  Then there was our meals.  I had their Petite Filet Mignon, but this was not petite at all.  Here at Joe's, they do everything big. A petite filet here is 8 oz and cooked to my liking (medium-well).  The filet was tender, juicy, and so so good. I'm not stating that this is the best steak that I ever had, but it's still good enough for me to want to come back.  My gf had their Florida based Stone Crabs.  You know, the parrot beaks that you see on the billboards off our freeways.  I think she loved it because she finished her plate. For our sides, I got the mash potatoes and my gf got the mac n' cheese.  And of course she did.  The mash potatoes and mac n' cheese, like the bread, didn't have a chance.  Both were good and a must if you're having steak and crabs. 

Overall (ie. long story short)...Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab has good steak, fresh crabs, and great service.  Prices are decent as well. 

Parking Tip:  Valet at Joe's.  If you're going through the main Caesar's entrance, it's the first right after the Caesar's and Forum split.  Sure beats having to walk through the Forum Shops to get here.  

PS:  I've been told that the Alaskan King Crab is the best at Joe's.  I have never been a huge Alaskan King Crab fan. But those that are, should give them a try.

It has absolutely nothing to do with the original one, I have been more than 30 times to the original in miami and the only thing I can say is that the one in las vegas is horrible in every way, for example In vegas the clam chowder was not only cold but we had to return it because it tasted like dirty laundry, then we ordered the wedge salad where in miami they bring you a huge portion witch most of times you have to share because it is so big, in vegas they brought me a 1\/3 of a half, i returned it telling them that there most be a mistake on the portion, 10 minutes later they brought me the exact same portion telling me that in vegas is a different portion, then we ordered the stone crabs, incredibly they didn't had the most common size witch is the large and told us that they only had the jumbos that were priced about $ 85dls per order,  20 minutes later another person came and told me that they had ran out of the jumbo's but now suddenly they had the large ! so we ordered the large, it was not surprised that when the stone crabs came they were frozen and not good at all,  a fresh stone crab should not stick to the shell and this ones were a disgrace for what they charge, the sweet potato fries are completely different as well, and the signature key lime pie is also not made the same way and tasted nothing like the original. If you plan to go to Joe's Do not consider by any means to go to the one in Vegas, It has nothing to do with the original in Miami,  I keep asking me why would they change a great menu like the one in Miami to make a worst one? please some one tell me ! they should be ashamed to be called Joes stone crab.",0,0,0

The place is very upscale and classy. 

We ended up ordering the stone crab, oysters, steaks, mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts, and a bottle of wine. I don't eat seafood but I tried the stone crab and it was pretty good. My boyfriend and our friend got a second order because they couldn't get enough. Joe's sauce that they serve it with is excellent! I even dipped my vegetables in it! The steaks were cooked to perfection and side dishes were delicious too. They serve a salt, pepper, garlic mixture to put on the steaks. 

Our waitress was Hope. She was very attentive and nice.

The staff, especially the head maitre d' where extremely rude.  We brought a very nice bottle of wine with us and were informed we could not open it. Mind you we were seated with water poured. They did not allow it and no one did on the strip.......um we paid corkage the past three nights at high end places no problem. We had a show to go to and did not have enough time to take the bottle back to our hotel. The lack of costumer service and extreme arrogance for such a high respected place was astonishing. On the web site nothing was stated that you could not bring wine in. Went over to the Old Homestead Steakhouse and they were more than happy to open our wine, had the best prime rib there!

Needless to say we were a few minutes late but guess what?  Even though there were plenty of empty tables we STILL had to wait.   $39 for 7 claws with hardly any meat.   Scallops were lightly fried (this is really just a way to hide that you can't cook scallops right).   The mushroom stuffed spinach was mushy and hard to eat.  The potatoes had hard parts and were overcooked.   We ate at 5 places that were ""destination"" style places and this was the worst.   

Finally, ""Joe"", our waiter, was more interested in serving the table of 20-30 people (even though it wasn't his table) than making sure we had our bottle of wine poured (we got a busser to do it).   Why would I server need to pour our wine?  It was a bottle of white that they didn't keep chilled tableside but instead near the center column 40 feet away from us.

Unfortunately it was the same weekend that the Billboard awards were in town and there was over a 2 hour wait.  Thomas, the Maitre D', humbly apologized, but there was no way to get us in sooner.  I explained to him that it was our first date night in a long time.  I surprised my wife with a sitter, we recently saw the Stone Crabs on T.V. and really craved it etc...He asked us to wait by the bar and he would see what he could do.  We figured we could see some industry people so we went to the bar and waited.  I think I see Carley Rae Jepsen here.  Darn, I have that song now in my head... ""Hey I just met you, call me crazy, so here's my number, so call me maybe...""  20mins later, Thomas comes by and says he could seat us and thanked us for the wait.  He knows how it was to get out on a date night and wanted to accommodate us.

From the start, we were given the VIP treatment.  As our server, Ashley, was placing the napkins on our lap, she noticed I had dark pants.  I usually request a dark napkin, but she immediately said ""I'll go and get you a dark napkin"" without hesitation.  Knowing and predicting my needs before requesting, sign of great customer service.  Another mark of an exceptional restaurant is that they left my wife and I alone most of the time.  This gave us the opportunity to talk and spend time together without interruption.  This is not to say they were not attentive.  They were more than attentive, but they did it in the background.   They worked as a team.  The person filling our water, the person bringing our bread, the person clearing out table, everyone was exceptional.  They knew exactly what was needed at our table and would rarely need to ask.  I would look down and have a fresh glass of ice tea.  Working as  team to help each other to make sure the client experience was exceptional.

Obviously we were there for the Stone Crab Claws, but Ashley made a suggestion of their signature table side Cole Slaw.  Cole Slaw?  She said we would not regret it and she would make it personally.  The Stone Crab was obviously amazing.  Sweet, succulent and delectable, with a hint of tang and heat on the back of the palate from their homemade mustard sauce.   When I die, I want heaven to be made of marshmallows, rainbows and Stone Crab Claws from Joe's!  And she was right, I absolutely loved the table side Cole Slaw. 

When the meal was finally over, Ashley comes over to the table and brings over 2 bowls with a hot towel and lemon in each bowl.  She squeezes the lemon on our hands for us and we proceed to clean our hands with the towels.  This was going above and beyond on the service.  As we were done with our dinner and leaving, Thomas asked ""Mr. & Mrs. Chan, where you happy with your experience here tonight?""  I explained how it was one of the most exceptional times at a restaurant I've had and would be telling everyone about it.  He handed me his card and thanked us for joining them that night.  

Needless to say, we've been back a few times, including my 40th birthday dinner.",0,0,1

We had reservations at Gordon Ramsey Steak, but we've been disappointed with so many fancy restaurants on the Strip and decided to go with something a little less expensive. I had the 6oz filet, hubby had the filet with lobster tail. Either his filet was much smaller than 6oz or mine was a lot bigger than 6oz, not sure. It averaged out to enough food for both of us, but that seemed odd. I didn't think the food was super good, however to be fair, I rarely think restaurant steaks are as good as what hubby makes at home. Wishing I had tried the sea bass. Our server, John, was awesome tho and gave us a great experience. So glad we chose to move to the ""patio"" and got him. Their key lime pie and Havana Dream Pie are really good! Our bill came out to just under $200 after tip and that included a bourbon, two $9 glasses of wine and one $23 glass. It wasn't worth that much in my opinion, but Vegas dining isn't cheap.",0,0,0

I started with the wedge salad that was pretty tasty, even with the bleu cheese crumbles! I also had babe start with the Crab Bisque - it' comes in a TINY bowl. Like, it's totally small. I'm not sure if they have other sizes or not but our server didn't ask us if we wanted a bowl or a cup but anyways it was QUITE good. 
For my entree it was between the two Scallop meals. I chose the Seared Sea Scallops with braised pork belly, cabbage and kale. The scallops were fantastic and the pork belly was melt in your mouth delish!!! 
Friend ordered the 8oz Petite Filet Mignon and it was cooked a perfect Medium Rare. He was actually ranting and raving about how delicious his steak was for DAYS after and he's had some good steaks in his time! 
We also had a side order of Stone Crabs which were delightfully cracked already and DELICIOUS! I don't usually like cold crab but it was SO good.

I just wanted to update that I was here again and sat in the dining room as last time we sat in the bar... The service was phenomenal and I especially loved the lemons and towels they provided at the end of our meal!

That said, we've been here three times now, and I think I'm finally beginning to understand the hype.

First - the service is great. To me, service is what makes or breaks a great dining experience. Even if the food is amazing, bad service can make you leave a restaurant feeling like it was terrible. That's not the case here. We're usually served by Brian (who was recently moved up to a somellier) - and he has been nothing short of helpful, friendly, and attentive. Honestly, my wife and I both waited our fair share of tables in our lives, and Brian has far exceeded what we consider ""good service"". 

Ok - so the crab - I'll admit that while it took me a while to get into, I'm starting to love it. The mustard that it comes with is quite nice as well. Really yummy stuff, and it feels good to eat something so out-of-the-ordinary when we're in Vegas.

I've also had their Filet - which was, to my opinion, a little too much on the ""Pittsburgh"" style for my tastes. I know a lot of Yelpers like it, but it didn't blow me away. Super tasty, it's just a personal preference for cooking style.

I had the pork chop most recently - the portion was HUGE - like a dinosaur pork chop - really yummy stuff. We also had the crab cakes, which were epic - almost nothing but lump Blue Crab - delicious in ways I never thought crab could be.

Finally - the dessert - Brian recommended the Banana's Foster pie to us on our first visit nearly 6 months ago, and we haven't been able to find a better dessert anywhere ever since. I've read the key lime pie is great, but I honestly don't know how on earth you could top the Banana's Foster pie. Decadent, creamy, with a homemade caramel sauce on top - there aren't many better ways to end a night in Vegas (ok, maybe a few ;)). 

Joe's has now become one of our Vegas staples - and for good reason.",4,2,1

The Stone Crab is the star - and may I say, OMFG. I recommend the medium sized option (arguably more flavorful than the large ones) - about $30 for seven, enough to feed two to three as an appetizer. 

Each claw is about the size of a thumb. The meat - perfectly chilled and just the right bounciness in the bite. The dipping sauce - creamy, tangy, flawless.

Everything else - The fish, salads, Stone Crab Bisque, steaks, the impeccable service - all top notch. I've visited the Chicago mothership several times and can vouch that the Vegas version stays true to the quality of its brand.

Forget about celebrity chefs and impossible wait lists, go to Joe's and feel like a KING!",4,4,3

The crab claw was good but I felt like it was a little overpriced.  I get that it's Vegas but still.  For the entree my husband did the filet mignon and I did the scallops (I don't eat red meat).

I'm not used to the battered part.  The portion was huge and I just couldn't get through it.  For sides the table got the creamed spinachs, hash browns, and a seasonal corn dish.

We were all happy with that part.  It was the cocktail issue that had me like ... what?

In most places, bar, restaurant, arenas, wherever, when you order a double, you pay more.  Duh, makes sense.  But in VERY few places if any, does a double LITERALLY mean double the price.  Ask the people at the Cirque shows who will sell you a single cocktail for 12 or a MONSTER for 18.  Anyway, the point is, had the waitress been clear, we would have had no issue.  But when you say, ""You want a double?  You only pay a little more,"" you are misleading your customers.  One thing is 12 to 18; another is when you pay $1 under twice the amount for a double.  Really?  Who you fooling there?  I repeat, had you been clear on this whole thing, then it would have been up to us to take it or leave it, but don't mislead your guests with such nonsense.  At the end of the day, I can drink cheaper and better in 10,000 other places in Las Vegas.  Markup on wine and liquor at a place like this is expected, but that is just ridiculous.",1,0,0

I called to confirm on 09\/29 and to increase the guest count to eleven.

This morning, prior to lunch, Joe's called me to confirm my reservation for ten. I corrected them that the reservation is for eleven, not ten, two tables on the patio, one of (5) and one of (6).

Upon arrival, a long table of four-tops had been set for eleven people. Two people had to sit pressed together at the end of the table which was uncomfortable for those guests.

We advised the waiter that we had two $25.00 coupons which he declined, allowing one per table.

Ma√Ætre d Thomas offered to reassemble us into two tables to accommodate the discount coupons, however we chose to remain seated as we were rather than create ruckus at the lunch hour.

Another reason for specifically asking for two tables was that it becomes a bookkeeping headache to breakdown a check of eleven people as most guests prefer to pay by credit card; this is essentially a business lunch.

Our waiter said separate checks are not allowed but that he could break the table into three checks.

The $25.00 coupon was applied to all three checks, the tip of course, was added to the total bill.

We managed to dissect the bill, figure the discount and the tip and make arrangements to repay the person who paid by credit card.

I had announced to the reservations person, Kayla, that we are locals, as she indeed could see by my phone number in Joe's records.

The point of my message is that we were extremely disappointed in today's transaction with Joe's Seafood. Regretfully, I believe we'll hold our monthly luncheons elsewhere and sadly, this sort of experience discourages future repeat business.",0,2,0

Joe's is located on the bottom floor of the Forum Shops near the main entrance.  Although their signature seafood item is stone crab claws, Joe's also offers king crab legs, lobster, oysters, and steaks.  

We started off with 1\/2 dozen kumamoto oysters ($16.95), the select stone crab claws (MP | $49.95 for 6), and fried calamari ($14.95).  In addition to select size crab claws, they also offer medium and large.  Sorry, only the oysters and crab claws are pictured.

First of all, the oysters were super fresh and briny.  It was a great way to start the meal w\/ a savory steak to follow:  5 Stars.  Secondarily, the calamari was OK.  It was fresh, but I thought the portion was small for the price:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the crab claws were surprisingly mediocre.  I was expecting a mind numbing experience, but my cousin and I thought they were just OK.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong size, but we were not impressed:  3 Stars.

For our entrees, we ordered items like crab stuffed shrimp, filet mignon, surf & turf ($54.95), salmon, and bone-in ribeye ($54.95).  You know what I ordered, because it is the only entree pictured - LOL.  My steak was excellent.  It was huge, void of any unnecessary fat, and cooked medium rare as requested.  Additionally, it was seasoned to perfection:  5+++ Stars.

For our sides, we ordered french fries, mac & cheese, creamed spinach ($8.95) and broccolini ($9.95).  Sorry, but I was only able to take a good pic of the spinach.  All of the sides were very good, and reasonably priced compared to Mastros:  4 Stars.

For dessert, we ordered the signature key lime pie, coconut cream pie, and a brownie sundae (all $8.95 each).  You know what I ordered, because it is the only dessert pictured - Hehehe.  First of all, the key lime pie was sublime (get it?  Hahaha).  It was tart, and had a perfect graham cracker crust.  Likewise, the brownie sundae was excellent, and it was a huge portion.  My only rec is to offer walnuts on the side.  Lastly, the coconut cream pie brok da mout (tasted very, very good).  It too had a perfect graham cracker crust, but the toasted coconut put it over the top.  Joe's version of my fave pie is the best I have ever had!  I didn't mind the price, unlike overrated Pie Hole in DTLA:  All 5 Stars except the last item which was 5+++ Stars.

The service on Sun, 8\/7 @ 6:30 pm from Mike V and his team was excellent.  He and the rest of the team were super nice, attentive, and just a pleasure to have as our team.  In addition, Mike was really knowledgable about pairing wines w\/ entrees, and informative about the menu.  He really earned his 20% tip:  5 Stars.  Not to be outdone, the ambiance is fancy w\/ a lot of dark wood.  However, it was not overly loud like Mastros Beverly Hills or Costa Mesa:  5 Stars.

I can't wait to return to the Ninth Island, and to hit Joe's again.  The food, desserts & service are fantastic, and the prices are more reasonable vs Mastros.  Dinner for 7 w\/ no alcohol was $610 inc 20% tip.  I've paid more than the foregoing for a table of 5 at Mastros!!!",51,32,46

I heard about Joe's on Food Network and knew there was one in Miami.   To my surprise my friend Karen told me that there was one in Las Vegas.  So being the foodie that I am, I had to check it out.  Joe's decor is reminds me of a NYC steakhouse. Dark wood tables, chairs and floors.  The stone crabs are definitely the star in this place, hence the name.  The stone crabs come pre-cracked so the all the hard work is done for you.  The meat is sweat and very flavorful and pairing it with the honey mustard sauce is genius!  I had the scallops and the gf have the crab stuffed sole.  The scallops came out alone with a little green garnish and a little greasy.  For me, it was too plain.  I needed something to go along with the scallops, maybe a mixed green salad wtih balsamic vinegrette.  The crab stuffed sole was great, especially when dipped in the sauce.  The onion rings were good if you like them thin and stringy.  The mashed potatoes with the fontina cheese is to die for!  Granted were on a low-carb diet, but you have to try it.  You only live once!  As you can tell, we obviously weren't able to finish the meal so we brown-bagged it home.  What a night at Joe's!

They crack the shell up pretty good and you just have to peel away the shell and eat. The waitress said to just eat it like you would a hard boiled egg.

Apparently, the fishermen catch these crabs, cut off one of the claws, and then throw them back. The claws grow back and then they later get caught again.

I do recommend starting off the with some stone crab claws.

Server seemed a bit perturbed but whatever, couldn't discern why. The beet salad was so salty. I tried eating it but couldn't. He offered the other appetizer options, which I didn't want. He told me he already put my fish order in so I better hurry and decide as he walked away. When he returned I repeated I didn't want the fried calamari or raw fish so he said they'd make a new salad. That was salty as well. He took the plate and said the manager will taste it and he would charge me for the house salmon. Fine. No response as to whether the manager's taste buds were similar to ours.... 

The Copper River Salmon did NOT taste or look wild but as it was over cooked and the beet drama, I ate it.

One nice touch: after I was finished, an assistant came by with a lemon, and squeezed the juice over my hands into a waiting bowl.  He then gave me a hot, wet towel.  Much appreciated.

I had glazed black cod as an entree.  It was a big piece of wonderfully moist, flaky fish.  The glaze was excellent.  A trifle sweet, it began to cloy after a few bites.  Not to worry - half a lemon was provided; the juice made the sauce perfect.  On the other hand, I could have done without the pedestrian French fried sweet potatoes.",1,0,0

The service could not have been better - the drinks perfect and the steak.....I would order again and again and again!

We have been eating at Joe's for years, and it's always been one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas due to the excellent food and service.  My husband proposed to me there in 2010.  We went there last week (on the 4th anniversary of our engagement).  My husband told the maitre'd it was a special occasion, which he ignored and said ""tell your waiter"" (which we did).
We arrived at 7 p.m.   We were rushed to order.  Our food arrived within 5 minutes (we were having cold crab legs and hot sides).  It was faster than McDonalds.  We were never asked if we would like coffee or dessert and the anniversary of our engagement was totally forgotten.  We were presented with the check at 7:25 p.m. 30 minutes after sitting down.

Our server Todd provided outstanding service.  His recommendations were spot on, and he provided guidance to our party of 8 on how to order and share our side dishes, without wasting food.  We had the seasonal roasted corn, loaded lyonnaise potatoes, and broccolini.  All three were flavorful and seasoned jut right. 

My meal started with a perfect martini served in a classic martini glass.  My least favorite item was the Ceasars salad; it was just okay. My husband's lobster bisque balanced out the poor salad; the soup was piping hot with superb blend of cream and lobster chunks. 

I shared a bone in ribeye with my friend, and I'm glad I did.  The portion was very large, and cooked perfectly to our request.  The steak was served on two separate plates, ready for us to dig in without having to cut it and divide up ourselves.  My mouth is watering thinking about it now. 

Todd recommended the key lime and Havana pies.  My husband and I shared the Havana pie.  Oh my goodness!  Perfect ending to our perfect meal.  Highly recommend.  

Last but not least, we were pleasantly surprised to learn the restaurant offered a VERY generous military discount.  This discount was greatly appreciated and will make this a repeat restaurant when we return to Vegas.

We had some drinks at the bar and each of us was charge a gratuity of 18% on our tab.  After our bar drinks, we received no service from the waitress on beverages.

We ordered all of the sides, soups and salads on the menu and especially lots of snow crab.  We heard great things about the restaurant and unfortunately our experience did not match other's experiences.  The snow crab was significantly smaller than Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, where we ate the previous night.  We recommend Del Frisco.  The snow crab seemed to have been frozen for a very long time; it was fishy, grainy, and not well cooked.  The frozen taste was strong throughout our entire order of crabs.  It was so far from fresh and tasted terrible.  Even the horseradish sauce could not hide the low quality taste.

The artichoke and crab dip appetizer was excellent.

The Manhattan chowder soup was tomato based, salty, and TONS of DIRT grains.  It was difficult to consume with every taste full of grains. This was the worst soup on the menu.  The crab bisque was great.  

The plain potato hash browns were good.  They are boiled potatoes that are placed in a baking dish and toasted on the top.  Not great but good.  The Lyonnaise however, was not pleasant.  It was overfilled with caramelized onions, which were so overpowering you could not taste the potato.  

The cole slaw had an interesting unique tangy taste.  The texture of the cole slaw seemed prepackaged, over shredded, soggy consistency, and poor preparation.   Again, the taste was very unique.  Our group ate the least of this item.  The corn was not sweet; it had several bell peppers and way too much seasoning.  The spinach had too much cream.  The other sides were all very standard.

The key lime pie had a nice strong, sour, and thick creamy filling.  The gram cracker crust was over sugared and too thick.   

Worst of all, after such a disappointing dinner, our waitress made the mistake of charging our group the entire tab multiple times.  Several of us were charged the entire bill.  We brought this to the manager's attention and he had no idea as to how to handle the situation.  We had to break it down to the waitress and explain to her the billing error.  She had a difficult time understanding how to correct and reverse the charges.  We're still waiting on verification from our banks of the reversals, since the restaurant clearly cannot be relied on.

Steaks are very good but I would point you Ruth Chris' for a comparison - both in quality and price.  Personally I thought Ruth's had a better flavor and quality.

Side dishes - disappointing!  Not in the quality but the quantity.  Ordered the ""Roasted Cauliflower"" - dish came out with about 3 ounces of product on it - asked the server who said this was normal. For 9+ bucks - skip it.   

Service - now this was extremely good.  Over the top in professionalism and attentiveness.  Joe's need to make sure they keep this staff - personable, professional, gracious - outstanding!

This what my second time here and I have to admit I was a little disappointed this time. Don't get me wrong the food is great but this time it wasen't as fresh.

The service here is simply outstanding, they are just on top of everything and work as a team...awesome. The food was amazing as I expected it to be: king crab, stone crab and grilled prawn appetizers all done to perfection and a very nice bread basket too. Entrees (steaks and seafood) were prepared perfectly and everyone enjoyed, no complaints, but there were a couple of exceptions. The mac and cheese side was disappointing. It was very small as compared to the other sides, we had them all to share. It was not very cheesy either. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was not good. Not sure what the heck is on top (almost like sour cream), they should revisit that recipe.....others seemed to think they were ok. 

Let me just say I applaud Joe's for providing a Gluten-free and Vegan menu in the first place, however you better bring it. I was sitting close to someone who ordered the pasta with seasonal vegetables and felt extremely sorry for him. It was literally dry fettuccine with dark vegetables, absolutely no sauce. It was not appetizing looking at all. Obviously not enough thought was put into that dish and a huge disappointment even for those who sat nearby, this person who chose not to complain got down as much as possible before giving up. He made the most of the apps and bread, but actually said he would something later....shame, but I do say he did not give them a chance to fix it or provide an alternative :(

As I scoped out the surrounding tables, there were many tables of folks that were obviously visiting for conventions, etc. Lot of food and drink ordered, but there was also ALOT of waste. I noticed several times plates with a good amount of food being removed from the tables (the appetizers which are shared) only to go straight into the trash. I asked our waiter to box up our leftover apps and took them home. I have contacted Joe's asking them to consider donating to Three-Square as so many other restaurants and casinos do, this is simply terrible for all that food to go to waste when there are hungry people in our valley. I hope they will consider and by example encourage the rest of the Ceasar's establishments to do the same.

One last note: Only a few opted for dessert - the apple pie ala mode, holey moley that was a meal itself. The person who ordered it did a very nice job polishing it off and was almost successful at keeping others to a single forkful. It was huge and looked amazing, totally chock full of apples and seemingly very cinnamony, with a thin crust (YAY!!), with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream....wow, I would highly recommend that, but you have to give up part of dinner, there is just so much food.

Overall, a wonderful meal and we will return. Just a couple things could use some work.",1,0,0

I will admit, the two Hosts really need to work together and better their communication skills. 

What did we eat, too much! We ended up sharing a ceviche, crab bisque, crab cake, BLT wedge salad, Joe's scallops and the copper river salmon. The BLT was best.

Stone crab just taste like crab but the claws have a lot more meat. And the shell is really hard, hence the name, I guess. They don't have the sweetness that the dungeness crab has so I do miss that.

Our waiter was friendly, and knew the menu backwards and forwards. I ordered the Select 6 Florida Stone Crab claws, a side of saut√©ed garlic spinach, and roasted asparagus.

 you can choose from a series of sizes of crab, we went with the premium or middle-large size of crab. 

i've never had stone crab before but it is just the most sweet buttery delicious crab in the world, without any sense of brininess to weigh it down. it is simply heavenly. 

the steamed arms are brought out cold and cracked with big full pieces of crab meat in each joint of the arm served with a bit of mustard dipping sauce... no need for any sauce just take the crab flavor straight as is, it is just beautiful.

and just so you know stone crab are protected and only one limb is harvested at a time so that they can keep one arm to survive... and this does not kill the crab and their arm grows back with time. for you eco geeks out there that means that it is a sustainable food and good for the survival of the stone crab.

i cannot wait to go to florida to try it again near the source, one can only imagine how much better it can be!

- Available October 15 - May 15.
- Sold by size (medium, large, jumbo, colossal), price increases with size.
- Size matters for texture not sweetness.  Buy the largest you can afford.
- 2013 harvest starting at the lowest in history.  Astronomical prices ($12\/claw large, $25\/ claw jumbo).

For other menu items, stick to basics; KISS.  Great place for a casual, shared meal with friends.  Solid preparations for grilled lobster tails, steamed jumbo Alaskan king crab legs, classic oysters Rockefeller, and pan seared diver scallops.  The colossal lump crab cake excellent, moist, sweet.  Almost all crab with lumps sticking out in all directions.  Pick it up and eat it with your fingers.  

Good selection of steaks.  Two grades, USDA choice Angus and USDA prime.  All prime cuts are bone in.  Cuts are gently trimmed leaving some of the outer fat in tact.  Old school, fat is flavor style.   Even grilling and cooked to temperature.  It's beef, nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be.

Diverse side meant to be shared.  The grilled tomatoes are the perfect foil for the stone crabs.  Tart, acidic, blistered and  just warmed through.  

Save a little room for dessert.  Home made key lime pie.  They are known for it.  One of the best examples I've ever had.

Short but very well chosen wine list.  Whites perfectly target the clean seafood flavors from Spain, France, Italy and New Zealand.  Modest (2x-2.5x retail), Vegas resort pricing.

Casual, friendly, efficient service.

I had the John Dory and it was incredible. My wife had the jumbo lump crabcakes which were flavorful and filling. The pecan-topped sweet potato pie was an incredible way to finish our evening. Delicious!

We shared an order of stone crab claws and these were easily the highlight of our dining experience. The meat was flavorful and succulent. The accompanying mustard sauce was also superb, not that you need it when eating such fine crab meat.

I've been eating here two or three times a year for many years now.  It's not uncommon to make a trip to Las Vegas just to dine at Joe's and turn around and go back.

Located in the Forum Shops at Ceasars Palace (did you know that there is no apostrophe used in Ceasars Palace because the owner when it opened said that all guests entering were Ceasar).  Joe's interior has the look of an old school but high-end steak house.   Booth's are located in dark corners; old photos of Joe's origin restaurant in Miami adorn the walls, low ceilings, ornate light fixtures and a sample of Joe's large selection on wine is displayed along one long wall as you enter.

Joe's has large and varied menu featuring a selection of prime steaks, crab, lobster, and salads.  Every thing is al a carte so sides are served family style and generally large enough to serve the table depending on the size of your party.

I've sampled the rib eye and lobster but the reason I keep going back to Joe's is for the Alaskan King Crab.  The dinner portion features a 1  1\/2 lbs. of the largest crab legs I've ever seen.  Crab is usually tough meal due to the amount of work to free the sweet and succulent crabmeat from the spiny shell.  Once you're done leveraging your sheller and cracker you end up with a pile of crab flakes on your plate.  Not at Joe's they make it easy for you by cutting the shells open tableside.  It's a great show.  All you have to do is use your fork to pull out the meat, dip in the drawn butter and enjoy.  I've searched wide and far for other restaurants that serve crab in the same way and have failed miserably.  

Joe's sides and desserts are good too.  There is a large selection of potato dishes to choose from and vegetables ranging from roasted corn, asparagus, Brussels spouts and Saut√©ed Spinach.  The dessert menu features Key Lime Pie and pie of the month (April 2016 was Strawberry Ice Cream Pie), sundae's and other baked confections.  

The staff at Joe's is always friendly, knowledgeable and ready to help you make the right entr√©e or wine selection.  You will never lack for a refill of any drink.  Meals are delivered promptly and prepared expertly to your specifications.  If you are enjoying red meat you'll find the temperature is perfect (medium-rare is really medium-rare).

FOOD
When in Rome, so I had the Stone Crab.  After that decision had been made, I looked for other accompanying dishes and found a few gems.  The bread basket had 6 different & delicious breads - my favorite being the pretzel that is pictured here on Yelp. The cup of Crab Bisque was buttery with just the right amount of salt - probably could have a whole bowl.  The Caesar Salad had just the right amount of dressing although wasn't something I couldn't have gotten elsewhere.  The Select Stone Crabs were meaty & tasty as was the mustard sauce it came with.  The Hashed Browns were just okay and probably a lot more than I needed.  (And that was a HALF order)   And the coffee was brewed very well - no bitterness in there at all.

Bread basket:  4\/5
Stone Crab Bisque:  5\/5
Caesar Salad:  4\/5
Select Stone Crab Entree:  4\/5
Side Hashed Browns:  3\/5
Coffee:  4\/5


SERVICE
My server, whom I know the name of however I will refrain from using it because of the comment at the end of this review just in case, was genuinely as good as it gets.  Prompt.  Informed.  Courteous.  Friendly.  Accommodating.  This is frankly as good as I can expect without him comping my whole meal.

He advised adjustments to the portion size of my orders (""half orders, sir"") to ensure that I'd have room for everything.  The staff was Johnny-on-the-spot with every plate and the bussing was prompt enough.  My glass was almost always full and I never had to ask for the check or the status of a dish.


ATMOSPHERE
This is a beautiful restaurant, with an air of class and a bit of authority.  The folks in the main dining room know that the immediacy of service is important as is knowledge of the dishes so the people that work there seem focused on making sure people get the right dish for their tastes and they are all dressed the part.

Make no mistake, this is a more formal restaurant expecting a relatively nice dress code.  Not exactly ""coats mandatory"" but jeans on men at least are probably discouraged.  Slacker attire does stand out amongst the well dressed servers, dark wood booths, incandescent lighting, and draperies.


VALUE
$65 for everything above sans tip.  Not bad at all, and that was with the higher end ""Select"" Stone Crab.  The reason you might buy the ""Select"" Stone Crab is to get larger claws so that you spend less time shelling the cracked claws and more time eating the big beefy morsels.


CONCLUSION
I'll be back for certain.  It's not quite at that ""irresistable"" level however it definitely warrants several return trips - especially with the wifey.  Another thing:  This restaurant doesn't belong in the Forum shops - it's too classy and deserves better than the be across from a ""Sony Style"" retail shop.  They ought to pull up roots and move to the Palazzo where Sheldon Adelson could use a good restaurant with good value.

I was not at all expecting a seafood joint to have such great steak. A must have at Joe's. 

Their seared sea bass was also delicious. It was cooked just right so the fish melt in your mouth with just the right amount of flavor. 

The service was also great. We were seated in the big dining room the first time we were there for my mom's birthday. The seating area was a bit crowded but tolerable. Our waiter was very attentive. The second time we were there we had about a party of nine and they sat us in the private room without our request, which I thought was very thoughtful of them.

To start off, it's fancy. Don't show up in random clothes. The staff is formal, proper, polite, and extremely informative. They all know what they're talking about and help in every way. I would recommend this place to everyone, however, it's not cheap. You definitely pay for what you get! A good meal, at a good spot, with some great company. Make a reservation, save some time since they can get swamped with people. I ate here on my birthday and they even threw in some dessert no charge!

At this place, I've had many things but only listing what I can remember:

Bread: They serve bread once you sit. DON'T over-stuff yourself with it. I know it's beyond yummy but save your appetite, it gets better!

New England Clam Chowder: I'm not a fan of seafood whatsoever but I don't think this was bad. My bf loves this and orders it all the time. It's a nice portion and fulfilling. 

Caesar Salad: By far one of the best salads I've had. They split it to share if you ask and it's extremely light. The dressing isn't over-powering which I love, and they never drench it either. 

Crab Claws: Personally, I don't like them but that's only cause I don't like seafood too much. Once again, my bf LOVES them. They come with lemon to add onto them and bring you everything you need to eat them. I love how they bring out hot towels once you're done to clean your hands with. Big plus!

Filet Mignon: Ordered a Medium piece of meat. Wow! SOO good and they cooked it just the way I like it. It wasn't dry at all, very similar to Medium rare, without all the blood oozing out.

Mashed Potatoes: OMG! This is to die for! I ordered a half order, the portion is quite large with the rest of my meal. They layer them with cheese which gives it a little extra umph!

Parmesan Crusted Halibut: WIN! I LOVE this dish, everyone should try it. The crisp in each bite is to die for. My favorite thing to get!

I never know the name, but ladies, if you want some alcohol without it being overpowering and overwhelming, try ordering one of their special martini drinks. I always tell the server that I want their ""special peach martini..but I can't think of the name"" and they ALWAYS know what I'm talking about. The rim is covered in sugar and it is beyond refreshing and tasty. You can't even tell there's alcohol in there... based on the taste! I always get two when I eat here!

It is everything you want it to be.  It is confident, delicious, but not stuffy.  In Miami, Joe's has been around forever, but it doesn't suffer from the ""grand old favorite"" syndrome -- where everything feels tired and under glass.  This is classically-presented seafood, with exceptional service and stylish decor.

On a personal note, I still remember the delicious meal I had at Joe's in Miami, 18 years ago!  My mouth still waters.  When I discovered that Vegas had an outlet, we raced over.  I believe this is the only West Coast version of Joe's... so it's like a rare bird sighting.  Grab it if you can!
    
The food?  Ah!  The bread basket was crispy and delicious.  The Bloody Mary's were insane -- filled with shrimp and incredibly yummy.  A second round was called for!  The crab bisque is rich and wonderful, with the broth poured over a bowl stacked with crab.  Yum!  The Caesar Salad is fresh and terrific.   The oysters are fabulous, with a fine selection, and the server quite knowledgeable about their different qualities.  And the piece de resistance... the reason to travel to Joe's... are those Stone Crab Claws.  Joe's has some special technique for harvesting the crab claws, then tossing the crabs back in the water to grow another one!  It seems like black magic, but it's quite delicious.  We honestly thought we were stuffed and couldn't handle this final course, but the claws are quite truly the most delicious crab you'll ever have.  We ate and ate.  They come with a mustard dipping sauce, which is terrific, though they're wonderful just plain, too.  I assume they fly these crabs in every day from Florida, because the texture and quality was absolutely perfect. 

Yes, this is a rave.  One tip: When I tried making an online reservation through Open Table, the system said the restaurant was sold out (a Saturday night on a holiday weekend).

This particular location is quite random, very bottom floor the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace. When you walk it it leads to the bar area, which seems kinda fun but is mostly there for those enjoying happy hour. Dining area is either in the outside area where you can gawk at shoppers or in the back dining room where it's so dark, you might just fall asleep.  

The food selection is enormous. The wine list is so long, it's actually kinda intimidating, and the specialty drink list looks interesting (I opted for the Pomegranate Martini and ended up with nothing but a Welch's drink). Bread is not very good... they offer different variations which is a nice touch, but I don't know how you could possibly serve 7 different kinds of BAD bread? 

We finally decided on the steak and tails dinner: $49.99 each. Lobsters were small but the taste was truly decadent. Steak was OK - but was a little on the dry side. I did see a waiter debone a fish for another customer and I was truly amazed! He literally got every piece of fish off that bone and in record time, it seemed! Overall, dinner was a 4 stars (counting just the food). 

So, after we were done eating, it took a record of 20+ minutes for us to even flag anyone down to clear our table and bring us our check. We were trying just about anything to get the servers attention but to no avail. Finally, after a sturdy 'EXCUSE ME' - we finally got the waitresses attention.

John, our Maitre D, was back again and was his usual funny self.  He sat us inside the main dining area, and there was no wait for lunch on a Saturday.  Call ahead if you know you're heading there and he'll set you up.  

On my last visit, the stone crab claws were a bit disappointing, but we tried them again because it was a first for my friends, and this time, they were delicious.  Sweet, tender, and a better deal if you order the select variety with an order of 6 for $45.  

Of course I had to get the Alaskan King crab legs, and they did not disappoint.  Lunch prices were $55 for 1 pound as opposed to 1 1\/2 pound for $80.  If you want the dinner serving, they're more than happy to give it to you.  

Our party tried the ahi tuna sandwich, lobster tail tempura, oysters rockefeller, fried asparagus, sweet corn, and hash brown loaf.   All were delicious, except the hash browns.  I thought they were a bit overdone, and too salty.  They are topped with a ton of caramelized onions which at first sounded perfect, but they were way too oily.  That we wouldn't order again.  

We each finished our lunch with half slices of their pies. The flavors on the table were key lime, chocolate peanut butter, havana dream, and another flavor I can't remember.  If you like key lime, theirs won't disappoint.  But we were in absolute awe of the havana dream.  Our waitress described it as a tres leches pie, and it was amazing.  I even considered taking a whole pie home.  It's that good.  Don't be fooled by the ""half"" slice.  It's actually a very generous size.",0,0,1

'Nuff said: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=b_U71SJ8gwneofsDXbzzZg

Whenever I'm in Vegas, I always pay a vist to Joe's. The service is good and the food is awesome. I was even impressed with their bread basket full of warm pretzel bread (my favorite), fennel\/sesame flatbread, rye and cheese bread. 

Get the CRAB CAKE appetizer ($14.95 lunch, $15.95 dinner):
All meat-no filler. Big chunks of sweet, succulent dungeness crab served with Joe's special garlicky mustard sauce.
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=n6r04azWZWg9ffBImFPVug

Their sweet STONE CRAB CLAWS are my favorite type of crab to eat (yes, I prefer them over alaskan king crab). They're served cold and pre-cracked, with both the cocktail and mustard sauce, simple but so good!! 

 I either get them as a 4-piece appetizer (varies, market price):  
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=5ngQjeAYWk9ByzBr2JmX7g

SEAFOOD CHOP SALAD ($16.95 lunch,$18.95 dinner):
 It's a meal in itself, enough for 4 people to share. Yummy chunks of lobster, king crab and shrimp piled high on a lightly dressed salad. I hate raw red onions more than anything, but the fresh sweet lobster made up for it. 
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=u2NxFIR6JKtfSzgDXUgRKQ

The BACON-WRAPPED SCALLOPS ($23.95 lunch, $26.95 dinner) are also a must try. 4 large perfectly cooked scallops are wrapped with bacon to mimic a filet mignon. 2 ""filets"" per order. 
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=kgykWS4E17qRgC8GtkLqYA

The CRAB-STUFFED SOLE ($42) with asparagus was also yums and portions were huge (two decent sized filets wrapped into medallions). The fish was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The lobster sauce was undetectable, I could only taste the browned butter.

The side orders are huge, great for sharing. We usually order one or two at the most:
SWEET CORN ($7.95) is always a favorite of mine. It's pan-roasted in butter and yet it still had a nice crunch to it.

We sat at a table near the bar.  Our waitress came over and got our drink order, and about 10 minutes later they finally arrived with some bread selections.  Other people have commented that their bread was warm, but ours was cold.  The selection of different choices was a treat, and the lavashe covered with melted parmesan cheese went well with my Bacardi and tonic.  For our meal my wife and I decided to share an order of 7 large stone crab claws, shrimp cocktail, oysters Rockefeller, and the Aged 16 oz NY Steak.  Everything, and I mean everything was top notch.  The oysters were filled with bacon, cheese, and spinach; the shrimp cocktail, while not quite Morton's grade, was  tasty and had nice sized shrimp, the steak was thick, juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the stone crabs.....Words cannot explain how good these were.  Growing up in a Pan-Asian setting in Hawaii, there are very few sea foods that I haven't tried.  From Jellyfish salad, to raw squid, we have it all there.  I've had Dungenous, Maryland Blue, King, Snow, and last night finally, I got to cross Stone crab off my list.  While pricy at about  $60 for 7 Large pieces, they are divine.  Huge fatty pieces of perfect claw meat await you after taking off the pre-cracked shell.  Follow that up with a dip in Joe's famous mayo sauce, and you have the food that the gods were suckled on.  And oh yeah, we ordered a bottle of bubbly to compliment the sea food, and  cut the fattiness of the of the steak.  Overall, a great meal, and a great start to our Honeymoon in Vegas.  I would eat here every week if I could, but at $300 including tip, I wouldn't be able to make my car payment.  That being said, the service, although very friendly was slow, and I know that it was because it was so late, and we were literally the last seating, but I have been to places in NY and Chicago that were the same caliber of food, had a late res, and they took care of us the entire way.  Last night it felt like a great meal, but a little rushed.  Never a good feeling when you drop 3 bills for a meal.  So a little our fault, a little theirs.  Next time we come, I'll make an earlier res, and hopefully the service will be a little sharper.",1,0,2

I've been coming here for years, and trying various menu choices. It has been a corporate ""gift meal"" to high-performance employees and partners for the past 5-6 years.

Whether it's a light meal alone, with a partner, or with a group, Joe's Las Vegas never has failed to impress me. Patrick, Tim, Diane always seem to make it a experience vs merely a meal. I've discovered new wines and new foods here.

Always allow your server to select which stone crab you'll have. They generally know what's best on any given day.

I heartily recommend any of the bone-in steaks vs the standard steaks. Joe's specializes in bone-in. The Chilean sea bass is the only seafood I'll eat, and I was cajoled into trying it by Patrick at Joe's. As usual, he was right. I love it.

The host\/maitre'd was such a friendly fellow that made you feel so welcomed.  He is perfect for his position.  He welcomed us in and offered us an inside seat or an outside seat - we chose inside, as I was  not into watching all of the shoppers on the outside.  Cozy setting on the inside.  

Was I wrong about this place.  It was so freakin' good.  The first offer you 5 different kinds of breads - who would think a place like this  makes their own breads?!  There was a ciabatta, lavosh, olive bread, pretzel roll and a dinner roll.  I was impressed.  

We had to try the Stone Crab - pricey - $10 a crab, we had the large size - server's recommendation.  You can order as many as you want.  Don't have to go by what's printed on the menu.  She said it fell off the shell better.  It was really tasty and the mustard sauce was really good.  I am not a saucey person, but it certainly complemented the crab.  

We had the Manhattan Clam Chowder and the Caesar Salad next.  Both were also very good.  I had the salmon next and it was outstanding.  It was a special of the day.  It was cooked to perfection.  

The best part of the meal was dessert - the blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream was soooo good.  You can order a 1\/2 slice of pie - my recommendation.  But the best dessert was the Peppermint Ice Cream with the Hot Fudge.  Hot Dang!!!!  This was the best ever.....  This hit the spot and made this my favorite place to dine.

The stone crabs were meaty and mouth-watering.  They crack the shells so you don't have to struggle with it.  In fact, you just peel the shells away from the meat and enjoy.

And for dessert, their signature key lime pie is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I was in the Key West 2 weeks ago and had the opportunity to sample some of Key West's top key lime pie locations and it's interesting to say that Joes Seafood (in Las Vegas) was better.  Wow... Now that's impressive!",6,5,7

The stone crab is incredible! We ordered 4 large for two people and they were fresh! The sauce on the side is really good on the crab meat.  But they are good on their own as well.  All of our dishes were extraordinary. The seafood is fresh and the prime steaks are delectable.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Originally we loved going to SW steakhouse but they had recently increased their prices of our favorite rib-eye by almost $20, it was time to consider another place to try. One of our friends was coming to town with his girlfriend to attend a bachelorette party, so on the first night, before people arrived, we had gotten together for dinner. Reservations were made for 7 pm and apparently are dealt with separately from the front\/bar areas. Majority of the party was a bit late but we were promptly sat at the far back dining room as soon as we arrived to check in at the other counter, inside the restaurant. I had originally thought the restaurant was a bit small, with a seating area outside, bar area, and maybe another dining room upstairs but little did I know, besides the areas noted, there were 2 more dining rooms in the back, and supposedly banquet\/party style rooms upstairs.

Our waitress had came to us almost immediately as soon as we sat down and had told us about the specials while serving us two baskets of bread. The bread baskets included a few slices of raisin bread, a type of cracker (never know what these are actually called), pretzel bread, and a surprisingly moist and soft but sweet corn bread. 

One of the main items this restaurant is known for is the stone crabs. The stone crabs is a sustainable food item where they are heavily controlled and harvested only within specific size requirements. Best thing is, the crab stays alive and can regrow the claw after its removed. The crab claws at this restaurant are harvested from the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 

The stone crabs are served as a cold appetizer with a light mustard-type of sauce. Prices are as follows as of 03\/17\/17. Medium (7 per order - $40), Select (6 per order - $50), Large (5 per order - $70). Between 4 of the 6 people in our party, we had ordered 2 orders of the ""select"" size, by recommendation of the waitress for being the ""best deal and most commonly ordered"" and easily sharable due to the even quantity. 

Flavor-wise, to be honest, I really don't know why these are ""better"" than any other crab. Clean tasting with its natural sweetness. Texture-wise, its fairly similar to other crabs. Less ""stringy"". If anything, my complaint would be they cracked it too much and it was a pain in the butt cleaning the shells off before eating. 

Prior to coming here, I had a problem deciding on what to order, besides the crab. 

There was a lot of sharing with our party. Sharing between 2 people. The couples shared amongst themselves, of course. By suggestion of the waitress stating their bone in filet is a signature item, I guess that's what I was getting. 

The bone-in signature prime steaks are hand-carved by butchers in house and aged for 24 days priced at $57.95 for 16 oz. The size of the filet was pretty big and the bone was fairly small. I never knew you could do bone-in for filet's and I've always seen filet's extracted as a whole tenderloin, mainly either as a filet or as a chateaubriand. Typically I never order filet mignon or buy it but as it was a recommended signature dish, I decided to try it, as I usually cook rib-eye's a lot. The filet has a great crust. For a signature dish, I actually had thought they'd do an amazingly perfect cook with minimal gradient. I've never cooked filet so I can't say from experience but I know its difficulty. Seasoned really well and as said before, great crust. The center was a very cool and pink, almost closer to rare than medium rare. Great flavor from seasoning and the meat itself. When i got closer to the center of the steak, i had to use the provided side seasoning salt, but very minimal. Best filet ive had (not saying much since I haven't had much hahaha) 

Double-cut Colorado lamb chops w\/ mint chimichurri ($57.95) - this is what my friend ordered. As we were sharing, we had split halfsies on our orders. The order is almost like a full rack of lamb chops with the cuts at a borderline 3 bone cut. They state as double-cut because they cut so close to the bone on the outside bones. Paired with a great chimichurri sauce and a grilled lemon, it brings a bright flavor to the dish. Like the filet, great meat flavor and seasoning. Totally been craving chimicurri sauce lately too. One of the chops I had, the center was definitely raw-rare. Oh well xD better than overcooking my chop lol

Overall, not bad in terms of meat. Crab claws, may be over-hyped and over-priced. At least i tried it once. Would like to try their rib-eye maybe if I were to return.",3,2,2

If you do not like scallops, this is the dish to change your mind IMO.

The Crab Bisque is great.  I am usually not a soup bisque person but I would definately have this when I come back.

First all, the best bread basket! Their pretzel bread was so soft and moist inside almost like cheesy bread, and delicious corn bread muffin! 
For appetizer, I got a grilled prawn, it was smokey outside but tender inside and the sauce that came with it was delicious! Better than mustard sauce! I also dipped my bread in this yummy dip.
For entree, I didn't order a stone crab even though it's my favorite shell fish, usually toward the end of the season which is May, stone crabs are no longer fresh and not as good as the beginning of the season, so I ordered chilled crab legs. They were already cracked in the middle, so easy to get the meat out, and it was so sweet and lots of it!

My 9 year old had 3 of their baked potatoes with chives and butter, they are good but then what doesn't taste good with load of butter? 

My older son scored!  his caesar salad was the best to me.  It had the perfect balance of flavors, delicious.  

I was the least lucky one for the night.  I had a TERRIBLE TIME!  All because I started with the half-dozen oysters, which were not what I had expected.  First of all, they tasted bitter! The flavor didn't improve after I dipped them in the sauce it came with.  As a seasoned oyster sampler, I know the good fresh oysters don't need any sauce or dipping, they are good on their own.

Secondly, they were tiny. I'm talking about the actual meat part.  One of them was the size of my thumb nail, no kidding.  

And worse of all, I had a very bad tummy ache right after I ate the oysters.  Ouch, ouch!

At this point I ordered their lobster bisque, thinking it might ease my tummy ache.  But the bisque tasted so weird, it was too salty, and too sweet at same time.  And my tummy ache got worse now, I had to let my son get up so I can lay down.  That didn't help, so I asked for some very hot water. Then another pot, and another.  I was sweating profusely after 3 pots of hot piping water by now, and I was a royal mess regretting ordering that wretched oysters.  But at least I could get up and walk back to our room at the end, thank God, we are not staying at Augustus tower this time, or I have to walk more.

I am thankful to that nice bus boy who brought me hot water. God bless u for ur sweet tender heart.  All this time, our waitress, a well-weathered one, witnessed my pain with such an indifference as if she has seen the world of suffering.  I think she was afraid if she admit i got ill from their oysters we may not pay her.  I know there are people who do that, but not us.  The bill was almost $200 with the wine, nothing was comped even with  my terrible plight.  She was very glad to take the hefty tip from us though.  

I have never had reactions like this to the oysters before, and oysters are my favorite food if u read my profile.  It was just not my night.

Since the rest of my family did have good meal, I am giving them a very generous 3 stars.  I would have rated them higher if the waitress didn't retort me bitterly after I gave her my feedback of the oysters and the lobster bisque each time.  Hey, waitress lady, everyone else may prefer ur tiny bitter taste oyster but I don't, is that a crime?  Also, please don't look aghast when I tell u I didn't care the lobster bisque as if I am not refined enough to appriciate ur ""fine"" dinning.

I had dinner here on Sunday (1\/22\/12).  I made a reservation for 4 PM and was seated promptly.  I was asked by the maitre d' for my choice of watching football or watching people.  When I chose football, he showed me to a high top table in the front of the bar area.  Directly in front of me was a flat screen with the 49ers\/Giants game.  During commercials, I could look out to the patio in the Forum Shoppes and people watch.

Since I chose this early time, the menu given me was the lunch menu.  I was told I could order from the dinner menu if I wanted, but the server didn't go to get a dinner menu.  It was just as well.

I ordered a cup of Stone Crab Bisque, the 12 ounce New York Strip Steak, and an individual portion of saut√©ed garlic spinach as my side.  For dessert, I got a half portion of their Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge.

The soup was quite good.  The cup was just the right size.  The steak was superb!  It was charred on both sides and very rare inside--just as I ordered.  With it, they brought a small container of seasonings--ground salt, dried garlic, and other spices--to add to the steak.  It was great!!  The garlic spinach was also excellent.  Finally, the server told me that they had half-sized portions of dessert.  That's what I got, and it was more than enough to finish the meal.

Two reasons for the 1\/2 star deduction from a full five.  One, since it was lunch, I guess, the bread selection wasn't a selection.  I was brought 2 small rolls, something I could buy in any grocery section.  That was quite disappointing.  Also, I waited about 10 minutes before the server first came to talk to me about ordering.  Since I was in no hurry, and I was watching the game, this was no problem.  Still, someone should have stopped by to assure me my server would be along.  It was busy, but not that busy.",4,1,4

This time I ordered 6 blk medium stone crabs $40 again as an order. We asked for it to be steamed and served warm, & with lemon on the side since it was a little bland but tasted fresh!! They pre cracked it for us prior to serving which I thought was nice. We only had to peel the shells off easily. 

They gave us salt and pepper on the side for the stone crab and complimentary bread when first seated. 
The bread consisted of parmesan bread, salted pretzel bread, and other crispy wonton looking bread. 

Also ordered the 24 oz. Bone-in Ribeye $60 It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I asked for medium well. It was delicious. This serves 2 people so I shared this also with an order of the stone crab and an order of mash potatoes.  3 entr√©es was enough. 

Their Jenny Mash Potatoe's $10 has bits of crispy onion or was it parmesan on top. It was also good. No complains.

With tax was $118 including 18% tip it was about $138 . Not bad for a dinner date. 
My only complaint was the server was on the side talking to her co-worker a couple of times when we needed to get her attention. Also when we asked her opinion for which mash potatoes to order since there is 2 on the menu, she said both of them tasted good. The Lyonnais and the Jenny Mash. Hmm I would expect them to be more helpful. 

Its okay, I would still come back for the great food!

Compared to the Joe's Stone Crab at South Beach in Miami, Florida, this place has a lot more room for improvement.  

The jumbo claws they serve is only as big as the large ones served in the Miami location, and their large stone crab claws may not even pass the medium size test by Miami's standard.

As for sweetness of the crab claw meat, there is no comparison between the two places.  The location in Miami beats this place hands down.

2 star for service.

We went there for a corporation dinner... So our menu is prefixed.
We had sate mushroom and shrimps for appetizers. Salmon, ahi tuna, fillet mignon, and crab cakes for main dishes. They are all great. 
For desert, we had lime cake, chocolate cake and apple pie. To my surprise, even though the pie looks quite homemade but is so tasty and to die for! 
I have has their crabs at their OG Joe's in Miami so... no question, crab is their specialty!

However, our servers were very rude and scolded at everyone when we asked for drinks (diet coke instead of regular coke, tea in stead of coffee, really?!) and when some people wanted to use their same utensils in stead of changing new utensils! The food were dropped in front of you...

So, even the crabs are awesome, I would be afraid to come back to this place... Who needs to be schooled about utensils, eating too much bread before your meals or whatever...

Definitely no where near being Michelin rated, but if you get sick of eating tasting menus at 3 star restaurants, (seriously, try eating a large prix fixe for 3 nights in a row) come try the crab.

P.S. I definitely didn't get the sports bar vibe that one reviewer got. Sure, basketball was on, but only the NIT, and if they reviewed it the same night they ate there, that means I was there the same night, too...

When I was younger you couldn't get me to touch anything but grilled cheese and hotdogs (I was a picky eater as a  kid).  I have had the opportunity to try many great seafood restaurants. One of my favorites by far is Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab. The quality of seafood and the spot on service make for an unforgettable seafood adventure!

One meal from Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab I highly recommend is the Filet Oscar. The Filet Oscar is a Filet Mignon with Alaskan King Crab, Asparagus in a B√©arnaise Sauce. It was so flavorful! The combination of steak and crab topped with the creamy b√©arnaise sauce was savory and delectable. The crab was perfection.

If you go to Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab you MUST try the Stone Crab. All I can say is Holy moly guacamole! The best  crab I have ever had. This dish is a necissity when dining at this restaurant. (Make sure to squeeze a little lemon over it). You will melt over the perfection of Joe's Stone Crab. The claws are huge and you get a huge plate of them. I highly suggest you add this to your order!

Besides the meals I mentioned above, the entire menu at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab is amazing, delicious and unforgettable. Make sure to taste their some of their mouthwatering dishes before leaving Las Vegas!

When we checked in they couldn't find our reservation which scared me thinking our night is ruined already but they still honored our reservation and had us seated within minutes. Troy, our server, told us their special which was intimidating at first but he was very patient and gave us plenty of time. 

We started our dinner with Crab Bisque which was warm and creamy. Then we had the seafood chopped salad it had good amount of shrimp, lobster and the king crab. The dressing was perfect and the greens were fresh and crunchy and with the cherry tomatoes it was so sweet. Hard to describe you just have to try it. For our course my husband had a filet mignon (medium) and I had the stone crabs and our sides were Jennie's mash potato, sweet grilled corn and grilled asparagus. Troy was great and recommended that we get our side as half instead of the full since there's only 2 of us sharing. The steak was soft and mouth watering seems like the meat just melts in your mouth. The stone crab is fresh because you can taste the sweet meat. And their sides so yummy. For our desert we had the key lime pie and the Havana dream pie. We liked the Havana better. It's hard to describe what a wonderful experience we had you just have to try it for yourself. Oh yeah and they gave us complimentary champaign for our anniversary.

Fun, funny, witty, wonderful, charming, and chimerical!  Linda was attentive to our every need. Smart enough to see that we had a great sense of humor (so we had multiple fun exchanges). She bussed the table herself several times to keep things moving, and was very helpful with the menu and food suggestions. When the time came for the check, it came quickly. No pressure. The other wait staff was wonderful too. No fuss. No muss!

So, why only two stars?  First, ""Tim,"" the first person we met, was abrupt from the get go.  We arrived about 15 minutes early, it looked very busy, so I gently asked if there were any chance that we could be seated early. ""Tim"" responded with a curt, ""No,"" said we would be seated as soon as our table was ready, and with a dismissive snort suggested that we were out of our minds to even think about asking.  We walked around for 15 minutes & returned at our reservation time. I alerted Tim we were back, our whole party was there, and we were ready to be seated. He impatiently reiterated that we would be seated at soon as our table was ""ready."" Nonetheless, I heard him get on his radio and ask for a ""small"" table.  Ultimately, Tim spent his time focusing on the larger parties of six and eight, and we fell through the cracks.  15 minutes after our reservation time, I asked when we would be seated, and Tim proceeded to scold me about how reservations ""worked"" in a restaurant and said he was waiting for other people to leave our table before we could be seated. He then again got on his radio and made a new request for a table for two. Bottom line, no actual tables are reserved. A ""reservation"" to them apparently means you still have to wait for a table -- I guess it's just a shorter wait than someone who just walked in off the street. It was much like the Cheese Cake Factory business model, but without the vibrating and flashing pagers handed out so you can walk around The Mall as a distraction from the interminable wait. 

We were eventually seated 20 minutes after our reservation time & 35 minutes after we first walked into the place -- and that was only after I asked to see a manager. 

Second, the place is basically an over-priced (but leas classy version of) Red Lobster.  In a word, the food was mediocre. The calamari appetizer was soggy & doughy. We split the BLT Wedge salad. It was just average. I had the grilled seafood platter. The dish was tough & overcooked & skimpy at the price point charged. Even the bread was just ""so - so"".

My mom's fried oysters were definitely the best thing my party of 5 ordered.  They were delectable!  We all LOVED them.

My hubby really liked his fried chicken.  I found it tasty, but nothing special.  I would skip this dish.

I like meat rare.  My dad ordered his steaks medium-well, so I cannot judge this overcooked piece of meet.  He was happy with it.

My crab cake was tasty, but nothing amazing.  I was coveting the fried oysters.

The key lime pie is a skip it.  It was served almost frozen.  The brownie sundae was also a skip it.  It had a traditional taste to it with a rich brownie, but it was a 3\/5 at best.

Our waitress was nice, but I felt we had to hunt her down.  We went very long stretches without seeing her.  I ordered my son's dessert and paid my bill through someone else because I could not find her.  (-1 star)

It was my aunt's bday and since I'm a ""foodie"" I picked Joe's. After I made my first appearance here on New Years, I hoped this place would meet the same expectations. Unfortunately it didn't.....

Food: 4.25 Stars
Service: 2.5 Stars
Overall: 3.75 Stars

Yes, we started off with 14 ""select"" stone crabs! 14 of them!!!! (120 dollars worth of stone crabs). This was delicious like I remembered.....and that mustardy sauce is so yummy that I could dip anything in it! We also tried the Rockefeller Oyster which I was not that impressed. I didn't taste an oysters what so ever.....

I ordered the Bone In Ribeye this time and I shared it with my dad. I had it cooked Medium. Well, last time I had gotten the filet mignon and let's just say I was a bit disappointed with the steak. It was dry in some parts (basically well done) and it wasn't medium at all. Luckily my dad rather have the steak well done then bloody, so it worked out in his favor. However, I was a really REALLY disappointed about my steak. The Jennie's mashed potatoes made up for it though as well as the garlic Spinach. I didn't get to try the sweet corn, but my aunt thought it was really delicious!

My other foodmates ordered the fried chicken (heard it wasn't as awesome as KFC's chicken, but he is a teenager), sea bass (they said it wasn't fishy at all and it was really fresh), liver (my Aunt enjoyed it), fish and chips (not sure how my brother felt about it, but he ate most of it), shrimp scampi (my other brother ate all of it so it must have been good or he was just hungry) and my lil sister had the cheeseburger kids meal (pretty decent sized). Overall, I think the food was enjoyable, minus my dry steak.

Now the service....I understand that when there are large parties gratuity is added on automatically. Since its a ""nicer"" establishment, you would expect it to have awesome service. Maybe it was just our server because last time we had an awesome server, but at the same time, when we come in and spend 700 plus dollars I think we deserve some good attention. It's not that we were getting HORRIBLE service, we just were neglected. I watched our server attend to other tables (smaller tables) attentively and with us, it just wasn't there. After my dad signed the credit card slip, the server picked up the tab right away. In MY opinion, I think that is a bit rude....why can't they wait the 5 minutes it takes for us to get up and leave and then pick up our tab? Maybe I'm just a cranky woman today, but it doesn't mean I don't love Joe's...I just would ask for a different server. 

Overall, the Havana Dream Pie is to die for and I love their stone crabs. Next time I will stick with the seafood and hopefully my experience will be a better one with the service anyways.",6,0,4

Everyone at our table shared the stone crab and one other dish, but if I were to go back, I would just get the stone crab. It was so delicious! They precrack the claws for you so you peel off the shell like you're peeling a boiled egg, making this one of the most effortless crab eating experiences I have ever had. They cooked the crab perfectly and the meat was sweet and delicious. Add some butter to that and talk about a great meal! The second dish we got was the fishermans platter, I wasn't super impressed with it, especially in comparison to the crab. But my brother and sister shared the stuffed sol with lobster tail and they were raving about it. My dad ordered oysters, and usually he'll share at least one with me because he knows how much I love them, but not this time. He devoured them in seconds! I looked over and they were all gone!!! 

We also ordered some sides, and all of them were great. If I had to choose just one, my absolute favorite would be the mashed potatoes. They come out with a nice crust of cheese crisps and bread crumbs. I could have eaten just that for dinner, it was so good! We also really enjoyed the broccollini, nothing too fancy but cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasoning. 

Our waiter was also really great. He made the dining experience so much better by offering suggestions and being really attentive. Everyone at our table kept on talking about how great he was.

We had six o'clock reservations and we were seated right away. Service was attentive throughout the meal. Frank ordered off the menu, and our friend and I went with the restaurant week menu for $50.13 and we chose the same items: Bowl of Stone Crab Bisque, Chilean Sea Bass with Jennie's Mashed Potatoes and Sauteed Broccolini and Joe's Signature Key Lime Pie.
 
We started with bisque and calamari ($14.95). Both were excellent! The bisque was smooth as silk and the veggies had a nice bite. It'd only be better with more crab. Because everything is better with MORE crab. The calamari was tender and lightly breaded, and the cocktail sauce had a satisfying kick from the horseradish. 

After we gobbled that up, the real feast began. We dug into large crab claws ($59.95), seabass with bok choy, mushroom mac n cheese ($9.95), mashed potatoes and sauteed broccolini. It was all delicious! The claws are always out of this world. I generally prefer a hard sear on fish but this miso glaze was wonderful - a pleasant blend of sweet and salty. 

We were already stuffed, but we still had dessert to come. Frank looked over the menu and chose the Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge ($7.95). That thing was a monster! It was rich, decadent and positively sinful. He could not finish it. We tried to help, but the PB pie won. The key lime pie was light and refreshing. It hit the spot!

I think I can safely say that Joe's is my favorite chain. They do it right! The Restaurant Week menu provided an opportunity to try something other than crab and the fish was indeed was stellar. The RW three courses were offered at considerable savings too. You save about $25, and $5 goes to Three Square for each meal ordered.",5,1,1

I've been to the Miami location and Chicago (is it even there anymore?). SO had never been. 
We ordered Pacific crab claws (completely disappointed that there were no stone crab claws...why do they keep them on the menu when they don't have them?) which were pretty good with the traditional mustard sauce, the 12 oz filet medium rare and the spinach. 

The filet was the winner this night. It was cooked well and the seasoning salt that accompanies it was delicious. 

We really liked the crab claws, they were tasty. We just wished for traditional stone crab as SO had never had them before and they are so hard to come by.

The spinach: frankly, I make better saut√©ed spinach at home. 

I loved that they had Albari√±o and Sancerre by the glass. The wine list was nice and not exorbitantly marked up like everywhere else in Vegas. 

For dessert we had peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. It was standard. 

Joes reminds me a lot of Ruths Chris but add crab and minus some of the more delicious sides like sweet potatoes. 

The service was excellent, as expected.

All in, it was $160 for two of us, splitting the filet, crab, 1 side, 1 glass of wine, a soda and ice cream. Pretty reasonable for Vegas!

Its a great restaurant if you aren't looking for the most favorite meal experience of your life  which you can also find in Las Vegas by just trying out your most favorite chef's restaurants.

Great food and the wonderful dry aged ribeye was to die for. The lack of attention by our server was somewhat of a let done.

He came by to take our order and seemed to be on auto-pilot as he went thru the motions of telling us a liitle about the menu.

He took our order and their were a few specifics that my wife had instructed for her entree. I don't think he passed on the info to the kitchen. He dropped the food and hadn't offered to refill any of our beverages and we had to tell the busboy of any further needs that we encountered.You would think when ordering a $65.00 steak that there would be concern about how everything was prepared.He did not stop by once as he was pre-occupied by a couple right next to our table!! Now I'm not saying that I need to be served on hand and foot but a little concern about our experience would be warrented.

Long story short, we summoned the manager who was very helpful and apoligized for the shortcomings and offered us to make the experience better .

This is it folks! When you're looking for a filet that is so good it speaks to your soul look no further - get it at Joe's. I generally do not order filet mignon because they always seem to lack flavor. Delmonico's is a prime example of an over priced bland filet.

Petite Filet - Awesome! 

Jenny's Potatoes - Not the greatest. I would never order this again. The hashed brown potatoes didn't look any better. They looked like an over-sized overcooked baked potato. 

Grilled Tomato - Phenomenal. Never had anything like this I'm my life. One slice of a grilled tomato covered with cream of spinach and then layered with baked cheese...don't knock it til you try it. 

Two Crab Claws - My awesome waiter threw these in for free to ensure that I at least experienced the famous crab claws. He was honest about stating they were not in season. They were a bit frozen, but still okay. I was glad I didn't order them as my main course. 

Key Lime Pie - The Bomb! The lunch special actually came with banana cream pie...once again my waiter went over and beyond to hook me up.

We ordered martinis which our waitress offered blue cheese stuffed olives or with pimento.  We asked for both.  She brought the martinis with extra olives on the side, the dinner was starting off perfectly.

We began with Stone Crabs, meaty claws served with a tasty mustard sauce.  Just as delicious as I remembered.  

We had inquired about the crab bisque, our waitress suggested splitting it because it is a very rich soup.  I would of never thought of sharing, it was a great suggestion.  And the bisque was to die for!

Next came our entree, we both ordered the grilled seafood platter.  Such a large serving of delectable grilled lobster tail, scallops and prawns. We had steamed asparagus as a side. 

There was so much seafood we could have shared an entree, neither of us could finish our plates.  Such a shame because it was so good!

We had an 8:30 reservation so tables were clearing out as we were dining, so there should of been no need for the rush.  The food quality seemed to decline since our last visit also, the Jeenies Mashed Potatoes were dry, and the asparagus was undercooked.  Although I did have the Bone-in Filet, and it was perfect.  By 8:30 they were sold out of the large claws so we ordered the Selects, and they were extremely tough, my suggestion is if that the large claws are sold out, save your money and order something else.

But the seafood, which I thought was their specialty, was just so so.  The scallops ($24.95) tasted kind of dirty.  And the stone crab ($42.95) was nothing special.  I'm not a big fan of their mushroom sauce, so maybe that has something to do with it.  If I go again, I'm going to try to get some good, old melted butter.

We also tried the vegetable chopped salad ($13.95), which was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but chock full of vegetables and pretty tasty.  The pretzel bread was pretty good, but cold.  :(

Keep in mind, about half the tables are high-top so you may have to sit at one of those.  Also, they could use some dual service technique or something.  We did have a guy come down and randomly wipe down our table at odd intervals, but he didn't seem interested in helping with anything else.  So our only waitress was occupied and we had to wait longer than we wanted to order dessert and get the check.

My only regret:  Not coming here sooner!  (I've lived in Vegas for over ten years!)

One order of the large stone crab to start was shared between my family and myself.  Throw away anything you knew about delicious crab.   This was the absolute most delectable, satisfying, piece of crab to have graced its way onto my tongue.  Paired with the mustard sauce, a.k.a. crack sauce, and you'll experience a high unlike any other and you'll probably wonder why Nevada even needed to legalize marijuana when this is so much better.

Next let's talk about that chilean sea bass.   What the hell?  Did this come from the sea or from the heavens above?!    It was so good.   I ordered this based on other Yelper's reviews and just ""wow"".   Topped with a miso glaze, the subtle sweetness is like a protective coating for the delicate fish as it discovers safe passage through your mouth, down your esophagus and into your stomach.  Perfect fish dish.  Truly on point.  10\/10 will order again and again.

Now.  About that 24oz bone-in ribeye.   My body just almost shut down thinking about it's greatness.  It's almost as if I am not worthy to eat it.   Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned; it was the most juiciest steak I've ever eaten in a very, very long time.  In fact, I recommended Joe's to a friend and well-seasoned traveler\/foodie from Europe last week and he messaged me almost immediately raving about how amazing his steak was.   It was out of this world good.  I'm almost convinced that this was the best steak I've eaten in my life.

I'm licking my lips and painfully strategizing my next 'special occasion' to find a way back to this restaurant.  It's pricey yes, but worth every damn penny.   The service was spot on despite how busy the restaurant became.  The food; truly 5 stars. It's as good as it gets.",6,4,1

We wee staying next door at the Bellagio, so we figured we would give Joe's a try because we we all seafood lovers. 

We started with a half dozen of raw oysters and stone crab claws. The oysters were juicy and delicious to the point I didn't want anything except a dab of the vinegar ice to go along with them. We had an assortment of oysters, and I particularly liked the Stellar Bay and Naked Cowboy. 

Our stone crab claws were also delicious. The shell was peeled away much like a hard boiled egg, leaving the juicy meat exposed for us to devour, which our group did pretty efficiently. 

Appetizers consumed along with a half bottle of wine, we moved onto dinner. I had my sights set on the grouper, but our waiter made a gentle nudge to the Chilean Sea Bass, telling us it was flown in that morning. It was a great suggestion and I'm happy he recommended it, because it was outstanding.  It came by itself, but we ordered a variety of sides to go along with it, and it was plenty filling and perfectly prepared. 

One person at the table ordered the scallops, and I have to admit I had a little bit of food envy. I sweet talked her into giving me a bite and almost took her plate. I was secretly hoping she ate too much bread and wouldn't be able to finish her dinner, but she did.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab really is just a tourist trap with a few great options and a lot of okay items you are privileged to pay Strip pricing for...

If you do find yourself here just ignore the inflated prices and stick to what they're know for: Stone Crab Claws, King Crab Legs, Crab Bisque, Filet Mignon...even Scallops with Pork Belly.

I've been here three times over the years and every time I've tried to explore the menu a bit and share some items with the table. I keep coming back because what the do well, they really do well. But in the end I just think that you can get a better meal at a much better price. It's not that Joe's breaks the bank...just that most of the menu is 10-20% overpriced. I have no problem with spending a little more than the actual quality of the product calls for, but if I do, I want it to be really great food or good food in an incredible setting...Joe's doesn't do either of these well enough that I see myself continuing to come back.

This place was OK. I had a big breakfast at Bouchon so I couldn't order the prix fixe stone crab lunch as I had hoped (which is $27.95, not $21 as listed elsewhere). I didn't want to leave without having some kind of seafood and pie though, so on my server's rec, I got the seafood salad. It was a pretty huge undertaking; well worth the $16 - a giant lump of shrimp\/crab\/lobster on top of a huge chopped salad. I had asked my server what was in it and she only remembered lettuce as being one of the vegs. It turned to be two hardboiled eggs, lettuce, avocado, palm hearts, asparagus -- all nice surprises, though I imagine I'd have a fit if I had a food allergy and wasn't told about any of it. I couldn't finish it, but I did want to save room for pie. As I was struggling to breathe, my server suggested I might try a half slice of pie instead, which was a brilliant idea on their part, and dumb on mine: $3 for a sliver. But that was OK, since it was key lime and possibly the best key lime I'd had in my life. Nice, firm and tart, though the crust on the bottom was a tad hard.

Start your meal with their stone crab claws. They're the best. Melt in your mouth, butter texture with great flavor. The sauce they serve it with is also excellent.

Now entrees. Chilean Sea Bass with a miso glaze. SO GOOD. Cooked perfectly to the point where the sauce caramelizes on the fish. Fish texture is great as well.

Dry aged bone-in rib-eye. Pretty bomb piece of steak. I'd say it is my second favorite next to Nick and Stef's. Comes with a dry seasoning composed of salt, pepper, garlic, and corriander. 

Filet Mignon. I'd stay away from this one. Wasn't that great in my opinion.

I ordered the lunch special which came with five medium stone crabs, hash brown potatoes, coleslaw, and a slice of key lime pie.  It was a lot of food for $35 and a very good value considering Joe's prices.  The stone crabs were very fresh and tasty with the famous mustard sauce.  I liked the tangy wet cole slaw with slices of tomato.  The hash brown potatoes had a crunchy, deep fried crust and was a very generous serving.  I hardly put a dent in it.  The key lime pie was enjoyable even though I was so full.  Joseph, a fellow SoCal native, was the server and he was so nice, friendly, and engaging.  He was very attentive and personable.

It was great. To be honest, I'm not sure if I've ever had bad crab. We got the jumbo 3 piece to share, which was a good option to taste without fully committing your entree to seafood.

I saw an episode of Man Vs Food and put it on list of things to try if I was ever in Miami. Just think how excited I was when I learned that this restaurant was started by the owners of the Miami restaurant.

Back to the claws, one word - AMAZING -. Being Filipino, I have been exposed to some awesome seafood. The combination of salt water and sweet crab meat was incredible. Each of us has two claws each. I could have had more, but the meal had just started.

For my entree, I ordered the bone in Rib Eye ""Oscar Style"". Oscar style is when you add crab meat, steamed asparagus, and hollandaise sauce on top of your meal. The steak was cooked to order (Medium Rare) and the ""Oscar Style"" topped off the meal excellently.

My wife and I went for lunch around noon and the restaurant was about half full.  We ordered our drinks\/meals and everything was fine at that point.  That is when the trouble started.

First off, any Joe's veteran knows about the crack-crack-crack method for easily eatable crab when done correctly.  However, my order of stone crabs appeared to be just CRUSHED with a sledgehammer.  I spent almost my entire time removing teeny tiny bits of shell from each bite I took.  It was terrible.  Secondly, about the time our food arrived, the restaurant was completely filled.  Not sure if they understaffed on purpose or not, but that was the result.  Drinks went unfilled, napkins could not be obtained, and the check took forever.

Having been to Joe's enough to know the potential, this was a severely dissatisfying experience.  As a general rule, when I am paying a premium (and at Joe's, you WILL pay a premium) for my seafood, I expect a quality meal that simply put, was not delivered for many reasons.

I try to make a stop at Joe's during every Vegas trip, big winning or no.  Often times it's my last stop out of town.

A plate of Stone Crab here, naturally, is a wonderful thing.  I like to start of with 6 of the Select ones.  They come with a dijon mustard sauce, which is great, but drawn butter is available.  

I like to follow up the crab with a steak, usually a filet, medium rare.  While I recommend going during lunch for a guaranteed, immediate seat, I don't recommend the petite steaks served as lunch specials; get one of the thick, real cuts from the dinner menu.  I once shared an amazing porterhouse done black & blue style (blackened and pepper crusted on the outside, so rare almost blue on the inside). 

Crab and steak, that's enough to make me happy, but it's easy to get distracted by the sides here.  They're a la carte, and they can be addictively delicious, like the grilled tomatoes topped with spinach and cheese and the baked mashed potatoes.    

There's a variety of wine-by-the-glass available.  On my last visit, I had an excellent glass of Frog's Leap Merlot, which was soon followed by another.

Both the table and bar staff are attentive, extremely knowledgeable, and dressed impeccably.

There are at least 3 dining areas here -- ""outside"" in the mall, by the bar, and inside in the back.  But for lunch of solo dining, the bar is an excellent option.

In short ""food delicious, service not so much.""

I would have to agree when I was forced to pull out my trusty ""eyebrow raise\/foot tap"" to call one of the hosts over to the front desk.  If am I preparing to spend over $100 on a meal for two lets at least get the front lines ready with a ""hello and how many?""

We sat in the bar at a high top table and were given with a small varietal bread basket to nosh on. We ordered two medium rib eyes, which came out perfectly cooked, and small side order of green beans.  The steaks had a delicious crusty exterior but were a bit salty in my opinion, as were the beans.  Instead of giving a side sauce they included a small ramekin of ""steak seasoning"" which I believe was just extra kosher salt mixed with dried shallot, oregano etc...unnecessary.

Was it good? Yes.
Will I be back? Probably not.

The staff at Joe's moved quickly. Before I knew it, there were five servers around us, mopping and cleaning off the table and bringing us towels to wipe off. My mother has a sense of humor and what's a bit of soda? No biggie. We just wanted to finish our meal. Our server was apologetic and there wasn't really a need. Accidents happen. Then the GM came out and offered us a personal apology, then came the chef. Incredible! They offered a complimentary dessert which wasn't necessary but appreciated.

The filet was incredible husband got a 12 oz so we split with my platter the steak seasoning they bring you is good pile that stuff on! It definitely adds a spice to the steak in a good way! It was so tender and easy to cut into! Definitely would have gotten the filet next time.

Their mac and cheese is just divine something about the taste of the difference cheeses they gave was delicious we literally cleaned the plate on those.

I got Joe's ""famous"" scallops, though what they're famous for I'm not sure. Don't get me wrong, they were pretty good, but really nothing special. Just scallops. Literally-- just. scallops. My mom enjoyed her stonecrab, but the steaks my dad and boyfriend ordered were both WAY undercooked. They ordered medium rare, and got steaks that were pretty much bleeding. 

None of the entrees come with side dishes, so you order those and share. We found them all to be just okay.

Very elegant, yet laid back and light atmosphere. The service was top notch. And they did a great job of explaining the menu and really made us feel comfortable. Drinks were excellent. My husband had an old fashioned and I had a dirty martini and they were both very good. The stone crab is a must try! The mustard sauce it comes with is to die for. We had this as an appetizer to share but it could also be an entree for one. My husband had the filet and lobster tail as an entree and it was outstanding. We're from Nebraska so we're pretty snobby when it comes to beef, and the filet did not disappoint! I had the Chilean sea bass and it was out of this world. One of the best meals I've had. We shared a side dish of roasted cauliflower that was quite delicious as well. They also gave us a free birthday dessert of a brownie a la mode. Only took one bite as I was extremely full, but it was very good. If you're in Vegas and want an elegant delicious meal this is definitely the place! And I have to say the pricing wasn't terrible. It's obviously more pricey than some places but for what you get it was definitely well worth it! I can't recommend Joe's enough!",1,0,0

The first thing I can tell you is that the quality of their stone crabs seem to be deteriorating. On the last visit, we had the choice of picking either the large, select, or medium sized claws. This time, we had the choice of either the 7-pc medium sized claws or this other crab with a fancy name (I forget). I asked the waitress and they said it's pretty much dungeness crab.

If you're familiar with stone crabs, you know that these little suckers are hard to come by, hence the extravagant prices. It takes a while for these crabs to grow just one ""big"" claw, and when they're fully grown, they're immediately harvested, chopped off, and thrown back into the waters. Imagine if you're one of these stone crabs... it must be excruciating. It's like that alien pawn shop dude (who plays Monk) in Men in Black who keeps getting his head blown off throughout the movie. It hurts like a mother, but at least it regenerates, surely albeit slowly.

Anyway, the quality of the stone crab claw didn't seem up to par compared to the last visit. It didn't seem as sweet, as succulent, as tender, as worth the $36 or so for 7 pieces. The mustard-based dipping sauce is a must, and super tasty as usual. Obviously these are defrosted from being previously frozen, but it still had that lingering effect of just recently being thawed out.

My usual bone-in ribeye was excellent, cooked to a perfect medium. Juicy, full of flavor, I licked every inch of the leftover bone. The stuffed mushrooms we had for apps was very good, along with the roasted corn for sides. As a sure sign of fate, they even offered a glass of sparkling wine from Domaine Carneros, where my wife and I went on our first date up in Napa\/Sonoma Valley about 9 years ago. 

We finished off with a complimentary dessert with chocolate and ice cream, but I couldn't leave without eating of slice of their key lime pie. The waitress was a bit shocked that we (err, I) had the room for another dessert. But it was well worth the extra few hours of cardio in the gym. Rich, buttery, and tart, the key lime pie was a nice ending to another fantastic meal at Joe's.",5,4,4

It just feels genuinely nice to walk in and chat it up with the maitre de who creates the experience right off the bat and the rest follow up to knock it out of the park. I guess we frequent here enough over the years for them to recognize us and our waitress who remembers waiting on us many times even thought we were locals. That still is such a rare find nowadays.

Once again I couldn't stray and I ended up getting the grilled seafood platter. For me killing scallops, lobster, and shrimp in one reasonably priced meal sends my wallet into financial euphoria. Above that though everything is always so fresh and cooked to magnificent texture. I always wish though I had just enough room for the banana cream pie with banana foster sauce..OMG!

On my last trip out I went here. I had such high hopes for this place but found it to be lacking in every single area. The seafood was sub par at best, I found that I have had much better crab out east. The service was average, I think our waiter filled up our water glass twice and was much busier with his other tables.

I dined here with my Mother and Wife and they felt the same way. They spent some money on the place because the decor was nice. This is a major tourist trap though. They need to do a better job with the food!

My husband started with the Crab Bisque and it was the best Crab Bisque we have ever had.  There were beautiful chunks of crab nestled at the bottom of the bowl as our waiter poured the rich and decadent soup over it.  I started with a half dozen of Oysters on the had shell and it tasted fresh and perfectly briny with a clean finish.  
We also shared the Chopped Salad. It's not your average chopped salad- it is packed full of a variety of fresh veggies and topped with a delicious vinaigrette.  I could have eaten these starters alone and be happy with my meal.  

But, then the jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs came to the table.  It was beautiful. It was a bit pricey at $79 but my husband and I were practically moaning after every sweet bite.  And it was huge and so much crab meat. So. Much. I don't think every strip  buffet's crab legs combined can even match the amount that was in the crab we were served.  It was first presented on a beautiful platter and then perfectly cracked open by our server, leaving us perfect thick sweet whole portions of crab meat.  Dip it in some warm clarified butter and you will be speechless.  Speech. Less. 

We also ordered the last order of the ""Select"" Stone Crabs.  Just because it is in its name, doesn't necessarily mean they will have stone crabs available.  I guess this year's catch has been historically low so we were lucky to get the last batch.  There are also Medium and Large Stone Crabs offered.  The ""Select: is the size in between.  These are my husband's favorite. Personally, I thought they were OK.  It has a much more mild flavor.  I'll take the Alaskan King Crab over them any day. 

We then finished our meal with the famous Key Lime Pie.  Key Lime Pie is usually the last thing I would consider when I have other pies to choose from, but since this is something they are known for- we had to try it.  And I am so glad we did- it was delicious! It is so popular that you can find the recipe on line- or better yet you can order it from the original Miami, FL location and have it shipped to right to you.  

We were extremely happy with our meal from start to finish.  The service was attentive and friendly.  Although the waiters are formally dressed in their black and whites, it is such a comfortable atmosphere while still classy.  Now excuse me, as I reminisce about those decadently delicious crab legs and save my pennies so I can return.  Because it is worth it.  Oh so worth it!

We started with the 5 large stone crabs as an appetizer and were very very good. The mustard dipping sauce that comes with it works very will with the crab, but dont overdue it. Your ordering a $65 appetizer so enjoy the crab, not the sauce. I would have loved to see how big the two colossal stone crabs were that cost $85.

Started out w a great bread basket. We split the veggie chopped salad which was surprisingly good and huge. Stone crab bisque was disappointingly ordinary but I really liked that they brought out the bowl with crab and veggies, then added the bisque tableside. Genius way to make sure everybody gets the same amount of crab. 

We shared the steak sandwich - unexpectedly 3 little sliders vs 1 regular sandwich. Thick slices of tender medium rare steak. Maybe not worth $17 but it was damn good. We also shared the 8oz filet with sides - super fresh tasting charred sweet corn, sauteed broccolini and mac & cheese. Perfect char and seasoning on the steak but sides were just average, I wouldn't say any were really worth the calories or $

We had the stone crab claws, two kinds of oysters, the grilled seafood platter and a petite filet mignon.  The best oysters ever.  The prawns (waiter said it was from Madagascar) was the best ever.

I brought relatives from out of town here& even celebrated my bday back in March. Boy was I wrong.... Woowww! So on Christmas my sister, cousin, a family friend & I decided to come in for an early dinner. Long story short...Strike 1.) I asked our female server(forgot the young ladies name) how her Christmas was going & she said terrible because she had to be at work. Strike 2.) my sister tried to ask our server for something simple as hot tea & she walked away
Strike3.) a whole new waitress came over & said she would be taking over. We asked why & she responded our previous waitress said we didn't like her. Like whoah! We would never say anything like that or treat anyone like that especially on Christmas. 
Strike 4.) our new waitress brought up us going to a strip which I thought was totally inappropriate specially with an elder sitting at our table
We tipped good even though I felt this visit was bizarre & uncomfortable. At least our food was good, Merry Christmas to us






I went back and Bridgett was our fabulous waitress. They took care of me and my friends really well. Thanks to the management he was great.






The food is soooo good I've come a few times. My last visit wasn't so great. The waitress wasn't so friendly and did not work with me well. I asked to substitute one minor item (scallops) for maybe another piece of shrimp. She acted as if they never given substitutes or have heard of such a thing. I just changed my order to something else because I didn't want to bother anymore. It was just a friend and I for lunch. We gave her a great tip even though she was unfriendly and not very accommodating. Luckily our food was wonderful or I would've been one unhappy camper. Great food and nice place...

We had actually planned to go to a crawfish place for dinner, but I really wanted to try something else for once...since we always go to the crawfish place when we come to Vegas.

My first impression when walking toward this restaurant was....wow....this place looks really expensive, so it better be good! Located in the Forum Shopping mall at Caesar's, the restaurant looks like a long and well established classic American bar and restaurant. We were greeted at the entrance by a host who seated us right away....likely because we showed up early at around 5.30pm....but even then, the place was very busy. We were led to our table where we were introduced to our waiter ITodd) who took very good care of us. Both the host and Todd were extremely polite and nice, courteous, and professional, and made us feel like the most important guests at the restaurant.....real class.

In less than a minute, a fresh basket of yummy bread was placed on our table....and it looked gooooood! ....and after tasting it....wow, delicious. Todd then came over and showed us the menu with the featured specials, which all sounded absolutely amazing.  Everything on main menu looked absolutely delicious, but we couldn't order everything that looked good as we would not have been able to finish it all.....so we were very selective. As an appetizer we ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms.... and OMG,...they were absolutely delicious! I can quite confidently say without a doubt that these were the best I have ever tasted! Next, how could we have come to Joe's without trying their 5-piece signature Stone Crabs Claws. Also absolutely delicious....and together with their special dipping sauce.....absolutely fantastic! $65 for 5 claws.....well, it better have been good! Already cracked, Todd was good enough to instruct us how they are supposed to be peeled and eaten....and afterwards, brought us some lemon to squeeze on our hands and wet towels to clean our hands of the fishy crab smell. And it actually worked!

For our entrees, we ordered their featured special grilled Dover Sole, which was de-boned at table side. Simply squeezed lemon on top and you have one absolutely delicious fish meal. For myself, I ordered the Roasted Black Cod as this is one of my favorite types of fish. It was cooked and served in a mild tomato broth with olives and herb oil. The cod was so fresh and perfectly cooked.....and the broth was mild enough as to no way overpower the fish.....every part of this dish complimented each other.....I absolutely loved it.....I thought the portion was a bit small, so thank goodness my friends and I shared everything. For sides, we ordered the Sauteed Broccolini and highly recommended Roasted Swee Corn. Both were also perfectly cooked and delicious. The serving of corn was good, but I think there should have been a bit more Broccolini in the dish.

All this together with a bottle of wine......wow.....life is good....and this restaurant qualifies as being one of the best restaurants I have ever tried! The service was excellent and attentive, and I will say that it was worth every dollar we spent on this dinner. I will definitely be back when I'm next in town. Oh, we were brought the wrong check, but it's a good thing we normally check everything before paying.

My other friend mentioned this restaurant is known for their stone crab claws. I've never had stone crab claws in my life, so I was quite interested to see what it was all about. It is already cracked by the server, so you don't have to do any work besides dipping it in butter or mustard sauce or your own concoction of lemon juice with salt and pepper. I really liked the mustard sauce, but my friends weren't fans. The stone crab claws come in 3 sizes: small, medium, and large. It is best to order the large claws so that you get more meat. We also ordered the Alaskan king crab legs here, and they are super YUMMY!!! I actually preferred that over the stone crab claws to be honest. It is so meaty and so delicious! Ah, I actually want some as I'm typing this! I tried the stone crab claw bisque which was too creamy for my taste. We also ordered the oysters which were pretty fresh as well.

We made reservations for 5 since the only other time was at 9.  It ended up working out well because we had a nice relaxing long dinner before returning back to our hotel for a nap and getting ready for the evening.

Decor: 4.5\/5  Clean, beautiful dark wood paneled walls.  We sat in the back circular room, the seats and tables were arranged a little strangely in that I noticed later the seats weren't evenly distributed (minor) but not in a logical way.  The seats were up against other seats from adjacent tables.  Poor planning and made getting in and out difficult.

Service:  5\/5 Service here was fantastic.  The waiters (I didn't see any waitresses) were all in Tuxes and very professional but more importantly friendly.  Plates and dishes were cleared promptly and the waiter chatted and joked with us.  Amusingly enough, we stopped a bus boy (who was also dressed in a tux) if he could bring us a Jus -- he either misheard or didn't know what it was, but he did his best and we were brought some other sauce.  (Some white gravy stuff that turned out to be pretty tasty)

Surf: 4\/5 I didn't try the oysters but the table seemed to enjoy them.  The stone crab pretty much just tasted like crab to me.  The mustard sauce didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  I was underwhelmed by the crab but it was neat trying them.  I wouldn't feel the need to order that again.

Turf: 4\/5 the meat was good.  4 of us ordered the Petite Filet Mignon -- strangely I think only one of us finished it.  I guess we got filled up with the delicious bread (5\/5!).  The meat itself wasn't bad but not amazing.  I think it was worth the money but sadly not memorable.  The fresh horseradish was not very spicy, their special mix of spices\/seasoning was tasty (but very salty)

Side Dishes: 3\/5 we tried a few of their dishes.  Ranked from least favorite to favorite.  1) The creamed spinach could have been entirely skipped.  It was flavorless.  2) The Mac n Cheese was ok, they used spiral noodles.  If you're in the mood for Mac N Cheese you'd probably be satisfied, but it also wasn't memorable.  Then again I think I've started expecting bacon and maybe gouda in my Mac N Cheese now... 3.  Jennie's Mashed Potatoes.  The crusty crumbly bits on top were yummy and the melted cheese inside was great.  It was strangely dry though.  My idea mashed potatoes have chunks of firm potato and then soft creamy potatoes in it... this was just a little dry but great flavor.  Worth ordering  4) The sweet corn was surprisingly great!  I usually like corn plain, but this was really delicious.  I think we were all surprised with how good this was -- that was the only side plate that was entirely finished.

Dessert 5\/5: We ordered the Key Lime Pie.  All their desserts are made fresh daily and since this is originally a Florida restaurant -- we decided on the Key Lime Pie.  It was thankfully not green and was very light and at least for me, the best Key Lime Pie I've ever had.  I finished most of the pie even though I couldn't even finish my steak (and lemme tell ya what a steak person I am!).  The coffee was also excellent according to my friends, but I think starbucks is good so I wouldn't know.  Sorry!

Overall, it was a great meal.  If I went back to Vegas I'd probably want to try a different restaurant but I certainly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been there.  The meal ended up being a final cost of  $78\/person (that includes a $40 bottle wine). 

I'd recommend coming here with at least 4 people (we had 6) since the side dishes family style.  Apparently, you can get Joe's delivered to your house.",0,0,0

Based on recommendations on Yelp, we ordered the banana cream pie which was the most tantalizing combination of perfectly ripe bananas, cream, warm caramel sauce. The coffee is also something exceptional!  After you're finished eating, they bring you warm towels to wipe your hands with fresh lemons over the washcloths. It's the perfect duo of a fresh, real washcloth wipe with the natural lemon scent!  Many thanks to our server Steve G. for an overall 5+ star experience!",0,0,0

Yesterday I decided my treat was to get some crabs.

Ok, Ok, get your mind out of the gutter, even if I am in ""Sin City""  you know that is not where I am going with this. 

Joe's has a dark wood interior with a large patio and all the servers in their crisp black and whites, I felt a little underdressed in my no-makeup-tennis-shoe look.  This was not to stop me, however from getting my crabs.

For those that don't know, stone crab is only really in season for three months and usually comes from the Gulf in Florida.  It's a rare treat, these little claws of perfection, so you have to get them while the getting is good. 

I sat down and the server immediately came over. She was pleasant and helped me find an excellent medium bodied glass of white wine to complement my seafood. Throughout my whole meal she was attentive, polite, and personable.   

I chose an appetizer for my lunch, but this was no mere starter - this was the ""2nd Mortgage"".  A stone crab claw, a jumbo shrimp, a small lobster tail and a small portion of shrimp\/scallop cerviche, all chilled with cocktail and mustard sauces for dipping.  This was a dish to relish so I took my time. All the seafood was cooked and chilled to perfection with that just caught fresh taste. I really wish I had just gotten a plate of the stone crab because that one claw was so good I am already having major cravings for more.

All in all a perfect dining experience - a girl has to treat herself and to borrow from a certain ad campanign - ""I'm worth it",5,5,4

STOP! Beware the next comment may cause the reader to salivate

is exactly how I felt as I bit into my absolutely sinfully delectable and succulent Chilean Sea Bass with Miso ...(*mouth starts salivating).. glaze.. 

It's white mass was cooked to perfection. Presented center stage next to a neatly dressed soy-teriyaki bok choy reduction on a decadent flawless white serving plate, it is visually stunning.  The Miso glaze crust was flaky and crispy (almost lightly fried), but as you bit into the actual sea creature's flesh it starts to part into two as your teeth bite into it. The steamy, juicy flesh meat rushes to your taste buds and you totally fall in love it. It is soft, the texture akin'd to a firmer softened butter with a clean taste absent of any overpowering fishiness inexperienced restaurants suffer from. Oh no, this fish was absolutely PERFECT! This experience, which I've only had once, was only at this Joe's Seafood Restaurant!

If I had a final meal on this planet, It'd be the entire menu at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab Restaurant! Bar none!

You cannot go wrong with anything you order here, but DO NOT FORGET TO TRY THE SEABASS if you're a fish eater!

As expected for a restaurant of such reputation, the decor and staff is without a doubt FLAWLESS! Expect to tip the Matrie D' to take you seriously and receive a seat... otherwise wait for an obscene amount of time watching other people eat. They only take reservations for 8 or more.

PROS: EVERYTHING

CONS: Becareful, as this place is very expensive. The Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze will go for $38.95 a'la carte!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!",6,6,5

after getting a little lost walking around the forum shops at caesar's (30 mins late to our reservation)... we were ready to try these famous stone crabs from miami. i don't like eating seafood as the main course because it's very light and from my reviews... you should know that i like to feel heavy and full after i eat. so... i couldn't resist the bone-in-ribeye (surprise...  surprise). this was the third time i've eating the ribeye in the past 2 weeks (i'm seeing the doctor next week... might as well hear bad news since i'm expecting it). since i had mastro's (see my review) last week... i had it fresh in my mind and could say that this steak was not quite at its level. but overall it was a very good steak. 

my wife had the large stone crab (5 claws). of course i snagged a couple of them. very good i must say but was a little disappointed with the size. you only get the claws... that's it. i wanted the whole freakin thing. 

for our sides we got jennie's special potatoes and sweet corn. the jennie's special potatoes were twice baked mashed potatoes with garlic, parmesan cheese and asiago cheese. i loved the creaminess of the potatoes and then the crunch of the parmesan and asiago... definitely one of the highlights. the sweet corn was good but regretted not getting the creamed corn.

The steaks; I ordered a petite filet and my wife ordered the bone in filet... both were cooked perfectly (medium rare). Quality cuts of beef! Not sure if they season the beef because they offered us a side of seasoning with our steaks. The seasoning was good, but I wish my filet was already seasoned with this stuff so it wouldn't need it.

The reason why I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because that I wish our server had a little more personality.

My wife wasn't really done with her entree and he was ready to clear the table. The whole staff was very efficient and doing their assigned jobs though.

The waitress was cheery and recommended a seafood appetizer sampler that contained oysters, King Crab legs, and Rock Crab legs. The oysters were very tiny, but the King Crab legs were absolutely delicious!

For the main courses, most of us tried the waitress-recommended Bone-in Rib Eye. Comparing it to the steaks we had at Mesa Grill (Caesar's Palace) and Bouchon (Venetian), this was our absolute favorite steak of the week-long trip! Bouchon, by the way, isn't recommended by us for steak.

Oh, and six of the stone crab claws, which came pre-cracked and with Joe's mustard sauce which was just a little bit mustardy, and really, really tasty.  Dessert consisted of coconut cream pie and their peanut butter pie.  The peanut butter pie, filled with huge amounts of mousse, tasted like someone had made peanut butter into mousse which ... is as designed.  If you love peanut butter, you'll love the pie.

The steaks were deeply red in the middle -- on the rare side of medium rare, which is how I love them.  They were meaty, and rich, and had clearly been sitting around getting older by the day before they got served -- exactly what I'd want from dry-aged meat.  The food was fantastic.  

But the service ... oh, the service ...

Start with the fact that about 3 hours before dinner we asked to change our reservation from two to three and they cheerfully acceded to our request.  Come to the fact that we were half an hour early and they sat us down when we got there.  

And our waiter, Neil? an on-the-nose balance of friendliness, jocularity, but also leaving us alone when we wanted to talk.  The service was IMPECCABLE.  Neil walked us through the menu, suggested a few things, and more importantly suggested to avoid one or two things.  Nothing I hate more than a waiter who claims everything on the menu is great, and telling me that one or two things aren't great builds a ton of trust.  

They paid close attention to us, but from a respectful distance.  I was drinking iced tea and they noticed what sweetener I used and proactively brought me more.  At some point, when I finished a glass of iced tea, I timed it -- it took them 23 seconds to ask if I wanted another one.

I'd come here again.  Happily.",3,1,0

It's what I would call casual elegance.  And the service was very, very good.  All of the people who attended to our table, were very nice and courteous.  The restaurant was also very, very clean.  Now, I started with a bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder, which is one of my favourites.  And it was one of the best I've ever had.  It tasted so fresh.  It had great flavour and it was loaded with veggies and clams.  Now for my entree, I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon.  It might have been the worst steak I've had in a restaurant of this caliber.  The outside of the steak was completed charred and tough.  And I ordered it Medium Well, which usually means mostly pink, but not red.  However, this steak was very ""well done"".  I wanted to send it back and had I been the one paying for the meal, I would have.  However, I did not want to cause an issue, or embarrass the person paying the check.  So, I just asked for some Sauce Bernaise.  At least that made the steak bearable.  One of the others in my party had a Grilled Seafood Platter, which looked incredible and he said it was.  I'll be getting that the next time I go.  My sister had the Halibut, and it was beautiful and she enjoyed that.  For dessert, I split the Boston Creme Pie with someone else in my party.  It was incredible.  It is so hard to find these days, and I don't know why?!  It's such a great desert.  My sister had the Pumpkin Chiffon, which also was great.  So, if you're going to go here (and I recommend it), stick with the seafood and stay away from the beef.",0,0,0

We booked an early reservation because we had tickets to a Cirque show afterwards, so the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived.  Despite this, they seated our party of 7 at the worst possible table in the room, right outside the noisy kitchen.  That's one of my pet peeves about restaurants, and major points off for that.

But the worst was my steak, which was one of the worst-trimmed steaks I've ever had the misfortune to be served in a restaurant, rife with gristle that I had to spit out more than once, and then take care to trim around.  Their menu says they serve prime steaks, and believe me, this was no prime steak.  For $46 (just for the steak) I deserved a lot better.

They have a great bread basket but points off for the cold rolls in it.

Thankfully, most of the other food was fine and the service was adequate.  They screwed up a couple of the orders but it was a large table, and they corrected everything when we pointed it out to them.

Still, our table dropped $800 for dinner, wine, tax, and tip, and for that kind of money we believe we can do better.  So can you -- look elsewhere.",0,0,0

I called the manager to let them know that me and my boyfriend believed we may have gotten food poisoning from there the other night. We both
felt ill the next day, and was pretty sure it was from the 2nd morgage appetizer. It was delish- don't get me wrong, I even took pics!  

Anyhow, after asking me a few questions, she asked me when was the last time I ate prior, and told her at Red Rock Buffet for breakfast. The manager then asked me ""How much did you two drink by the pool"". We are locals here- and I was highly offended. We live in Summerlin and went there for breakfast, you can't beat a made to order  ommelette  and
 coffee for 5 bucks! So I wrote a note to corporate, and the Las Vegas General Mgr. got in touch with me and stuck up for his manager. Poor customer service, every single person I ran this by also stated this was offensive to them as well. It is a shame, it was our first experience there.

I am referring to our waitress who fell into the trap of thinking we couldn't afford the meal at hand. Her explanation of what would be ideal to order was a bit confusing. I did appreciate the story of the restaurant though.

A pretty nifty bread basket comes out before the meal started. We had decided to share the large stone crabs which was enough for 3-4 bites per person (total 5 people). Soon after, our entrees (I got the bone-in ribeye) came out with the delicious sides. The hands down favorite of the table had to have been the garlic spinach which had roasted pieces of garlic on top. The mac and cheese and the fries were good as well. Beware of the salt condiment that comes out with the steak, if you make the mistake of adding just a bit more than you need, your steak can end up like a salt lick.

I'd probably skip over the stone crabs and try their other thing they are known for (Alaskan king crab) and share my steak along with some sides the next time around. In any case, I enjoyed what I ate.",0,0,0

PROS: I can't speak on the steak because I don't eat red meat but the fish here is some of the best I've ever had. Next, you will never have to ask for your server because the moment you glance away from your table, one is in front of you, eagerly awaiting your request. 

CONS: For dinner, you'll need a reservation to guarantee yourself a table, on any night of the week.

I know that doesn't sound appealing, but if you sprinkled that happiness onto your perfectly cooked filet mignon, you'd want to bathe every inch of yourself with it too. Don't believe me? Try it. You won't complain.

We received a large gift certificate for being frequent diners at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants (see my review of Mon Ami Gabi), so we decided to try Joe's. Since we were starving, and all I could think of was cow and things that crawl on the bottom of the ocean, we dove straight in and ordered entrees...after 2 glasses of wine of course. The red malbec was FANTASTIC and went very well with my cow and sea creatures. My fiance ordered the fisherman's platter, fried, and I ordered the petite filet mignon and jumbo king crab. Our orders were perfection.

Fried seafood is difficult to make and to cook it well enough to maintain the freshness of the seafood and not the dry, overcooked nature of cheap frozen grocery seafood. Joe's doesn't fry their seafood. They lightly dip scallops, shrimp cod and calamari in an airy batter and then after brushing them through an oil bath they place them ever so delicately on your entree plate. They may as well just pop each piece in your mouth because that's what happens when the plate hits the table. This was not fried seafood, this was seafood done right with a blatant disregard for calories. I didn't even have to eat it to know that the look of content on my fiance's face had nothing to do with me.

Now onto the filet. Oh that filet. I love rare cow. If I am at a steakhouse, I will order the steak rare to see if they are truly a steakhouse. Oh yes, my friends, this is a steak house...more like a steak heaven. This petite filet was cooked PERFECTLY. No chewiness here, just soft, tender filet mignon drizzled in the salt mix (please see first paragraph for further loving of the salt mix). Even the waiter was doing a side glance of my cow, knowing that my senses were on overload. The crab? There's a reason they're known for snow crab, but their king crab made me want to do the Snoopy dance in the middle of the restaurant. No butter needed, absolutely no butter needed for this crab...but I did use some anyways because I can never decline butter. The crab was juicy, they cracked the crab for you so you didn't have to cut your hands open doing it yourself, and it melted in my mouth. That dinner was worth every penny we spent and then some. The service, hands down some of the best service I have ever received at a restaurant. Superb.

So while you go and go bananas on some crab legs and filet at Joe's now, I will go to bed and have sweet, sweet dreams of cow and crab. This can only end deliciously.",2,0,0

It's curious but the bar food here is just as outstanding as the dinner menu.  The burgers and appetizers never disappoint while the service here is outstanding.  This place is always packed but it is not difficult to eat here off dinner hours say 5pm or 8pm.

I was caught between the shrimp scampi (I heart scampi) and the parmesan halibut. The waitress suggested the scampi so I ordered that and I also got a small portion of the king crab mac and cheese... as I LOVE king crab and I LOVE mac and cheese. I also ordered a blush wine and I don't know the name of it (I asked the waitress and SHE didn't even know... um... FAIL!!!) but it was delicious so I'll shut up about that. The scampi came, and well, it looked sad. Yes the shrimp was large, but it was overcooked and there was NO taste to the pasta. Seriously??  A restaurant of this caliber with this reputation and the scampi has NO taste?? Unimpressed. Also, the king crab mac and cheese had no taste as well. I'm not a fan of adding salt to ANY dish... but I felt like BOTH dishes needed salt but like I said, I don't like to add salt. There was BARELY any king crab in the dish as well. LAME!!! I was completely disappointed and unimpressed with the food AND the service. My friend wanted to order another drink but our waitress never came around. We should'e went to N9NE at the Palms.... where we originally intended to go, but since she was staying at Caesars and we heard great things about Joe's we came here. BLAND food, MEDIOCRE service = a WASTE OF MONEY. Never again Joe's. NEVER AGAIN.",2,0,0

The place has an old-school atmosphere and a menu full of classic dishes. And, of course, their specialty... stone crabs. We got an order of stone crabs to start. They're cracked before coming to the table, which makes it easy to dig in and eat. There wasn't a ton of meat, but the meat that was there was tender and succulent. Just don't expect it to be as sweet as king crabs or snow crabs.

I dove into the RW menu after that starting with a bowl of stone lobster bisque with plenty of flavor and a slight kick. The tiny bits of celery added a variation in texture that was refreshing. It came in a large bowl that would have been good enough to share. 

The 8oz filet was lightly seasoned, very tender, and slightly undercooked. The quality of the prime beef was evident, but it lacked the finishing touches that would have made it exceptional.

Sides of ""Jennie's mashed potatoes"" and steamed asparagus were brought for the table. The cheesy and chunky potatoes were a nice variation of the classic side and the breadcrumbs on top were an added bonus. The asparagus were standard. Nothing special, but I guess you have to have some green on your plate, right?

For dessert, I went with Joe's signature key lime pie. I love key lime pies in any form, so this one satisfied my craving. It was far from perfect, though. Too tart and a thick and uneven crust... maybe Joe should take hi name off of this dessert. I also tried my wife's dessert -- the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. Pretty good and had me thinking about candy canes a few months too soon.",4,0,1

I started off with the stone crab bisque. It was quite tasty, so I expected everything else to be good as well, but it wasn't.

I had the grilled fisherman's platter. Getting a dish like this tells you alot about the quality of their seafood. There's no sauces, seasonings, or extra flavors to hide behind. Just cooked fish and maybe a little butter and lemon. Well, it wasn't good, the seafood wasn't fresh, and it wasn't properly cooked either.

Onto the roasted chicken. Somehow it was dry and greasy at the same time. I guess I shouldn't have gotten a chicken dish at a seafood restaurant.

Service was pretty excellent, but the food was a letdown. Stick with the stone crabs I guess, and you probably won't be disappointed.",1,1,0

I've never met a stone crab I didn't like...until tonight everything on the menu tasted half-frozen even though we are in stone crab season. Best dish of the night was the crispy brussel sprouts. Now when you're at Joe's this should be considered a problem. Staff was nice enough but i came here to get my seasonal stone crab on, not to discuss why Vegas doesn't sell powerball tickets. Anyhow. I've finally solved the mystery. The reason why this is not up to par with Joe's is this is NOT Joe's. They license the name and use the same vendors.

The Maitre D' is a man of few words, but runs the restaurant very well. We had a nice table for 6 set up on the patio for our 6 PM reservation. The service all around was excellent from our waiter and sommelier to the gentlemen who prepared our king crab legs. 

We started off with classic wedge salads and chowder. We ordered a platter of the large stone crabs as well as Alaskan king crab legs. For our side we went with their hash brown potatoes (Sooo good!!), charred brussel sprouts and cauliflower. Everything we ordered was excellent. 

The stone crabs were so fresh having been flown in that morning. I absolutely loved the mustard dipping sauce as well, perfect pairing. The king crab was also excellent. The large legs are already split, all you need to do is pull out the meat and dip it in that warm drawn butter. Heaven. 

The hash browns were another favorite. So crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. For dessert we had Joe's famous Key lime pie. Probably the best I have had. Perfect balance of sweet and tart and the crust was fantastic.

This place is a very classy place for dinner. 
The staff here is not pretentious, is very friendly, and attentive.
The service is what made my visit here extremely enjoyable (plus the stone crab mmmmmmmmmm)

Everything I ate here during my visit was delicious.
We had some bread.. (ok, I normally don't eat bread so it was actually my partner who ate bread). It kind of disappoints me when some places serve cold bread :(. Well, it wasn't cold, but bread usually tastes better when it's warm in my opinion.

We got the Stone Crab appetizer I think. 7pc of deliciousness!! I wish I had some in front of me right now. I wonder, does the body of a Stone Crab taste good? Where is the body?? It'd be a waste of delicious crab meat if the Stone Crab body IS edible, yet not sold :(

Caesar salad was good. But it's just caesar salad.

My petite filet came out. It was a nice medium rare but for some reason I didn't like the sear on the edges of my steak, I think it was too tough for me or .. something. It was still good though. 

The partner got a nice hunk of meat! NY Strip! Holy moly this piece of meat was THICK!!!!! He looked very satisfied when he devoured it.

2 Sides we ordered were the Broccolini and Mashed Potatoes.
Broccolini will always be delicious.. sauteed in garlic.
The Mashed Potatoes was alright... it was too cheesy for my liking.
If you love potatoes and love cheese, then I think you'll definitely like this side dish.

I should have gotten the hash browns or something. 

For dessert, le partner ordered the Banana Cream Pie because he has this undying love and addiction for bananas. The sauce they put on this dessert is freakin good! Tasted like toffee or something.

I just had a cup of berries, because well, I like berries.

I recommend the mac&cheese and the roasted corn were delicious. 

The BEST dish I had at this place was the Stone Crab bisque. It is by far the BEST crab bisque I have ever had in my life and probably one of the best soups. I definitely recommend just going there for a bowl of soup and some free bread. It's a great and filling snack. 

The atmosphere is boisterous and fun, with a bar in the front room and a nicer eating area in the back. You don't have to dress up for this place, but you can and you won't feel awkward, which makes for a nice balance.

Last dinner in Vegas and it was certainly THE BEST!

Ordered:
x Large Stone Crab Claws - soooo much meat in these things. Everything's already cracked and pretty much ready to eat. Unless you're my date... then you'll need help with getting the meat out in one piece :P The dip it came with was so creamy and delicious. Perfect combination. 
x Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes - THE BEST crab cakes I've ever had in my life. SOOOO much flavor and SOOO much meat. Pretty much ZERO filler. Highly recommend for you crab lovers. This was probably my favorite of the night.
x Chopped Seafood Salad - refreshing with lots and lots of fresh seafood. Generous amounts of each ingredient and was the perfect crunch to all the mush we were eating. 

Tried to order the grilled corn, but was told it was out of season :( Will have to come back to try it in the summer!!

Then, when you think it couldn't get any better, our waiter brought over some steak spices. Just a tiny sprinkle on top of your meat and the flavor explodes!

Try the stone crab, what they're known for
Crab bisque is the best you'll ever find (ask for extra crab meat)

     - Jumbo Lump Crab Cake 10\/10 - Was the best I ever had...it was a real crab cake meaning it wasn't polluted with breadcrumbs and fillers it was FULL of delicious melt in your mouth lump crab. If you love crab\/crab cakes please consider ordering this!

     - Steak - 8\/10 petite filet paired with a lobster tail was yummy no complaints here. the filet had a nice crust and yet was still tender. Good job!

Summary: Will definitely dine here again. They are superior at seafood and good at steak. If you are a surf and turf fan like I am then this is the place for you. If you are purely a steak connoisseur like my fianc√© then you may prefer Craft at the MGM. I enjoy both so this was a great choice.

Food:
Bread basket- great start to the meal since we really liked the bread basket.  We liked the parmesan crisps\/sheets, and ended up asking for more.

Stellar Bay oysters- SO Good!  Another reason to visit Vancouver sometime soon.  Perfectly briny and extremely fresh, I could've had a dozen by myself, easily.

Dry aged bone-in rib eye- we asked for medium rare, and it was a little more cooked than we would've liked, but man, was it good.  Tender and juicy, we enjoyed it to our last bite.

Jenni's mashed potates- Can't go wrong with mashed potatoes. Yum.

The star of the meal, stone crabs- Delicious!  Succulent, meaty, and sweet!  Really liked the dipping sauce too.  We ordered the large, and it was 5 big claws for $65.  Pricey?  Yes, but you don't eat stone crabs everyday.

Service:  Very good, no complaints

D√©cor:  steakhouse d√©cor, we sat outside and it was very nice.

I tried Joe's Stone Crab in Miami, Florida and it was probably one of my most memorable restaurant experiences.  This is their sister restaurant.  AND NOW I HAVE ONE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE US! Ok, it's not quite in LA...but it's doable.  It's slightly hard to find if you're starting from the Caesar's casino, but it's worth the long walk.  Made a reservation for lunch with my family at 11:30am (their opening time) and was seated very promptly.  

Service was amazing and the waiter was helpful and hilarious.  The staff really seemed like they were all very well trained and enjoyed working there and it created an awesome atmosphere for us to enjoy.  And the food came out QUICK! I love and appreciate fast service because ain't nobody got time to be hangry.

Now on to the food:
BREAD: You get an assortment of bread.  Our basket included a variety of about five different types including a traditional dinner roll, onion roll, pretzel bread, and bacon & ciabatta.  Load up on the carbs (:

HOT CHOCOLATE: It was so delicious.  None of that watered down hot chocolate nonsense found here.  Really satisfied my craving for hot chocolate and their whip cream is freshly home-whipped.  YUM!

CRAB BISQUE: The size difference jumps a lot from cup to bowl.  I love their presentation.  You're first served with a bowl with crab bits and stuff in the middle and then the server pours the bisque all over it.  I don't know if they do that for the cups, but it is a nice touch. Flavor is nothing short of what I expected.

MEDIUM STONE CRAB: Our waiter recommended us to get two orders of this (vs. a jumbo order with less claws) for our party of seven so we each could get two claws.  You still have to take off the shell of the crab, but they pre-crack it for you so it's almost like peeling a boiled egg shell.  A MUST ORDER while eating here.

JUMBO ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS: Ugh this was amazing! Another MUST ORDER!! The meat was easy to slide out and it had a sweet scrumptious taste to it. Dip that into the mustard or butter sauce and it's pretty mindblowing. Too good!!

COLOSSAL LUMP CRAB CAKE:  This was the only dish that we ordered that I could have lived without.  It was good, but I just felt like it was a tad bit on the extra fried side to me.

ALASKAN KING CRAB ROLL:  I will totally order this again.  It's a perfect order of seafood, if you don't want to over order or go over budget haha.  They stuff the roll with fresh crab meat and it comes with a side of their homemade chips (which are pretty much perfection).

SEAFOOD CHOPPED SALAD:  This is also perfect if you're feeling full already.  This salad comes with the Alaskan Crab, Lobster, and Shrimp on top of salad with a vinaigrette.  It's so good. Like wow good. Wow.

WILD MUSHROOM MAC & CHEESE:  It is most definitely on the cheesy side and it's freaking delicious.  One side order is worth sharing because it's a lot to finish, but it's worth a try to all the cheese lovers out there.

KEY LIME PIE: THE ONLY key lime pie I've ever liked was at the Joe's in Miami. And they serve it just as good here. It's pretty freaking awesome and you're either an idiot for not ordering it (or you're too full haha). Just kidding that was mean...but it's really yummy!

I can't rave about this place enough. One of my favorite restaurants ever and you have to come and splurge a little bit here.

The servers were overall very attentive and friendly. The food was excellent quality and quantity. Our mea began with The Whale served family style. This was comprised of Alaskan king crab, Lobster tail, Jumbo shrimp cocktail, and shrimp & scallop ceviche. The only awkward aspect was the lack of spoons to serve the cocktail sauce and ceviche onto one's plate. The quality of the seafood was outstanding, though :) The servers also came around with small silver carafes (like a little coffee pot) filled with melted butter to pour into little dishes at your place!

Next came two truly delicious salads. The Caesar salad was to die for delicious. But sadly there was not enough of it to go around our table. We also had a chopped vegetable salad very lightly dressed with a creamy vinaigrette. This salad was so delicious, too! It was mostly chopped veggies like green beans, jicama, carrot, cabbage, etc. The flavors and textures were perfect!

For the entree each guest had a choice of:
Herb Roasted Chicken (did ANYONE actually order this???)
Colossal Lump Crab Cakes (looked A-Mazing!!)
Salmon Au Poivre - orange, fennel & radish
Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon (This was the thickest tuna steak I have ever seen!) - crispy potato cake, spinach, mushroom, & red wine bordelaise.
Chilean Sea Bass - miso glaze, bok choy & shiitake mushrooms.
Petite Filet Mignon- 8 oz.

I had the Chilean Sea Bass and although the bok choy and mushrooms were seriously lacking, the fish (which is the star) was terrific! It was a generously sized portion, not over seasoned, nor over cooked. It was a treat! 

::vegetarian and gluten free options were also available::


Sides served family style were:
Jenny's Mashed Potatoes
Four Cheese Mac & Cheese
(There were three dishes each of these per table of 9, so there was plenty!!)

I skipped the Mac & Cheese due to the heavy dairy, so I can't rate it. The potatoes, however, were delicious. They did have a crumb topping on them, though. Something a person avoiding gluten would never expect. You've been warned ;)

The desserts were really just okay. A tray was brought out with small petite-four sized pieces of Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Fudge Pie, and Havana Dream Pie. I expected to have a dessert that would inhabit my dreams upon tasting the Havana Dream Pie, but it didn't. It lacked interest for me. It seamed like a sponge cake sliced with a pastry cream filling. Ordinary? Maybe I need to try it again to be sure.  The Key Lime was well executed, tart, not too sweet, velvety creamy texture. I did not opt for the chocolate as I did not want to over indulge in the sweets, either ;)


 Overall, I can say the banquet menu and service was excellent. I would happily return for either a private event or a personal dining experience.",0,1,0

We decided to finally try this place and we weren't all that impressed.  We called to make a reservation, but they said they didn't have any openings til after 9.  They also said that we could try and do a walk-in.  So we headed down there and decided to walk-in.  We were seated immediately.  It is a very nice place and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  We were seated near an area where some guests were waiting for their tables and were pretty much standing next to our table.  Our waitress seemed very nice and informative about the menu.  Service of the bread and meal was pretty good.  The downside was that they were very slow at refilling our water.

I had the Bone-In Rib Eye 24 oz. $59.95.  It was something that I wasn't blown away with.  The steak seemed a little tough and didn't have a lot of flavor.  It also had a big chunk of fat on it.  I don't mind some fat on my steak, but this was a pretty big piece.  I would think a place of this quality wouldn't have served something like that.  

My cousin had the Stone Crab and he wasn't impressed with that either.  He felt it was lacking flavor as well.

We also had some mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach.  We weren't fans of this either.

Maybe we caught them on a bad day.  I really doubt we will come back.",3,2,0

Because we stayed at Caesars, I made reservations for two to come here on a Tuesday night at around 8pm for dinner.  Our table was ready right when we arrived.  Once seated, the drinks and yummy complementary bread and butter came out.  All of the breads were so yummy we asked for another.  For dinner, we weren't super hungry so we shared a Crab Bisque ($10), Scallops ($37), and Selected Stone Crabs ($50).  The Crab Bisque was out of this world amazing.  The bowl came empty with just some celery and other ingredients in it.  The actual bisque was poured in our bowl by our friendly waiter.  It was full of flavor and was delicious with our complementary breadds.  It's definitely worth getting and actually cheap for what you get.  I highly recommend it.  The Seared Sea Scallops came out sitting on some sort of potato cake.  These were also amazing.  I think there were about six of them and all of them were seared perfectly.  I would totally order this again.  And lastly their famous Stone Crabs.  I love that it was broken for you so you all you need to do is dunk them in the sauce it came with and eat.  Yum!  The meat was super sweet and super fresh.  So good!

Our total was about $120.  I thought pricing was very reasonable.  Everything on the menu was fresh and delicious.  As for service, our waiter was very friendly.  He made great recommendations.

1st things first. the service was outstanding! Our waiter was intelligent, knowledgeable and friendly. He made some great suggestions and was patient with us.

We had the stone crabs with a seafood salad. The crabs were a pain to eat. I love crab, dungoneous crab! But these had little meat and lots of ""stuff"" inside that was not something you would eat. There was very little flavor and it really needed the yummy mustard sauce the comes with it. Also, they were very c c cold. Almost frozen. In fact, we asked the waiter since they seemed like they needed to thaw a bit. He assured us all was good and that they never freeze the crabs.

Dessert was a flourless chocolate cake with PISTACHIO NUTS and chocolate sauce. Yummy. The nuts made this scrumptious.

Again, he didn't tell me that I'd be charged for that until I saw the bill. Well, you can tell how upset I would be without knowing the details. I guess he could've been more careful and explained to the customers more clearly. I don't mind to pay but I do mind being charged without letting me know first.

So I went through the cheaper route while dining here so I'm pretty sure I didn't get the full experience.  I ordered the filet mignon (6 oz) lunch special at I believe $27 which comes with Joes Grilled Tomato and Jennies Mashed Potatoes.  It also comes with a selection of a slice of pie, which I chose the Havana.  

The steak was cooked very well and they do bring out some steak salt to season to your liking.  Honestly, I would rather have the chef season it his taste so as the seasoning can permeate the meat better but not everyone would feel the same way.  The tomato was topped with their famous creamed spinach and topped with cheddar cheese under a broiler for a few seconds.  The spinach was very rich and I am glad I didn't get a full order of that.  The sampling was just enough for me.  The potatoes were also seasoned with bread crumbs and more cheese.  A very rich meal that relies on comfort food.  

That dessert though.... To sum it up, essentially like a dulce de leche pie made from the heavens.  They make their pies in house and you can definitely tell.  Each bite was so rich yet so good, coffee does wonders with this dessert.  My friend also got the same combo and ordered the key lime pie.  Damn. The dessert chef here knows his\/her stuff.  Be sure to order a slice if you don't get the combo.

Service was very hospitable and welcoming, and the bread baskets will definitely fill you up if you're not careful. They serve about 5 different types of bread for all kinds of different tastes.  Although I didn't get order oysters from here, I was still very satisfied. Next time, I'll come back and try what everyone else raves about and also in their name, the stone crabs. :)",10,6,12

We left fully understanding why they have been in business for over 100 years. It's a simple plan really: Do one thing and do it well. Joe's knows seafood! And in our opinion, Joe's prices are perfectly matched to the quality of the product and the delivery of the service. Dining at Joe's was an experience, not just a meal. And we love when dining out is a complete experience!

Our visit started off on the right foot. We approached the Host stand and were greeted with a smile by a gentlemen in a black tux. I gave him our name and he was expecting us, knew we were from St. Louis and knew we had a dining club back home. Bonus points for being so detail-oriented and for paying attention to the notes I put in our reservation. His name was Gabe. He then directed us to a beautifully dressed table (The tables were dressed to the hilt and the chairs were very comfortable and conducive to a leisurely sit. A beautifully dressed table is the second sign of a good restaurant. Hint: the first sign is how you are greeted by the host\/hostess) and handed us the lunch menu, special menu for the day and the extensive wine list. He informed us our server would be Perry and wished us an enjoyable meal. Well done, Gabe!

Even though the restaurant seemed fairly full (a great sign for a Monday at noon during the two slowest weeks in Vegas!), Perry was over in a millisecond to greet us. He was professional, efficient, friendly, was quick to give us a bit of background on the restaurant and their goals, and offered us bottled or tap water. I love it when the waiter, manager, chef, etc., take the time to give you some history and explain the restaurant's goal. It gives me an idea of what to expect and some insight into why the menu is the way it is.

To start things off, we ordered wine (Riesling, Dr. Pauly-Bergweiler, Noble House, Mosel, GER) by the glass ($8 - very reasonable and a deep pour), but we would have preferred a half-bottle, but there were no Rieslings offered that way. That was a bit of a bummer, but their wine list is extensive, so I feel most people would find many choices to select from. Bottle prices ranged from $40's to $7k with a lot in the $40-$70 range. With that, we received a bread basket with several fresh-made choices to munch while we made our selections.

This day was about shellfish! For our appetizer, we selected the Madagascar Shrimp ($17 ea). It's grilled and served shell removed, head on. The server finished the prep at tableside. It is hands down the largest shrimp I've ever eaten, much less seen! It had to be 8 inches long (no joke, folks, see the picture with reference to the server's hand) and probably was 6-7oz after cooking. We split ONE and it was plenty as an appetizer. It was grilled to perfection; I highly recommend this.

Our ""second course"" was the Jumbo Alaskan King Crab (6oz appetizer portion $22). It was served beautifully, over ice, pre-cracked, and garnished such that it was a sight for the eyes in addition to the taste buds! The chilled, drawn butter was superb. It was real, true drawn butter and it added to the crab, instead of detracting from it. Although, the crab did stand on its own.

For our ""third course"" we shared the Joe's Classic Two-Course Luncheon Special. It consisted of five medium Stone Crab Claws (I thought they were very large for medium claws), Hashed Browns, Cole Slaw and Key Lime Pie ($35 - an excellent deal for this price!). So, the Stone Crab - perfection! The meat is sweet, smooth and melts in your mouth. Seriously the best crab I've eaten. The hashed browns are very good, without being overly engineered. Now, the cole slaw. Oh. My. God. It comes out of the kitchen as cabbage, apple cider vinegar, Hellmann's mayo, sweet pickle relish, some pepper, salt and sugar. Perry mixed it table side and it was out of this world! The best slaw ever!!!

And lastly, the Key Lime Pie. It should be noted that I don't eat pie. But my husband had his first bite and raved about it, so I felt I had to try it...you know, for the sake of a complete review! Let me say, it was heaven! I'm fairly certain not all Key Lime pies taste like that, so I am not ready to call myself a pie lover, but I'd eat Joe's Key Lime again in a heartbeat! It's brightness was the perfect note to end on after the richness of our crab and shrimp.

At the end, Perry came by with lemons and a hot towel. He squeezed lemon over our hands, then laid the hot towel over them and rubbed a bit. We finished off the process and were super glad they do that since we'd certainly dove right in with our fingers for this delicious meal!

Overall, superb experience! Food, service, atmosphere - all excellent. And, in my opinion, appropriately priced for the quality of what you receive.",8,0,4

The first time I got the dry aged bone in rib eye, and oh my god it was amazing-completely melt in your mouth. It's also really large (24 oz) and that time I split it halfsies with my wife and just got a salad and sides. 
The second time I got the wet aged bone in rib eye, and while it was also delicious and cooked to my idea of perfection. I would definitely spend the extra $15 and just get the dry aged one. When you are splurging you mine as well just get the best.
I'm personally not a sea food fan but the friends and family that I go with LOVE it here, we went this last weekend and I'm sure it comes up as a topic of convo at Thanksgiving and Christmas about how good it is.
The service here is absolutely fantastic, these folks are the best of the best. Picking up crumbs from the table constantly, always having a drink full.

My husband, cousins and I decided to go here for dinner while in Las Vegas (based on the Yelp reviews) to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary and it was also our cousins mini honeymoon.

It was a little hard to find from where we parked - it's on the 1st floor at the far end but we asked around and were finally pointed in the right direction.

Our server, David, was awesome!!!! Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, funny. Couldn't have been better. Our water glasses never emptied, he gave us excellent recommendations when we asked, he checked on us multiple times to be sure everything was perfect - he was just great!

We ended up ordering way too much food! The side dishes are separate from the entrees and, although we found out you can order 1\/2 orders of the side dishes, they were still big enough to be shared between the 4 of us.

We ordered the Filet Mignon and King Crab, Filet Mignon and Lobster and the fried chicken. As sides we shared 1\/2 portions of the Lyonnaise potatoes, Big Daddy potatoes, roasted sweet corn, Mac and cheese, steamed asparagus, fried asparagus with lemon sauce, creamed spinach. We had SO much left over but oh my Lord the food was SO SO SO good! We all agreed it was one of, if not THE, best meal we'd ever had. The food was excellent!!!! Every item was absolutely delicious!

David also talked us into dessert (even though we were SO full) so we ordered 1\/2 portions of the Banana Cream Pie with Foster sauce and Key Lime Pie to share and he also brought us Brownie a la mode for our celebration. All 3 were excellent but the Banana Cream Pie was our fav.

This place is fancy but it's not overwhelming so. We all felt that, for a fine dining experience, this place is very reasonably priced. You get fairly large portions and the even the half sides are pretty large.

Reservations recommended. When we got there for our 6:30pm reservation, their next availability was 9:30pm.

The turkey avocado sammy is my fav(3.5) service is solid (4) value: depends on what you order.  Stick to the sandwiches and the 2 course lunch and you should make out fine (3.5 bump up to 4)

Just to preface this review -  Stone crab is not all that for me. Neither is crab in general. But we still make our way to Joe's for lunch to catch some of their other menu items. 

We usually go during the summer when Lettuce Entertain You club members receive coupons to dine in their local joints. Usually there is a coupon for Joe's which is a major score (yay!). 

We've tried different iterations of things but the true stand outs for us is the lunch menu which is way easier on the wallet than dinner. 

My perennial favorite is their turkey avocado sandwich. Served with real roasted moist turkey and a nice thick slice of bacon, it is a simple dish done really well. Love the combination of alfalfa sprouts, tomato and avocado. The fried sweet potato fries are pretty solid but nothing special. For $16, this is as affordable for a place like Joe's gets. 

The hubs loves their sliced rib eye French dip with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions and a side of fries. ($22) It's messy\/juicy but oh so good sandwich served on a ciabatta roll. The french fries again are nothing special. 

The two course lunch is a good deal if you consider how much they charge for sides and dessert. Between the two options of Alaskan king crab vs.  the steak,  I would opt for the crab. 

Really,  the crab is only okay in my books. Portion size for this is pretty small -  about 5 small legs. Where it stands out is the lyonnaise potatoes and roasted sweet corn. The lyonnaise potatoes is kind of like a large mound of hash browns topped with caramelized onions. Greasy but very tasty. The roasted sweet corn with a hint of lime is great too. Both portion sizes for the sides are really a lot for one person and easily shared. It comes with Havana dream pie which is essential a Boston cream pie minus the chocolate topping and instead dulce de leches with a hit of cinnamon. If you decide you want banana cream pie or key lime pie instead (both are pretty good) ,  they will accommodate you. All of this for around $28-29.

The steak option is okay - just the mashed potatoes are boring while the saut√©ed spinach is nothing special. 

Service is prompt generally during lunch hours due to all the power lunches that go down here. As soon as you are seated,  they make sure the water glasses are filled and a basket of warmed bread is placed while you peruse the menu. The bread basket is okay but I find myself partial to the Parker roll and the lavosh -  both are kind of guilty pleasures.

Overall, Joe's is nothing particularly innovative. But it is good food executed well generally. Value is largely during the lunch hours with decent eats for a more reasonable price point. 3.5 starred review with bump up to 4.",7,4,6

Everything is a la carte, so when you order a steak, that's all you get. Sides are ordered separately, but each side will easily serve two people. I was in a party of five so everyone ordered their entrees and we had three side dishes, which was more than enough for my table. Our server was spot on and courteous. I would probably put him near or at the top of the list of the servers I have had. 

We ordered a Stone Crab appetizer for all of us to share. It was the first time for me having Stone Crab and I didn't think it was the greatest. But I knew what I had coming, so nothing was going to compare anyway. It probably isn't something I would order again. I absolutely had to order the table-side chilled Alaskan King Crab legs with melted butter. I died and went to heaven several times over! I normally prefer my crab meat warm instead of chilled, but who am I to complain if they're going to do all the work for me? It was so delicious I'm about to start drooling just thinking about how good it was. I normally make fun of my sister about being stingy with food, but I made the most food aggressive dog look tame with my crab legs. The side dishes were good too, which ranged from french fries to baked potatoes to macaroni and cheese to green beans. It was a fairly good list so I don't remember all of them. 

It is a bit on the expensive side (my crab legs were well worth the $60, though) so be prepared drop some bucks. If you're lucky enough, you'll be able to pay for the entire meal with casino winnings. If you like Alaskan King Crab, this is definitely the place for you.",0,0,0

We eat at Joe's about once a month, and their food and service have always been outstanding.  For that matter, the food on this last visit was as good as ever and our server was excellent.

Here is what happened.  We were enjoying lunch in the terrace area.  After about an hour, the matre' d came over and asked us to move to the bar, and finish our conversation there, as someone was waiting for the table.  I can honestly say, I have never had anything like this happen to me before, let alone at such an upscale restaurant as this, and after only an hour!   We had salad and lunch, we were not simply sitting enjoying waters and taking up a table.

To his credit, the matre' d did say something to the manager, who came over, and was very apologetic.  The problem was, while she said she was sorry, and he should have never asked us to move, in the next breath she told us we were not the first people that they have asked this of, so obviously he is instructed to do this.  Now, had we ordered next to nothing, had we been there an inordinately long amount of time, been acting inappropriately, or dressed that way, I would understand.  We found this totally unacceptable.

One night was a far more extravagant night- claws, cakes, pies, wine, scallops, steak, fish, sides... Big bill obviously got us greats service. (oh, an the food was excellent! I LOVE crab and those claws are worth the price. I had been skeptical, but it's true).

But the other time, we were being more light and frugal: 3 of us shared 2 meals- one was a sandwich from the bar menu. I ordered the mac and cheese b\/c, c'mon, that's what I do. The server, halfway through us eating the M&C came back and said that it was a new mac on the menu and he didn't think that the kitchen had gotten ours right-enough, and he was bringing us a new one to try (!!! two mac and cheeses for me!).

We sat down and ordered our food and ask the waiter if he can rush our orders because we had tickets to Celine at 7:30. He did an excellent job and we made it in time to Celine.

We ordered Stone Crab as an appetizer to share. It was good but I think they over cracked it, every piece of meat came with a tiny piece of shell with it. 

I ordered the Chilean Sea bass. Very good. Very buttery and full of flavor. Actually, half of us ordered the Chilean Sea bass.

We each ordered shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. It was very good. The cocktail sauce has a dollop of horseradish which gives it more than the usual kick. My wife had the Copper River Sockeye Salmon special. Salmon was cooked as she requested and she rated the dish as excellent. 

My favorite dish has always been the Parmesan Crusted Halibut with lemon butter sauce.

One is because I felt this would be a ""people pleaser"" in terms of a solid steakhouse for a larger group. The other because it was a three dollar sign joint. I realize steakhouses can get pricey, so I wanted to find something that wasn't going to break the bank, but still be ""fine dinning."" 

The service is very good, I'll note right away. But please be wary, our server was a totally up-seller. She knew exactly what she was doing.... ""oh, if you're going to get a couple glasses of wine, get a bottle"" or ""what appetizers can I start you with"" almost as soon as we sat down. I kinda feel like they're probably all trained that way. Not necessarily annoying, but be wary!

Also, the food is all a la carte. So you'll get up there in price with what you order. We had a table of 8 and ordered 4 different sides and they were all gone by the end of dinner. But it was the perfect amount. The good: garlic roasted spinach, the lyonnaise, and my fave grilled tomatoes (wonderfully red tomatoes with pesto and melted mozzarella on top aka YUM!). The okay: broccolini. 

I ordered a special, which was Filet Mignon with crab on top. I really wanted both the filet and crab, and the regular menu listed large pieces of both for much more. This was the perfect amount for $36. Plus asparagus! It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and very flavorful. The crab was fantastic and I almost wished there was more. Maybe a bit more, but the portion was good still.

Tried the Stone Crab, Manhattan Clam Chowder, and the Stone Crab Bisque.  Stone Crab is not as easy to eat as they do on TV.  A lot of cartilage and broken shells to contend with.  By itself, the flavor was fine but the Mustard sauce really made it.  I think I'd rather have dungeness crab, more economical.  Manhattan Chowder was OK,  Bisque was a bit rich and a bit salty for my taste.  What else do you expect from something that came from the sea, you ever drank seawater?  

We sat in the bar area which made the atmosphere busy.  Service was quick.  It is a good place to try, but I won't repeat.

Crab claws are basically what they are known for but what makes me want to go back is the beef.  I always get a NY strip and it's always done to perfection.  Sides are great and perfect for sharing.  French fried sweets, roasted sweet corn, asparagus, it's all very tasty.  

Their banana cream pie is also a winner.  

The thing that sets this place above others though is the seasoning mix they give you to put on your steak.  It is quite simply the perfect blend of seasonings that bring out the flavor of your steak.

So we're wandering the endless halls of Caesar's looking for a spot to chill for several hours before the countdown begins. The halls are a bustle of screaming children and many people. The host stand and its tailored dude greet you alongside the display menu and a few tables out in the mall for the noisy customers. The real restaurant is back two rooms behind the bar and is like a secret treasure room for the deserving. We were lucky!

The NYE special surf and turf themed card included jumbo stone crab claws (4), king crab legs, 3lb lobster and a ""side"" of 8oz filet mignon. I won't say which one I didn't order, but the steak was the best steak in the universe, the lobster was huge and meaty and the stone crab claws (those poor babies!) were phenomenal. Add to that a special price on the Tattainger reserve and it was one heck of a way to bring in the new year.

The bread basket included several varieties but my favorite was the fennel seed, roasted sesame seed and Parmesean lahvosh. Stuffed mushrooms were excellent.

The service was prompt and professional and I loved how our server kept stopping by to ask us if he could bring anything for us _right now_; very fun.

But, this being Vegas, we took a gamble and won BIG time!  My husband and our friend got the steak (chop) & the lobster.  As our friend put it, the lobster was both sweet with just a tad bit of saltiness for flavoring; it was succulent, and when dipped into the butter, simply divine. So, they moved to the steak, both of them were skeptical that they'd be impressed at all well, they were wrong. As my husband put it, the steak was so tender you barely even needed a knife to cut it; you could've just used the edge of your fork. The steak was tender, savory, and made to perfection.  Wow, right?  
We also had the stone crabs because that's Joe's signature dish;  it definitely did not disappoint. Meaty and flavorful.  I had the grilled seafood platter with shrimp, scallops, & lobster tails. The one major problem with it was that I finished all of it and then it was gone. . I suppose it gave me a chance to dive into our sides:  mac & cheese, saut√©ed spinach, and stuffed mushrooms. Mac & cheese:  shell pasta struck the balance of firmness but not too hard, and the shape (I discovered) handily scooped up & held the cheese so that everything landed into my mouth. Stuffed mushrooms were also nicely done with the mushrooms retaining the flavor from the buttery stuffing & let's be honest, that's always a good thing.  And the spinach was my one vegetable, made extra delicious with seasoned butter-\/or something like that. The staff was very helpful, knowledgeable, & engaging. She knew a couple members of our party were on a tight schedule so she got our order going quickly to get them fed and  out the door.

I'm no seafood expert, but the actual Stone Crab appetizer (it's a bunch of claws!) tastes really great. It tastes... more like crab than regular crab.

Yeah, uh... So like,  regular crab flavor is like calling it a few times over the week until it finally agreed to meet you at a coffee shop and when it did show up, it was dressed in these gnarly sweats but it's wearing nice perfume. Stone Crab immediately shows up to your house in lingerie on speed dial. I mean, you know. If Stone Crab were an attractive woman and you were a heterosexual dude. Oh yeah, and the mustard sauce you dip the Stone Crab in is the lingerie--it's flavorful and not overtly spicy.

I also ordered the Seafood Chop Salad, which I really enjoyed. It has all these colors! I don't know why (you can guess, maybe?) but my salad was covered in a good layer of seafood that I couldn't even finish. Sooo... if you like salads and like eating your fill of seafood (and maybe if you're a tiny person like me), get the salad with Joe's vinagrette sauce.",0,0,0

I Had never been to this restaurant before, was a referral from a friend of mine, so we went. I let him order since I had no idea what to get :)

He ordered the Stone Crab and some Crab Legs. I was very happy with them all. As you guys can tell from some of my previous reviews, I am sure somewhere in there I have gone to AYCE buffets that have crab legs, and I will say I have honestly never had ""premium"" crab legs, and there is a difference. 

I also had the Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon, that was excellent.

The stone crab got me going though. The taste was superb. I never had them before, and was really impress...to the point that I just placed my first order for Stone Crab yesterday since it is now Stone Crab season.

The Crab Legs were great as well. The meat was so thick I go full off maybe 2 or 3 of them. Usually at the buffet I will have many many plates of crab legs, but for some reason I was stuffed off only a few of these, the Stone Crabs and my ahi tuna steak.

Overall, paired with some good wine and people, this location got me. I don't know what the bill was, I am sure it was a pretty penny with a few bottles of wine flowing, but I am sure it was up there.

One thing is to know about Stone Crabs, if you don't is that seasons is from October 15th to May 15, so me eating here in September, I must have had frozen stock or they pulled the stone crab legs from another vendor, not sure. It was good either way.",0,1,0

It was the perfect spot to go to for some alone time as we did come on this trip with a group of our friends. It was already kind of late but luckily Joe's was open till 11pm.  We walked in and they were able to take us right away thankfully.

We got served a nice hot basket of assorted bread.  It even had cornbread in it with chunks of corn in it!  That was the best bread basket I've seen (yes bread is my weakness).  Our waiter let us take our time in our orders but was a little slow with serving us and checking on our table.  Not a big deal though.  The food was delicious!  I ordered a seafood platter which came with a lobster tail, shrimp scampi and scallops.  It was surprisingly a good amount of seafood.  My boyfriend got the filet mignon and crab.  Honestly, the portion size was smaller than I expected but it all tasted good so not complaining.  We also ordered a side of broccoli and their baked potato with roasted onion sour cream which was pretty damn amazing. Something about that onion sour cream.  

Their stone crab is what they are known for and honestly wish we had ordered it.  But we already had a pretty filling dinner.  I guess we'll just have to come back and try it next time!  The boyfriend and I enjoyed everything in our meal, including our dessert.  We opted for the gluten-free brownie sundae.  Sounds like an average dessert but it was oh so good and they give you not just 1 but 2 brownies!  It was very moist and chocolatey.. totally hit the spot :)  They also were very generous on the ice cream (I hate places that give you very little ice cream!).

Overall I enjoyed Joe's and would definitely come back here again if I were ever in Vegas again.  Yes this place is a fine dining restaurant but I thought the price was reasonable.  Even with our drinks it wasn't so bad!  Great spot to check out when you're in Vegas!",1,0,2

In terms of entrees, I had the chilean sea bass, and he had the large snow crab. While 5-6 snow crab legs didn't seem like a lot when we first checked it out on the menu, the legs are actually really meaty and filling! The sea bass was flavorful and tender, but the seasoning didn't overpower the buttery taste of the fish. 

As for sides, we ordered the fried asparagus and shrimp and grits. Let me just say that I am a huuuuuuuuuge fan of creole food. You can imagine how excited I was when I saw that they had shrimp and grits on the menu. I was not disappointed! This place has the best Shrimp and Grits in Vegas and believe me I have tried everywhere. While everything is a la carte, the side dishes are big enough to be shared by 2\/3 people (particularly if you order more than one).  Foodies typically approach restaurants with a ""one and done"" type attitude, but I definitely would eat here again!

The ambiance is very romantic. When I made the reservation, I walked in to find that they had a huge, round, dimly-lit booth reserved for us in the back. It made us feel so special because it was almost like we were in our own little world! Our server's name was Neil and he was so kind to us. Definitely an experience I won't forget!

Let me tell you something... it really doesn't get much better than this place. The stone crab is out of this world, cooked to perfection and the bring it to you with the shell already cracked so there is no fight when it comes to getting to the meat- you just basically peal the broken pieces off and ohh man.... it just melts in your tongue and their mustard sauce is the icing on the cake.

I had totally forgotten to tell my friends that we'd share the sides and we regretfully over bought. I'm hoping they give all that extra food to the homeless.

For dinner, my husband got the king crab legs special.  It was the best he ever had.  They cracked the legs for you right at the table.  I got the filet mignon since I do not eat most seafood.  The steak was so tender and delicious!  We had macaroni and cheese and sauted green beans for sides.  Yum, yum, yum.  Very rarely do I find macaroni & cheese as a side, so I jumped on the chance to order it since I just love mac & cheese!  For dessert we had the apple pie w\/ vanilla ice cream.  Another cool thing that our waiter suggested was half orders on the sides and dessert.  We got the half size for the dessert and it was still enough for the two of us!

     Let's start with the food.  The stone crab claws were really good, very sweet and delicate.  The Kumamoto oysters were good, but not great.  I've had better in Seattle.  My seafood platter was good, but not great as well.  And it came out luke warm and got colder from there.  My wife's crab cakes were tasty but once again, were warm and not hot.  When I go out to eat and spend $600, I EXPECT to be wowed...I was not.
     And now on to my motivation to post this review, the service.  Maybe our server was having a REALLY bad day.  Perhaps, her husband couldn't take her attitude anymore and she had just received a divorce text from him merely seconds before she greeted us!  When my wife commented on how fast the oysters came out our server said, ""Yeah, they're oysters."" In a not friendly tone.  And when I asked to speak with the sommelier because I had a question about the grapes used to make our bottle of wine, she looked at me like I was a complete idiot and walked away to get the somm.  The service was prompt, we never waited for anything and always had everything we needed.  But her attitude was HORRIBLE!!  She never smiled at us once.  She was the most unfriendly server I've ever had.

A classy looking place which replicates an old 20's-era steakhouse in the Forum Shop area of Caesar's. Classic large bar with a great selection of fine spirits. My Oxley gin martini was a great way to start. Paired with Kumamoto oysters, this is the way to start a meal! Besides the usual accompaniments, Joe's served a semi-frozen version of mignonette that is unique and tasty.

The grilled octopus appetizer was tremendous. Hot seafood on cold beans and greens was simply delicious.  My wife went for a classic Manhattan cocktail and we also split a small cup of Manhattan clam chowder. While we both prefer New England clam chowder, this was quite good.

Main dishes were next and I was not disappointed that I strayed from my usual steak craving and opted for the Chilean sea bass. A sweet teriyaki glaze was perfect in bringing out the flavor. My bride opted for the small filet and huge lobster tail. Another martini and a glass of excellent Cabernet helped wash down the delightful dishes. We split a classic baked potato and steamed asparagus. All were excellent. Their famous key lime pie finished off the evening perfectly.

Started off with a beautiful assortment of bread. My favorite was the crispy cheese flatbread. I knew we were in for a treat when the amuse bouche arrived - hamachi and caviar. We ordered the popular Stone Crabs. I'm used to dirtying my hands for crab meat but these Stone Crabs come pre-cracked and didn't want to budge out of the rock hard shells. Kept us preoccupied for a little while. Fresh nonetheless. The Seared Scallops were perfectly cooked and came with some of the best bacon jam i've come across. The cauliflower mash surprised me, i thought it was actually mashed potatoes! Creamy and buttery, you would never know otherwise. I can rave about the chilean sea bass but i'm pretty sure every dish here is worth of 5 stars.

I first asked the waiter what a stone crab tastes like.  His reply ""a mix of crab and lobster.""  After trying them, I would say that is a fairly accurate description.  While good, I prefer blue crab meat, which is much sweeter but maybe I am biased.

The ambiance was very nice.  Much like a steakhouse, as opposed to some type of Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville type place I was originally expecting.  The service was excellent. Our waiter called me ""sir"" every time, which is a nice touch and took the time to answer all of our questions.  (There is nothing worse than having a waiter with an attitude)

I like using my reward points toward my dinners. Even though I asked our waiter twice he denied that I had any points toward my meal. Checked my app had $40... disappointing.

The big joe potato was crazy, it's not on the menu and you can feed like 6 people. Comes with grilled onions, bacon, chives, cheese and sour cream and just mad flavor.

Working with the folks at Joe's was super easy and they were able to accommodate so many of my unique requests and last minute changes to the set menu. Jessica and Khaveri were super professional and communicated so well with me. I had some sour experiences with trying to book through Caesar's special events (which Joe's is not apart of), so to work with people who understand quality and customer service was such a blessing during this hectic time. 

When it came to the actual reception, our service and food were impeccable. I've had to give up crab due to a shellfish allergy, so I enviously watched as the dinner guests dined on the stone crab. I chose the Chilean Sea Bass as my entree, and myself and the groom (also allergic to shellfish), both commented that it was one of the best takes on the dish that we've ever had. The bride and groom were so impressed at the spread. The bride was admiring the seasoning on her steak, and one of our waiters came out instantly with their packaged seasoning for her to take home. They even emptied and packed up the wine bottles from the dinner for the bride to use as part of a shadowbox for later. 

Even if you're not in need of a place to hold a reception, Joe's is great for lunch and dinner. I've dined here many times and have always been treated so well by everyone I've encountered.

Well, I don't stick to 4 words very well, so here's a few more.
 
The restaurant itself is very nice.  We dined in the main dining room, which was comfortable and cozy.  We had a reservation and on a Saturday night, we did not wait one minute to be seated.  Unfortunately, that's where the good service ended.  Our female server was haughty and condescending, and reluctant to offer any suggestions whatsoever.  
 
So we decided on the Stone Crab Bisque, Bacon-Wrapped Scallops and Select Stone Crab Claws, with a side of mac n' cheese, which seems to be my current obsession.
 
With the exception of the mac n'cheese, the food was GREAT.  The bisque was better than GREAT, it was amazing!  Lick-your-bowl amazing.  The scallops were perfect, as was the crab.  
 
Dessert?  Who knows?  It was never offered and we couldn't catch our server.  This seems to be happening to me a lot in LV, a less confidant (or less thin, hahahaha) woman would start to assume that the servers think I don't need dessert.  WhatEVER, there is dessert available elsewhere, in the form of cocktails served a little later during the REALLY GREAT Matt Goss show over at Cleopatra's Barge. *separate review posted*
 
Anyway, not bad value for GREAT food, except for that bad service thing.  I wrote a less than flattering comment about it on Open Table, and received an e-mail from the manager.  I provided him with the requested phone number to reach me, and he did call.  Left a voice mail, which I returned and it ended there.  Not too impressed.

The service was excellent from the start. We had a preset menu so ordering was only for the entree and desert.

The Caesar salad dressing was the best I've had. It just made the salad amazing. The string beans amandine were excellent as well. They had a slight buttery taste but not overwhelming and were cooked perfectly.

I got my filet and it was perfectly seasoned & cooked (medium). Absolutely succulent and tender. I think others were so used to not getting a perfectly cooked steak that they ordered a different temperature to make up for it but ended up with exactly what they asked for.

I had assumed the filet was a larger portion but since it was smaller decided to add on lobster tail. I apologized for the last minute change (we had all been served the entrees at this time) and asked if I could add it on. The server came back once to tell me that it would be out shortly. When it finally showed up they apologized even though it was my mistake. That's an A+ for service.

The lobster tail was cooked perfectly. I shared a little with others who were under the same opinion.

Now for desert. I ordered a cappuccino (they use Lavazza) and the apple pie. The server wasn't joking about saving room for desert. The portion was huge. It was possibly one of the best apple pies I've tasted (and I know my apple pies since they're my favorite). Some of the apple slices were slightly under-cooked. These were thinly sliced apples not the larger chunks. But there were only a few like that and the rest made up for it.

Compared to other establishments of this caliber their food was a hit & miss for us that night. The filet was perfectly cooked, but the quality of the rib-eye wasn't that great. It was a little on the chewy & slightly stringy side. The rib-eye at Gallagher's in NY NY hotel was better. 

The chilled stone crab claws were pleasantly sweet & delicious, but we felt that they were quite overpriced (~$25 for two claws).

We ordered the Stone Crab appetizer, the crab cakes, and the rib eye steak. While waiting for our meal, we were served a basket of different types of bread. Hands down, the little pretzel bread was my absolute favorite. 

We were served the our appetizer, and we dived into the four claws that we were served.  They were soo good, succulent, and with a sweeter flavor than you find in the dungeness crabs I normally eat in LA.  The mustard dipping sauce was really good too; definitely not too mustardy. I would actually call it more of an aioli.  

Our entress were delectable as well. I ordered the crab cakes, and my eyes popped open when they were served I was expecting a couple disk-shaped cakes, but these were no mere disks, but MOUNDS.  The cakes had practically no fillers to it, but was just all sweet, delicious crab.  The steak was amazing as well.  It had a delicious, almost salty crust to it, and it was perfectly cooked. It brought to mind that I haven't had a good steak in, well, a long time.  We ate every bit of food on our places (despite being extremely full), and walked out of the restaurant with that feeling where you're happy from the awesome meal you just ate, mixed with the uncomfortable, slightly lethargic feeling you get from just eating way too much.",2,1,1

It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday evening though. This restaurant was a lot fancier than I had thought, and I felt very under dressed. 

Our server wasn't the nicest person...he didn't smile and never made eye contact. However, another employee who always picked up our food and cleared the table was seriously the best! He was so friendly and kind. 

We decided to try out the fried oysters. We are both not oyster lovers, so we decided to give it a shot. At first, it was ok, but the larger pieces were so soft and the fried crust was not crispy. It tasted like mush. If you're not a fan of oysters, I'd stay away from this dish. 

We, of course, ordered the stone crabs. They were pretty pricey, but delicious! I liked that the crabs were already cracked, so it was pretty easy to eat. There was a ton of meat in each crab. The crab was served with the house mustard sauce, which was ok. I would prefer something spicy - like Tabasco, but I did not ask for that. 

Our last course was the rib eye and a side of asparagus. The rib eye was cooked perfectly, and we requested that they cut the meat into slices to make it easier to eat. The side of asparagus was just ok. At first, it was weird because the asparagus was shaved, so it was white. I would have preferred more flavor too.

Came in on the first night of a 6 day trip and decided to have Joe's for dinner.  For a Saturday night there was no wait and we were seated immediately.

The usual variety bread\/pastry basket is brought to the table at the beginning of the meal.

For the entree I decided to have the Select Stone crab claws.  According to our waiter, the Select Stone crabs are a bit larger than the medium and the shells are less ""grainy"".  For our side dishes we had the garlic spinach, lyonnaise potatoes, and a creamed spinach.

Select Stone Crabs - 6 claws per order and they were delicious as usual. The crab meat a has a very light and sweet taste to it. Served with their signature mustard sauce.  If you don't know about stone crabs then you're really missing out.  These are from the Gulf of Mexico where they harvest remove one of the claws from the stone crab and throw it back in the water for it to re-generate its missing claw.  

Garlic Spinach - sautee'd with A LOT of garlic.  I am a garlic lover myself but the garlic was a little too overpowering to go with the sweet flavor of the stone crab.  This is probably a good dish if you order a red meat dish.

Lyonnaise Potatoes - These are one of my favorite side dishes of any restaurant.  The potatoes are soft and somewhat scalloped, lightly seasoned, and browned for a crispy upper crust.

Creamed Corn - The corn has sweet taste to it with just the right amount of cream and just the right amount of corn.

All in all a great dining experience and a perfect start to any Vegas trip for me.",2,1,1

We decided to skip the appetizer and go straight to the entree. My girlfriend had the salmon which I quote was ""the best salmon ever..."" It was tasty, light, and cooked perfectly.

I got the seafood platter which honestly had so much seafood I felt like the pacific ocean was inside my plate. 

My favorite from the platter definitely had to be the scallops which went well with the white wine sauce and the Madagascar shrimps which was grilled and split in half like a lobster tail. It was delicious, meaty, delicious and so juicy. (Yes I repeated delicious purposely)

- Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon with Crispy potato cake, spinach, mushroom, red wine bordelaise

Service was quite good and attentive at lunch, but was far less impressive at dinner. It took 15 minutes to get a drink order in after being seated. The place was jammed, but this needs to be better.

The tab for dinner for the 8 of us was about $1900. One of our group had a rewards card, but management declined to apply any credit to the card because another of our group paid for the dinner, in spite of the fact that the person with the rewards card had eaten at this restaurant three times this past week, having spent a few thousand dollars there in that week.

Kumamoto oysters are always a solid choice. My personal favorite is the crab bisque made with King Crab.  We usually get the 1 1\/2 lb. Of King crab legs which we prefer over the stone crabs. The steaks here are pretty lackluster and are served with a really salty mix that does nothing really for the steak.

-bone-in ribeye:  Yah, I splurged for the bone and honestly, I don't know if it would've made a difference.  I've noticed with other places that the meat next to the bone is usually a bit more tender than the rest of the steak but it really didn't matter here.  Every piece of meat I ate was just as good as the last.
-dover sole:  This thing was A-MA-ZING!  Cooked perfectly and the brown butter sauce on the side was so decadent.  My only gripe about this dish is that they took the belly, and all the tasty little bones away =(  My little heart cried when the waiter took that platter away ='(((
-swordfish with mint pesto:  This was a special that night and it was overcooked.  My friend really should've sent it back for a new one but she didn't.  The presentation was lovely though.
-creamed spinach:  This was very good.  It had a good spinach flavor and wasn't overloaded with cream.
-Jennie's potaoes:  Honestly, I don't see the draw of this dish.  It was just whipped potatoes and it seemed to have lacked butter and salt in it.
-mac and cheese:  This was okay, loved that they used shells though =d
-oysters on a half shell:  Their shucking skillz weren't too bad.  Only about 3 of the 12 oysters on the plate were stabbed to death and I had some shell shards in 1 of my oysters so that was good.  They were offering French Kisses and Kushis that night.  The Kushis defintely stole the show with a slight sweet buttery taste to them.  They also come with little Tabasco bottles that are uberly cute!  And a migonette, which was nice but a tiny spoon to get the liquid onto the oysters would've been greatly appreciated hah!

Had a tremendous Englishwoman as our server. She was sassy and knowledgeable and provided impeccable recommendations (how many crab claws to get, suggested that I get my bone in filet medium as opposed to my usual medium rare to avoid a cool bone).

The large crab claws were impressive and generally amazing. The bone in filet had a wonderful crust. Even the chopped salad was really well executed.

It's easy to eat here when it's covered by work. Between the three of us, we dropped $600 (the other two fools kept on ordering quality scotch... I was super jealous as I wasn't drinking but that's another story). So yeah I wouldn't come here if you're looking to save a penny or two.

I would still make a point to come here and pay for a great meal on my own dime. I would seek this place out if you're looking for a great combination of seafood and steak.

Joe's has a nice ambience; it is conveniently located in Caesar's and the after-dinner coffee was tasty but the positives end there.  I can't believe this place gets so many 4* reviews.

Although a variety of bread is presented in the basket, the bread lacks freshness and isn't served warm.  The butter was hard too.

My husband and I order calamari everywhere we go and this was pretty poor- small skinny pieces, chewy and nothing special or tasty about it at all.  The breading wasn't hot and crispy like one would expect.  The mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes from a box.  My husband got the dover, which was deboned tableside, but it was relatively tasteless.  He also had oysters and they were ""meh"" according to a guy who eats them often.  

I had scallops and shrimp as my main course and both were overcooked which really impacts the flavor and texture of those foods.  I let my husband try some and he concurred that they were overcooked.  It's pretty bad to get that wrong when you are a steak and SEAFOOD restaurant.

The service was good although our table remained covered in crumbs and even though I brushed the table off in front of the waitress, she never scraped the crumbs between courses or when clearing the table like they do in a lot of ""better"" restaurants.

Also, when I asked the server for extra butter, his reaction was as if I had just insulted him. I eventually had to ask a bus-boy for the butter.  Service was rushed and sub-par for this restaurant.

ambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted. 
the wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority. 

the food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the filet mignon i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), the waiter usually removes the tail from the shell before i consume it. i had no extra plate to place the shell on and i didn't find it appropriate to leave it on the table. so i worked around it. but i will say for $59.95 it was a fairly priced meal. my brother on the other hand had the filet mignon and King Crab Legs. we were ""sold"" that they were HUGE legs and delicious. fresh and great! when they came out... there was a measley (maybe) one leg cut into three pieces. not much bigger than snow crab. not huge, barely delicious... and if it wasn't for the melted butter - i wouldn't consider it very great.
given that i have had true alaskan king crab legs before - a single leg about 2 feet in length and about 3 inches in diameter with claws the size of my hand... so yes my idea is skewed. but can i be blamed for expecting the best at a restaurant that self proclaims itself as the best in vegas?

as we finished our meal - we had to waive a busser down to find our waiter to close our tab out. in the end... after rockerfeller oysters, kumoto oysters, stone crabs, filet mignon with lobster and king crab, and two glasses of wine. i can say... meh - i've experienced better.",0,0,0

This entire meal was served up, along with some good conversation, by Mark the bartender.

The scallops are literally the best I've ever tasted.  So delicious.  You have to try the stone crab of course.  We get ours steamed because I'm not as keen on the cold version (the standard way they are served).
We have never been disappointed in anything - keep up the good work Joe's!",1,0,1

Took my brother, mom, and my boyfriend here for my brother's birthday\/Easter day. The ambiance was intimate and our server was very attentive and gracious. 

The food was splendid. My boyfriend and I had the filet and tail. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked (we both had it medium rare) and the lobster tail was very tender and didn't have the rubber texture to it. 

My mom had the crab claws and my brother had his rib-eye steak and they both enjoyed it.

Our server cleared out the table once we were done and served my brother a medium sized brownie with vanilla ice cream and with a candle on top. No birthday song but my brother isn't fond of birthday songs anyways so that was a huge plus for him\/all of us.

The awesome thing about that was that I didn't give them any special instructions at all! I remember my mom saying happy birthday to my brother when he arrived and the guy who handles the reservation over heard her and greeted him as well. I guess he let our server know! Very impressed on how discreet they were about it.

One minor gripe was our seating. We were seated right next to the kitchen but meh. I was not too bothered by it. The overall experience was excellent.

The Miami location is seasonal with its stone crabs, so we didn't go.  When I found out about the Las Vegas location, I called to find out that they have stone crabs year round. :D so my next Vegas trip, my friend definitely wanted to go.  We unfortunately got back from camping later than expected and my friend called to make a reservation.  We didn't end up at the restaurant until 9.  When sat down, the waiter immediately told us that they ran out of stone crabs.  WTF!!!! WHY THE HELL ARE WE THERE FOR??!!?  I was so angry and disappointed, I wanted to walk but we were so starving we stayed.  Why couldn't they have told us that when we made the reservations?! Of course not.  EVIL. evil.  So we ended up ordering a bunch of seafood, crab cakes (delicious), calamari (nothing great, a bit disappointing actually), some different crab claws (Jonah crab claws) , which were sweet still and pretty good, some scallops (really buttery and rich..too much) and garlic shrimp which could have been more garlicky.  It was an underwhelming dinner, but dessert made up for it....you can order half slices, but it's still a pretty huge slice.  I'm not a fan of key lime pie, but it's what they're known for, and it's not bad.  and their Havana dream pie....OOOOOO MMMMGGGGGG it was A DREAM....similar to tres leche cake, it was smooth and creamy and the perfect amount of sweet.  OOOOOOOO I wanted a second slice but I was too damn full....I'm dreaming about it. :D maybe next time we can actually try some stone crabs.  And they better be damn good.  :P",0,0,0

I could go on all day about the Jumbo stone crab claws that I had in Miami, in Vegas it was just ok.  They were out of the jumbo claws and maybe the large because we ended up just getting the mediums, you really can taste the difference.  In Miami the sweet potato fries are thick cut and in Vegas they're shoestrings and I prefer the thick cut.    The garlic creamed spinach is the same.  Do not order the fried chicken!  I had heard so many great things about the chicken , but ended up so disapointed, it was not salted at all so it tasted really, really bad.  I'm sure this locaton loses some of it's charm because it's not in the salty air of  the Miami coast, but there is no excuse for the bad chicken and being out of jumbo claws.

Going to Vegas, I had to bookmark Joe's.
We went for dinner and it was beyond what I expected. The food was delicious and our server was exceptional. I ordered the medium stone crab claws. My husband ordered a lobster dinner (forgot everything he had) and fresh corn. I truly enjoyed the stone crab-they are served cold but I asked to have mine heated a little. Since it was the first time I've ever had stone crab, I did not know what too expect. They were not sweet nor did they taste like snow crab or king crab-they are a completely different taste and texture. But in a good way. 
What I could not get enough of was the fresh corn. I am not sure what blends of seasonings they put on them but they were amazing! I couldn't stop eating them.

The oysters are so fresh, delicate and tasty. There is NO question that they are extremely high-quality. I could've eaten a dozen more of these bad boys.  The chef split our soup up for us into two cups, which was very nice of him to do. It is silky, rich, and seasoned just right. I think a whole bowl would be too much for me though because it is very rich.

Our steaks were a bit more on the rare side, rather than MR but we didn't mind because they tasted so damn good. The lobster tail is grilled and split for you, and the meat was so tender and had a delicious buttery flavor. We also ordered creamed spinach, which I didn't care for but I'm not a creamed spinach fan. We also got a side of mac n cheese, of course, and it too was delicious.

My dining companion and I had stone crab and Alaskan king crab for an appetizer. The Alaskan king crab was delicious and easy to eat as the shell was split in the kitchen and the meat comes out in one piece. The stone crab was a different story as the shell was smashed in the kitchen and there were numerous small pieces of shell that were hard to see when you separate the shell from the meat. If you happened to miss a small piece of the shell you are in for a surprise if you bite on a piece of the shell as it is hard as.... well, a stone.

For main courses my companion had a filet mignon (ordered medium) and I had the grilled seafood platter, which consisted of Madagascar shrimp, lobster and scallops. We had sides of sauteed spinach and crispy brussel sprouts. The steak was raw in the middle and overdone on the exterior which is inexcusable when you are paying Joe's prices and there is the sous vide technique to ensure steak is cooked perfectly. My items were mixed with the shrimp tasting fine, the lobster was overcooked and the scallops varied from one to the other as to their doneness and taste. All of my items were grilled and there were black carbonized pieces that I had to separate from my food. There was an unpleasant sauce, which I think was a mixture of butter with a herb sauce, that completely detracted from the flavor of the seafood. The spinach was insipid and the brussels sprouts were overcooked.

We were celebrating a special occasion and received a complimentary dessert of ice cream with a brownie. The brownie was overcooked and only tolerable with the help of the ice cream.

The service was a strange blend of familiarity, camaraderie (the waiter commenting, jealously, that he would dine with us if he had the opportunity) and condescension with a touch of arrogance. Then there was meaningless attention such as replacing the generous stainless steel bowl for the crab shell when it was less than one third full.

There are so many choices of dining in Vegas and Joe's shouldn't be one of them. Chose a restaurant where the chef is prominently featured so you know that someone is putting their reputation on the line. Joe's is a stale restaurant with a menu lacking any imagination and relies on a clientele that is clinging to a time gone by and don't know they could have a far superior experience at over 50 other restaurants on the strip, and spend less at the majority of them also.

I have dined at many high end restaurants around the world and it continue to amazes me that places such as Joe's can survive when there are so many excellent dining establishments where ever you may travel.",1,0,0

Now that I have said that, I can tell you about the food.

For lunch, I ordered the stone crab special (of course), which came with 5 stone crabs, hashed brown potatoes. coleslaw and key lime pie for dessert.  

The stone crabs were served with a special mustard sauce.  I am not normally a fan of mustard, but it was yummy.  I love shellfish with just a squeeze of lemon, so I opted to eat it that way.  The stone crab was quite good.  It wasn't the best I have had, but it was still delicious.  

The hashed browns were terrific, but I am always fond of potatoes.  

The coleslaw was... interesting.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.  The best part about it was the sliced tomato garnish.  Enough said.

The key lime pie tasted like it was previously frozen, as it was QUITE cold.  That said, it was phenomenal.  I have had key lime pie in Key West and this rivaled the best Key West key lime pie.  There was no weird green dye in this pie, as you often see in ""fakes.""

Joe's is located in my favorite mall, The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They are, coincidentally, a stone's throw away from Agent Provocateur (a must-stop for any lingerie collector such as myself).  Of course, I didn't pop into AP with my lunch date... but that will be revealed in another review altogether.  :)

Would I come here again?  Certainly.  

TIP: Make reservations, even for lunch.  We arrived slightly tardy for our 11:30 lunch date, but a table was held for us.  Even though there were several open tables, those who approached the maitre d'  without a reservation were only given the option of bar seating (a few high tops).",7,3,7

Because this party had 17 voracious vixens, reservations were strongly recommended.  Thus the Maid of Honor booked it over a week in advance, but we were strongly advised that ALL guests must be present in order to be seated.

We thus were chaired onto 2 different tables.  The table I intentionally positioned at had the following proper foods fit for the queen\/bachelorette & her feminine minions\/comrades:

-Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs-
http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/rGOhtKrX7e\/
They'd better be succulent & fresh; otherwise I would've suggested going to those prestigious buffets without hesitation, with precaution of their slightly overly salty condition.  Not to worry (particularly to the PR who may be reading this =P): they were cleanly & lovingly plated to not even crack those sturdy shells ourselves, as I thus reveled at this meatiness, well-balanced sweetness and saltiness--with the zesty touch from the considerately mesh-covered lemon halves & luxurious melted butter.

-Bone-In New York Strip-
Coming in 3 beastly, thick pieces (at 20 ounces each), just the essential salt, pepper, and seasoning brought the medium rare steaks to straightforward TLC & deliciousness.  Must I say even more...

-Lyonnaise Potatoes ($10.95)-
The menu didn't lie about how shareable it was, even for 9 chicas I sat along with.  Decadent with the utmost creaminess and caramelized onions, I became even more elated that they unintentionally left this tasty carb for this potato-phile.  Besides: what I ate was towards the what-you-partake-on-a-Vegas-bachelorette-night.

-Roasted Sweet Corn ($10.95)-
The touch of lime sparked so much bite, savor, and downright ecstasy coming from mine & the girls' faces that another generous order was ensued.  Was it the best I've ever eaten: well in Vegas, oh heck yes.

And we must not forget the...

-Stone Crab Claws-
http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/q8C4UTLX_8\/
If you're completely unfamiliar with this sustainable sustenance, here's what I hope you can imagine.  Oddly meatier and chunkier than the lengthy legs of the king crab or Dungeness crab, at about $7 PER CLAW you're taking into this toothsome and subtly nutty ordeal, complementing with the just the right pinch of zing of their absolutely tolerant horseradish dip.  These too were effortlessly cracked for us to easily scoop up with our forks, whether using the dinner utensil or the fancy toothpick-ish version.

Obviously I wouldn't leave off my take on service: both the host and the server exhibited sheer patience when we were still waiting for a few more lost chicks to arrive.  Additionally our accommodating waitress cheerfully yet calmly helped our table order the right foodstuffs to last throughout the fun night.  The price may still be quite high for the socioeconomically average Millenial, but I expected that especially for presenting great quality.

So make sure you and your partygoers--whatever occasion it is--are prepped up with a luxurious appetite and the most comfortable mode of transaction to spend exquisitely towards their scrumptious Stone Crab claws.  P.S. if you're reading this review at the month of this post, Joe's is serving up their aptly yet benevolently sweet sliced called the Pumpkin Chiffon Pie, which $1 of every slice will proceed to the Susan G Komen (Breast Cancer Research) Southern Nevada.

Our server was Peter Z  . Wow is all I can say he was Amazing.  I think the waiters name was Tony (I think) he was very fun as well.

Definitely make a reservation for night, especially on the weekend. We sat in the entry part of the restaurant, which I like because you can people watch and it isn't as loud in my opinion as inside the restaurant. 
The stone crab claws are a MUST ORDER. They're a delicious appetizer and come with a mustard sauce that is very enjoyable. 
Back to the service, the waiter comes over with lemon and hot towels after you eat to clean your hands! That is awesome :) 
For dinner we ordered NY steak, cut into strips. We also ordered crab legs, hashbrowns, and fried asparagus. Everything was cooked very well and came out at once. One of the bussers cracked the legs for us at the side of the table which made eating it so easy! 
Wow. I can't say enough good things about this place. 
It's definitely pricey but worth the price. You get what you pay for here and everything we had was phenomenal. 
The only criticism I have is about dessert... Which was still good. I'm lactose intolerant and every dessert had milk in it of some kind. I can't have dessert at most restaurants, and luckily I was able to order apple pie without the ice cream, but I would have loved to have more variety. It was a huge piece of pie and the presentation was still great.",0,0,0

It was Monday night and wasn't sure what we wanted to eat so after doing some Yelp searching, the hubby decided to go to Joe's. The hubby have been to the one in Miami and raved about the stone crab and the key lime for over a year now and knew this is the time for me to try it. Once you sit down, a basket of variety of bread comes to the table, even though it is not the warm kind, it is still tasty. I started out with a cup of stone crab bisque which is nothing too special. It tasted like the crab and asparagus soup my hubby made. Then we ate an order of the 7 medium stone crab and each bite was so deccadent. My main entree was the Fisherman's Platter which consist of prawns, scallop, calamari, and fish; you have a choice for fried or broiled and because I am on a healthy kick, I opted for the broiled. My hubby order the bone-in rib eye and he claims it is the best steak he had. It was cooked just right (medium well). I had a couple of bites, and the meat was so tender and it melted in my mouth just right with all its own juices (salavating while writing this). At the end, of course, we had to have the key lime pie and according to the hubby, it was the saem goodness back in Miami. Our tummies were definitely fulfilled and what a great way to end our Vegas trip.
This is definitely a place to go for a special occassion while in Vegas or if you have some money to spend because it is not cheap.
I didn't get it five stars because the service wasn't Great, it was just good.",1,1,1

We started with the crab bisque, which happened to be the most flavorful dish of the evening.  After that, we had a round of the oysters Rockefeller.  The oysters were unfortunately so incredibly salty that it was hard to eat more than one.  I pointed that out to our waiter, who's response was ""that's just the nature of oysters.""  Now, having had hundreds of oysters all over the country, I'm fully aware that is not true.

Then came the entr√©es and sides.  We ordered the seafood platter, shrimp and grits, fried chicken, the mashed potatoes, fried asparagus and Mac and cheese.  We shared bites around the table and everyone's reaction to the food was the same: BLAND.  The ""gravy"" on the shrimp and grits, while appearing colorful and packed with flavor turned out to be under seasoned and flavorless.  What a bore.  The fried chicken was dry and also flavorless.  My sisters husband describe the coating on the outside as ""the flavor of toast.""  He said the white meat of the chicken had more flavor than the coating. 

One saving grace, however, was the grilled lobster tail on the seafood platter.  Found the flavor!

When the waiter came over to check on us, we expressed how underwhelming the food was, he brushed it off and walked away.  Horrible.

For all the great food in Vegas, this is not a worthy option in the least.",1,0,0

The stone crabs were our app which weren't worth the money paid for.  But I'm from Maryland were we eat crabs all the time and it's hard to convince me that a place outside of the Maryland area really has some good crabs or not.  We also had asparagus but those were the worst asparagus I've ever had.  The didn't even seem completely green either like true asparagus.  The creamed spinach was the worst.  Not sure how they mess up on that.   The mash potato's were ok but I had better at Outback.  We also has the apple, keylime and banana pie.  All of them were basic except the keylime which was good.

This was my first time having stone crab claws & I thought they were just so-so. The texture was a little like a flakey white fish, dense & less sweet than Dungeness crab meat (my fave kind.) At over $10 per Large claw (an order comes with five), a taste of Joe's does not come cheap. And the mustard sauce (spicy from the horseradish) was good, but I'm going to call 'overhyped' on their namesake dish. 

The three of us also shared a crab cake entree ($24, too much breadcrumb filler), a salad & the 'Second Mortgage' appetizer ($16) which was the best thing we tried. I especially liked the jumbo prawn & shrimp & scallop ceviche that was included in the appetizer. 

Service from everyone we encountered was five stars-- very professional, but given that I've had better crab cakes at The Palm a few doors down & the stone crabs hit my wallet pretty hard, I'm giving their food a lukewarm three stars.

I really enjoyed our evening at Joe's. I had never had stone crabs, and the claws we ordered were good, and the dipping sauce was completely addictive.

I ordered the salmon au poivre, and it was truly lovely. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the fennel and radish salad was refreshing and the perfect complement to the salmon. Other dishes at our table included two filets (perfectly cooked and seasoned) and one liver-and-onions. There's not a lot to be done about the texture, but the flavor of the liver and sauce was nice.

We decided on the pan roasted sweet corn, cole slaw, and celery root au gratin for the side dishes. The best part of the corn was all the smokey flavor of grilled corn without all the crap that gets caught in your teeth. The cole slaw is bright and vinegary, something I appreciated since I don't love mayo. The au gratin was a nice change from potato.

We concluded our meal with a slice of the signature key lime pie, which had one of the best graham cracker crusts I've ever had. 

It was a nice meal, and everything was satisfying, so why three stars? Overall, it was a delicious meal, but a few things stuck out. For one, the crabs were great, but I'm not sure I felt like they were worth the $60. The au gratin was definitely under-seasoned, and I suspect that the pie was previously frozen because it certainly seemed frosty in the middle. Our server was nice, but he seemed to be reading from a script at times, and I was a little frustrated in his answers at points.

The Spinach stuffed Mushrooms we shared as an appetizer were excellent, but worth $15? Not so sure.

For entrees we had the crab stuffed shrimp and the medium snow crab legs. They were decent but honestly nothing special, we've had similar quality from far less expensive places.

Finally, $8 for a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream covered in chocolate sauce. We expected much more from the waiter's description of the dessert than that!

Overall our waiter was pretty unattentive, albeit friendly and welcoming.

I understand that everything is expensive in Vegas (and we certainly came to realize that during our long weekend there) but I expected more in terms of quality for how much we paid. Our bill came to $150 including drinks, which for us did not represent value for money.",1,0,0

I had a grapefruit margarita that was excellent (it even was garnished with a big slice of fresh grapefruit).

Located at the end of the newer wing of the Forum Shops it still had the feel of being within a mall, so dining alfresco really meant that you have a great view of the escalators.  Well, to our surprise, it was a tuxedo waitered affair with full linen service...

With our expectations in check, we were initially led to a table between the doors leading to the patio by a slightly stoic maitre 'd that we failed to impress.  That said we told him that we preferred a larger, more centered 4-top that was available, and so we were seated without a problem.  In retrospect, he may have thought that the tiny two-top was a more intimate seating, but no way, not between the doorway and it certainly would have been a problem with all the food we would wind up ordering...

I'm down for seafood, prime steak, and Stone Crab just like the man says;  but they weren't highlighting their signature Stone Crabs with their distinctive black tipped claws saying that they're not quite in season and frozen at the time of our visit.  Bummer.

One of the better crab cakes that we've had, it was meaty and succulent interior belittling it's perfectly crisp scone-like battered exterior (more on this later) prompting my wife to declare that this was the best crab cake she tasted, as good as Old Ebbitt's in DC.  The Caesar Salad (of course) was tossed and divided for us without even having to ask, the freshly grated Parmesan was good quality and had that slightly salty flavor...

Here at Joe's they have a set of signature Bone-In cuts and I was tempted for a moment to order the Filet Mignon with the bone because I've never really heard of such a thing, but for my first try I wanted to have a basis for comparison to others the tried and true bone-in ribeye cut.  The 20oz Bone-In Rib Eye is flown in just like everything else in LV from somewhere in the midwest, it was prepared perfectly with a good even outer sear http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#MYSVBsRccwc5b83vREBdkA.  Delicious and savory with much of it flavor from the extra marbling, it rivaled steaks at other places that sometimes cost more.

Although we didn't notice it much at the time since we were enjoying the salad, our crab cake appetizer was actually served after the salad because the kitchen burnt the first one and insisted on making another one before it came out resulting in an out of order but otherwise unnoticed delay.  Because of their faux pas, they decided to comp us two slices from their famous pie only dessert menu:  the Banana Cream Pie http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#z4g_Kdhogn6XqcjtyLEGXA and their signature Key Lime Pie http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#ZEw71UqTC2Y7ELYfUQYdQA.

You must get the Stone Crabs (large ones if they have them)
They are Melt in your Mouth.
They give you a Mustard\/Mayo Dipping sauce which my Mom said was incredible but I dont like Mayo.   So they gave me a Malt Vinegar and their
Red Wine Shallot vinigerette to dip the crabs in,  Both were sooo good!

We started with salads.
I had the Chopped Veggie Salad which had a ton of veggies and was great.
My parents had a Chopped Lettuce Tomato and Blue Cheese Salad which they loved.

My Dad did not get the Stone Crabs, he got Lobster Tail  Tempura.
I tasted it, and it was also Melt in Your Mouth.

Sides we got:
Lyonaisse Potatoes (I dont eat potatoes but they looked amazing if you do).
They were  dome shape, crunchy, and had carmelized onions on top.
Brocollini, which was simple with a garlic and olive oil, but very good.

They give you a good selection of breads beforehand that seem to be homemade.  
I'm not really one to eat bread before a meal, but they had these really think cracker like things with parm cheese baked in and some intersesting seeds that we couldnt get enough of.

Parents split the Key Lime Pie for dessert.   I didnt eat it, but it looked good, they said it was very good and the homemade crust looked good.

We got to Joe's without a reservation at 6:30. The host told us it would be 30 minutes, but actually had a table for us in 10 minutes. The problem however was that our table was in the over crowded bar and not in the restaurant in the back. We literally had a group of guys leaning on our table for about 10 minutes during our meal. The atmosphere was abhorrent. 
The only thing worse than the atmosphere was the service. Our waitress seemed grumpy and unhappy. We ran out of butter for our pre dinner bread, our food took forever to come out and when we were done our meal we waited for lemon water or hot towels, but ended up going got the bathroom to wash our hands. The hot towels arrived approximately 5 minutes after we were done eating. When I am done eating crab I don't want to wait 5 minutes to wipe my hands down. In my opinion the hot towels in a high end steak and seafood joint should be brought out 5 minutes before you are done, not after.
The meal itself was ok. The only thing I would get again was the medium stone crab. We got some of the large and medium, there wasn't much difference in size, and they tasted the same. I think you get more meat for less money with the medium. The mustard sauce they are served with is really good. We ordered fries and onion rings to go with them, the fries were decent, but nothing to write home about. The saddest onion rings in the world are onion straws, and that is what we got. I wanted a solid steakhouse onion ring and instead I got an over salted mess of greasy thin cut onions.

I've sat at the bar and relaxed from a day of working a convention. This time, I brought my 8 year old son and sat in the Forum Shops outdoor piazza area. I always have excellent food and service.

Food: They have a lovely bread basket of assorted rolls, bread slices, pretzels, crackers. c'est magnifique!

If they have it, always stone crab claws. Yes, they are frozen for shipment but still good. And you have to have their mustard sauce to accompany them. This last time they only had the large size. I only wanted a couple of claws and they were large for my appetizer.

If I'm there at lunch, I like to get their 3 course meals. They will usually have two choices - one with beef and another with seafood. I usually get seafood. This last time, they had King Crab Legs. OMG - so generous with the portions. It came with two huge sides of potato lyonnaise and roasted corn. 

Finished with 1\/2 slice of their delicious Havana pie. It reminds me of tres leches cake but with dulce de leche. one of my favorite desserts.

The kids meals are fabulous and at a great price!

Service: Always stellar

Ambiance: Can be romantic to very casual depending on where you're sitting.",4,4,4

I took to Yelp and started my research.  Joe's was one of the first restaurants that come up on my search.  With over 2,000 reviews and having a 4.5 star rating we decided to make reservations and give it a shot.  It's conveniently located within the Caesar's mall area and is very easy to find.  Once inside you don't even know you are in a mall.   The ambience reminded me of an old school steak house, dimly lit, dark wood d√©cor and white table cloths.  One of the main reasons we chose this place was because of the Stone Crab.  We are big fans of crab but have never tried the Stone Crab.  We had the Stone Crab as an appetizer which was perfect.  They come in small, medium and large.  Your server will recommend the large because they are easier to handle but they are the most costly.  Speaking of cost you shouldn't go hear looking for moderate price tag.  It's a bit pricey (as is any decent steak house) but that's ok because the food is very high quality.  After the Stone Crab we were each served our main course.  My wife ordered a Petite Filet and I went with the Rib Eye (No bone).  We were both very pleased with our steaks from the flavor to how it was prepared to our liking.  I order all my steaks medium rare and my wife orders hers medium.  Both were perfect.  I had a baked potato and my wife had a sweet potato as a side.  Can't really mess those up and they didn't.  The only problem with our meal was the fact that we each could not finish our steaks.  We may have over indulged in the bread basket beforehand.  That's what happens when you starve yourself because you know you are going to have a great dinner.  The bread basket hit the table and like magic it disappeared.  Our service was pretty good although we kind of got the feeling our server was disappointed we didn't order a bottle of wine over just two glasses.  I could be completely wrong but that's the vibe we got.  Overall though I would not hesitate to come back to Joe's and probably will every time we come back to Vegas.",1,0,0

We arrived a bit early for our reservation. We politely told the gentleman at the desk that we were a few minutes early. He barked at us to go to the bar and have a drink. We walked into the bar area but it was heaving with people eating from bar tables. It seems clear that the tables in the bar were set for diners, not people waiting on a dinner reservation just having drinks. The bar stools were all filled. We asked a passing wait staff if it was all right to sit at one of these tables and her response was equally rude: no these are all reserved, go ask the maitre'd. We then asked someone in a suit where we could get a drink and he barked at us, waved his arm dismissively in a general direction and said ""go ask the bartender"". No one was gracious or helpful. Only rude like they didn't care about customer experience. 

Very off-putting first impression. I guess because they are popular and fully booked they feel they can afford to treat customers with disrespect. And this was before we even got seated!  Every staff interaction was rude.

At this point my husband, who is normally a very mild mannered person, was starting to lose it.  I dragged him outside into the shopping mall where we waited. We discussed not going back in. 

We presented ourselves again at the appointed time of our reservation and were quickly seated in a very pleasant corner booth. Our server asked us, perhaps rhetorically, how we were doing this evening and we were honest with him about our earlier experience. 

While the food was pleasant, and plentiful, it was not extraordinary. We weren't concerned with price so much, we knew from previous visits that the place is expensive.  Our server was experienced, knowledgeable and professional. 

A glass of wine that we ordered was corked. We brought this to the server's attention, he sniffed it, and he agreed. But by the time we got his attention, the meal was over. 

At the end of the meal, after the check was presented and the credit card was taken away, the manager approached the table and said he wanted to hear more about our earlier experience. We are polite people but we were candid. He expressed surprise that we were treated this way.

Usually, at this point, in our experience, management would make some gesture of contrition and compensation. But none was offered. This reinforced our belief that Joe's won't try to make it right and doesn't care if a customer walks away with a negative experience.

The broccolini and mashed potatoes are great and the table next to us had hash browns and seemed really pleased with it (it looked really good).

The main reason why people come to Joe's is the stone crab which is phenomenal when super fresh. When I got my order of stone crab claws last week, they were horrible and not fresh.

Basically it was a plate of 5 stone crab claws that had been frozen and thawed. They were still rather cold, there was no seasoning or special preparation except for a side of their mustard dip, and it purely sucked. SO FREAKIN DISAPPOINTING. Joe's should know better than to offer stone crab when the stone crab is out of season and serve it thawed from the freezer and still charge so much. 0 STARS FOR THE FROZEN STONE CRAB. There's a reason why Joe's Stone Crab in Miami used to shut down for months when stone crab was not in season. I believe the waiter should have at least warned us how much they suck frozen.

Luckily, the rest of the food was decent - the salad with seafood was good and had nice portion of shrimps, crab, and other seafood. However, I would have preferred the dressing to be less creamy and for it to be a lighter salad. The cole slaw was average. The key lime pie was pretty good but not as good the stuff you get from Joe's Miami.

Service was attentive and professional.

I was here last year on a business dinner and came back around for a repeat with a girlfriend from work. The service and food are both wonderful. Obviously, we came for surf n' turf and we both left stuffed and happy (and, for being on the Las Vegas Strip, the prices are the same as you would find at any higher-end steakhouse - nothing on the menu seemed outrageously inflated).

Our charming server (""Steven"" or ""Stephen"", he-of-the-Awesome-Bulgarian-Accent) suggested we start off with the Shrimp de Jonghe appetizer (i.e., a fancy name for scampi): six plump shrimps, basting in a super-garlicky sauce. Delicious. Joe's also provides a very ample basket of mixed breads (soft pretzel, dinner roll + a savory bacon-y ciabatta that my friend LOVED). 

We both ordered surf 'n turf: petit filet mignon (I chose the Alaskan King crab and my friend had lobster). We also split an order of the Hashed Brown potato and the grilled asparagus with Romesco sauce. My steak was a little overcooked in the interior and a little ash-y charred on the outside. However, the crab legs were delicious (and already split down the middle for me), so I flaked and dunked those bad boys in the clarified butter.

The presentation and texture of the Hashed Brown was awesome: a golden brown and crusty mound of fluffy-on-the-inside starchy goodness (but a little lacking in flavor). But the grilled asparagus was absolutely delicious (and I don't really like asparagus that much), and the cherry tomato Romesco sauce was truly the star of the dish (we both loved the delectable tomatoes - sweet, chunky, delicious). The generously-portioned sides could easily be shared between 2-3 people.

We finished off with two desserts (we were both veritable piggies that night): wedges of lemony cream cheese pie with strawberry sauce (my friend's favorite), and fudge pie (my favorite!). They were both about as good as dessert can get.

To reiterate, our server was excellent: he looked like a possible secret agent assassin, had a fabulous accent, provided attentive (but not smothering) service with a flourish (he snapped our photo), and we never felt rushed or like a nuisance (and we lingered over dinner for close to three hours, chatting, sipping and and forking around - hehe). Service nailed a 5-star rating as perfect.",2,0,1

King Crab Legs! Served table side with drawn butter. Yes they are expensive, but absolutely the most amazing thing I have ever eaten. They redefine what crab should taste like and you should not leave here without trying them. I split a caesar salad and an order of the legs with my mom and it was more than enough food.

Remember Stone Crab is about 1 thimble full of meat per claw. Hold that thought.
Steak and\/or lobster is the way we usually roll.
Amazing breads and cornbread.

Service is always excellent and Bobby the bartender is a Legend.

There's something good on the menu for everyone.

Definitely make reservations days in advance if you're trying to go on a weekend otherwise if you're lucky, there's first come first serve seating in the patio area (inside the mall but outside of the restaurant). Our waiter was very cordial as they should be for a restaurant of this scale. Get the grilled jumbo prawns on a sugarcane stick!! It's not on the menu, and if you're adventurous or just plain Asian, make sure you ask to keep the heads after they remove it tableside otherwise they'll take it away and if you love sucking crawfish or shrimp heads, you'll know what I'm talkin' about! The large stone crab claws are worth trying but the price tag is hefty.. Too hefty, but that's what you pay for eating on the Strip especially inside the Forum shops. Their dry aged bone in rib eye definitely hit the spot. I asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. Their Chilean sea bass was also a great choice. Very tender! I didn't get to try the branzino but someone at our table ordered it and they were very disappointed. Overall, this is definitely a date night place or special celebration type of place.

Cons - Stone crabs are almost impossible to eat without getting shells in your mouth. The shell is hard and it could very easily chip a tooth. Also we ordered the lobster which was pretty pricey. That would have been fine except that it was way overcooked.",1,1,1

Not only was the service so friendly and genuinely inviting,  the food was absolutely perfect. We ordered oysters, ribeye, calamari,  creamed spinach,  and a seafood platter. And glass upon glass of wine and drinks ;). Not one complaint.  The ribeye was melt-in-your-mouth tender...literally like butter.  The oysters...omg. If you're as into them as I am you know how important it is for them to be superior quality for them to be impressive...these were.  And we're nowhere near the damn ocean, so this shows how much this restaurant cares about giving you what you pay for. Grilled shrimp...incredibly moist and juicy on the inside for how much beautiful char they accomplished outside. Scallops were divine. Seriously like butter.

A table wasn't going to be available until after 10pm but they had open tables in the bar area which was fine with me. Everyone we came in contact with were very nice. I wanted to try the stone crab and my waitress recommended that I order 1 to try it first just in case I didn't like it. It was ok but I'm not a fan of cold seafood, thankfully I didn't order a full serving. The lamb chops I ordered were delicious and I loved the crab cakes.

Have eaten here 10+ times and always great waiters,service & food.  4 of us went last night and ordered large stone crab. It was not up to the normal unbelievable quality. The manager came over and told us, very nicely, that it was out of season and that was why it was frozen. We sent it back. 10 minutes later he had a platter of cold king crab sent to the table to make up for the problem. 
If you go ask if the crab is in season, if not, get the king crab. Their steaks are great, the sides very large & good, and probably has the best fried chicken on the west coast.  Key lime pie is a must.
Try it, it is one of the top restaurants in Vegas.",0,0,1

I was here with 4 other colleagues of mine. We started off with some drinks and a 15 oyster platter. We got 3 different types of oysters and each one tasted absolutely amazing. Hands down those were by far the freshest, tastiest oysters I have ever had. Adding a hint of lemon juice just had to put it over the top. We had the steak tartare and that was pretty good. 

Up next were 15 medium sized stone crab claws. I saw this on the menu ""Fresh stone crabs are found in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. They are hand-harvested, one claw at a time, and thrown back to the sea."" and had to jump on it. When they came out, we started cracking. The table went silent and then was followed by ""mmms"" and ""ahhhhs"". I was in seafood heaven.

After that, we had the Alaskan king crab legs. We were told by the waitress that these legs are most fresh during these few weeks. Guess what? It was that time of the year.  We had a total of 2 orders and each bite was indescribable. Okay... let me describe it to you. They come pre-cracked. As you pull the flesh off of the shell, you dip the chilled crab meat into a small butter dish. Give it a few seconds for the butter to soak onto the surface of the crab meat. Take a bit and you'll find yourself in seafood heaven yet again. I died and was reincarnated at least 3 times that night. 

The bill came out to around $600 with gratuity included. It was well worth it because one of our managers comped the meal for us! Sometimes you do get lucky in Vegas.",1,0,0

Nicole was the coordinator for the room and she did a great job. She was very helpful and responded to e-mails quickly. She was available for us to test AV equipment and helped us store our 

Joe, server manager, for the night did a great job communicating and provided wonderful service for us.

The service was good as my buddy knew that waiter and he was very good to us. We all shared a few plates of Stone Crab and it was good, but not great. My brothers and I ordered Steak and to say they were all burn't would be an understatement. They weren't too bad inside, but the strong burn't taste on the outside took away from any positive flavor left in the steak. My youngest brother said something at the table, but my buddies wife made it very clear to him that he ""did not know anything and to not embarass her"". We all kept our mouth's shut and choked down the steaks. On a positive note my wife had Dover Sole prepared at the table and it was Fantastic. It's a shame as Joe's likely would have looked after this miscue, but we didn't have the chance to let them know and after we left none of us were inspired to return again on our next trip to Las Vegas.",0,0,0

So far, so good right?  We order a nice white wine since we planned on having seafood and the stone crab appetizer and 1\/2 a dozen oysters.  Stone Crab was nothing special to me.  I prefer king crab in all its butteryness.  Oysters were delicious but there's not much the chef has to do there.  For main entrees, I ordered the Salmon Au poivre and the hubby had the swordfish.  Here's where I found the taste and texture lacking.  Salmon was not that tasty and too lemony.  The Swordfish was too tough.  We order their mashed potatoes on the side and it was ok for me but their grilled corn was amazing.

The cerviche was good on the whale, alaskan crab is pretty good too. I never had stone crab before, and I thought it was just ok. Nothing I had missed out on all these years. For my main course I got the branzino, which is just fried fish and too salty. I thought the filet was thicker, a little disappointed on my end. I also tried a bite of my friend's ribeye, which was way too salty. So glad I didn't order it. The hash brown is also nothing special. If you come here, just the get the alaskan crab or the stone crab. This place would be a 3, but 3.5 for the good service.",0,0,0
