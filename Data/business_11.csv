The building is absolutely stunning. The inside is top notch and plenty of things around that'll catch your eye. The water wall outside is really cool, make sure you snap a picture by it.

The room was very nice. I love that it was so modern. My favorite thing about the room by far has to be the tablet that controls everything in the room. I would myself just finding any reason to do something with it. I also liked the shower\/tub combination in the bathroom. The room was very clean and room service did an excellent job keeping everything tidy. 

The casinos has a lot of games to play. If you're into slots, they have plenty of those. I'm a table game person and it was tons of those around to indulge in. I'm also a sports better and they have one of the best I've been to on the strip. Nice amount of tables and seats to sit at and enjoy all the action. 

I didn't partake into any of the restaurants at the hotel, but from what I could see, there were nice size crowds there. Something must be good at them! 

Check in was a breeze and very quick. Staff was nice, attentive, and did their job extremely well. What more could I ask for. I really enjoyed my stay at the Aria. I will definitely be back and can't wait!",2,0,0

As per usual with casinos i recomend utilizing the valet parking.  It is a long walk from the parking structure to the lobby.  It is not much closer to the elevators.  It is worth the few dollars you will spend tipping to use the valet.

The person working the front desk was friendly and funny.  It was a relatively quick process.

The moment i walked into the room i was very impressed.  as i entered the lights came on, the television turned on and the blinds opened up automatically.  The rooms are of a modern design.  There are a lot of dark wood and stone tones.

The television is a flat screen.  Nearly all of the channels are hi definition.

Everything in the room can be controlled from the television remote control or a touch screen control panel on the night stand.  This is an excellent convenient feature.  When i was ready to go to sleep i just touched the master off button.  All the lights slowly dimmed, the blinds closed, and the television shut off.

The bed is the most comfortable i have ever slept in.  The bed wraps around you almost like a cacoon.  You slowly settle in for a wonderful night of sleep.

The bathrooms look nice and are well appointed.  The combination shower tub area is a nice touch.

I tend to be a hotel snob.  I was expecting a good experience.  Aria topped my expectations.  This is my new favorite casino\/hotel in Las Vegas.  I did not make it to the pool area.  I will save that for my next trip.",4,2,1

He also told us that we would be staying at Aria and the best part of it would be that we'd get a suite all comped!

Left on Friday night at around 8 pm, traffic was light and made it there in under 4 hours including a stop at Mad Greek for a strawberry shake ;-).

If you're like me and don't trust valets with your own car, I had to self park.  Followed my nav and it took me to the main entrance located off Harmon which is only for valet.  Quickly made it back onto the Strip and followed signs further down to the self parking lot.  

Made our way to the front desk (decent location as it wasn't too far away from the parking structure) and up we went to our room.  Found out we were given a Cirrus suite which was over 1,500 sq ft!  Walked in and noticed to your immediate left was the powder room (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=ruYVKA_Lr_qQXNWipwRuPQ).  Straight ahead was the living room (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=1gycZfYq6oA6SfmhLireYA) and (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=JWyxSCLtxCljPd0x3nfsHg).  In the middle of the suite was the dining room and kitchen\/bar (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=P9OKIJBFa9BIb41TY-cjUQ), (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=fl6np9ScKQ5QACXlKni39A), and (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=lL1jgkULaK9fGFq6BpFkyw).  Finally the bedroom (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=xbo_t2EnVMXm30Y0xuWOeQ).  Full sized bathroom and jacuzzi tub (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=SW2xRJ6rQj5Tk757oABuUg) and (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=4L3KZVYIwfGEebChrE-9Tg).  

The suite had 4 tv's more than enough which had tons of channels to choose from.  All of the curtains were automatic and controlled by a switch.  The suite also had 3 zones so that you could control the temperature (living room, dining room, and bedroom).  Overall a very nicely modern decorated room but there were a few things which resulted in some deductions of stars.  For example, the barstools had plastic seats rather than some sort of microsuede (to match the couch and dining room chairs).  A major deduction was because of the bed.  The mattress was not very comfortable (a bit too soft for me) and already showed signs of wear.  The left side was saggy and I literally sank down into it once I laid down.  Roll over to the right and you'll notice that all previous guests slept on the left side.  Kinda disappointing for a hotel that is less than a 2 years old.  Needless to say I woke up with a sore back the next morning.  

3.5 stars for this hotel and will probaly stick with my normal room at the Venetian or Palazzo for my next visit.",1,1,1

My tv remote was useless and took a ton of button presses before it did anything. Someone also decided to completely destroy the remote screen by the bed before my visit.

Long version:

We spent 4 days at the Aria for our honeymoon. We picked Aria thinking it was going to be a luxury experience.

Good:
 - We enjoyed the casino and poker room - good amenities, staff was great. Limits get high at night and on weekends but it's a fairly short walk to cheaper casinos (Monte Carlo, NYNY).
 - The restaurants we tried were pricy but generally tasty (although I would not recommend Lemongrass) - prices didn't seem out of line compared to other Strip restaurants
 - Hotel staff were always pleasant but didn't necessarily provide good service...see below
 - Beds were comfortable

Not So Good:
 The room itself was decent but not amazing:
   -  Water pressure in the shower was not strong
   - The A\/C didn't seem to consistently work - had to set the temperature artificially low to get the room cool. 
   - I also thought the desk chair they provided was pretty uncomfortable.
   - The fact that they charge you $25\/day if you want to actually use your mini fridge for personal storage is lame

 We had multiple issues with front desk and housekeeping:
    - When we checked in, the bathroom was not fully stocked - body lotion and shower cap were missing
    - Aria advertises twice a day housekeeping - however, we left the hotel room around 8-9am with the 'service requested' light on, and 12 hours later the room had not been serviced at all.
    - Our last night, we decided to stay in and watch a movie instead of more gambling. The on-demand service didn't work. The front desk called tech support who called us back very quickly (which was great) -- but he said, ""Oh, we had to put a cable box into your room, on-demand won't work."" We weren't informed of this at check-in. The front desk did switch us to another room very quickly after this, but was a little frustrating. Ironically, housekeeping immediately showed up when we were moving rooms to clean it out (she said ""I heard we need a fast turnover!""), even before somebody had come up to deliver our new room keys.
     - We noticed a few times that the room would spontaneously turn all the lights off and close the curtains. When we called the front desk to ask about the on-demand issue, the front desk said ""Oh, the previous guest probably had a sleep timer on and that's what's doing it."" She was right, and great that she immediately knew what was wrong .. but why wasn't it caught during the room turnover process?

Overall neither my wife or I thought the price point of the hotel matched the room or service we received there. Would totally stay somewhere else nearby and come to the casino though.",0,0,0

I just stayed one night which I got for free from Hotels.com. I read a lot of reviews and it seemed like everyone likes Aria. Some things that I noticed was that I didn't see a lot of kids which I love. You have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel which kind of sucks in my opinion.

I have to say - they were absolutely exquisite! From the beautiful casino floor, helpful staff, great policies and breathtaking suites, I was beyond floored with my visit to this new Vegas establishment. Let me paint a picture for you....

We wanted to get married in a fun place for our quests to take a mini-vacay. The problem with doing this in Vegas (esp on the Strip) is that things get incredibly expensive. A simple dinner meal for a catered party will easily reach $150 per head. Being in the wedding industry for the last 5 years - I decided to do some researching for alternative location spots. 

After researching for weeks, I decided to start looking in to elegant suites in hotels. Upon doing so I uncovered that it is not permitted to bring in your own food or drink to your hotel. A lot of places have extremely hard policies on this. Hotels make a ton of cash on catering. A bowl of chips and salsa would run you $5 at the store - go through hotel catering - easy $75. Ridiculous. We called at least 15 hotels to inquire about their policies. 

As a last resort we researched ARIA. Here I was thinking that we wouldn't be able to swing a luxury suite at this brand new hotel and BAM - they had a suite that was PERFECT for our needs. We had about 65 people at our wedding and wanted to throw a cocktail party afterwards. We confirmed with guest services that we were permitted to bring our own food\/drink 3 different times. Each time, no hassle. We told them we were having a party - no hassle. This suite was RIDICULOUS. Floor to ceiling panoramic views, remote controlled curtains, temperature, sound system, a giant boardroom with 12 chairs and a large table (perfect for buffet style snacking) and 3 separate bar areas for set up. 

We worked out a great deal with a local restaurant and they were able to deliver directly to our suite and set up with no problems at all. The night went off without a hitch. Even the bell hop unloaded our entire SUV filled with decorations, liquor, beer, etc and brought it all up to the room for us. I will absolutely come back to ARIA. 

Do yourself a favor, throw down the $700, and stay in the ""Executive Hospitality Suite"" for at least one evening. The views and the suite itself will take your breath away.",7,1,2

The place doesn't have that old grimy feel that some of the older hotels have, and my allergies didn't pop up from hazes of cigarette smoke, surprisingly. Very modern and upscale place, would love to stay there again. 
I do not like the room fridges where you can't use he space for personal storage, and had to dispute some charges because it automatically registers if you move things in there. Shower pressure was not great but at least the temperature was nice and hot.

We arrived at 6:30am on Sunday 11\/19\/2017 and was greeted with an extremely rude valet attendant named Sharon (an older woman) so I hope she gave me her correct name.

When we arrived, valet was pretty empty probably because of the time of morning. There were only 2 attendants visible and we were unsure where to pull up for valet services. We pulled in front of Sharon and rolled down my window at which point Sharon said very rudely, ""you're leaving right?"" I responded ""no we want to valet park."" Sharon replied, ""he said (pointing to another valet attendant) you said it's too expensive?"" At which point I said, ""incorrect, we want to park"" ""where should we go?""  Sharon then pointed in the direction of where I should park. As I was backing up, she started yelling ""STOOOOP!"" and making a gesture with her hands as to say stop. It was so loud, and her face was filled with rage I thought she was yelling becuase I was about to hit someone, but there was no one around as I said valet was pretty empty. She was just being extremely rude and unprofessional for no reason. When I opened the car door and asked her what she was yelling about, she said ""I said to just stop right there!"" I asked for her name and said I would be reporting the situation. I too work in hospitality and this behavior was unacceptable, especially for the early morning hours, and our very first interaction with the resort.

I got a free room through MyVegas rewards (minus the cost of resort fees) for one night.  Prior to checking in, we decided to drop our bags at the bell desk since we were heading to a day club pool party.  We were intimidated by the long line that had formed outside but the line moved quickly and the bell hops were fast, friendly and efficient! 

Checking in through the self-serve kiosk was fast and we had no issues what so ever.  Our room was pretty far walk from the elevators as it was located at the very end of the tower.  We were shocked that we were upgraded to a tower king suite which had a guest bathroom, an executive conference room and a very spacious living room\/master bedroom! The showers even had a built in sauna! We were blown away at the amenities and the housekeeper who came in the evening to make our room ready for the evening. She had our bed ready for sleeping, placed slippers next to each side of the bed, organized our stuff in the bathroom, etc.  We definitely felt spoiled and enjoyed our luxurious room. 

We called the next morning and extended our checkout time at no cost.  
Tip: Aria will charge if you extend your checkout time past 1pm! 

I really liked the fact that their is an employee who only allows guests with room keys access to the guest elevators.  It makes me feel a little more secure!

Then I waited another 20mins ...no one came so I called front desk again and spoke to Anthony and I was piss off this time and he put me on hold and transfer me to a front desk manager (Lenard), he was nice and apologize for the way how his staff was not giving good service but I said I've waited over an hour now and I cannot sleep and can't leave the room as I've been waiting for their team to show up .  He quickly said he will send someone up right away.  I then waited another 30 mins and still no one show up.
At the end I've waited over 2 hours for security to come up so I can file a statement about a bug on   my bed.
After all that problem that ruin my whole morning, all Aria did was give me $50 credit, I mean how insulting !!! I thought Aria was a nice reputable hotel and would treat guest better than just give you $50 for a bed bug issue.

The day after, I was trying to talk to the front desk manager again (Lenard) and he never return my calls, I left couple of memos with his staff to ask him to give me a call.  He never once return my call at all.

Really bad experience with the service at Aria probably won't stay here again because of the service.",1,0,0

The bathroom was sleek and the counters\/shower walls were all granite-- the shower and bathtub are connected and share the same door.  The toilet was in the same room but had its own door which was nice. 

I would have given Aria 4 stars if they actually gave me the room I wanted.  I made a reservation more than a month before my arrival and I wanted one Non-Smoking room with one King size bed.  But no, I got a Smoking room with 2 queen size beds.  I didn't mind the 2 queens but I don't smoke (and hate the smell), so I didn't appreciate that they didn't have the Non-Smoking room that I had reserved.  

Pros:
- Upgraded\/modern
- Restaurants here are great (Julian Serrano and Jean Phillipes 

Cons:
- On the end of the strip, so you need a cab to go anywhere
- No casino
- Confusing--there are multiple entrances and taxi lines",3,3,2

I received to the city view room on the 56th floor, with the view of strip (well, adjacent buildings).  The room was smartly decorated with the touch panel technology.  However, the bathroom was very small for the room of this size, but the wet\/dry combination of the bathtub\/shower is good example of how they utilize the space well.

The worst part of the room is the bedding.  The sheets were made of cotton but the quality is horrible.  Have been sleeping at other non gaming resorts, I felt like I was sleeping with sandpaper.  It was one of the bad bedding but their AC was quiet and strong, definitely needed for Las Vegas.

I also did not like how their check in lobby is so far from the guest elevators. Its only been couple years since they opened and the lobby smelled smoky already. Yucks.

I'm in a corner suite on the 25th floor which boasts an absolutely gorgeous view of the strip, especially at night. However, the view is only possible because the suite is surrounded on three sides by glass...which is unfortunately very ineffective at blocking noise from outside. I'm writing this review at 3:05 AM as the bass-heavy music from a nearby nightclub threatens to shatter every window in the room. I called the front desk to ask if they knew what the noise was and if so, when I might expect it to stop. The answer was, ""Uhhhh...well it's Wednesday night...could be The Cosmopolitan? Maybe it will stop around 3 or 4?""

Look, I know I'm in ""VEGAS, BABY!!!"" and some noise is to be expected. But I didn't ask for a 24-hour club experience, and I think guests booked on this side of the hotel should be warned that that's what they're getting. Also, guests who have a complaint (even when it's about something over which the staff has no control) should at least be offered an apology or some minor compensation, not just ""Uhhhh..."" Bad form.

Another noise problem: The jets in our bathroom jacuzzi tub came on randomly three times throughout our stay. That was a bit unsettling.

As for the rest of the hotel, it's not terrible - the casino is fun and easy to navigate, there are a number of restaurants offering a variety of food options, the buffet is good, and the housekeeping thus far has been decent (had a couple of dirty-looking drinking glasses when we walked in, but otherwise the room was spotless). Also, I ordered breakfast from room service and was quite impressed with the efficiency of service and overall presentation. The food is lacking in quality for as much as it costs, though - the same is true in the 24-hour cafe downstairs (Cafe Vettro). 

In fact, I think that's a fine summary for my stay here: Lacking in quality for as much as it costs. I won't be staying here again.

(Update: The music finally stopped at 3:30 AM. Sweet, sweet relief.)

(Update #2: We needed a late checkout and were informed we'd have to pay $150 to stay in the room an extra four hours. I explained that I'd spent most of the night awake involuntarily listening to loud, thumping music and was planning to spend that four hours catching up on sleep before flying home. A nice young lady at the front desk named Tahlia got me a late checkout for no extra charge. 

Then when we checked out, an employee named Dana argued that we probably weren't hearing what we thought we were hearing and it couldn't have been that bad because they'd have heard it at the front desk. Again, bad form.)",1,1,0

We stayed in Aria and Palazzo on this trip, so maybe I'm slightly biased because we had a much better experience at Palazzo.

First, there were lines for -everything-...call me spoiled, but when I'm paying for a five-star hotel, I don't expect to have to wait in an airport-style 20-minute line to check in. The same applied for check-out, but it was even longer. Yes, you can do express checkout, but I've had bad experiences being charged for minibar stuff that I didn't actually eat\/use, so I wanted to view my bill\/summary before checking out. Had to wait at least half an hour to check out, and sure enough, there was a charge for chocolate poker chips (or something like that) that we hadn't eaten.

Second, two of the lights in the room were burnt out. Not a huge deal...called it in and someone came to fix it a few hours later. Still, I think I'm allowed to be picky when I'm paying for a five-star hotel.

The glasses on the table weren't the cleanest (I cleaned them before using them). A card they had on the nightstand (it explained that they won't change your towels unless you request it - wtf?) had writing on the back of it from the previous occupant. Not huge deal-breaker-type things, but not things I'd expect of a five-star hotel.

Third, the room was fairly small. It was nice (more on that in a minute), but our view was pretty ugly during the day (a little better at night), and it felt more like a room I'd get in a three-star hotel.

We went to HAZE nightclub, which I'm posting a separate review about. Suffice it to say, also negative.

Now, the good stuff: everything is in a very ""modern"" style, which I'm a big fan of. They have some cool technology (an iPad-type thing that controls everything in the room from temperature to lighting to music), but it's kind of hit-or-miss in whether it works how you'd like it to, and it's pretty laggy (takes like 3-4 seconds to just scroll through to the next available option).

We had to walk through Cosmopolitan several times to get to where we were going on the Strip and it's about a million times nicer than Aria. It's like $50 or $60 a night more expensive for the basic room (and granted we haven't seen the rooms), but next time we'll -definitely- be staying there instead.

Huge room.
Top of the line amenities.
Nice foyer.
Huge  entertaining and  sitting room.
Nicely set up.

Few snack selection on their lounge and it takes forever to fill. Guests wait in line and no plates for breakfast. Had to use napkins :\/

Aside from that, clean and big hotel rooms.  Its got a fridge with a weight sensor so you basically can't use it for yourself.  Bathrooms are nice but we ended up just getting the shower sans bathtub...bummer.

The pools are nice except when you go in the afternoon.  Imagine people with their drinks enjoying the pool so much that they don't want to get out.  This translates to murky waters if you know what I mean.  But this is really something that the hotel can't enforce so you're better off swimming in the morning when there are likely fewer golden streams.

The room was better than average.  I've heard many good things, but it didn't live up to the hype.  I mean, it's a good room, better than average, but not anything to go crazy about.

We read online that the room greets you and the curtains open, presenting the view to you.  It didn't do that for us.  If we were supposed to press something for that to happen, we didn't know - and how would anyone know?

The rooms are automated, so you can turn everything off with just one press of a button.  Instead of those privacy tags that hang on the door nob, there are lights for PRIVACY (red) and SERVICE (green). So the kids can't go out and make a game out of collecting everyone's PRIVACY tags.  You no longer have to open the curtains with your hand and arm, you just need to use your finger on the curtains button.

The beds were comfortable and the room had everything we needed. I didn't really like the set up for the shower and tub.  The shower and the tub are in the same section.  PRO: A husband can take a shower at the same time a wife takes a bath and it can lead to sexy time.  CON: If your roommates are not married to you - you have to use the whole bathroom one at a time...unless you guys are close like that.... The toilet is ""hidden"" by frosted glass.  In my opinion, that's not enough privacy for me.

Our room came with 4 robes. We didn't use them, but that's a nice thing to have - very comfortable. The TV was a pretty good size, but the control was very unresponsive and delayed.  If you're watching porn and a kid walks into the room, there's about a 1-2 second delay after pressing the buttons on the control before the TV actually changes.  This is especially true with the guide.  It's almost impossible to navigate through the guide on TV because it's so frustrating trying to wait that long before the button you pressed actually functions.

The view is beautiful.  They really got it right with the view.  They whole wall was a window.  Our view was the pool.  Luckily, the Miss Universe contestants were there, and our view just got a lot better.  With a window wall, it feels like that whole side of the room is open, and it just looks so beautiful!

The idea of automated rooms is good, but it can go either way.  If you know exactly what to do, it'll make your vacation so much easier.  If you are new to it, you most likely will be pressing the wrong things.  When a couple of our roommates were taking a dump in the toilet when we first got to our room, the lights went out unexpectedly because we didn't know what we're supposed to press.  All you hear is, ""HEY!!!"" - and we knew we accidentally turned off the lights.

For us, we didn't know what to do with the automation so it made life a little more confusing at the time.  But once more people get used to it, it'll be a great thing.

HOTEL\/CASINO
Getting to the Aria can be a little confusing right now.  There is construction going on, so that might have been the main reason.  You have to turn into a secluded-looking area and go pass some cones and once you get there, you think you're at an airport.  It felt like LAX to me.  It was a little confusing - but I'll let that pass for now because there was construction, and maybe after the construction is completed, it'll be all better.

The inside of the hotel and casino is very beautiful.  It's heavy on the art.  I'm a guy who can appreciate nice art.  At the Aria, it's packed with art.  The thing about it is that it's hit or miss.  There are some things that are nice to look at and take pictures of, while there are some that are pointless and look like a waste of space.  But I like the idea of having a lot of art - it really makes the hotel look very... *thinking of the word*... interesting.

One thing that can really kill a beautiful environment, like inside the Aria hotel, is the cigarette smoke from the hotel.  With the Aria, I couldn't smell any cigarette smoke until I was actually in the casino with people smoking.  They do a really good job keeping the smoke and the smoke smell away from the lobby and the non-smoking areas.  Smoking is not allowed in the lobby.  What you smell instead is VANILLA!  There is a strong scent of vanilla floating around, and I'd rather smell that than the cigarette smoke.  Sometimes, the vanilla smell is overwhelming though.

The air conditioning system is cleverly hidden all throughout the whole hotel.  I was walking by the check-in area and felt a cool breeze.  There was a wall just giving off cool air.  Underneath the check-in counter, there was a vent giving  off cool air.  Randomly underneath the planter - cool air.  We made it a game to find the hidden vents - it was cool. *note: DO NOT spend too much time looking for secret AC vents around the hotel... you're in Vegas!

Bottom line: The Aria is a great place to stay, but for me, it didn't live up to all the hype I've heard.  There are better rooms and hotels, but the Aria is worth a stay.",2,2,1

On April 15, 2016 I called the Aria just to make sure they would accept my support dogs. Although I do not legally have to do this, I always do out of courtesy to any hotel I stay at in case they want to put us in a room away from people etc. The lady I spoke to told me I needed to have a ""service card"" with me when I check in. I explained, I do not have a card, but I do have a doctor's note. I travel all across the country with my dogs and have anxiety being without them. She checked with the front desk who again said no I need this card. My response was I can simply go online and order a card right now for each of my dogs for $150 each that has absolutely no meaning to it if that's what it would take. It was suggested I stay at one of their other hotels that accepts animals. 

I completely understand policies regarding animals, but I have stayed at MANY hotels that do not accept dogs. I call every hotel before I stay there to let them know. I am never questioned about it on the phone or when I check in. We have never gotten any complaints from any guests or hotel staff regarding our dogs. They are small dogs (15lbs) each. They go in their crate when I can't take them out with me to restaurants, casino lobby's etc. They are house trained. They do not go to the bathroom inside at all. 

I found it to be quite discriminating that because I need my support dogs with me I cannot stay here. I guess I will never get the opportunity now. Shame on you Aria hotel.",1,0,1

Pool was just OK (3 star) since there wasn't any large lap-pool area.  There's a jacuzzi right next to the buffet windows!  Depending on who's there, it may be a plus or minus.  LOL.  

The buffet was nice but depending on the deal you get, may not be as good as other top buffets.  Nothing stood out, but nothing bad either.

The casino is comfortable enough for gamblers.  Nice decor.  But the layout right around the casino is not so good.  It takes a long time to walk to the strip.

Otherwise, I was very unimpressed with the hotel. It was my first time staying, and the hotel gets a lot of hype so my expectations were high. The hotel physically is nice, in terms of the common areas. The rooms were my biggest point of giving a poor rating though. First of all, upon getting there, the room door was already opened. I called down and the front desk was insistent that nobody else was staying there. The next day, I noticed the front door handle was half hanging off the door; at that point, I didn't want to continue staying in the room. They really should have given an upgrade at that point, but provided me a different room a floor below. So I moved all my stuff and went to the new room. After leaving the room for awhile, I come back to the room, and the room key no longer works. I complained, and a security person came by to open the door, but by that point was just completely over the whole place. The room itself wasn't bad by any means, but for the prices you usually pay and how highly the hotel was rated, the room is pretty small and ceilings are low. The rooms at Palazzo and Wynn (as well as general levels of service) are far superior. Finally, checkout is at 11 AM. I called to ask for a little extra time (an hour at most), and even that was not allowed. Even if in the future another 100 dollar food credit is available, I probably wouldn't come back.",1,0,0

The hotel was very futuristic, great aesthetics inside and out. Great restaurants, definitely a bit pricey. A nice meal at the Blossoms Restaurant for 8 people was about $5,000. 

We stayed at the Aria Sky Suites which has private elevators, so it makes you feel pretty special :) Haha! The 2 Bedroom Penthouse was beautiful, equipped with 2 big bedrooms, 2 nice restrooms, a living room, dining room, and bar. The bathrooms had really neat bathtubs right smack in the middle with a button on the side you push for bubbles, Neat-O! And there's also a remote that looks like a picture frame that sits on the night stand that controls the T.V., Air Conditioning, Lights, The Sheer blinds and Blackout Curtains throughout the entire suite. Pretty advanced stuff :)

There is also a private limousine pickup location that is right next to the Aria Sky suites elevator and private entrance which is quite handy if you'd like to stay low profile. 

The Casino I must say is a different story. The dealers don't seem to be that friendly, almost as machine-like as the technology goes with the hotel amenities. I would definitely recommend going elsewhere to gamble, preferably the Bellagio!

There's also a pretty neat futuristic tram that takes you from the Aria, to the Crystal Shopping Center, and to the Bellagio. It's located right by the Valet pickup location next to the Coffee place. Just be prepared to be in some heat until the tram comes (about every 8 minutes) because the tram entrance is out in the open. Cool thing is that it is free! 

All in all, a great hotel to stay in and be pampered. Bad news is definitely the casino. Club Haze in Aria is pretty awesome too! That's it, Cheers!! :)",4,2,2

However, I'm still shocked that something like this could happen in the first place and how they were reluctant at first to remove the charge.

I'll now go on to review my stay at the hotel. 

First of all, check in line is LONG and looks like a line in Disneyland. Never in my life have I seen a hotel with such a long and slow moving check in line. Fortunately we went to the ""invited guests"" desk where there was no line, but they informed us our rooms were NOT even ready. It was 2pm. What the hell?? They said wait would be at least 3 hours. This was absolutely ridiculous because it's not like they weren't expecting us. I've never had to wait to enter my hotel room. MAJOR red flag.

After eating at the awful pastry cafe in the Aria casino to kill some time (we were starving as well) we decided to gamble a little bit. The machines are nothing special and the casino is pretty small. 

Finally, after about two hours we were notified our room was ready. We had a room on the 26th floor. There are 3 elevator sections you may enter to get to your designated hotel room and the set up must have been created by someone who did not pass high school. The FIRST elevator section is for 1-15 (something like that) the SECOND is for 40-49, and the LAST is 16-39. It doesn't make sense?? Why are the numbers out of order??

When we got to our room, i thought it was a pretty standard room for a 5 star. Beds were big, bathroom was nice, and we had a great view of the strip. Disappointed that they no longer provide slippers though! 

Also, the one thing that I truly was annoyed about was the TV!!! The remote would NOT work unless you nearly walked up to the tv. My relatives in other rooms also had this exact same problem so it wasn't like my tv was faulty. They need to update their systems. 

The gym was very nice and they provide you with towel service, cucumber water, and there are also lockers for you at the front desk. They charge you automatically $25 everyday for the gym whether you go or not (yeah, I know..) so you better make it worth your while!

All in all, the Aria could have been a lot better than it was. I don't think it's deserving of a 5 star hotel title and I'd rather stay at somewhere a little pricier for better service and amenities.",3,0,0

Long lines for food, one (1!!!) valet guy, no inexpensive food options (18 dollar sandwiches), and no blackjack tables for less than $50.00.  I get it if Aria is going for the Four Seasons crowd, maybe trying to out-wynn The Wynn, but when the casino flaunts every table has a minimum of 50 dollars (meanwhile some are empty), their own ARIA-only, not M-Life Only, but ARIA-only rules on touching cards for certain games, well then they aren't trying to be fun.  No free drinks in the SPORTS BOOK....WTF?!?!  They are trying to be obnoxious.  Maybe I should have figured it out when the two largest signs as you drive that street are for LV and Gucci.  Bellagio is fun, MGM a blast, even 'slumming it' at the Monte Carlo seems like more fun.  This isn't.  I think the new-ness is what pulls people in.  

I was there during super bowl weekend (Seahawks\/Broncos).  Decorated very well.  Rooms are great.  Very comfortable.  EXCELLENT BED, fantastic shower.  Great decorations, waterfall walls, clean carpets, ipad-like room controls...but that isn't enough.  That isn't NEARLY enough.

There's no where to eat outside (on those rare pleasant Las Vegas mornings that you really should try to take advantage of). The pool has limited hours, and you're not allowed to bring outside food or drink out there anyway. It's downright tacky the lengths that the hotel will go to to prevent you from bringing in outside food (including the staffer interrogating the family with a newborn about whether they were trying to sneak in baby food).

Aria looks breathtaking structurally from the outside as you drive in from the strip and into the City Center. The little fountains of dancing water and the lights showcasing them, as well as the buildings of the resort also. Very modern and right in line with all the new hotels in Vegas.

But the one thing I noticed when I first walked in here the first few months they were open and on recent trips since is that it's dark in this hotel. I mean, I felt like my eyes were deceiving me but the dim lighting on the casino floor and surrounding areas did not leave a good impression on me. I'll never forget it cause I was thinking that and remarked to my friends in amazement how a brand new (at the time) hotel & casino that was the epicenter of the City Center (also brand new at the time) could be so poorly lit?!? Not good... And also there are a lot of ""dead"" zones and corners that are just wasted space within the casino floor and the 24 hour restaurant\/cafe towards the back of the property. 

And I cant go without reviewing the valet. Valet lane is a bit confusing and hard to spot at first with their signs being so small. By the time you realize you've mistakenly taken the thru-traffic or taxi lane, it's too late and you gotta go all the way around to finally valet your car. Valet pickup is a decent setup with a nice air-conditioned room for you to wait in with magazines & vending machines. Not sure how long they expect you to wait for your car but that was an interesting touch. I thought the placement of the valet being all the way towards the front end of the Aria property was too long of a walk. You actually leave the casino through 2 sets of double doors before you reach the valet station to drop off your ticket. I might be hypercritical but ease & convenience of valet dictates where I like to stay in Vegas sometimes... That and a well-lit casino & resort.",4,0,0

First impression:

The fountain outside is pretty cool and the casino smells good when you walk in. Many casinos have that nasty smoke smell, but the Aria does not. This was a major plus since I hate the smell of smoke.  

Check in:

Although quick and efficient, the front desk host was lacking in social skills needed for hospitality. I've worked for years in the business and I know when someone can be more helpful and chooses not to be. There wasn't a line and the host could have chosen to be friendlier and more informative. Instead, he didn't engage in conversation and seemed reluctant to give us the room we had reserved. 

The Room:

I liked the remote that allowed us to control the TV, Radio, Lights and curtains. The room was a nice size, but not the biggest I've seen in Vegas. There are buttons that control the lighting on the sides of the bed. One says sleep and that turns off everything in the room. My friend decided to take a nap while I was in the shower and it turned off the lights in the bathroom. I was a little tipsy and it scared the ish out of me. 

The Scam Artist:

On the first night the guys in the group decided to go to a strip club. A bellman in the lobby told them that he could get them a free limo ride and comp access to the Hustler if they gave him a sizeable tip. They paid the guy and hopped into the limo. When they got to the club, the limo guy asked for his fee. The guys had been told it would be a free ride, but paid him anyway. When they got to the door and asked about their comp access, the security at the club said that they had no affiliation with anyone at the Aria Hotel. 

So my overall impression of the Aria is that it could have been much better. Customer service wasn't what it should have been at such a nice hotel and nothing about the room really wowed me. I wouldn't stay here again and for that reason, I can't recommend it to anyone else.",7,2,3

I'm not a complainer but I'll just say that we got unlucky (that's all).

Although we encountered a few rude\/un-friendly staff members, I would like to make a shoutout to Kathleen at the Front Desk when we checked in. She was absolutely amazing and patient with all of my questions. Kudos!

You could open and close the curtains eith your tv and set your alarm that way as well as turn on\/off all the lights.  Here are some downfalls: no cheap eats anywhere in it, check in\/out took quite a bit of time, maid service did not come everyday.  We got a good rate on rooms so it was well worth it.",0,0,0

The room was big enough for two or more people. I had the room to myself but did have friends over, and it was not crowded. This room definitely made me want to lay down and enjoy the room itself. The restroom was great, very spacious. The toilet had its own little door for privacy. The shower was small but there was a bath tub. Did not use the tub, so no comment there. The casino itself was big and well kept. There is a bakery place downstairs, with delicious crepes. Be ware, the morning lines are long. Plan ahead. Will stay here when i do come back.

If you have stripper friends, have spent time in strip clubs, or are a stripper yourself, you know what I mean.  That lotion that strippers wear that makes them smell delicious?  That's what the Aria smells like.  Which is great because otherwise it'd smell like an ashtray's ass.  

My company had a conference here right around the time that the Consumer Electronics show was happening, but apparently we were lucky enough to score some rooms.   Since I barely had time to see my feet, never mind the casino, I'll try to gauge what my perceptions were:

The good:
*Sir Mix-a-Lot sighting
*Totally electronic rooms- which confused my mother but was awesome for me.  I like a button that opens and closes the drapes and adjusts the temperature, rather than having to hunt for the drape-close thingy or thermostat. 
*Neat shower\/tub combo.  Alas, I was not able to take naughty advantage of it.
*The aforementioned stripper smell since it doesn't smell like an ashtray's ass.
*The staff at check-in.  Granted, I got VIP treatment, but they were pretty darn awesome and super envious of my Kate Spade bag (sample sale, natch). 
*A relatively easy to navigate casino floor.  After years of working in a casino, I understand how easy it is to get lost.  This place clearly is confusing, but not as bad as some.  

The bad:
*The fact that there are not enough Ghostbusters slot machines.
*The sheer size of getting from the guest rooms to the convention area.  It's roughly 8 miles.  I hear Eminem playing in my head.  
*The service at the hotel bar with the trees in it.  Waitress second day + busy time of day = disaster and exceptionally long wait times.
*The fact that I realized I am too old to dress like a cheap hooker and stay out until 5 a.m. 

That being said, I do love how modern this hotel is...as long as I'm not paying for it.",6,18,8

One minor complaint though: when I entered the room, the last customers' empty water bottle and half-eaten salsa was still there. I didn't want to eat any of it, but it gave a dent in the otherwise very good impression. It wasn't until my second or third day that they fully stocked my refrigerator and water\/chocolate\/etc. Also, I really wish they gave me a full refrigerator rather than a stocked one.

Put bluntly, this is the nicest hotel I've stayed at in my entire life. The entire hotel appears to be upgraded to 2011 technology.  The rooms are amazing with your environment fully controlled by a computerized system. Everything from the lights to the curtains to checkout  (receipt will be emailed to you)) can be done with a remote control through your massive flat screen TV. Even if you need to check out in the lobby, there are employees walking around with iPads who will take you out of line and expedite the process. 

The bathroom has by far the nicest shower I've ever experienced in a hotel. Only in a luxury apartment in Tokyo have I used something in the same league. It's HUGE with a separate tub and shower-head and beautifully designed. My only complaint is that the water pressure could have been better. I know Vegas has water issues so I don't blame them for toning it down.

The hotel has many restaurant options spanning all types of cuisines and budgets. The seminar I attended provided most of the meals, but I did dine casually at the sports bar one night and enjoyed it. The casino is also very well ventilated and the smoking never really bothered me (I am someone extremely sensitive to smoke).

If it wasn't for the Yelp Spring Break deal, I don't think I would have stayed here for around $400 a night on Friday and $600 on Saturday night.  I got a deal to stay from Thursday night to Saturday night for $177 a night, which is a steal in my opinion. 

Now with so many things to say, I'll list in bullet:

Service:
- bell service: top notch!
- valet: fast, convenient, and parks your car inside not outside
- check-in: WAITED 30 MINUTES TO CHECK IN with only 5 people in the line, a line that was invisible 
- check-in: did not even remind me that I have $50.00 to use inside the hotel!  If it wasn't the fact I REMEMBERED the afternoon before I checked out, I wouldn't have use it!           
- check-in: the manager that was standing in the back was playing with her hair the whole time while I was checking in (and had a shit face too)
- check-in: very accommodating!  Won't give me highest floor, won't give me room with city view or anything
-  house maid: super nice, accommodating and makes the room super clean

Room:
- lights were wayyyyy to dark 
- new, so of course is nice
- original price you have to pay for the hotel, NOT WORTH THE MONEY
- very techy, but with such a techy room, no ipod dock.... WTF

I booked my hotel\/flight for 3 nights through Southwest Vacations all for ~$500. But shortly after, reading some reviews got me a bit worried. Here are some things I would like to clarify after reading some reviews.

1) Resort Fee - YES. Unfortunately this a trend in Las Vegas. Aria is certainly not the only hotel to have this and unfortunately it is one of the higher resort fees. It gives you access to the Gym, Free internet throughout the ENTIRE casino, some random other things - it does NOT give you access to the spa (my one major let down). The spa facility charges $30 just for entrance.

2) Housekeeping - COMES EVERYDAY. I'm not sure who's review it was that I read but they complained about not getting their room serviced... uhm.. definitely not true. Perhaps they forgot they had their ""privacy"" light on. The control panel by the front door has a button for ""Lights"" ""Privacy"" and ""Service."" They did such a great job cleaning my crap everyday. No complaints from me.

Now onto some of my observations\/experiences.

- Rooms: SO SPACIOUS! Got a large king bed that was ubbber comfy. I slept so well every night. I loved that there was a button next to the bed labeled ""Good Night"" and it would 1) turn off all the lights in the room 2) electronically pull the sheer and solid curtain. In the morning, I heard the solid curtain open up. It was a great way to wake up - I didn't have the sun blaring into my eyes but I could still see the daylight. LOVED it.

- Bathroom: I really loved the bathroom. Nice big tub (big enough for 2) with a nice shower. Great temperature control and pressure. 

- Bathrobes: LIKE A DREAM. Okay I admit.. I pretty much changed out of my regular clothes as soon as I got in to the room just so that I could put on the robe. Yes.. that comfortable.

- In room service: Okay.. food was so-so... err.. okay so-so may be actually generous. I ordered probably the most bland quesadilla in my life. 

- Rest of the hotel: I really liked having different elevators for different floors. I was on the 25th floor. There were 4 elevators dedicated for just the 25-30th floors. I never waited long. The elevators were amazingly fast and quiet. Pools looked awesome - didn't actually go into them but there were so many different ones.

**TIP**: expect to pay MORE $$ for any taxi ride going TO aria\/cosmopolitan - the road that leads to their front goes through some weird back route and unfortunately that tacks on maybe $4 -5 bucks. If you are coming FROM the airport, take the shuttle that is $6\/person one way. The taxi ride will be ~$20. On the other hand, if you are GOING to the airport, its a quick ride ~$12.00.",12,0,1

This was my first visit to Vegas and I was excited to stay at an upper scale hotel. The room was nice however it was a little rougher than I expected. You could see the wear and tear in the halls and room. People can definitely be rough on things, especially when it is not their own. 

But that is not why I only rate it an Average. Upon waking up the first morning of my stay, I noticed that there was a sticky pad stuck to me. It was not mine. Obviously I was more than disgusted. I alerted management right away and although they were sorry for the situation, they did not do anything but apologize. They said they would change the sheets that evening, but when I arrived back to the room I noticed the same wear and tear on these sheets. I again alerted them to the problem and finally my last night there, I presume they changed the sheets ... I am guessing they did but the sheets did have a lot of wear on them. They did provide turn down service and left some a couple chocolates the final night.

I was surprised that they did not comp my first evening or offer some type of customer service compensation for my obvious disgust of knowing that their sheets were not cleaned and I had slept in them that way. Perhaps it is because I am not a gambler and was only there for a conference. I will say that I did receive messages from their assistant front desk manager but besides an apology, that is where it ended. Perhaps I should have been more assertive for asking for more than clean sheets.

Although I hope to return to Vegas one day to show my husband the town or perhaps attend another conference in the area, I do not know if I will spend my money at the Aria.

Uh no, I'm calling at 1 am so someone can come at 4 am.  YES COME NOW.

She said someone would be there in 30 minutes, so we went downstairs and came back up at 2 am to a still dirty room.  Only when I called them a 2nd time did they send someone.  We weren't able to sleep until 3:30 am that night thanks to the busy hotel staff.

The monorail connecting it to Montecarlo on one side and Bellagio on the other side is very helpful to move quickly.

Rooms are huge, clean and comfortable and have probably the best pillows ever. The tablet used to control everything in the room is kind of nice although it makes a difference only if you are extremely lazy.

The services are quite on the high end side so you don't get many cheap choices and most restaurants are just plain expensive.

The queue at check-in was long but moved pretty fast, but you might want to try and avoid the busiest hours of the day although in high season you get queues all day long.

The concierge service was simply amazing and the girl at the desk (unluckily I forgot her name) helped me a big deal with a little plan I had to propose to my girlfriend, fullfilling all my last minute requests.

The casino area feels a little bit anonymous, but being not a themed hotel it just fits the whole atmosphere. The pool area is very nice and very relaxing and in the morning it was not packed at all even in summer.

Make sure you don't miss the Jean Philippe Patisserie as it's a lovely place for breakfast or a snack in the afternoon.

We flew in and got to the hotel at 3PM.  They checked us into a room and when we got there, it was still being cleaned!  I went back down to tell them to reassign us and there was not one apology for the mistake that they made.  They checked other 2 bedroom suites and it turned out that there was only one smoking suite available at that time and all of the other ones were being serviced.  I never stay in smoking rooms so that was obviously not an option.  They supposedly couldn't do anything for us ie put us in another comparable or better room so the only choice was to wait around.  They told us to go eat with a $100 credit towards food or beverages in the casino.  Once our room was done, we were checked in.  When we got there, everything was clean and in order.  Great quality decor.  We found that the TVs in the bathrooms didn't work which was annoying because we usually have the TV running while getting ready.

In it, I recounted the comedy of errors which led to my giving a 2 star review. In return, the hotel contacted me and offered an upgrade to a Corner Suite should I ever decide to stay there again. The opportunity arose on a recent trip to Vegas so I contacted them about the upgrade.

Very shortly, I got an email from my ""personal concierge"" who would be happy to assist with anything I needed during my stay. Unfortunately my ""personal concierge"" wasn't actually scheduled to work at any time while I was there.

The day before arrival I got an email from the resort stating that I could check-in online and they would email me when my room was ready. I input all of the information and awaited the email. When it hadn't arrived at check-in time, I went to the hidden Tower Suites Lounge to see what the hold up was. The young lady behind the counter explained that my room was not yet ready, but she'd be happy to check me in. I told her that I'd already done the mobile check-in, and all of the info should be there. It wasn't so I got to check-in again.

As I'm going through this, the woman to my left was speaking to a clerk checking her into her Corner Suite. He very kindly informed her that she could keep her original room or he could move her to a higher floor for a better view. She was now being offered her choice of two rooms... but my similar room was not yet ready.

Eventually the clerk re-checking me in finished the process and then called to check on the room status. Turns out it was all a mistake, my room was indeed ready but no one had updated it in the system. The indifference to the mistake and the general attitude was ridiculous.

On getting to the room I looked around to be sure things were in order. I also turned on the ""privacy"" light as I don't feel the need for housekeeping over a 2 night stay. For the most part everything was fine, except for the tablet controller in the bedroom which was not working. I called down to the desk and they said they would send someone up to take care of it right away. No one ever came. I didn't care if I could turn on a light using the tablet and let it go.

For the record, if you like a firm mattress the bed is very nice. The rest of the furniture is horribly uncomfortable, as though someone had covered a wooden box with slight padding and designer fabric.

The message light on the phone came on. It turns out housekeeping had tried to deliver an ""amenity"". I was told this was standard for suites and was likely ""chocolate or chocolate covered strawberries"". Further they said they could ""bring it right up"". Since I was going to be there for a bit, I said sure. It never arrived.

The next morning, I got up and went for a walk. When I came back I finished a shower and was in the process of brushing my teeth when housekeeping came into the room to find me stark naked. My response to this was less than delicate. Somehow the ""privacy"" light had been turned off and the ""service"" light was lit. I didn't do it, and the only other person in the room had been the housekeeper that had barged in on me.

I'd had enough. I called down to the concierge desk. The young lady who answered was quite empathetic and swore that she would have a manager and a housekeeping supervisor contact me as soon as possible. If you've read this far, you won't be surprised to find out that no contact was ever made. She also said that she'd make sure the amenity was delivered. I pointed out that I wanted them to knock and not just let themselves in. A half hour later, I turn around to find a man standing inside my door offering me a bag of amenities. Communication is not their strong suit.

The amenities as it happens were a bag filled with the old Aria grooming products which had become obsolete when they changed the packaging.

I finally went down to the Tower Suites Lounge and had a long discussion with the shift manager. She was apologetic, sympathetic, and was kind enough to wave the resort fees for my stay. She also told me that the person on shift before her has left a note stating that she'd called me on my cell. There is no evidence that this occurred. Before we parted, she said she would follow up on the ordeal when she returned the next day. And, to her credit, she did reach out to me to apologize further. Nice to know someone at the Aria values their guests.

At checkout I asked for a print out of my invoice so that I could ensure it had a zero balance due. What I got was a waste of a piece of paper that had the Aria logo, my name, address, room number, arrival and departure dates, and nothing else. I again asked for something showing a zero balance. She decided this was the right time to get snippy with me and said ""I can't just type it in that you have a zero balance, sir."" as she handed me the useless paper... ""Would you like me to email you a copy?"" The perfect idiotic ending to a perfectly horrific stay.

Stayed there this last weekend (March 8-10, room 19-231) and was very disappointed with the experience this time around compared to my stay there at this time last year.  Boy, where to begin?...

First, one of the novelties of the Aria is the fact that, upon entering your room for the first time, the lights come on, the motorized draperies open, your TV comes on to welcome you, etc.  My room?  None of that happened.  I had to fumble to find the light switches and, once I did, was able to get the drapes open finally.  I was surprised to see a couple rungs of the draperies hanging loose.  What housekeeper sees that and deems it acceptable???  Tried to turn on the desk lamp but it was broken.  The edges of the wood desks had the finish worn off as well -- something a little furniture polish or even a magic marker could fix in an instant.  Surprising that the hotel pays no attention to detail like that.  I felt like I was in a cheap motel this time.  For that price you expect superiority, not mediocrity.   Oh -- and I had specifically sent a request ahead of time, a request they acknowledged via email, to be put in a room on a higher floor.  They stuck me on the 19th, while most of my co-workers were given rooms on the 35th floor.  Funny, considering that they were right behind me in line at check-in, yet the associate who helped ME said there were no rooms higher than the 19th floor.

So I finally get settled and begin to relax when all of a sudden a VERY loud party starts up in the room next to mine.  There must've been 20 people in the room, early 20's, and obviously very intoxicated.  I eventually caved and called security.  Some guy eventually showed up, but it didn't make much difference.  I finally had to leave my room as I couldn't even hear my TV over the noise.  When I came back an hour later all was quiet, but only because they had gone out.  It started up again upon their return at about 3:30 AM.

After spending all day at the NASCAR races the next day (tired as heck due to lack of sleep thanks to the party) I returned at around 5:00 PM to find that my room had not been serviced and, from the looks of it, housekeeping was gone for the day.  I went down to the concierge desk and let them know, then headed out to dinner.  When I came back it was obvious they had been there.  However, they must've done a rush job because my dirty drinking glasses were still where they had been left, my used & wet towel & wash cloth were still in the shower, and the amenities had not been replaced.  Consequently I had to shower the next morning with no shampoo.

On my final night there, I was jarred awake at around 3:00 AM, again from the room next door.  Great, I thought, the party gang is back.  Strangely, however, there was no talking or yelling like before.  As I stepped into the hall to see what all the clanking of glass bottles was, I discovered it was HOUSEKEEPING.  Who the heck cleans rooms at 3:00 AM, waking up everyone at that end of the hallway?  When the lady stepped out to dump yet another bag of cans & bottles in the hallway, I said, ""Really? Cleaning a room that noisily at 3:00 AM?""  She just looked at me and said, ""yeah, and?"".  Gee, pardon me for wanting to have a satisfying stay without a 2nd night of loud noise to keep me from sleeping.

So in conclusion, I was deeply disappointed with this stay.  It seemed obvious that the hotel doesn't take as much pride in being special anymore.  Time to look elsewhere next time I'm in Vegas.",1,1,0

All of these features makes you never want to leave. Aria also has a great location on the strip as it is located in the heart of city center which is at the heart of the strip. It's easy to walk to anything and everything you could possibly need. We used the mobile checkin feature which we loved as we were notified when our room was ready and got to skip the long checkin lines. In addition we also used the mobile check out feature which we thought was uber convenient. However that's where all the nice things ended. Upon using mobile checkout we were told that a finalized bill\/folio would be emailed to us which it never was. We called a day or two after our check out to ask them to send us a bill the lady on the phone confirmed our email address and said it would be sent over right away. Again we received no bill\/folio. We called again a day or two later and asked if we could get our bill we spoke to someone named Walter and again he confirmed our email address and said he would call the front desk to have them email it right over he said he would need to put us on hold. We told him fine. He then just simply hung up on us and still no bill was sent. At this point we were absolutely frustrated as it seemed that the Aria was trying to hide something from us. We called back as Walter had not called us back after hanging up on us, and much to our surprise Walter answered. This time we told him that we still had not received a bill and he said that they closed in 20 minutes and that he would just transfer us to the front desk so that we could try and deal with this issue with someone else. Once we were put through to the front desk the lady on the phone said she would send us the bill and we received it almost instantly which leads me to believe everyone else simply ignored our requests. Upon seeing the bill we noticed that they had opted not to apply our $100 dining credit luckily we were still on the phone and she said she would fix it immediately and that she would take off one night in resort fees, and she would send our correct bill to us. We thanked her and hung up. Upon receiving the next bill we noticed it was still not correct and that the resort fees of one night were not taken off as promised we had to call back once again. It should never be this difficult to A. Get a bill in general and B. Get a correct bill. All in all I strongly suggest staying here but I also suggest you take a careful look at your bill and ensure that you receive a bill. Again our stay here was fabulous and would rate it five stars but from checkout to present was awful and we were made to feel that they didn't care about us because we were no longer at the hotel.",0,0,0

Some stains on the white sheets, the ""strip view"" was of the roof, and the blackout curtains didn't black out much...ended up buying their sleeping mask package to try and get rest during the day, but it was horribly uncomfortable. The shower\/tub area was cool, but the floor is extremely slick, and the shower head spray was pretty uncomfortable...Not too much that I would usually complain about, though. The worst of it began when we ordered room service late one night. Had Caesar salad that tasted like it was from a gas station, ridiculously overpriced (like $18?), and a ham sandwich that I could have gotten at Denny's...$25. The total bill was $90...for 2 sandwiches, a soup and a salad...When I called to let them know how bad it was, they did not care...did not offer to take anything off the bill...the following day we went to a $400 dinner for my boyfriends birthday...we brought home leftovers and contacted the front desk to see if they could be saved and reheated later, and they said of course, brought us a mini fridge (since they didn't have one in the room that we could use). We saved our dinner for later, since we knew we'd be hungry and the room service was so terrible. When we called to request it be reheated, they told us they could not accommodate us. We would have eaten it the night before when it was still warm if we'd known, instead we threw away about $150 of food. They ended up giving us a $40 food credit to use at the hotel. On top of this, I had requested some kind of ""romance"" package for my boyfriends birthday, (flowers, chocolate, whatever.) They told me they could do rose petals, chocolate strawberries and champagne with some balloons. Cost $200 for shit champagne and some rose petals. The strawberries were decent. Overall the experience was very disappointing...I WILL say that we decided to try breakfast the morning we left, since we had the food credit, and it was great-the woman who brought it was extremely pleasant and the food was delicious, although still extremely overpriced.

The stay was extremely comfortable, it was probably one of the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed on, and the room was surprisingly quiet for only being on the 3rd floor.   

I'm not sure why, but it seems everything in Vegas is not made to be efficient...as the the walk from the self park to the hotel area, probably takes a solid 10 mins walk...and then the walk from just your room to the elevator had to be well over 5 mins. 

The location is great, right in the middle of the strip, and if you're into high-end shopping, you dont have to wander too far from the hotel. Downside is they tack on a high resort fee to your nightly stay.",0,0,0

But with that out of the way here are my thoughts.
Check in was efficient when we got to the desk--but both people in front of us asked really involved questions (next time buddy save your bell desk questions for the bell desk).  So check in took about 20 minutes but most of it was because of bad luck of standing in the wrong line.  When we turned around to leave the 4-5 open lines had grown from 4 people in each to over 8 in each so we timed that well.
The room is nice.  Never staying there before we didn't know if the 19th floor was good or not but at check in the woman made it sound nice and said it had ""a mountain view"".  That's kind of silly to say because it was actually a view of Vdara and other construction still taking place with just a hint of mountain in the back.  I understand ""mountain view"" sounds preferable to ""construction view"" but let's call a spade a spade.  Anyway, other than that the room lived up to it's billing on the web.  Nice colors, efficient use of space.  Nothing outrageous but nice--especially the comfortable bed and it was quiet (until the construction started early in the morning but again we knew that going in that it was a new place).  It was cool when you walked into the room and everything lit up from the automated systems.  We thought the remote control unit was fairly easy to use as well.  And again it was nice to have so many features at your fingertips.  One of the TV stations shows flight info at McCarran which was nice to not have to look up on our pda\/computers.  Speaking of which--they charge $15\/day for internet access which seems a little cheesy.  Just about anywhere else first class we travel that's an amenity and not an expense.  Cheap.
It was nice in the mornings to not walk have to walk too far to find coffee and pastries.  The Jean Philippe pastry shop is great.  The brioche was amazing and the coffee good and again it was conveniently located just off the elevators to quickly grab something and head back upstairs.
The casino is nice--subdued colors and spacious.  It wasn't crowded during the day but the evenings were fuller.  There was a convention going on (broadcasters) which had swelled the numbers some they said.  Speaking of they--every employee and dealer we had contact with was very pleasant.  I can't recall a place where every person was pleasant.
Crystal--the shopping mall--is definitely a work in progress. Nice attention to detail in the building of it though and hopefully it will take off.  You walk through sections of it to get to the tram which takes you to Bellagio or Monte Carlo.  We also walked from the hotel to the strip and it was no problem at all--no further than walking from Caesars to the strip for example.  But there's lots of construction going on so you're walking under cover for some of it.  But it's an easy walk to Bellagio for sure.
All and all a fine stay and we'll be back.  But it seems like Bellagio and Mirage have a more solid feel than this place but again it's early.  Give it a try!!",1,0,0

I really looked forward being in this new resort. Well, Aria was the bad experience in Vegas hotels rated 5+ resort. Where should I begin? Well, the check in was a mess, we waited too long and finally when we manage to do so we needed to take a long way to get to the room (nobody thought it would be smarter to pot 2 elevators near each side?!? The total walk from elevator to our room is about 5 minutes, in hotels it's alot!). Anyhow, the room was dirty ( I upload the bathroom floor), and not well kept ( the spot lights in the shower was out!). Besides that, the hotel is new but yet you can see it's age far more beyond, that was a surprise to me. When we wanted to do room charge in restaurants we were blocked for some reason so we went twice to the front desk to ask to cancel this block, each time the representative said we are fine and we have a credit to make room charge. So include the guy from check in we were pretty upset that 3 different representative could not understand why we cant do room charge , at the end they fixed it. Moreover, this hotel is a huge place, no design, just big empty space with full of noise and to strong smell of vanilla ... Not delicate. The restaurants we tried was not top notch, very average but charge like gourmet.. So when we understood that we went to eat at the Wynn resort . At the Wynn we found some of the best restaurants in Vegas ( tapas- al cava, American and casual but taste fantastic- social cafe, wine and steaks- Sinatra.. And the list goes on ...). Last but not list, the spa!! Who is the idiot designer who decided to built the spa connected to the main pool of the resort, where the music is deafening with techno - house- music? ?? This is such a fetal decision that ruin my spa time. Imagine sitting in the spa jaccuzi,   trying to relax but all you can hear is loud basses and house music...!! Beside that, they use tones of chlorine there ( I got a rash all over my legs from 5 min in the jacuuzi), the robes are old, and nothing there was relaxing... They charged 30$ for spa, but they won't let you see the spa unless you pay first. Stupid trick!   So, to summarize that: don't use the spa facility, if you want a good spa go to four season or encore (Wynn). Well, this hotel is screaming for good management that will take care of the UI ( user interface) or in other words, to be responsible to the whole experience throw the client eyes. If I need to compare that hotel to the cellphone world, aria is like old nokia from the 2000, compare to the Wynn experience which more resemble to iphone5 ;)",0,0,0

I think that the hotel is energy efficient because the shower water pressure could not be adjusted and the shower only got moderately hot, no other adjusting.  
The water wall in the front was mesmerizing and impressive.
The entire hotel casino and lobby smell strongly of vanilla cupcakes at all times, they must pump that smell through the air vents to cover up the smell of smoke.  If you have a sensitivity to smells, this would not be the place for you.
The City Center is a nice shopping mall that consists solely of high-end stores.  If you're looking for high-end shopping, you'll love it here.

* I found the design visually pleasing.  It lacks the cheesiness that's so common on Las Vegas Boulevard.  (Aside: The two nearby unopened towers are stunning.)

* Competence (which was all over the place) aside, the staff seems to be composed of generally nice people.

Bad:

* Our reservation for two beds turned into one bed and... a cot.  (It was a very uncomfortable cot.)  I understood this to be a common occurrence after talking with some other guests.  Apparently the joint has 4000 or so rooms and only a few hundred with two beds.  Watch out!

* I could barely see out of our west-facing windows.  I'd guess that, yes, there has been some recent construction in the area.  Still, basic blocking and tackling for a hotel should include clean windows, right?

* Minor complaint #1: The drain didn't work in our shower.  It had to be fixed.

* Minor complaint #2: It took ""security"" an eternity to retrieve something from our room.  I could have run to Hoover Dam and back in that time.

1. Check in - Awesome, friendly, helpful and informative
2. Housekeeping - Awesome and super friendly, they seemed to be happy you were there
3. Pool staff - decent service, speedy but our girl didn't come by a lot
4. Liquid - tons of fun
5. Alibi - good service but some of the security was an ass
6.  Pit boss - completely rude, asshole, didn't care about anyone gaming, shut down a full table and told everyone to go to a different one where the limit was 4x higher
7. Jean George - awesome, tasty and great service
8. Aria Cafe - quick and easy and tasty
9. Buffet - worth the money and good service from the wait stuff but the cook at the Pho station wasn't please t
10. Check out - probably the biggest piece of garbage lady ever and they weren't even busy... 
11. Jewel - nice club, good setup and super friendly hosts
12. Casino host - very nice, helpful and accommodating 
13. Tom English pub - very tasty awesome Bloody Mary!
14. Dealers - no one was engaging at the tables except for 1 lady at craps... Maybe the BJ dealers didn't speak English 

So in summary they do have some decent restaurants and it seems like some people really care that you are there and others don't give a flying shit about you.  If you care about gambling, pick somewhere else that will make it fun.  If u can avoid check out, do it.  You could stay elsewhere and just walk over to eat if you like.

Also, the hotels restaurants were great. There are lots of super options though they are a little pricey. We loved Jean Georges, the Patisserie, and Lemongrass (basically everywhere we tried!) and the others all looked good too.

The colors of the casino are a bit gloomy with a lot of brown and the fact that the Craps table took a lot of money from us made it feel even gloomier. The dealers did not seem to be Vegas's ""A Team"" either... I'd rather go elsewhere to gamble but here to stay!!!

Not five stars in our book mostly for the wait during check-in.

When will hotels realize that the current traditional check-in methods are a big downer. 

You just walked into the place - and the first thing you do is STAND IN A LINE? Do the math on the common sense of a FIRST IMPRESSION hotel industry!

I recommend you stay away from the tapas place, and check out JG Steakhouse and Jewel night club as they have just re-opened the club that used to be Haze. There's Five50 pizza (by the slice, too) for your late night needs.

To get to the Aria, take Harmon Rd and follow the sign in the right hand lane. This place loses a star for making people pay for parking though; the first 4 hours will cost ya a flat rate of $18 if you aren't a hotel guest. M Life, you're losing me on that one.",7,3,7

1) The curtains weren't high enough so when it came time to the morning, you didn't even need to open them and walah...you got yourself 7am sunlight and it's not welcoming if you just came in a few hours earlier.  We had to move hotel rooms and needless to say only until you complain nicely and demand for the manager will something happen.  Otherwise, good luck negotiating with helpless counterfolks that are mediocre at being nice at best.  In a fake way of course.  

2) The hotel was supposed to give us passes to their club and other amenities but that didn't happen.  Apparently at 2am, the only ""coffee"" shop type restaurant is this COLD and MODERN place where there is PLENTY OF SEATING yet NOBODY wants to sit you nor serve you.  Their service overall was slow and the food was OK.  Nothing great...probably should have just ordered room service.  My food probably would have taken shorter than 1 hour to bring to the room.

Oh, and supposedly they even have a VIP line for this restaurant...WTH?  You're kidding me right?  After leaving a club you need a pass to get in the front of the line and if not, then your wait time for crappy service was minimum of 45 minutes?  uhh...NO, don't think so!

3) The rooms however like most say that they are sleek, modern, and comfy with LOTS of space.  

The highlight of this trip was that I got to see Snoop Dogg live at the club in the Aria...talk about RANDOM night that's for sure!

1. NONE OF US SMOKE
2. I have asthma, which means that if I smoked, I might as well just dig my own grave
3. We have a baby. If I smoked in a room with a baby inside, that would make me the worst dad in the world.

They claim that they found cigaret butts inside glasses and they have documentation to prove! THEY OBVIOUSLY MADE A MISTAKE. They must have the wrong room number. The rude guy on the phone just kept saying that he had documentation to prove and would have to file a dispute that would take a long time to resolve. Really?! So I lose $500 and I might never see that money again.

Do I have to show x-ray, blood test, medical records, etc. to show them that I do not smoke???

As a casino, it could be better, but I think that their purpose was to cater to more of a tourist\/leisure crowd.

Gaming - 2 stars
For a casino of this caliber, they have a dearth of fun machine to play slots on.  The floor has very few cocktail waitresses making rounds, although the areas are kept pretty clean.  The number of gaming tables is a lot less than you would imagine.  Returns on gaming are pretty bad.  I don't think that I have really come up here, and the lack of people makes for a spooky vibe.  There were no hand dealt tables for BJ, all shoes.

Hotel - 4 stars
Great restaurants always make for a pleasurable stay at a hotel.  Aria is no exception.  One of the biggest perks is that center stage of the casino is John Phillipe Patisserie.  What a great place to get dessert or a bite to eat in the morning.  The rooms are nicely appointed, although a bit small.  I strongly suggest that you do not opt for the smoking room, as the ventilation systems here are pretty weak.  We got stuck with one and the room smelled like an ashtray.  The smell of stale cig smoke was in all of our clothes, luggage, etc.  This was less than a year after they opened, so it must be far worse by now.  Aria probably has one of the nicest bathrooms in a casino.  Strange, but true.  Sometimes, it's those little things that make an impression.",4,0,1

The location is unbeatable. It is right in the middle of the strip and you can go across the strip - left or right easily. 

The rooms - the rooms are all updated since it's a newer casino and they are very modern. You control the room environment via iPad. The bathrooms are nice, the beds are comfortable, I had zero complaints about the rooms. 

The casino is NICE. The machines are newer, the tables are nice and the lobby is not gross. So many of the resorts are older and the lobbies are sub par and not updated. ARIA is not like this. 

The pool is one of the best I've experienced. It is CLEAN and they have so many different pools based upon what type of relaxation you want or what type of party mode you are in during the day. I highly recommend ARIA for the pools during that season. 

Lastly - ARIA has some good restaurant options. I have been to Julian Serrano, Todd English PUB, Javier's, ARIA Cafe and Lemongrass - and they are all good restaurants -- and all located within the resort.

I come to Vegas quite a bit and stayed at many casinos and had a great time.  Well I came back this year in April for my 30th Bday and second Bachelorette Party with my girlfriends.  We decided to go with Aria and try it out since it was the new and upcoming and upscale casino that was suppose to be great.

Wellll......to keep this posting short, I'll highlight the things that was REALLY horrible...

When we arrived to the hotel, we didn't get there until about 4pm..The outside was beautiful! Great start right? And then we walked in...The line in the lobby to check in was really long, so we thought that they were just really busy and it was a good sign with all the people there.  They had every single window open to help the customers.  After waiting in line for about 30 mins, we notice the line wasn't moving at all and the line next to ours was not either..After another 30 mins! We finally got to the window and gave them our name and said we had two rooms reserved with two queen beds...He then told us that our room was NOT ready and available and that it wouldn't be until about 10pm...YES! I said 10pm!We thought we heard wrong and asked him to repeat it and give us a reason WHY...well it seems as though the new casino decided to overbook their customers and end up not having enough room for everyone.  We found out that this was not just happening to us, but a whole lot of other people too.  So with about 6 girls that just arrived with tons of luggage with us, we were NOT happy.  We made it very clear that we were NOT leaving until they give us at least ONE room right then..(trying to be understanding and giving them time to give us the second room later on for the OTHER 6 girls arriving the following day)  So finally he found us a room...we took the elevator up to the floor our room was on and as soon as the elevator opened up, you can smell the HEAVY scent of cigarettes! URGHHH...it was SOOO strong, i instantly got a headache just walking a few steps into the hallway towards our room.  We just thought that someone might have just smoked one before we got there...We were wrong! He gave us our room on the smoking floor instead of non smoking which we kept reminding him to make sure its not mistaken.  So 30 mins later, they fixed it and found us another room on the right floor and when we entered, there was only ONE king size bed instead of two queens.  So we called and all they can tell us is that its the only room available and that when the other room with two beds become available, we will get switched immediately....THIS NEVERRRRR happened all weekend.  to cut the story short, 12 of us girls stayed in two rooms with one king size bed and a roll away bed for the whole weekend.  OHHH, andddd the two rooms were on opposite ends of each other.   They have the WORST customer service and housekeeping.  Forget about turning your bed, you'll be lucky to get clean towels or see a maid on your floor! It was horrible and all they can do to TRY and make us happy was comp us $50 for each room...it was horrific considering how much they charge per night.  The price is up there with the Wynn and Bellagio..We would NEVER would have had this problem there and if we did, it would have been dealt with and resolved immediately.

I was pretty excited since it's such a new hotel and I haven't stayed in it yet.

Needless to say, I didn't end up staying the night here because I wasn't in the mood to drive to the strip that night. However, I did drive over to the hotel at 7am, so i had until 12pm to checkout. I had my boyfriend meet me there, so we could have breakfast before he went to work at 8am, but that didn't end up happening because we passed out on the comfy bed. It must've been very comfortable because we ended up sleeping through our phone alarms and waking up at 8:15am (15 minutes after he was suppose to be at work). He actually woke up right before me and said, ""okay, I gotta get ready"" and I said, ""well you better hurry, it's 8:15."" Then he literally jumped out of the bed like a kangaroo on crack and was ready within 30 seconds. 

After he ran out of the room, I went back to sleep for about an hour on the marshmallow-like bed. I really like that the curtain covers up the entire window because it keeps the room cool and it almost looks like nighttime when the whole thing is blocked off. 

When I woke up around 9:30, I decided to relax and take a bath in the awesome tub. I was in the tub for about 5 minutes and I was completely under the water when I heard a knock at the door. Since my whole head was underwater, I wasn't sure if it was actually at my door, so I sat up and listened. That's when I heard another knock at the door, but this time the door was unlocked and OPENED at the same time as the knock! WTF! I didn't want to jump out of the bathtub and run over to the door all naked, so I just kind of hid myself behind the wall of the bathtub and yelled, I'M IN HERE!"" and the lady was like, ""Oh, I'm sorry, I'll come back later"" and she closed the door behind her.  I understand that I didn't have the ""do not disturb"" sign up, but still, that doesn't mean I should be busted in on more than TWO HOURS before checkout time.

I was pretty pissed after the incident, so I just got all of my stuff together and headed out after trying to checkout through the tv, which was not working at the time. 

To sum it all up, I've definitely experienced better, which is why I'm giving Aria 2 stars. The only things I really liked about this place were the bed and the beautiful view from the hotel room. Other than that, the ambiance and decor of the place is pretty ""blah,"" the towels are like worn out sandpaper, the tv checkout service wasn't even working, and I was almost violated by a housekeeper.",1,4,1

It felt like taking a bath in a steam room.  We had a decent view. Breakfast to the hotel room was around an hour wait... An hour wait for specifically two glasses or orange juice, a quart of coffee, and two oatmeals. If you're ordering breakfast in the morning and have somewhere to be, set an alarm for 2 hours before you have to head out and take a nap in between the time your order gets there.  The set up is definitely more of a hotel-feel if that's what you're going for.  Maybe I'm picky but I was not a fan walking in with snacks in birds eye view. It just looked tacky.  I much prefer the condo-based rooms in the Vdara.  

The positive however is the fact you can call valet to have your car ready when you arrive to pick it up from the room.  Very convenient!

I didn't stay at the hotel, I only visited the casino. It's a huge, too big for my taste. I liked how they kept up with the whole MGM regulated smell factor. The moment you walk into most MGM properties, you'll notice that they have nice vanilla like smell, that kinda masks the smell of the cigarettes, emphasis on kinda. 

I was way more impress with the M Resort when they first opened. I'm from San Diego and one thing that they have at the M Resort (which we don't have any where else in LV) are the readily available soda machines on the casino floor for FREE, as long as you're playing, and all that leaves the cocktail waitress to be useful for are either cigs or alcoholic beverages. NOT ANYTHING LIKE THIS here in Las Vegas. And you would think that they would as it's a work-out in itself just trying to get to the fricking PUB (no bueno). 

My biggest complaint about this place is that it feels so UNINVITING. The colors are so dull and not eye catching. Nothing makes me want to feed the machines with green paper and the dealers at the table look so f'n cranky. Yea, that depressed look on your face makes me wanna play at your table! 

So to recap: 
1. Aria smells good. 
2. Aria is massive, too big, you'll get lost. And don't think about asking workers where anything is at... They don't even know.
3. Aria is uninviting. Splash some color on your walls and on those dealers faces, they're so depressing to look at!!! 

TID BIT: I have no idea if they have a parking garage at Aria, I heard that it's Valet ONLY, who knows... But what we did was park at Monte Carlo. They're connected and if you're trying to get to crystals or some other far, far away hotel within City Center, they have a monorail.

P.S. DB Promoter at the Haze entrance, could it hurt you to finish your damn text message AFTER I asked you to help me find my way back to the yellow brick road?!",4,3,3

This hotel is huge so take some time to familiarize yourself with where everything is, otherwise you'll be walking in circles.  While the hotel itself is very modern and chic I have to say that I expected more. The first thing that irked me was the sign by the personal fridge that said that there were sensors inside the fridge and that if anything was removed for longer than 60 seconds it would be added to the bill.  Really?  For the amount of money they charge for a room I don't know why they would think that such precautions are necessary... then again this is Vegas.  You also can't bring any snacks from outside to fit in the fridge so don't buy anything to eat for later that needs to be refrigerated Oh, and $8.75 for a bottle of water.  Unfortunately we had to go across the street to the shops and stock up so that we wouldn't end up spending $100 on water by the end of day 2.  Water pressure in the shower was nonexistant and the temperature was lukewarm at best, and no free coffee. :(  Wifi was free which was a pleasant surprise considering they charged for everything else...

Checkout is supposed to be seamless - in fact, you can just email them to let them know your room number and that you are checking out and you are done.  However, I'd advise to look over your bill before checkout - my friend realized that some random person had tried charging a meal to her room from a restaurant within Aria the night before she left. She had to wait in the long checkout line but it was taken off her bill without an issue.",1,1,1

Pros-

1. The hotel is brand new and state of the art.  The decor is all modern yet its not sterile.

2. The beds are super comfortable and almost all the rooms offer floor to ceiling windows.  Each room also has a  remote control that controls everything from the curtains, to the tv to the temperature of the room.  This is a super nice modern touch!  

3. The inside is a little dark,( not allot of natural light), however the color scheme of the hotel (neutral blues and browns) help it not seem so much like a dungeon.

4. Most rooms offer a great view of the strip, or, I was fortunate enough to get a room with a fantastic view 2 years in a row =).  No complaints!

5. The Buffet is excellent.  Definitely one of the better buffets Ive been to in Vegas.  All you can eat crab legs!  Yes please!  Lobster!  Check!  Its 48 dollars per person at night and 35 dollars per person for brunch on Sundays....its expensive but the quality and selection are good. The rice crispy treats on the dessert bar were my favorite and added a nice touch!

6. The pools- the regular standard pools are very nice.  They aren't as overcrowded as many of the other hotel pools on the strip. There are 3 pools and they are very spread apart.  The waitress service by the pool was also better than most places 'Ive stayed on the Strip.   

7. Location!  Aria is a little farther down the strip but close enough to offer some  walkable options for great food, shows and shopping.

Cons

1. This hotel smells like the perfume Vanilla Fields.  It reminds me of high school and I literally hate it.  The smell is so overbearing, they really need to tone that down a notch!  I'm repulsed by it. 

2. As others mentioned, the cell service totally sucks!  I have both a sprint and an at&t phone and neither worked well.

3. The line for check in can get a bit ridiculous but this is true of all Vegas hotels.

4. The general food selection at the hotel is poor. Most hotels have at least one cheaper option, but even the cheaper option at Aria is waaay to expensive.  Can a girl get a cheap cheeseburger over in this joint please! Even the so called cheap coffee shop was charging about 10 bucks a sandwich.  

Bottom line I have more pros then cons, and,  for the price we paid (we get a super cheap special for our group every year) it was a fantastic value.  However if I had to pay full price I'm not sure I'd splurge on it. Its very nice but Id like to see how some of the other hotels are in comparison.",2,1,1

The gentleman that checked me in was not the nicest, which left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. That being said, I wasn't surprised when I finally arrived at my room (one of the furthest from the elevators).  However, the technologically advanced greeting upon arrival was pretty cool... the automatic opening of curtains, mood music, and a personalized welcome written out on the TV screen as well!

The rooms at the Aria are clean, modern, and pleasant... They have all of the amenities you'd expect from such a fancy\/high end hotel.  The bed is super comfortable and the blackout curtains are pretty amazing.  Great robes and toiletries too!

I must warn anyone reading this that the Aria is huge - if you go here, be prepared to do a lot of walking.  Be prepared to do a lot of spending $$ also; even if you don't gamble.  Everything at this hotel is pricey including the coffee shops, restaurants, bars, in-room snacks, etc... but I guess that is what vacations are for, right? 
I did visit Chill - the gelato\/coffee shop each day, and I had breakfast one of the days at Café Vettro, which I enjoyed.  

One thing to note that was very frustrating for me:  my phone would not work in the hotel at all, and neither would the wifi on my phone.  I have AT&T and haven't experienced this problem anywhere else, but it was extremely frustrating.  There were a few others in my group that had similar issues too.  Thank goodness the wifi was free and did work with my laptop or I would have been completely disconnected.

It started off great.  I did mobile check in and got my room in minutes.  Room was fine except for some of the light switches not working.  The high tech rooms seem to breakdown a lot faster than regular rooms at other hotels.  Conference Center is nice and easy to get to even though it is down a very long hall.

On my last day at the hotel, I went to the hotel gym.  When I got back, I was locked out of my room.  Thought maybe me key just go deactivated.  So I went downstairs and talked to a security guard who helped.  He called someone to get me back in my room.  Security finally showed up after I call the operator and ask where security is.  Security can't get me into my room either. Another hotel staff comes by and calls someone and they say I need to go the front desk.

So I go to the front desk and talked to the manager.  Turns out overnight, they tried to run my credit card and it was declined several times.  The manager was not outrightly rude to me but her demeanor showed it.  It was if I was a common criminal trying to run out on my bill.  I have a long history at the Aria and other MGM properties so she should have been a bit more accommodating.

So I have to get special permission to be let back in my room to get my ID and credit card to prove I am not trying to run out on my bill. Security lets me in and I get my ID and card.  I then go back to the front desk where they run my card with no issues. The front desk clerk says because I did mobile check in and they did not run my card manually at the front desk, the overnight charge was declined.  

Seems that if they are going to continue to use this mobile check in, they should get their credit card processing working properly.  Also, if they had tried calling me in my room or on my cell phone, I could have easily taken care of this.  Instead I have to run around the hotel working with security and the front desk when I was in a hurry to get to my event.  And I would not have had to deal with a rude front desk manager.

I did eat lunch at the pool bar one afternoon and it was not bad. You order with the cocktail waitresses and someone else delivers your food in a bag.  I guess the food is made elsewhere on the property.  I had the falafel plate.  It had lots of good stuff on it - hummus, Greek olives, salad, pita.  That was one bright spot during my stay.  Except it was way too hot outside.  Not sure how people bake in the hot sun when its 110 outside.

This was my first time in Vegas and I'm so glad we didn't decide to stay at a cheaper, cliche, themed hotel.  

This hotel was very luxurious and I almost didn't want to come home to my piddly loft downtown.  What do you mean my apt doesn't have remote controlled drapes, lighting, television, music and climate?  PFT, screw that! 

The security was a nice feature.  They [room]card you before entering the elevator lobby so non-guests aren't able to just waltz in.  

I must admit, I'm not sure about Vegas.  I think I could not go back and not feel like I'm missing anything since I'm not big on gambling and clubbing hasn't been my thing for about 10 years.  Come to think of it, I'm only 28 so it's definitely never been my thing!  BUT I would come back here in a heart beat JUST for the pool.  That triple digit heat, the pool-side alcohol service, the hot bodies, people watching.  Def. saw a lot of young women with some wrinkly old men - they totally married for love!  If I ever go back to Vegas the pool is where you'll find me.

The whole experience was very relaxing and glam.  And the location, center-strip, can't be beat.  A lot of the good shopping and sights are an easy walk.  However, there really is no reason to leave the hotel.  Everything you need is right there.

Terrible service. Extremely rude employees who obviously hate people and their jobs. And the longest lines ever, everywhere and for everything!!! Oh, and there was a blood stain on the wall in our bathroom and gross stains on the carpet in our room. Unacceptable for the prices they are charging. You can stay in far better hotels in Vegas -- Bellagio, Venetian, Planet Hollywood...  anywhere!  

A snippet of some the terrible service we received:  

1.) The taxi line took over 30 minutes- unacceptable. I ask the ""director"" if it usually takes that long (so we can plan our days out) He answers so rudely ""uh yeah sometimes. i don't know. whatever"" are you fucking kidding me??! And you still want a tip. It's ok. I called him an asshole. Which is what he is. a RUDE ASSHOLE.

2.) At Jean Phillipe Cafe, where an egg sandwich is $10 bucks (its fine, I get it everything is over priced in Vegas)  I asked politely ""what sandwich doesnt have mayo."" I don't eat mayo- it's a pretty simple question and request. The MANAGER rolls her eyes at me and says ""It's all pre made. They all have mayo. If you dont like it you can eat somewhere else"" Uhhhh ok. Way to take pride in your job!!

Same manager at Jean Phillippe throws a sandwich on the ground, swears, and kicks it through the restaurant (no joke!) after my friend says she won't accept it because it didn't have egg inside it (like on the menu) and was not acceptable for her. WHO DOES THAT?????!!!! She literally kicked it all the way across the back counter and was visibly angry. 

GET A NEW MANAGER!!!! She is terrible. What an embarrassment. She should be ashamed of herself. Yeah, the MExican lady with long fake blonde hair. YOU ARE TERRRRIBLE. You have NO business being a manager or working with people !

LONNNNGGG lines for everything. Line for taxi (over 30 minutes EVERY time). Line for coffee. Line for food. Line for bell desk.  Line to pick up baggage. A line For everything!!!! What the helll are we paying for??? Understaffed and over priced.

Positives:

1) The valet staff was quick and pleasant. 
2) I was checked into my room immediately.
3) I have a very high sense of smell and really enjoyed the vanilla smell in the casino. Anything beats the gross smell of cigarettes. 
4) The casino itself is modern and beautifully decorated. It's definitely sexy. 
5) The room is fairly large and is great for those that love technology. 
6) The bed is large and comfortable. I could stay in bed all day. 

Cons:

1) The only late night eatery is the cafe.
2) The cafe is over priced and has a limited menu. $7.50 for orange juice!!! I ordered chilaquiles for breakfast. It was bland and dry and didn't even come with rice and beans. The waiter was incredibly rude and acted like I was bothering him when I requested salsa. Stay away from this place. I don't mind spending money on food so long as it is worth it. THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH IT.
3) A mix drink is $17+.

I didn't gamble at any tables so I can't really speak on that. I would definitely stay here again. All the staff members were pleasant. I never walked by a staff member without being greeted.

CONS:

-INEXPERIENCED FRONT DESK STAFF:

 Check- in took  36 minutes with only two people in front of me. When I get to the front desk I am informed I can only choose from a smoking room when I specifically requested a NON smoking room. Got a rude reception when I tried to get my $75 room credit promotion after booking from the internet at a special rate. I got the run around and spent another 25 min. waiting to try to claim it. In the end, a rude manager told me ""absolutely not"". Check out was smoother but I did check out at 6 AM. A good rule of thumb is: allow 30 min. minimum to check in\/out. Print EVERYTHING out before you go, so you can show them ""proof"" - otherwise they will play dumb, like they did with me.  If my front desk experience was better Aria would get a 4-star.

- CONFUSING HI TECH GADGETRY NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO WORK,  INCLUDING THE STAFF

I love gadgets, I have iPods, digital cams. I am pretty proficient with computer and hacking my way around systems, but the Aria has the most confusing room ""computer"" system that does everything from opening the curtains, turning on the TV, etc etc. It is a real pain when things don't work like they are supposed to. We actually called in a tech but he couldn't figure it out either. Despite all the hoo-haw there is no iPod or MP3 hookup...and get this no CD player. You are forced to listen to their music channels.

- LOUD

if you have an adjoining room be prepared for annoyance if your neighbors are loud. After checking into my room, I had to call front desk to relocate me to a quieter room after a series of ""HELL YEAH!!!"" woke me up. I could hear every cuss, every expletive from the thin adjoining door. If you want to avoid headaches after you unpack, ask the front desk for a room without adjoining door. 

- CONFUSING LAYOUT

If you are arriving via shuttle bus, be prepared to spend about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get from the basement to the front desk. I was in the shuttle with stranger who was also trying to find the front desk to the Aria. We ended up in an elevator with an Aria hotel employee who did not speak English and had no clue what we were talking about when we asked him ""Lobby...where?""

Despite the really poor service from front desk staff, confusing layout, there were some saving graces:

PROS:

- REALLY NICE ROOMS

Even the standard rooms were impressive. The decor, storage space, lighting, entry foyer, dual sinks, marble floors, shower and tub (hang onto to something, you WILL slip), separate WC, nightly turn-down service, the most comfortable beds with down pillows...Excellent!! Oh yes, the scales in the bathrooms are a plus if you need to weigh your luggage. Every room has a view, which is also the plus. Hopefully when you book your room you will be facing the strip.

- EXCELLENT SUPPORT STAFF

Good bellmen, good housekeeping. Very friendly. Why can't the front desk staff learn something from the people who actually service the floors?? Another bonus is the security around the Aria. If you do not stay at the hotel, you will have no business going to the rooms. They check your room key as you try to get onto the elevators.

- FAST ELEVATORS

Floors are broken down from 1 -7, 8 - 15, etc so you don't have to wait forever to get to your room. 

- DECOR

Really nice, overall. Impressive. 

ADDITIONAL INFO: do not use their Wi-Fi unless you are prepared to pay $15 a day, local calls cost $1 each, do not put *anything* in the fridge even if you not going to drink or eat their stuff - they will charge you as everything is weighed (see other Yelpers comments). FYI I paid $149 a night for four nights in Feb of 2010 for a basic room. 

If Aria trained their front desk staff to be more customer-service oriented, Aria can only get more 4 star ratings in the future. It's a new hotel with great potential!",10,4,1

Aria itself is brand new and when I was last in Vegas (for my 30th birthday in 2009) it was still under construction.  The big appeal of Aria is how technological it is.  What this means is that when you open your hotel room door the automatic curtains will open up for you, and the lights will turn on.  If you are gone for a period of time and forgot to turn your TV, lights, ect off it will do so automatically.  

The entry to Aria hotel is nothing super-special save for the smell of vanilla\/jasmine that they spray everywhere on the casino floor that weirdly leaves me craving vanilla cupcakes.  How handy that Jean Phillipe's bakery is located near the bank of elevators going up to the rooms.

My favorite features of Aria are as follows:

--The size of the rooms.  Very nice!!  Instead of one dinky window you get an entire bank of windows that run the length of the room and open via a long curtain.  There is really not one ""bad"" view in the hotel.  

--The beds.  They are the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on.  Period.  It feels like you are sleeping in a sea of Jello.  

--The deep tubs.  I love how the tubs are sunken though they are located behind the shower (?) which was sort of weird.  The toilets have their own separate room complete with phone if you just can't wait to make a call or have fallen and you can't get up.

--Location.  Aria connects to Crystals which is a mall with shopping and dining that then connects to the Cosmopolitan. I feel like the Cosmopolitan has a lot more happening than Aria and we spent more of our time there.  In addition Aria is fairly centrally located on the strip in general.

The Bad:

--One of the things that bugs me about Aria is the service.  Though it wasn't bad I didn't feel like the customer service was at the top of their game.  Being 5 star I expected more in that category. 

--I HATE the new ""Vegas"" thing of charging a mandatory $20 a day for ""convenience"" items like wireless internet and gym use.  Even if you have no plans for either one you still have to pony up that fee on top of the already expensive hotel rate.  

--Your room IS very technological in the sense that you can plug in your iPod, iPad, MP3, whatever you have to their state of the art sound system IF you have your aux cord.  Like, the one you have in your car to connect to your device.  Who would think of bringing that to a hotel room??  No problem though because for TWENTY DOLLARS you can buy a ""keepsake"" Aria technology package that includes such that is located above the mini bar.

--No electrical outlets near the bed to charge your phone, use your laptop, ect.  Why am I paying $20 a day again for wireless internet?  So I can sit in my stiff desk chair to use my laptop??

While it's part of the capitalist monolith known as CityCenter, and has lots of fancy time apparel, there are some major issues with this place that can't be overlooked.

#1 - What brand new, modern mega-resort can afford to have zero cell phone service?  My iPhone was absolutely worthless in this place it might have well been New Year's Eve 1989 rather than 2009.

#2 - Kinda pricey, even the 24-hour Cafe Vettro.  On the late night I peeked my head into Aria, I went by this place hoping I could get something reasonable.  Some people might think $7 for cream of wheat or $12 for pancakes is reasonable, but come the hell on.

After those two big turnoffs, this place is stunning.  CityCenter is one of the most expensive private construction projects ever and it shows.  Everything from the elevator banks to the carpets to the light fixtures are modern, trendy and classy.  I swear if the Chargers make it to the Super Bowl I am going to have to watch the game at Aria, which has one of the more unique and inviting layouts I've seen.

I'm guessing there won't be much change for those looking for an affordable option at CityCenter.  Hell, this ain't the Hooters hotel so I guess it comes with the territory.  Handle the cell phone service and this immediately gets four stars.",4,2,2

Room: Nice decor, large bathroom, great ""city view"" 

Casino: Man, was this place confusing. We got lost headed to [enter location here] multiple times. No, I don't think it was just the alcohol that caused our confusion. Overall it's nice but there is a definite lack of signage.

Pool: A little generic. And it was a little annoying that liquid requires a separate cover. You would think that they would offer hotel guests discounted or free admission, but nope. Nothing. Also, I was super bugged that you couldn't take drinks anywhere near the pool. I mean, not within a 5' border. There went my hopes of getting drunk sitting in the pool.  

Bars: We spent a lot of time at the bar right outside of the sports book hanging out with a bartender - John. John was great. Super friendly, willing to make crazy concoctions, and just generally a good Vegas person. 

Service: for the most part, the service was outstanding. It seems like everyone from the Valet, to security to the restaurant servers went out of their way to answer questions and be as helpful as possible.

The hotel was super clean, the staff was really friendly, and there was so much to do on the property.  The only thing negative I would say is that the hotel was too big.

Hotel Rooms:
This was one of the nicest hotel rooms I've ever stayed at.  Everything looked new and clean. I got a king bed and it was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! There was automatic window curtains (blackout and sheer) which was pretty cool.  The best part about the room was the bathroom! There were dual sinks, a shower, and a tub! All in all...gorgeous room.

Conference Rooms:
The conference rooms were big and very nice.  It was well equip with speaker and IT systems.  The meeting rooms spanned over 3 floors.  Due to the sheer size of the hotel, it did take a while to get to the conference rooms from my hotel room (approx. 20 minutes).

Casino:
The casino was very nice. The staff was friendly and was very helpful. They have all the standard casino games including casino war! They also have a very nice poker room.  2am on a Tuesday night and the poker room was still all packed!

Gym:
The gym was free to hotel guest as part of the hotel fees.  They have all kinds of machines there. My favorite machine was a rope pulling machine....you don't see those at 24 hours in Hawaii. It was definitely a bonus that Aria offered bottled water, towels, and clean earphones! There's a nice sitting area right outside the gym with a high tech fire place.  Great place to just hang out.

Pool:
The pools were beautiful. Definitely a must check out! There were 2 or 3 pools on the property with life guards on duty.  We went kind of late so there weren't too many people. Within the pool area, there was Liquid.  It's a day club that runs like a nightclub. There is a cover but we were able to get free passes for staying in the hotel. Liquid was gorgeous! The staff was really nice and the patrons were very good looking. We will definitely be back the next time we go to Vegas.

On this occasion I stayed in a room with Queen sized beds with a view of the strip.  This room like all of the others was sleek and modern with a ton of gadget controlled features like all of the room controls being on a tablet and the curtains and sheers able to be opened and closed with a button.  It's beds were comfortable and all of the employees were curtious whenever you walked by.  My concerns with the room on my past visit was that the first night we were there we were awoken at 4:40 AM by a bellhop who was there to pick up our luggage.  You would think at that time of the morning that he would have double checked that he had the right room?  Then my second issue with our room was our room keys.  I am not really sure what was going on but we ended up with multiple keys that wouldn't work on our door.  It was frustrating. 

The casino at the Aria is one of the newest on the strip and it shows being nice and also one of the most expensive. We played a number of games there during our stay since our hotel rooms were right upstairs.  It was only natural that is also where we would place some sport bets since we always had to return there.  However I can't say that I recommend their sports book.  When open there aren't really any problems but look out if it is closed and you have to go the cages to cash a ticket.  I tried to cash a ticket there this morning. Since I was leaving at 7:40 for the airport and the sports book didn't open until 8 it was my only option.  I went down at 7 and was the only person in line.  The cashier tried to get the sports book machine working and could not.  I explained my predicament and she told me I could mail it in.  Why if I am standing in your casino at the cashiers would I want to take my ticket home and mail it in?  So I asked for the supervisor.  She tried a little bit harder but was also ultimately unsuccessful in trying to cash the ticket and encouraged me to mail it in as well.  No thanks.  Eventually they found out the lady opening the sports book would be in at 7:30 and she thankfully opened up just to cash me out.  Seriously though 30 minutes to cash a ticket?  That was both disappointing and frustrating.

The bottom line for me is that yes the Aria is a really nice hotel and casino.  That part can't be denied but if I am paying a premium to stay at your hotel I don't want woken up at 4:40 by a bellhop in the wrong spot and I also want to be able to cash out my sports bets quickly and easily.",3,0,0

Modern decor with a fresh feel to everything, you won't feel like you're in a rehabbed hotel like Planet Hollywood.  Nonetheless, the quality of everything is just lacking.  Consider it the Ikea of resorts.

The rooms are small.  For the same price, you can grab a place at the adjacent Vdara and it'll be more spacious.  Got hooked up with an upper level scenic view with complimentary chocolate covered strawberries.  The strawberries were a joke!!!  Okay okay, they were free, I guess I shouldn't be expecting much.  

On the plus side, it's conveniently located next to the CityCenter.  But if you don't mind the distance, I highly suggest you stay at a north strip hotel (i.e., Venetian, Wynn, etc.); comparable prices and better bang for your buck overall.

How in the world Aria sent my information to my coworker's work email? I used Hotels.com to book the rooms which shows my personal email xxxxxxx@gmail.com on M life account i use my other personal email xxxxxxxxx@gmail.com I have never used my work email and how did Aria email my receipt to my coworker's email?

I asked to talk to a manager, his name is Ryan Gregory, after I explained to whole thing to him and how frustrated I was. He just did not want to help me at all, not an apology, not any kind of compensation. and When I ask him what is he gonna do for me. He said we cannot do anything and right after that he asked smiling is there anything else he can do. He was really laughing from inside right at my face. Ryan Gregory is really a piece of sxxt !!! He does not qualify to be an Assistant Manager for a 5 star hotel, in fact any hotel, any where!

He is an insult to Aria and MGM as a company.",3,5,0

Check In : 2 Stars 

First off, the airport shuttle bus dropped us at the BACK of the hotel which has little or no sign directing guests to the Hotel Lobby which was fairly far away from the drop off zone. NOT cool. 
Then we had to wait about 30 min to check in though we came on a Thursday night around 10pm.  Not cool. 

The actual stay : 4 stars 

We asked for a room on a higher floor with a good view, smoking, not obstructed by Monte Carlo. ( Folks, make sure u ask for those things as they will not just hand it to you ).  So we were given room 23045 on the second to last floor,  which is the absolute best room you can ever have if you are not willing to spend top $$$ for a suite. The view of the city is quite magnificent from that room.  *** Beware***  the room is quite a walk from the elevator (2-3min walk). 
As mentioned by fellow yelpers, everything is controlled in the room by a single remote which SUCKS by the way. Too many lags, 2 to 4 seconds delay, can't work for sh*t.  That issue should have been addressed a long time ago..
DO NOT TOUCH THE POSSESSED FRIDGE OR ANYTHING ON TOP OF IT !! unless you want to be charged for things you've never used.  The Fridge and the crackers located on top of it have sensors that would automatically charge your room. 
Other than that, I loved my stay at the hotel. Do not expect anything free from them as they have this look of disgust and horror on their face when you ask for free shows coupons or free open bar tickets and all that crap. 

Check out : 3 stars 

Check out is at 11 Am though check in was at 3 PM. How fair is that? My flight does not depart till 11 at night so I thought, huh, they might just let me stay at least till 5pm or 6pm. So I called them at 10 AM to see if it was possible to stay in a bit longer. Was told I was given a complimentary extra hour to stay in. I wondered what was so complimentary bout an extra hour but since I did not want to be charged an extra $70 bucks, I ran outta there by 12:10. Btw, there is a lack of communication between Front desk and room service cuz, as expected, someone came and knocked at my door at 11:05 to ask me to check out.. NOT COOL. 

So that's my review. Drinks at Aria Casino are stronger than at most casinos I've visited. Worst Casino to drink at is Flamingo. That place looked cheap and their drinks taste like piss.. Though drinks are free, they do cost $$ since you are tipping the waitress. Learn how to pimp them cuz not all of them are nice.

Btw, I could care less bout that Vanilla scent but females do love that crap. Go figure.",2,0,0

It's not every year we turn 40, and we wanted to do Vegas in style and feast, relax and spoil ourselves silly.  Although the Aria is a beautiful establishment - every SINGLE touchpoint was FUBB!!! (Effed-up-beyond-belief!)

Our rooms were not ready at check in (which is 3PM) - in fact, most of our rooms weren't ready until after 5PM.  We ran late for dinner because we had nowhere to get ready and in desperation asked to use the spa to get ready.  We faced all kinds of attitude from the spa and ""fought"" our way to get in.  Of course, before we even got to the spa - it took the bell boys approx. 15-20 minutes to get our bags from the ""conveyor belt"".  Once we got back to the rooms after dinner\/show - we checked into our rooms.  They were nice and clean - but not 30 minutes after getting in - a few of us were woken up by housekeeping who demanded to know when we were checking out because they needed the rooms.... (It's called ""communication with the front desk"" people - it's not hard and it's a part of your job!!!!!)

The next day after running around doing the spa thing and shopping, we returned to our room only to find a chewed up piece of gum stuck on the entryway tile. OMFG - are you serious?!?  We picked it up and had to throw it out ourselves....  The rest of the room was clean and we had fresh linens\/towels - but had NO idea where that gum came from since we weren't chewing it...????

We got room credits for the terrible service but we could NEVER find out how much credit was remaining on the rooms unless we asked everytime we used it.  AND, every time we used the room credit - the merchants (bartenders, retail assistants) would have to call the front desk to ""open"" the credit.  So, once we checked out of the hotel, it turned out that we were over the credits and still had to pay a remaining balance.  I'm still not sure how that happened since we had to ""open"" the credit each time to use it - so how does one go over the limit?!?!

It was the first time ever that I was TIRED of complaining and just started laughing at how comically disorganized this place was.  They didn't have their shit together at all - and it was like staying at a 5 star hotel at 5 star prices, but a bunch of incompetent fools ran the place.  HORRIBLE.

The Jean Phillippe chocolatier shop is amazing.  The spa is gorgeous.  If you want to be treated badly but still pay alot of money, please check out the Aria.  You will be stepped on, treated like shit and then robbed.

Aria is a bit overhyped in my opinion. The dark colored decor is modern and sleek but this place is the Lexus of hotels - sterile without real passion like the Venetian.

If you look at my previous review, I had a 5 star for Aria. This change is because of the service they provided during my stay this time around. 
There were 3 major incidents that made me HATE ARIA. 

I had PRIVATE sign on in my room because I wanted to sleep in. Around 12PM, someone knocks on my door and asks me if I need towels which is bizarre. Why would you ever knock on a room that has a private sign on it in first place and I didn't even ask for towels. Now, if the incident stopped here, I wouldn't mind too much, but this person opens the door using his key which shocked me so much. I was just resting in my bed, but what if I was taking a shower, or doing something else in the room that required privacy? Or perhaps even just changing my clothes? As soon as I heard the door open I quickly told the person that I do not need towels and told him to leave. 

I left the room the second day with a housekeeping sign on, since I didn't receive housekeeping in the morning. I came back to the room after lunch and looking around some places, but there was no housekeeping done. I was fine with this, because we were outside only for about 2-3 hours. So I simply gave housekeeping a call, and let them know that we will be leaving the room again in about 5 minutes. I told the person that I would be coming back pretty soon and asked for the room to be cleaned meantime. I actually went out that time so that the room could be cleaned, I didn't really want to go out. Anyhow, I came back 2 hours later to find my room in the exact same condition as how it was before I left. I called housekeeping again and told them what happened and they said they will send someone immediately. It was such an inconvenience because I had to leave the room at 2AM so that they can clean it. I was hovering on Aria lobby for over an hour waiting for the room to be cleaned. Terrible experience. 

After this, I was pretty frustrated and I called the front desk about what happened, especially regarding the person coming into my room. The front desk apologized and told me that they will make sure this never happens again. 

Lastly, on the third night, again I had the private sign on. Someone again knocks on my door. I was thinking, well this time they won't come in since I called the front desk yesterday. NO. THIS PERSON OPENS MY DOOR AND COMES IN AGAIN. I TOLD HIM TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. I called the front desk pretty furious this time. They apologized of course and took the resort fee off and everything. 

STILL I think this is pretty unacceptable. HONESTLY THIS WAS THE WORST AND MOST SHOCKING HOTEL EXPERIENCE I HAD.",1,1,1

Room was not avail until mid afternoon and the suite we got was quite small for the value we paid. This suite is a corner suite and it's a third smaller than the regular sky suites. Plus, the check in experience was like getting the run around. It took a non front desk employee to actually tell a manager to give me specific time the room would be ready. Only then, within  a few minutes were we given our room keys. 
Then when we got to the room, the cable tv was not working and only local broadcast channels were available. The monitor flashed a message that no one is registered to this room even though my name is at the top of the screen! The pluses were that the limo driver was waiting for us at the airport and the bell staff knew my name already as I stepped out of the car. But that's the only positive experience so far.

It was packed.  Think about coming out of a stadium after a sporting event- it was like that.  Well maybe not that bad, but it seemed liked it. People everywhere.  The hotel is gigantic, but then everything is supersized in Vegas. The hotel sends you a mobile check in capability so that you don't have to wait in line - there must always be a line.  But of course it doesn't work so I call ahead to askf for help.  Still doesn't work. Arrive at hotel and not one person in the mobile check in line and 60 people at least for the normal check in.   The room was nice enough but nothing out of the ordinary. We ate at a few restaurants, but wouldn't do that again.  The smoke from the casino totally ruined my meal.  Better to eat at an enclosed restaurant where you can breathe. The pool area was filled with drunks and cigar smoke - so that was gross.  I suggest Aria that you have a cigar room.  Pools and cigar smoke - yuck!  We ordered a few drinks at the pool the first day when we finally managed to get the waitress with her bum hanging out to assist us.  Gouging prices to be expected but sadly the Kardashian trend has now spread to hotel pool waitresses.  So trashy, and didn't even mention the girls all had duck lips and fake boobs  It would have been laugheable if it wasn't so grotesque. We didn't see any children, maybe they were there but didn't see them.  Trying to get a coffee at Starbucks coffee on the Promenade level was so ridiculous.  Standing in line to get food was normal.    From 7am  - noon, there is a constant line of 30 people.  Maybe this is just what Vegas is all about and the Aria is a symptom of that hedonistic, Sodom and Gommorah type atmosphere.  Online check out - but alas it didn't work either.

First lets start with the location, right smack in the middle of everything. The city center is so modern and nice, to me its the staple to Las Vegas. Everywhere I went it was either walking distance or I would grab a taxi and it was never over a 10 dollar tab to get where you want to.

Second you valet your car, and walk into Aria, its so nice and clean you know you get your moneys worth staying at a nicer hotel. 

The reason why I wanted to write this review was specifically because of Michael who works in the Check In\/Concierge area. I literally was 5 dollars short on the card since they hold $130 a night on your card, and he literally saved me from being a debbie downer. Pretty much helped me out with everything and was sooooooo kind! All I know is that if I'm going to check in Aria in the future, If i have to wait for an hour to get him to help me check in, I will!

Let's get to the room! Modern, chic, and big! I love the technology style room! Can control the room lighting, TV, air conditioning, and curtains with this digital control screen. The bathroom is nice, love the double sinks! My favorite part funny enough is the mattress. I literally slept like a baby! It was as if I was sleeping on clouds!

Apparently Vegas is not as accommodating as you think.

Frequenters of Las Vegas- tell me your thoughts:

""Hello, 

My name is Krista McKenna and I am currently looking to book a return trip (for my sister (Sara McKenna) and I) with 4 new comers at Aria for a Bachelorette party in September (ideal dates are sept 27-29). There will be 6 of us in our group, and since I loved my experience at Aria this past May (we had a 4 day stay at Aria), I wanted to share this experience with 4 of my best friends.

Our problem is this: Everywhere I go, including your website, I cant seem to find a comparable deal (flight out of bellingham, limo transport to hotel, 1 or 2 large rooms for our group, and return trip) at a decent value or package. 

Because of such, the other ladies in our group are becoming hesitant in staying at Aria since everywhere we look, it doesn't provide a package deal (price and utility wise) thats competitive enough with the other hotels on the strip.

I, personally, am really rooting for Aria for the win. Why? Because I believe that Aria obtains the atmosphere, vibe and experience my friends deserve for their first trip to Vegas. Liquid is amazing, your pools are gorgeous, your food is delicious (LOVE the gluten free options!), staff is friendly and your rooms\/hotel are stunning. After personally experiencing such calibre, I don't trust in testing other hotels and would prefer to make Aria my go-to for all things Vegas. My family also feels the same as my father has become a loyal customer to Aria for his last visits to Vegas (an MLife card holder), so I would like to make it our family's go-to Vegas choice.

Our price range (per person for room, hotel utilities -pool, gym, internet- and including flights) is $500 each, not including food or drink, or shows\/gambling (which we also plan on doing a lot of), totalling $3000 for our group purely for accommodation and airfare. 

Can Aria meet the need? If yes, What can Aria offer that meets that need? 

I know that the other 4 girls in our group have never experienced Vegas before, and I know that depending on this stay, they will most likely become regulars to the Vegas (and hopefully Aria) experience. 

Side note - I have also obtained a significant amount of loyalty chips on the facebook app MyVegas, and qualify for perks at Aria - I intend to use this as well towards our stay at Aria if possible, and I have encouraged the rest of our party to do the same. 

So- where do we go from here?

Please let me know what Aria can offer- I am eager to book this trip and anticipate another amazing stay with Aria for my family and friends.

Wishing you the best,
Krista McKenna

Not bad right? 

Since I have worked in the service industry for YEARS, I know that an email like this isn't very common. Typically, based on expectations of a certain caliber of customer service, you would expect a response that is both (somewhat) accommodating and flexible.

After all- Vegas has a reputation of being a fun, financially feasible and lets face it, CHEAP (with free perks) place to vacation.

*No email received.

Is that even a response? Why do I feel like they didn't even read my email\/questions? Why would you even bother responding if above is all your going to say?

Not going to lie, Im pretty disappointed in ARIA Resort & Casino and MGM Resorts International - Public Relations.

Completely takes away any interest or motivation on going to the strip, and on building loyalty with one specific hotel.

Im open to your thoughts, friends. Tell me what you think. Was I holding too high and\/or unrealistic expectations?

*note - I have still yet to hear back from the PR team\/Customer Service sector regarding this.",1,5,2

I was worried when we checked in that they were going to say we had no reservation but thank goodness it worked out. We checked in later in the evening but still scored a room with the Strip view. The rooms are amazing! Love that when you open the door the drapes open up to your view of the lights on the strip. Everything is modern. The beds are super comfy.  Our room had both and shower and bathtub which was great! The hotel is so clean and the staff very friendly. Their looks are all heated. They give you plenty of towels when you get to the pool area too. Also helps that there's a Starbucks on the way to the pool. Yes! The hotel has lots of stores and eateries to explore if you don't feel like walking the strip. Parking is paid hourly on the strip now. We opted to Valet since we were staying here. The valet price is $18 per 24 HR period. Which is a better deal than paying hourly. As soon as you give them your ticket your car is out in a few minutes. Can't beat that. I'd definitely come back here again!,1,1,2

Everyone was extremely friendly, the customer service was excellent, probably the best I've ever had at any hotel. The room was amazing, the bed was super comfortable and bathroom was exquisite. Every piece of food I ate was delicious and every drink I drank was amazing. The gym was great, they have plenty of free weights and Dumbbells that went to 100lbs. One huge plus for me was the free wifi, whereas other hotels make you pay $15\/day for wifi. I can't wait to go back, I highly recommend staying at the aria.",1,0,0

The room was awesome, we paid for 2 queens with a street view on the 20th floor. The buffet brunch is around 30$, dinner is 40$, so we ended up going to McDonalds, that is right across the street, where we paid 30$ for 5 meals :). The casino and bar are clean, nice, a bit crowded. The bar server was very nice and the service was fast. :) They have Starbucks on the second floor, and a few coffee places downstairs. 

To our surprise, when we were checking out, we were charged  almost 50$ for some refreshments that we never had. But took a phone call to resolve the issue (gonna check my credit card in a few days just to be sure they took the charges off). So make sure you are not charged for anything extra. I provided my @ address to check out, so they sent me an @ in the morning with the bill to review. So far, the experience is great! Looking forward to stop here again sometimes in the future. 

The only concern throughout the whole trip: looks like Las Vegas is turning into Beijing. 75% of all people there - are Chinese?!?! My family is multiracial and we have no racial issues with anyone, but we were surprised to see so many Chinese faces around. Even the check-in line in Aria had at least 70% Chinese guests.",0,0,0

Hotel room was so clean and comfortable, I'm usually pretty picky about cleanliness and Aria was excellent! Beautiful view too! Looking forward to coming back. We played blackjack really enjoyed it, dealers were friendly! Nice drink service at the tables, much more generous than the other casinos we visited. The casino does a great job of getting the smoke out of the air too, I really appreciate that.

We tried Lemongrass, Five50 and Javier's restaurants. Really great food and service! It was nice to have this kind of variety in the hotel for those nights we didn't feel like going too far. Also saw the Zarkana show (great!) and were even given an upgrade to really good seats. Great experience.",0,0,0

The rooms are great: incredibly comfortable beds, modern marble bathrooms, and electronic automation for everything. The corner suite was simply breathtaking. However, of the four rooms our party rented, every single one had something minor wrong with it - eg. one room had the 'privacy' light stuck on, preventing any cleaning service (which they never did fix, despite multiple requests), another with a safe that 'glitched' stuck with wallets inside, and every room we saw had at least some lights burned out. 

""City View"" doesn't mean much with giant condo skyscrapers in front of your hotel. Even the best views in the place, you'll be lucky to see a little glow from the MGM or Monte Carlo. 

What really turned us off this place was the abysmal customer service, particularly from the front desk. Being put on a ""waiting list"" for a reserved room was a new and unpleasant experience - doubly so at check-in time on a Tuesday (wow, I'd hate to arrive Friday night!). Even worse was the subsequent downgrade for a night. The next day they promised to fix it, but again, we ""had to wait"", and they promised call us. Well they never did call us; I had to call them twelve hours later (an arduous process in itself given their equipment dropped more calls than it completed), and only then did they even *begin* to process the request.

Similar experience at the restaurants and bars - you'd get the occasional charming waitress, but most times, you'll be waiting 30 minutes or more before your existence is acknowledged.",3,0,0

The good: no bed bugs, great view overlooking Cosmopolitan Pool out onto the Strip, free-parking and really nice room service staff. Furthermore, they run the best poker room in town as far as I've experienced. Lots of action at all blind levels including daily tournaments. Additionally, if you want to play the best Ben Lamb, Greg Merson and Eli Elezra were all in last night boning up before Main Event.

The bad: Hotels.com and Tripadvisor might tell of a 4 1\/2 star experience while there, but actually....it ain't. Waiting in line for 20 minutes at check-in, having 4 drunks in the hall screaming obscenities into their phone on my way to the room, crabby front desk personal when I went back to switch rooms, someone else's leftovers and half drunk OJ in the fridge, chocolate-carmel sauce ( I hope) on the vanity above the fridge, 3 foot diameter wet spot next to the bed, 18"" long black hairs wrapped around the feet of the scale, mattress warped and listing to the left, swimsuit made four shades lighter and bracelets severely marred by massive amount of chlorine in the pool, and no one answering the front desk phone because they're too busy.....none of the above lead to even a 3-star experience, let alone 4.5. Obviously the facilities are nicer than thousands of hotels lining the Interstate highway system around the US, but just because I-15 runs right behind the Aria doesn't mean they're competing with Super 8. Las Vegas doesn't lack for good rooms and you should probably go stay at one of those instead.",5,3,1

The beds are COOOOOOOMFY.. Steak and Eggs via In Room Dining was absolutely superb. The Sky Suites utilize Khiels for their toiletries, which is quite nice.  Especially the moisturizer in this dry heat.

We decided to give it a try again because its been so long and friends have had good experiences recently.  First day was great, beautiful upgrades and food was good.  Then today, our second day, the wheels fell off.  We got back to our room around 2am and the room was never serviced.  Trash cans full, bed not made, no clean towels.  Not idea to come back to when trying for a romantic evening! We called for towels so we can shower and when they arrived there was a hair tie in one with dark hair all in it (not ours) DISGUSTING!

The rooms are beautiful, but their remote control system for the TV, lights, and window curtains - not user friendly.  I'm in IT and I had to take my time to figure it out.  All I could think of is that if my parents were there - they would be hating that thing.  I do have to say, I do love the ""goodnight"" button on the wall.  Push that, the lights dim out and the curtains close on their own.  Lovely.

In the casino, it's your typical Vegas casino with the slots and tables games as far as the eye can see.  Some really cool casino floor bars as well.  What I really didn't like is that it was HOT!  Where's the A\/C???  And also, as a non-smoker, I smelled smoke everywhere.  Very poor ventilation system.  I was at a slot machine and the smoke scent was so strong, as if someone were right next to me, but there was no one in my whole area (this was late at night).

Aria is one of the hotels situated at the ""City Center,"" aspiring to be at the epicenter of Vegas.  Its embrace of modernity is evident from the moment you pull within view.

Upon entering the futuristic, metallic lobby, you'll notice a pleasant perfumed air.  I couldn't put my finger on what it was, or where it came from, but it definitely beat the smell of cigarettes and old people.

A security guard is posted in front of the elevators, requiring you to flash your room key for admittance.

The hallways are labyrinth-like, and split into separate pathways one too many times.  They keys are magnetic, so you just wave your room key in front of the doorknob.

The room we got (pretty standard one) was very clean, and sleek.  The sheets were amazingly soft too.  The bathroom had a 2-person shower and tub, which is standard for the newer hotels -- nothing outstanding.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to check out the pool, or dine at any of the restaurants. 

As it is currently one of the newest hotels, it is a bustling and loud place.  There is also a casino downstairs, but I would recommend staying away from the blackjack tables around check-in times because you'll probably be surrounded by players just killing time while waiting for their friends (which means they'll take the dealer's bust card, and have you walking with a stink face).

Finally, the service, from what I saw, was amazing.  When I was walking down the hotel hallways, I was greeted by at least 2 employees with a smile and ""hello.""  I'm not sure who recruited their employees, but they were successful in trying to make a good new-opening impression.",1,0,0

Easily the most elegant, clean, and beautiful interior design and decorating of any Casino in Vegas. Every item, on a small scale of course, would look great in an elegant mansion. You couldn't do that with for example, Encore's decorating. The low ambient but xlnt subject lighting levels, fantastic airconditioning, and scale make it my favorite over Wynn and Palazzo, my other regular hotels. The size of the casino is too long and large and distances to rooms and restaurants is very far. Dealers and staff appear to be the sharpest in Vegas. Many quit good jobs at Wynn, Venetian, etc to work here. Dealers are attractive, fit, charming types you'd invite to your home...not the typical Vegas chain smoking, burned-out slugs.  Beverage quality at table games is very shabby for this level hotel. Watered down everything, crummy wine but the waitresses actually take enough time to ask and are eager to rectify any complaints plus show thanks for any tip.  Everything works great in the rooms and the bed is superb and there's zero noise from neighbors and hallway.  Elevators are lightning fast.

This last stay, was completely unbelievable. I had a $900 necklace stolen out of our room by housekeeping, and my friend had her couple hundred tiffanys necklace taken as well. I know for a fact it was stolen because the clutch it was in was missing, and the necklace had a small tangle I didn't feel like dealing with right then, so neither ever left the room. I called the hotel. They couldn't have seemed to care less if they tried. On top of it, all of the electronics in the room are out of date. Touch screens were great a few years ago, but now are shot.

Wish I could give an extra half a star but I can't :(. This place isn't quite 4 stars just because it's pretty much like any other casino, and some of the dealers seem to enjoy taking your money. No I don't get bitter when I lose money, but when a dealer takes pleasure out of it, it is kind of a punch in the face. No matter soon enough I will be drunk and numb to the pain. The extra half star I would have awarded would have to be because they are the only casino that I've seen that offer double deck blackjack where dealer stands on soft 17. My understanding is that these are better odds than most blackjack games you can find on the strip.  The only caveat to this is these tables usually have 50 dollar minimums and 100 on busy weekends. Oh well bet big to win big right?

OH YEAH and they had 5 dollar craps tables while I was there so not too pricey all around.

Some dealers here are actually really cool too always helping you out with getting drinks for the servers and even worry about you drinking a lot of alcohol by requesting extra water bottles which is great since they aren't cutting me off either.",0,1,1

This was our first time staying at this hotel.  Needless to say we had a blast and our customer experience was met and exceeded.

Pros - Access to the hotel from the self parking lot was easy breezy.  I have always felt that in other hotels that the walk from hotel to the self parking lots is so far and too long.  The hotel - casino floor is very clean the air was fresh, I barely smelled any cigarette smoke.  The room was super awesome, we were on the 28th floor facing the pool and I can clearly see the Rio.  The best part of our customer experience is the beds felt like they hugged me when lying down.

Cons - 2 Cons - 1.) Once we reached our floor the walk from the elevator to our room seemed very long.  Good luck if you got a room further down the hall.  2.) Initially the bathroom specifically the location of the toilet smelled like smoke.  Im sensitive to smoke smell but in this instance the smell did not bother me.

Pros: clean, well appointed two-bedroom penthouse suite (about 2100 sq. ft.). Really nice amenities. Loved the Toto Washlet toilet. 

Limo service from and to airport.

VIP entrance makes your arrival nice and quiet. There is also a VIP lounge. Also nice. Additionally, any time we left the hotel we always returned through the VIP entrance. The service staff was always attentive through that side of the hotel.

Loved the proximity to the Cosmopolitan, which is where Milos (the restaurant) is located. A walk bridge connects the Aria and Cosmopolitan. Milos is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas (see my review of it).

My favorite pizza joint, Five50, is located inside the Aria. Nice bonus. 

Cons: the service staff was in our suite entirely too much. Between regular maid service, turndown service, and room service clearing, these guys always seemed to be around. This tip: decline the turndown service, so that the staff isn't showing up at your room at 10 pm.

Noise on night two was unexpected. Got woke up at 4:45 am by people above us or to the side of us. We were on floor 35, so there are two floors above us. I'm not used to having noisy neighbors when I stay in penthouses. (The MGM penthouses are top dawg when it comes to noise control. I think they stagger guests for as long as they can. Additionally, corner penthouses at MGM are perfect.)

Anyhow, we had a great stay at the Aria. Even though I didn't think this was a five-star stay, I do believe that Aria will deliver a five-star experience next time we stay here.",0,0,0

the decor is so modernized and beautifully crafted. i love the architecture as well! so i usually go with my friends and this was the first time i've ever seen an actual room in the aria hotel! it was really clean, and very interesting since my friend's parents are VIP members. 

because they're VIP we were allowed in the lounge area where there was snacks and drinks. there were sodas, coffee, fiji water, and juice. there were also little desserts, cookies, little toast, and different types of cheeses. we ended up stuffing ourselves nonstop.

okay, so upstairs! the room was amazing. it was special because of it was a suite. there was a dining table and a little bar area. there was also a sitting area with a huge tv. yay for cable! the bedroom was stocked with different types of chocolates in a neat little tiny box, and the restroom...my god the restroom was like heaven. it was the first time i've ever used such an advanced toilet. 

i know it might sound weird but the toilet was so warm. at first it shot water at my butt which i screamed and panicked about but later on it's actually very relaxing. 

the tub however, i could have probably drowned in considering how i'm only 5 feet. and it was really hard to climb out.

Cold architecture aside, the City Center is definitely very impressive.  While being massive, it is also very beautifully done and detailed.  The artwork and design of the bars and restaurants in particular is impressive.  An all-amethyst bartop at one of the casino floor bars; a purple-hued wall of Manet in another....just simply gorgeous in numerous establishments within the City Center.

The rooms, however, were less than desirable.  While very technologically sophisticated, they are simply average in Vegas terms-  not huge, low ceilings, brownish coloring, moderately impressive.  Similar to what you would find at Caesars or Mandalay, and NOT TOUCHING the Wynn.  

My biggest gripe about our experience was the extended waiting throughout our stay.  30-40 minutes standing at the check-in desk.  15 minutes on hold with the bell desk (in which case I ended up hanging up and physically walking down there to retrieve our bags), and extended holding every time we called the front desk.  Also, I ordered something from housekeeping and waited an hour for it to arrive.  Bring a book, people.

To sum it up- I am looking forward to visiting City Center again to dine, drink, shop, gawk and gamble, but I probably wont choose to actually stay there in the rooms once again.  A MUST see property, however.",9,0,1

Sent service up, and water was fine at that time.   But on checkout-   we brought down another sample and it was entered into the system like a routine complaint.   No big deal.

It is much more pleasing to the nose than a lot of the other casinos with straight cig smoke smell.  Check in was a breeze with little wait and a very friendly clerk behind the counter that provided us a map of the hotel pointing out the main attractions.  

We chose to eat our first meal at Cafe Vettro, and it was just ok.  We gave it a try the next morning, and it was just ok again.  Juliano Serranos was much more enjoyable.  We sampled around 6 tapas, and each were very nice.  

The room was very nice with a touch pad control tablet next to the bed, and our view of the strip was outstanding!  The bed was super comfy with plenty closet space for two.  Free wi-fi and other tech upgrades makes the room even more of an attraction.

My family stayed at Vdara; a hotel I had always stayed at and should have stayed again at. We ""my friends and I"" decided to stay at Aria. I ordered my room from a third party website and was under the impression that I was reserving a double occupancy room with 2 beds with an added $71.68 resort fee. Regardless, if you book a room directly with the hotel or the third party websites.. you pay for it. I was well aware that the resort fee was going to be included because it within the fine print. 

However, upon check-in I learned that you have to pay a $250 deposit.. thats bullshit when other hotels actually mention it and is only $100. Then I learned that double occupancy meant King bed... whatever 

Either way the front desk manager, Firas hooked it up with a roll away. 

Upon arrival to our room, our room was open with the electrician, Fernando was working in our bathroom. Really weird and off, he claimed he was in there because the hotel room wasn't ready yet... Clearly!

Later in the day the room IPAD didn't work that controlled the room electricity and blackout curtains. The Tv had issues and we couldn't get the music to work. Awful and had to solve this multiple times during Day 1. Our room had 3 lamps that didn't work.

It was a complete disaster... from the unsatisfactory rooms (beware: the Aria has a very loose interpretation of ""city view"") to the lazy housekeeping to the improper handling of my credit card at the salon. 

We booked three rooms for us and our wedding guests. I told the reservationist that I wanted three really nice rooms (but not suites) and that price was not an issue. I asked her to just book us the nicest rooms that weren't suites. Apparently, that translated to three rooms below level 15: one with double beds and one with only a ""wedge"" window, which is basically a prison-window view of the city. Very disappointing.

Housekeeping both nights included nothing more than bed-making and emptying the trash. Dirty room service plates and dirty washclothes on the shower floor were left for us to pickup ourselves. And forget about any tidying up. If it weren't for the new trash liner, I would have had no idea housekeeping came at all. Not exactly the room you want to walk into on your wedding night. 

I was pleased with the services at the salon (and for $1700, I should sure hope so), but I was surprised to find three additional charges on my credit card from the salon after I had left. Apparently, they had discovered a few extra items they had neglected to charge me for. Had they called me and informed me of this before re-charging my card, it would have been no problem, but the fact that they just went and charged it for additional items (some of the duplicate, I might add) seemed really shady. The fact that it took me almost four weeks to get someone from the accounting department to look into the issue and call me back was particularly perturbing, and the presence of accidental duplicate charges made it clear that the Aria salon is entirely haphazard with their customer's credit card information. 

My complaints fell flat at checkout, and it took me following up and asking for a manager in order to receive any offer of retribution. I was told they would email me a voucher for a free suite upgrade at my next stay, but it never came. Empty promises. 

At this point, even if I did finally receive the voucher I wouldn't stay at the Aria again. They seriously dropped the ball on a really important weekend for me, and two months later my anger still bites.",17,2,1

When we arrived, the hotel registration desk area is very nice.  The lady who had helped us was very professional.  The only thing that I am very pissed off after the fact is that she had put us on the 7th floor at the end of the hall, about 2 doors away from being the end.  The walk is far .  At that moment, we were not feeling it with this nice hotel.

As soon as we scanned our key card, we opened the door and everything was automatic.  The curtains slowly opened, the lights slowly glowed in the room and the TV turned on by itself.  Everything in the room is very high-tech.  

The very next day, we went to dine at the buffet.  The meal was well over $75 for 2 people.  I am so glad it was free as I would never EVER come back again.  The food selection was very disappointing.  The food was so-so.  There is nothing about Aria buffet that made me said ""WOW"" about it.  If we had to paid for this buffet... the only thing that would of made the ""WOW"" noise would of been our wallet.  Believe me, it would of been the kind of ""WOW"" as if ""Wow, you got ripped off"".  

Aria is very hype and stylish... it attracted very young crowds.  The casino is not big.  The pool is way over-rated.  The cystal mall that's attached to Aria is all over-priced items.  We walked into the LV store and NO ONE welcomed us!  

Although this place is right next to the Bellagio and across from Planet Hollywood.  Do not be fooled... It is not close at all.  You can take the free tram from Aria that brings you to the back of the Bellagio where you have to walk what seems to be 10 miles just to get to the poker room.  Aria is very inconvient to leave.  I've always been a big fan of nice big fancy hotel.  After this experience with Aria... I have learned to really appreciated locations such as Harrahs, Imperial Palace and Flamingo area.

First, we arrived to our room to discover that all of the toiletries were half used. The concierge called housekeeping and they delivered a TON of replacement items, which was sufficient, albeit annoying that a 5-star hotel would try to get away with something like that in the first place!

That night, we noticed that a lot of the electronics in the room did not work. The touchscreen next to the bed was not responsive to touch as it should have been and half of the screen had lines through it so it was tough to read. When we pressed the reading lamp buttons, ""goodnight"" was activated, closing the curtains and leaving us in the dark! We then had to get up and go to the hallway to press the buttons to open them again. 

When I showered that night, I noticed that the bathroom was pretty gross. There was a general layer of dirt around the edges of everything and soap scum on the walls of the shower and on the inside towel bar\/shower handle. I was tired so I let this slide until the next morning when I noticed that the magnifying side of the makeup mirror had foundation fingerprints on it and some disgusting yellow goo running down it. I called housekeeping to request that the room be cleaned again, and they said they'd send someone after 1:30 when we'd be out for the day. Of course, someone came at 1 and knocked despite the privacy light being on... at least he was polite and agreed to come back later.

When we arrived back at the room, the bed had been made and the trash had been taken out, but NONE of the dirt had been touched. In fact, the mirror had been TURNED AROUND AGAIN instead of being cleaned! Seriously, Aria? This is a 5 star hotel! After that, I decided that I would not take advantage of the soaking tub even though I usually do because I'm not all THAT picky about cleanliness. It really was that bad. :(

That night, I kicked a broken glass that was on the hallway floor, then watched as an Aria employee passing by looked right at it and kept walking. I was so fed up with feeling like I was paying 6x as much per night as a Super 8 to have an even worse experience that I called the concierge again to report everything. Her concern was obviously scripted, and she said that all she could do was offer me a food and beverage credit of $50 and extend our check out time to noon. Not exactly what I wanted, but better than nothing, I guess.

The next morning, I called the concierge back to make sure we could use the credit at the buffet. Since she said we could, we went at 11:05, five minutes into lunch. This was definitely my favorite Vegas buffet food out of the ones that I tried (Planet Hollywood and Cosmopolitan,) but even that had to go awry when I took a piece of cake from the desserts section and the employee putting them out yelled at me that they ""weren't ready!"" They weren't covered or anything and were obviously ""ready."" I guess he just wanted to have the whole shelf filled before anyone could take one? That really makes no sense and the whole exchange made me very uncomfortable, like I was doing something wrong for trying to eat food that I paid for! Which brings me to my next complaint...

I DID end up paying for the buffet, as no credit was ever applied to my account as promised! I couldn't review my folio upon checkout, because the TV remote wouldn't work (big surprise, I know,) and I had to call the concierge to check out for me (even though he initially advised me to check out at the front desk, which had a HUGE line that I definitely didn't have time to wait in before making my flight.) When I reviewed it later in the day via email, I noticed that I had been charged... which brings me to my NEXT ordeal: calling AR to try to get this resolved. After waiting 15 minutes on hold, I gave up and emailed, only to receive a canned response saying that they would address my email ""within 7-10 days."" 

I honestly could not be more disappointed in my first (and undoubtedly last) stay at Aria. I highly recommend skipping this place and staying at the Cosmopolitan if you can shell out the cash. If not, THEhotel at Mandalay Bay is cheaper and still nicer than Aria.",1,0,0

I would definitely come back here just to go back to that suite bathroom. I mean, the service was great and dealing with the front desk was much better here compared to many other Vegas hotels... but the suite bathroom was pretty legit.

The suite was a fairly good size and had a separate living room, king size bedroom, one full bathroom + one half bathroom. The full bathroom was huge and included a standing shower, large isolated jacuzzi tub, long sink area, and a technologically advanced toilet (I was too scared to push those buttons..not sure what would have happened to me). 

Talking about technology, the whole suite was pretty much automated. There's a tablet that allows you to control the curtains\/sheers, temperature, lights, and maybe even the toilet (seriously I have no clue what that toilet is capable of). It was awesome to have the curtains set to open at 10am to wake up everyone after a long night of Vegas antics. It's a corner suite, so the whole room is pretty much covered in windows.

Would I come back and stay here again? Well, I did have really good luck at the blackjack tables here, so that's a plus. I don't think I'd stay at a regular room for the price, though. If I got another free corner suite? Ohhhh yeaaaaaa. Maybe I'll even pay for the suite too if I get it at a good rate.

There isn't a rectangular room in the entire place -- every hallway and vestibule is woven into a wonderland of curves and arcs and gently leaning walls.  Everywhere you turn, there are surfaces of beautifully colored glass, fabrics, metals, wood, even water. 

The controls for the lights, curtains, thermostat, etc. are all electronic and controllable with the TV remote, and they're not too difficult to figure out after a few minutes.  The bed was luxurious and wonderful, and most everything else in the room was nice, all the way down to the carpets and bathroom fixtures.  During our stay, we had to call to get a light fixture repaired and get a replacement hair dryer, as both had conked out. 
 
Services are all excellent.  The people are friendly and personable, and prompt. 
 
But wow, everything is expensive!  If you take an item out of the room fridge for more than 60 seconds, they *charge you* for it.  There's no space in there for anything else, and they say they'll charge you $25 per day if you store other items in there.  So if you want to keep last night's leftovers cold, etc., be prepared to pay.  The restaurants range from expensive to extremely expensive; the spa will break the bank; and like much of the rest of Vegas, there's seemingly little or no place to sit down and just relax unless you're gambling or eating.  Aria feels like I'm trapped in a beautiful, futuristic sci-fi world where everything is oriented toward quickly sucking the money out of my pocket.  This was a nice place, but next time I'm visiting here I will only walk through the lobby and then spend my money somewhere else.",1,0,0

Finally after all theses years I was able to afford to stay there for more than a day. We first stayed at the Bellagio for a few days thanks to my wife's work. I want to say it was 3 days to long. Once we arrived to the Aria we were blown away at the difference between the Bellagio and Aria especially the customer service. 
 There's only one way to  describe the Aria in my opinion and that is ""to be seen"". No matter where you are in the Aria you can be seen. The design is and layout is brilliant. From the lobby to the the elevators to the pool to the bars and restaurants to the casino you will be seen. I love the openness of the whole casino. 
 One of the main reasons we loved the Aria was our room. Unlike the Bellagio our Aria room felt like a 5 star luxury hotel. It also had marble all over and beautiful bathroom. Our view wasn't bad either, had a strip, airport, I-15 view of the Monte Carlo. Our king room had two small couches and nice desk with an entertainment docking station that you could hook up your Ipod or compute to TV for free. And once again unlike the Bellagio we had a 32' flat screen that was a master controller of everything in the room from the TV to the curtains and lights all on a sleep or alarm mode. Last but not least our bed was super comfy with amazing pillows. 
 Our first day to relax we headed straight to the pool. Where once again we were blown away by the layout, customer service and the loungers (the kind that don't get hot). Plenty of shade to sun ratio with beautiful gardens separating the different areas. Funny thing wasn't till the second day I figured out they had four pools, silly me. Three that look similar and one Adult party pool (if you can call it that). This is my number one complaint with the Aria. The Adult pool is smaller than the others and cost $100 or more to sit down. They need to re think there adult pool it's not worth the free admission unless your wealthy than never mind. One other thing they do that most if any don't do is water stations with free water spread out all over. I really loved the Aria pools. 
 Simply put the Aria understands the Vegas experience with home like feeling. In my opinion it is definitely one Vega's best casino and hotels. We can't wait to go back as soon as possible and this time where bring the kids. I will take Aria over any other any day of the week. It's worth every penny spent and you get what you pay for. With trams and escalators all over it's easy to get around City Center and the strip.",1,0,0

Security is in effect at all times and you must show your room key to the attendant in order to go up the elevators to the rooms.

Let's talk about the room for a minute... An iPad comes with room. Its exclusive to the room and cannot be used outside of the room. You can order room service, take out, look up restaurants and bars, look up spas and other amenities or control your room such as the drapes or set the alarm. The thermostat can be controlled by the iPad, or you can go old school and use the wall thermostat to get the right temperature for you. There are remote controlled shades, and you can choose black out or sheer from the iPad too.

The room comes with a fully stocked mini bar with light snacks such as chips, crackers and assorted nuts. This comes at a price of course. Your room will be charged. The bathroom has a Garden tub and separate shower with a private toilet area.

There are 2 luggage racks, 2 closets, plenty of drawer space for your clothes and an iron and ironing board so there's no excuse to walk around wrinkled. There's a safe to store your valuables in the middle drawer of the nightstand. You create and program your own code. I absolutely loved this room.

The resort have a variety of restaurants, shopping choices and a game room with comfortable seating and stations to play XBox and PS4. Check their hours of operation if you're into gaming. The casino is huge and there's no shortage of whatever your gambling pleasure is. Bring plenty of money.

Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about the Aria. My experience was totally awesome!",7,2,6

Check-in was painless as the person was kind enough to show me how to set up my wi-fi (since I'm far from being the computer savviest person around). Which is why I panicked when seeing the tablet-like computer next to my bed....but it wound up that even someone like me could learn how to use it. Ipad comparisons are not good as you have to ""push"" the button rather than ""tap"".

Not that anyone goes to Vegas to sit in their hotel to watch TV, but you'll like the wall mounted sets that have good picture quality and carry all of the sports and news stations to catch up on events since you've been out all day losing your money gambling :)

I only have two other Vegas hotels to compare the stay to, so it was a pleasure to be able to shave with good lighting for a change and not cut myself! The toilet has it's own ""room"" within the bathroom with a door and comes in handy if you don't want to offend anyone who is with you :) 

The sports betting room may be on the small side, but I found it brought more of a ""coziness"" when watching the NBA playoff games as the place was packed. The guys placing your bets are all very friendly and didn't offend any newbie sports with odds questions. They kept the lines moving quickly just before tip-off.

Never heard any noise from any of the guests on either side of me. Although I did not have a strip view, I was still happy with the location on the 32nd floor.

I called the front desk on occasion for questions....never condescending and polite as could be. Felt a bit ill toward end of trip (no, it was not for too much partying) and they were accommodating with a request I had.

My only issue with the stay is the high blackjack minimums at off-peak hours. $15 may not be much for many who can afford the stay at the Aria, but I'm generally someone who likes to start off slow on my first night there just to shake the cobwebs. I'm not expecting a $5 table, but one or two $10 tables in the morning wouldn't be the end of the world. Table minimums for blackjack at night are $25.

My checkout was painless. Being a holiday weekend, they made sure to be adequately staffed, as they had someone at the front of the lines to point folks to the next available person. She was also answering questions some of those folks had which sure helped move things along and pleasant with everyone.

I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be near the middle of the strip, stay in a hotel that is modern with great service and you'll certainly get your monies worth.",0,0,0

Not that anything was truly horrible at Aria, but I was under the impression that City Center was supposed to be utterly amazing, and I left feeling really let down.  The hotel entrance is nice, the staff was decent, but the overall impression is just boring.  No special 'oomph' to anything.  I knew they were having money trouble finishing the CC, and it shows.  It's almost like they downgraded a lot of stuff, just to get the hotel finished.

The rooms are really small.  I mean REALLY small!  (And this was after paying for an upgrade!) The bathroom is tiny- no counter space to put anything!  Not that I really wanted to leave anything out, since the bathroom faucets allow water to splash everywhere.  The ""bells and whistles"" are nice in the room, cool features on the tv and lighting, but took awhile to figure out.

Ate at the buffet for breakfast, and the food was good although the ambiance stinks- looks exactly like my high school cafeteria did 20 years ago.  The Union cafe was good, had a great dinner and it wasn't too expensive.  Jean Phillippe cafe is yummy.

Saw the Elvis show and this was the definite highlight of the trip.  I'm not a huge fan of Elvis, but the show was really good and I would definitely see it again.  Great Cirque dancers and acrobatics- VERY cool sets too.

Crystals shopping was another HUGE disappointment, half the stores aren't open yet, and there's no life to the mall whatsoever- very cold, sterile- kinda looks like an unfinished airport.  I will go back to the Palazzo or Forum Shops for shopping from now on.

Like I said, not a horrible stay, just disappointing.  I will go back to Palazzo or Venetian for my next trip.",0,0,0

The rooms are all programed to open the curtains, turn on the lights and music when you enter the room each time which feels so cool when you come in.  

I had room service there once a few times and they were always great when making sure everything was okay and cleaning up and such-plus the food was pretty damn good (not the best for the price-but still tasty).  

I personally had no problems with my room at all-everything i requested was brought up promptly and everyone i talked to was very polite and accommodating-my friends however-all had TERRIBLE service.  They had to call room service repeatedly or they would clean the room while they were in there-some called 6 times for a roll away and never got it in the 3 nights they were there...things like that-so for their sake i took it down a few stars because they lacked over all consistency.

I go to Vegas because it has the best restaurants, shows, and 5 Star amenities anyone could ask for.  And now thanks to the City Center, the most beautifully crafted buildings in the world.

And that's how people need to view the City Center, as a modern marvel.  The most famous arictects in the world set out to make the most beautiful buildings and that's exactly what they accomplished.  The location is great.  You can easily walk to other hotels or take the monorail, unlike staying at the Wynn or Encore, where you feel separated from the rest of the strip.  Other than that, I was not impressed.  The rooms are adequate; the staff needs more training, which falls back to management.

I live in Las Vegas so I am well aware of how important hospitality is in this city. I was surprised to see how bad service was in MGM's newest property. 

Positives: We checked into the room and the guy at the front desk was awesome. He found out we were here for our anniversary and he upgraded our room to a strip view at no cost. We made sure we tipped him for the nice gesture. The weekend seemed to be starting out well. We got to our hotel room and it was beautiful. I am big on bathroom tubs because I love bubble baths. The design of the bathroom was clever with the shower and tub together behind the glass door. The front desk during checkout was friendly along with the bellman that waited by us in Valet with our bags. The best worker was Chandra. I hope that's her name. She's the one that goes around and signs you up for players cards. These few were the only decent workers in the entire hotel and casino. The highlight of our stay was the Aria spa. I highly recommend that place. 

Negatives: Bartenders at the sportsbar were horrible. They had terrible service. Not very friendly. Also not very present. We sat in the back because there were no other open seats but then we realized they barely pay attention to people sitting in the back. We tried both Friday and Saturday night. After having bad service on Friday we tried again because we saw there were different bartenders.  They acted the same way the bartenders were on Friday night. That's when we realized it's probably a management issue. 

Valet takes long. The workers in valet were nice but for some reason it took so long to get our car on a Friday night when we could see our car parked out in front. All we really needed were the keys. It was extremely windy and cold so it seemed even longer. 

Our service button light was broken in our room causing the mini bar attendant to open our hotel room door. He did it twice. My husband had to scream out to not open the door and to wait until we answered it. We got late check out but right at 11am during the regular checkout time, house keeping opened our door while we were sleeping.

Hotel\/Check in- EASY and breezy. The bellmen by the front door asked us if we'd like to have our luggage taken to our room. Well yes, of course. So all we did next is stand in line to check in. The front desk staff was professional and had a great smile. you can tell she isn't  tired or tired of doing the same thing over and over.

And housekeeping kept doing their duties quiet, too. You never hear them vacuuming or banging the doors at all. A-

PS: since we went around the time of the Chinese New Year, the lobby was decorated with dancing lions and stickers of ""Year of the RAM"" all over. NEAT.

Dining in the hotel: Aria has lots and lots of choices for dining. Ranging from casual to more upscale. I liked the Aria Cafe as it has a casual vibe and i believe it is opened 24Hrs. The hotel gave us $80 for the buffet. We ended up using it for dinner one night. The Buffet was ok. Standard with choices of 'meats, seafood, Asian food, salad, dessert bar. The wait staff - ha, the few ladies that waited around our area were discussing personal stuff with their manager. I prefer not to hear personal conversation while i dine. It's unprofessional. Don't think we can't hear you. We can. everything. for a 4-5 Star hotel the staff needs to be aware of what they're doing\/talking about. They were only few feet away. We decided to dine in at Jean Georges one night. It was a last minute decision so we couldn't reserve a table. Ended up sitting at the bar. The bar staff, Mike. was great. He was able to suggest wine for my husband(based on husband's wine preference) and made a non-alcoholic cocktail for me that went great with my scallop. Attentive but never over do it. B+

Spa\/Hair Salon: Front reception had two young women there. We went to make an appointment one woman was obviously busy counting something and all she said to me was ""hold on"". Never look up, never acknowledge us, never apologize that she would be with us in a few. NOPE. I finally went to the other receptionist when she was done with a customer. She was some what helpful.. as it turns out the front desk didn't add me onto the list so my husband would have to come back to the spa to sign me in. She told us we could go to the front desk and be re-added. Husband asked her to call front desk instead? Her answer was yeh she could but we would need to talk to them. Again, for a 4-5 star hotel just leave it to the guest to solve the problem. You're supposed to be clever enough to be the problem solver. Maybe they're just not getting enough training. I had shampoo and blow dry session. Shampoo session was under 3 mins. Didn't feel all that pampered or relaxed. Stylist blew my hair and styled it. I had to re-fix it afterwards. it was ""too done"" for me but hey no problem. Sadly i have to give this experience a C- due to the rude receptionist. Next time I'm in town, I'll go somewhere else that believes in true customer service. The resort area\/swimming pool . SPA . Some shops are located at the Pomanade

Misc: You can't ignore that there are plenty of slots and gambling tables in the lobby area. And private area\/rooms for the high dollar slots\/pokers.  there are also plenty of lounges\/bars. The delicious Jean Pillips patisseries is also at the lobby. YUM. you can even skip desserts and just come here and eat your heart out. Aria is connected to The Crystal shops where you can spend $$$$$ on all the designer goods. One of the higher end shopping center.

Picked this hotel, because of  the contemporary decor, shows entertainment, location, and cheaper than the Wynn and the Mandarin. I checked out the Wynn and the Mandarin before booking the Arias. I selected Arias because of the specific activity that I wanted to do. Bonus was the cost. If you like contemporary, then check out Mandarin and Arias. Wynn costs more, but I would have paid less than Arias bc of the gift card that I have. Personal preference, I like Arias decor better.  I would stay at Mandarin orient if I want a quiet retreat and personal services, and no smoking.  I had gone there for drinks and dinner, and love the service there. Arias is somewhat crowded on the weekends, and signs were not easily post in locations where guests can find directions. I had to stop and asked for directions to the tour lobby. There were no signs at the concierge next to check in areas where I picked up my show tickets. I had no ideas that I can pick up my tickets there. Thank God, there were a hotel staff standing nearby that directed me to that desk.  Overall, it was a nice stay and would stay there again. Parking tips. Park at the crystal court valet if there are long line at Arias valet.",0,0,0

We had a beautiful floor to ceiling view of the mountains, Vdara and the Palms with blackout curtains, a very stylish bathroom (not very private but we managed), lots of closet space, and the most comfortable pillow-top mattress I have ever experienced. Seriously, Aria's mattresses have ruined all mattresses for me. Now I cry a little bit every time I have to sleep on mine. It was hard to get myself out of bed in the morning even though I was in Vegas, and it made me look forward to collapsing drunk onto it in the early morning hours.

I loved how everything was controlled by buttons, including the privacy and service signs for your door, curtains, TV and mood lighting. All of the staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful. Aria's pool area is great because there are a few separate pools and hot tubs, instead of one big pool for everyone. The hotel is huge, so they had some cute boutiques, a gelato shop, a chocolate shop where I had a crazily expensive but delicious crepe, and probably other things that I never found out about. Also, witnessing my friend win $1200 on a slot machine in Aria's casino didn't hurt. Although I want to try other hotels on the Strip in the future, I would come back here in a second.",2,2,2

In my spacious, well appointed suite on the 24th floor (#24250), one of the iPads that controls the room was off line. And in 3 areas on the short walk from my suite to the elevator, the hallway carpet was torn at the seam, and it looked like it had been that way for some time (frayed and pulling away).

Casino-I got lost in this casino because it's so large and the decor is amazing. You walk in and it screams luxury and high class. I felt very booshie in this place. Table minimums were kinda high. Lots of slots to choose from. Definitely a good casino to gamble in. I lost a lot of $$$ here. fML

Comfortable bed and pillows, electric curtains and shades, a tablet that is wireless in the room controls everything (tv, lighting, mood lighting, phone, room service, hotel requests, etc) bathroom was the best. Private toilet area to take a dump and explode, double sinks with TV, shower and hot tub joined. I could get a little crazy in the bathroom.

Staff- so friendly, we passed 3 employees walking to the room and all said hello and if we needed anything extra. M life front desk even called us in the room and asked if everything is up to expectations.  Luxurious!

It wasn't even crowded but it took FOR-FREAKIN-EVER to move and check in. We had requested and even placed a despoit for 2 double queens but they messed up and sold out of those so they gave us 1 king. Fine fine I can deal with that. I requested a room closest to the elevators, they gave a room that was in the boonies! Seriously the 2nd to last room at the farthest end of the hallway possible. WTF?! So we finally went upstairs and trekked our way to our room... guess what. THE KEYS DIDN'T WORK! Greeeeaaatttt! Fantabulous. We called front desk and they said they will send someone from security to open the door for us. After waiting for a while, the security guy just came. He was rude and told us we had to call front desk to get new keys. He didn't want to open the door at first. That's why you're there buddy!

- Rooms were large, and very tech-savvy. All i know is the ""Goodnight"" button that shuts of everything is wonderful. The blackout shades will be the death of me! The rooms are so dark you'll have a hard time telling if it time to wake up!

Upon check-in, I asked about my $75 resort credit as listed on the website when i booked my room. I was informed that because of the special rate I received (a 72-hour sale), I did not get the credit. I saved $60 to lose out on a $75 credit.The check-in lady seemed to care less and didn't seem to want to be working that day.  On top of this, there were no suite upgrades as the hotel was full (no big deal here). Minus one star for a bad start to the weekend.

I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel itself. The rooms were very nice and very modern. The casino was nice and the bars were fairly cool as well. The pools were nice. There are three to choose from and then there is a pay-pool called Liquid which i did not try. The spa was inexpensive at $30\/day. What was nice about the spa was the outdoor pool overlooking Liquid. 

After drinking all night and waking up with a hangover, i thought I forgot how to work with electronics because nothing in my room worked. No lights, couldn't open the curtain, the TV wouldn't turn on, etc. After waiting for engineering to show up for 45 minutes, I finally got my room 'powered up' again. Evidently, I wasn't alone as a sudden power surge caused a large number of rooms to go dark. Minus one point for making me think i was too hungover to turn on the lights.

Heading south on Las Vegas Blvd, we almost missed the one turning lane.

We got upgraded to a strip view room that was just absolutely gorgeous. The employees at Aria exceeded our expectations as everyone was just soooooo friendly and helpful even at the smallest things. Directions to the elevators? The guy walked us to it. 

The architecture and decor are all gorgeous. The only downside is that food at Aria absolutely blows. Café Vettro was so stunning but the food tasted so bland that I could not imagine dining there ever again. There are no food courts or chain stores anywhere in the City Center.  To get any cheap eats, we j-walked the blvd to go to McDonald's only to see a couple getting it on at 11 am on the stairs of the City Center.

I would NOT stay here again.  Their customer service and attention to detail is horrible even though the cost to stay at this hotel is high.

Our trip was booked as a package through expedia.  My boyfriend called the hotel ahead of time to book my spa services through the concierge.  Because we were booking such an expensive spa package the concierge told us that we may be eligible for a free room upgrade and that we should talk to the front desk associates to see if it could be done.  When my boyfriend spoke to the front desk over the phone they flat out refused.  I told him i would ask when we arrived.

When we arrived at the hotel the front desk clerk was surly and unhelpful and when I asked about the room upgrade he offered to upgrade our room, for an additional $70 per night.  He then proceeded to tell us that room upgrades are specials and that they were not having any of them during our stay.  (OK so there is OBVIOUSLY a communication problem going on between the concierge and the front desk.)  We aked if there would be a hold placed on the credit card that was used to book the room.  Normally there is, but BECAUSE the room was PRE-PAID we felt that IF there was going to be a HOLD it shouldn't be for the full amount.  But the clerk assured us that there would be NO hold on the account.  Just to be sure we clarified and asked again.  And he answered 'No, there won't be a hold placed on the credit card.'

When we got up to the room, it was VERY 'high-tech' (not in a good way).  We are pretty tech-savvy but it took us a while to figure out HOW to work everything.  Come to find out that one of the light-bulbs in the bathroom were out.  (This to me means that they do NOT check the room after a guest has checked out OR before another guest checks in.)  I called the front desk and they sent someone to fix the light.  For some reason after they had fixed that light, the MASTER switch for the room was messed up in the process.  I had to call AGAIN, and then AGAIN.  My boyfriend had also made a request for something for me in the room that was NOT there upon arrival.

We went to have dinner at SAGE in the hotel.  The dinner was fabulous but EXPENSIVE at $400.  My boyfriend used his credit card, but it got declined because of a $700 HOLD.  We had asked TWICE if there would be a hold placed and both times we were told 'NO'.  We ended up charging the meal on our room, and proceeded to the front desk.  We spoke to a clerk at that front desk and he assured us that it was a mistake, then he spoke to the night manager about it.  The night manager said that he would have the hold removed BY the next morning.  We also requested a late check-out which the clerk said they would comp because of all of our trouble.

The next morning my boyfriend called and checked his credit card, the hold had NOT been removed.  So we went BACK down to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager.  We went through the entirety of our issues.  She blamed the front desk clerk who we had at check-in for not giving us the proper information, and said that the concierge had NOTHING to do with room upgrades.  She did waive our resort fee and give us a $75 food and beverage credit for all the trouble, which we accepted.  She also offered to upgrade our room (but we were only there for one more night and moving all of our belongings would have been more of a hassle so we opted out of that).  She said that they would be SURE to fix the lighting issue in our room.

When we got back up to our room the light issue was STILL NOT resolved.  The next day was our check out so before we went to sleep I told my boyfriend to CALL and make sure we had late check-out.  He called, and what do you know?? We did NOT have late check-out.  The next morning went to get our boarding passes printed (which is included as a part of the services you pay for through the resort fee).  We were waiting in line (with one person ahead of us) for the concierge to print our boarding passes, when one of the employees pulled us away and directed us to the 'free' computers that we could use to do it ourselves, but the computer wanted to charge us.  So we had to go BACK to the concierge desk and stand back in line (there were now FIVE people ahead of us).  After we had checked out we went to the coffee\/deli area to get food before we went to the airport.  We ended up waiting 20 minutes for confirmation of our food and beverage credit.

I really wish I would have taken pictures but I did not want to intro negativity and distract my husband from his birthday festivities. ALSO, the bed in the room was unbelievable lumpy and uncomfortable.  My husband and I both did not get any sleep and woke up complaining of back pains.  For the price we paid for the room we should have been blissfully rested. NOPE! 
We went to the spa and it was the same feeling worn and old. The salt room is ridiculous, the hot stone beds were sticky and dirty. All the trash cans were overflowing.  It did not have an upscale feel whatsoever.  
A month or so after our stay we met up with some friends that were visiting from Texas for dinner.  We were going down the elevator when the heels of my Louboutins somehow became wedged in between the grates of the step i was standing on.  Luckily i felt my shoes sink in so I was able to jump out of my shoes and grab one of them out.  My other shoe I was not able to get out of the grate in time and it became stuck at the bottom of the escalator.  NO ALARM was sounded.  The escalator continued to move and crunch away at my shoe.  All four of us could not find the emergency off switch as several minutes passed by because it is a small button that is almost hidden.  My husband was finally able to pull my shoe out.  At least 20 minutes passed before we were able to get a hold of security, and security did not come because they noticed in cameras that something was wrong but bc my husband went to find someone who then called security.  When security came they were a bunch of douche bags that need lessons in how to communicate with human beings.  I was given the number for risk management and told to call in the morning.  I called several times before they returned my phone call in which the risk management representative quickly deflected onto the escalator company.  Long story short I have called risk management numerous times about my complaint and NO ONE has gotten back to me.  Luckily my shoe was not a strap on because I would have been seriously injured.  
All in all the ARIA is worn, dated and extremely overrated.  The rooms are lackluster, the spa leaves much to be desired, the escalators are dangerous to say the least and the hotel is staffed by a bunch of morons.

I just returned from my 3rd stay at the Aria in the past 2 years. This was my favorite hotel in Vegas until recently. I loved staying there and had not really given much thought to staying somewhere else. My previous trips were all excellent. 

Most people on here write a negative review that generally stems from an event or two that leaves a bad taste in their mouth .. like a broken lamp, a noisy neighboring room, housekeeping forgets to re-stock shampoo, etc ..

However, I am disappointed in the overall decline in service at the Aria. During my last trip (5 days, 4 nights) the hotel just felt seriously understaffed at ever corner. Everything was a wait, everything. It feels like, and this may be true for all I know, that the hotel needed to cut costs and just laid off 30% of their staff. The hotel is still immensely popular, but at every turn it feels like they are running on a skeleton crew. 

I gambled at the tables for over 45 minutes before a waitress came by.  I waited at check-in for over 30 minutes. Every day I waited at least 20 minutes for breakfast at Cafe Vettro - and I went at various times .. 8:30, 9:30, 10:30 .. and every time I waited, and every time the restaurant was only half full. 

Anyways, I want to love this hotel again, but I don't think I'll be booking there in the future. It is a great facility, and a great location .. but I've been getting better service at hotels that I am not staying in.

The room might not be likable for a person who is not into pushing switches. You have to push switches for the curtains, for the lights and other functions. Our switches did not work 100%, especially for the curtains. Also, our lightbulb was out, so we had to call maintenance. Not huge issues at all, but may annoy some people. Lighting was not very good in the hotel room. I would not recommend this hotel for an older crowd because it was difficult to read things with very bad lighting. Beds were comfortable.The bathroom is very open and if you have anyone who is weirded out about privacy issues, it may annoy them that the toilet room has a glass door that is muted out. You can still see someone sitting on the can, but if feels like you can see people and they can see you. 

The phone in the room has a cordless phone and a plugged in phone. There is not button for ""the front desk"" so some people may wonder who they should call. There are plug ins for people who are really techy. The safe was in a dresser drawer. We spent a good amount of time looking for it. 

The hotel itself is detail oriented with fabrics. If you walk around you'll notice that the walls have different patterns and fabrics. Go check out some of their beautiful and delicious restaurants.

You CANNOT USE the refrigerator for your own drinks. Also you don't get even a single complimentary water bottle in a room which is $250 per night off season. I would recommend staying in Wynn or Bally's at the same price.",1,2,0

The mini mart in the lobby has everything you might need during a weekend in Vegas...

Love the poker room.  Nice and wide open, lots of tables, and you can get on a $1\/$3 table pretty easily without having to wait.

The sports book is roomy as well, and unlike most of the other casinos, you can often get a seat.  

And the restaurant is BIG and stays open 24 hours per day.  The food was solid, maybe even better than solid.  I can't come up with a word that is a little better than solid.  Solid plus?  Extra solid?  Uber solid?

 My parents as well as my husband and I both had rooms with 1 king sized bed. For whatever reason we didn't get 2 beds as we normally do when traveling with our 3-year-old and she thrashes when she sleeps so I was not looking forward to spending 2 nights being kicked. When we left our room to walk the strip on the first day we ran into housekeeping. We asked her if she could have a cot sent up for the baby and she was so nice. When we came back to the room she had made up an adorable little bed for our daughter by pushing two chairs together and securing them with the sheets. She even set up her stuffed animals, our daughter was delighted with her bed and we were delighted we didn't have to pay extra for a folding bed or get kicked all night!

My father can be a hard man to please ( he has a slight Tony Soprano complex) and even he was impressed with the hotel service. He had a problem checing in, and for my father that could have tainted the whole weekend, but everyone was so accomodating and called to check to make sure everything was ok, even he was pleased.

We tried to lay out by the pools, which were very nice looking but of course we got the 1 windy, cold day of the year and only lasted about 15 minutes outside.

They called the desk and the desk sent someone up to the room to try to help. Within a couple of minutes, someone came up to check out the key card and found out the door lock had broken so they gave me a new room and brought the new key up to me. I was definitely surprised on how well and quickly they handled the situation.

GREAT:
* hotel is located centrally on the strip
* has an internal free tram that takes you from Monte Carlo to Bellagio
* beautiful decor, with high celling
* modern rooms with remote control access on tv
* security guards for room access
* great restaurants within the hotel
* easy access to Crystals at City Center
* outlets and laptop access are easily located on TOP of the desk, made it easy to charge your phones and connect the laptop to the tv

GOOD:
* ventilation, I am sensitive to smoke and I did not feel it unless I was walking next to a smoker
* 3 pools with LifeGuards and lots of lounge chairs
* shear curtains, blackout curtains and lights are automated and can be controlled with the tv remote control

NOT SO GREAT:
* the check in process took a great deal of time, we were waiting in lines of 4 and deeper with waits of 30 mins and more. This was with 8 front desk people working.
* when entering the room, two light were out one in the bathroom and another in the closet (I would expect those basic fixture to be resolved)
* sound proofy of the windows is not so great, I could hear noise from the strip clearly
* the in room frig is filled with mini bar items, without room for anything else
* the mini bar was not turned on, so everything in it was room temp
* the toilet is separated from the sink and tub by a slightly distorted glass door, but NOT enough where you feel comfortable sharing the bathroom. You could easily see the person on the other side.

Somethings that I would recommend that the hotel have ready in the rooms, seeing as how automated the room is:
1. have the tv turn on when guess enter the room for the first time showing the amenities of the room and how to use the remote control
2. turn on the mini bar frig and leave room in it if we want to place food there
3. check that all basic lights and functions of the room are working",1,1,0

It is clean, modern, new, and it doesn't smell from smoke. They have some kind of nice smelling fragrance in the air. All of the employees have smiles and are extremely polite and helpful. The management must have a top notch program because you could definitely tell that each person that works at the Aria is finely trained in their jobs. The room was gorgeous, with comfortable beds and a large bathroom. I liked that everything it high tech. You can control the temperature, drapes, wake up calls, etc. all from the television! We appreciated the security downstairs controlling the entrance to the elevators. We had a view of the strip and at night it was impressive. We had two closets and plenty of drawers. Don't touch anything in the mini bar because it is all computerized and you will be charged. Wish there was more room in the mini bar to put a few of our own bottles of water. By the way, you can't find a cup of coffee or a bottle of water anywhere in the hotel for under $4.00.  Plenty of nice restaurants to chose from and many shops to walk through. We didn't use the pools, but we did walk out to see them and there are many to choose from. We ate breakfast at Cafe Vettro which was good. Had a dinner at Lemongrass, the Thai restaurant. That was awesome, but as with all of the restaurants in the Aria, a little pricey. $20 for fried rice....really? 
Speaking of pricey, I understand room taxes at hotels. But they charge a resort fee of $22 per day. What do you get? Free Wifi (don't need it with an iphone) a free newspaper which is not delivered to your room, and use of the fitness center. When I asked about taking that off the bill I was told that they couldn't, so now tack that on to the room taxes and the price starts to rise. Other than that issue, I would stay at the Aria again.

Definitly get your car valet parked.

The entrance and getting to your room is NOT convenient at all. You have to walk 6-7 minutes just from the strip to get to the entrance of the hotel, then another 10 minutes walking thru the casino with your suitcase and crap to get to your room which the elevators are located in the back!

We frequently visit Vegas and this was our first time staying at Aria. 

The Sky Suites have set the bar high. I can't imagine staying anywhere else on future trips.

Since it was our wedding weekend, our coordinator, Marissa took care of most of the details. She arrange a limo to meet us at the airport and take us directly to the courthouse for our license. This was a breeze. I really like at the Sky Suites have a dedicated entrance to the hotel and everything was so easy.

Our room was modern and gorgeous. It had a ton of tech features that kept my husband happy. in particular, he liked the lighting and the toilet. He wants to install one of the Japanese- washing toilets in our house. I'm not so sure... I loved the bed. It was one of the best two-nights of sleep that I have ever had in my life. It was like sleeping on a cloud. I also loved the bathtub and took a bath each day. The shower had awesome water pressure. 

We had an amazing view out towards Red Rock. They had no clue when they gave us this view, but we had our first kiss atop the Voodoo Lounge at the Rio, so it was very cool for us to have this view on our wedding weekend!

I really enjoyed the VIP lounge. We stopped by for coffee every morning and didn't even miss our usual Starbucks Latte. The chocolate covered strawberries in the evening were divine. The staff was very helpful and personable. It was nice to always have bottled water available. 

We had a few hiccups with the concierge when trying to make reservations via the phone. At one point, we wanted to eat at Javiers and they made reservations for us. We showed up to find that the restaurant was closed. It was just odd. No big deal though.

We got a couples massage in the spa. Although compared to other massages that I've experiences, it was steep in price, the experience was still good. The facilities are very nice. We really enjoyed the coed areas, especially the outdoor spa. 

I wish it had been warmer when we attempted to use the pool. It was too cold to really enjoy it, but I loved the lay-out and hope to be able to use it on a future visit. It has a good vibe.

Our wedding experience at the Aria was wonderful. In particular, Marissa was a huge help. She was attentive and quick to answer our questions. We got married on a Saturday evening in the Fireside lounge. The location was beautiful. We added a pianist, which made the quick ceremony extra special. The minister was fantastic. His wedding sermon felt personal and had just really nice sentiments. We had two photographers that were top-notch. They took us all over the Aria and got some very cool\/ not so traditional photographs. 

We were all around pleased with our wedding and I would not hesitate recommending the Aria to other couples. They made our Vegas elopement a special experience.",4,0,2

It was a girls weekend and it was either Cosmo or Aria and according to the room and price- Aria was our home away from home for the weekend. 

When we got to the hotel- we were told that our room was being cleaned so decided to hang out in\/around the hotel since it was gonna be ready soon and they were going to call or text us according to the front desk.  We were all tired from our drive and we just wanted to lay out of the pool and relax before going out.  We had it all planned out and everything was gonna work out perfectly until the carpet was pulled beneath us. 

We were waiting SOOOOOO long at Starbucks- we decided to call down to check. They said they made a mistake (Yano, I don't even know if they admitted it to us- they prob just said they had more than expected or something) and it turns out that they were fully booked.  We called to talk to a manager Because this room was book way in advance- it wasn't like we walked in and got a hotel at that very second. 

After talking to multiple people and an hour or so went by- we finally get a room.  He upgraded us to a higher floor and something else but it was so minute, I can't even remember what it was.  Don't lie to us and leave us hanging. If we didn't call to see where our room was at, we would've been sitting at Starbucks for hours.  Just be upfront and honest- it made everything worst by lying giving us the runaround.

Yes, it's big and shiny, but I am not a particular fan of Aria or City Center in general. I will give a few reasons. The casino is big and cavernous not appealing at all, it is trying to hard to be Los Angeles,and if you have read some of my other reviews, I hate Los Angeles, I hate even more when Las Vegas doesn't feel it has its own identity and style and feels that it has to steal from Los Angeles. Next it is designed like an MC Escher drawing, to get to the convention center you have to up then down then up again, simply shameful. Every other hotel casino on the Las Vegas strip you can walk by with no or very lute incursion, at City Center you have to walk up and down and be taken off the strip. Lastly my take is that they could not care less about Las Vegas community, they never created the jobs they said they would, and they do very little in the way of outreach, nor do they bring in the $$$$ they claimed they would. There are better places to go that are designed more intuitively and are more appreciative of your business. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",2,1,1

also to mention, the guest in line ahead of us took over 20 minutes to check-in. after the guest got loud and expressed his unsatisfactory, he turned to us and says, ""yell if you don't get what you want!""

check-out was just as long of a wait in line for a clerk.

earlier, we had left our luggages at the bell desk to hold.  after checking in they say it would take ""10 to 15 to 20 minutes for the bell person to deliver to the room.""  the luggages arrive a bit over 30 minutes later.

about 45 minutes into our stay in the room, 2 hotel attendants waltz into our room without knocking and were shocked we were occupying it.  they said the room was lit as ""vacant""

now to the rooms... 
PROS:
kudos to the blackout drapes.  man, they surely helped for me to sleep longer!  props to the innovative feel with everything being touch-screen or remote controlled.  their beds are COMFY!  i dig the modern, feel of the bathroom

other than those pros listed, there was nothing great about the rooms.  
the room wasn't too big either.  it was disappointing to realize how dusty the room was.

I don't like the fact that they would not guarantee a non-smoking room when making a reservation (which was a big deal to me), but when I checked in, that was a non-issue.  I got my non-smoking room on the 35th floor.

I kind of had my mind made up before I arrived, that I would not like Aria.  I like modern, but for a Hotel, I usually like something more along the lines of the Wynn or Bellagio.  After staying at Aria, it is now one of my favorite Hotel's on the strip.  Here's why:

It's well designed!  
Some reviewers complain about the layout, and the amount of walking.  That is the issue with most large Hotels on the strip.  Since I was in Vegas for business, and my conferences were at Bellagio (1 1\/2 Hotels away), and I needed to be at the Conference Room at 7am;  I needed to know my way around fast.  I didn't have time to F**k around.   I studied the Hotel map.  I was able to walk from my room on the 35th floor, out the door, into the Vdara (next door), to the walkway that connects Vdara to Bellagio, and into the Bellagio Conference Room in 7 minutes. Yes, no exaggeration, 7 minutes!  No stupid $20 Taxi needed, No Trams were operating,  it was all on foot.  I couldn't believe it.  Anyone who is familiar with the area can appreciate just how amazing that is.  And that is possible because if its genius design.  Simplicity.  With 4000 rooms, plus tourists, its designed for a large scale of people.  Its efficient, and the foot traffic doesn't  bottleneck, unlike at the Bellagio.  When I stayed at Caesars Palace it took 15 minutes from my room to the Casino Floor because of their stupid elevator.  And as I recall, I wasn't on a high floor (I'm weird, I time that kind of shit.)  At Aria, everything is easy to get to from your room.  Yes, you do walk a long way from the elevator to your room, but Aria is also a massive Hotel.  Another word about design.  I arrived and left the Hotel via Airport Ground Transportation.  The Transportation areas are another well designed part of Aria.  There is no Ciaos.  The Valet is separated from the Taxi's, and customer drop off, and Limos. Everything is isolated. Shuttle Buses go underground, and do not share the same entrance and exit as Self Park.  Everything flows smoothly, and is managed, and the employees keep track of everything.  Compare that to other Mega Hotels in town, were most of the transportation siphons through the same general area.  Hotels like that stress me out, and I won't stay at places like that anymore.  Why?  I leave a hectic airport, to just to arrive at a Hotel with the same kind of hectic atmosphere.  That's not my idea of relaxing.

It's modern and Up to date.
Since I came to Vegas for work related reasons, my needs were slightly different than being there on pleasure.  The Aria is a hard property to compete with if your looking at modernization.  The Business center is impressive and for all you Virtual Office types,  Aria will be right up your ally.  You need a virtual office, they can supply you with one.  Call ahead to see what the pricing is though.  I also like that although they offer a free newspaper, you have to go to the lobby shop to get it.  Why do I like that? Because Newspapers are Dinosaurs.  Aria is an Eco Hotel.  Eco stands for conservation.  I would absolutely hate seeing papers delivered to every guest room, especially when most people don't even read newspapers anymore.  Newspapers are shrinking in size and content, because they struggle to stay in business.  I can hardly wait for them to suffer the same fate as Paperback Phone books.

Entertainment.  
I had about an hour to enjoy the pool.  What I really liked about the pool, is that inside the pool complex was a Day-Club called Liquid.  I appreciate the fact that Aria would recognize the value at creating something like that.  The Party Animals who can't wait for nighttime to go to a Night-Club, can go to the Day-Club.  And because they will segregate themselves in a walled off area, they won't be infringing on families with kids.  Genius.  If you want a drink, you can go to the Bar, if you want to Party, go over there.

In all, Aria is a good stay.  Water pressure is good, lots of Hot water, comfortable beds, and super high tech room.  Oh, and big room safe, enough for a laptop and a lot of other crap.  If you can't find it, check your nightstand.  Its safely mounted in the bottom drawer.",3,0,0

Aria switches between a 4 and a 5 for me.  The first couple of times I stayed there it was a 5 without question.  I loved how, in a city where everything is so over-the-top it's almost goofy, Aria is modern, simplistic and yet elegant.  

The casino floor doesn't wreak nearly as bad of smoke as some nearby casinos.  In fact, I think it smells amazing due to whatever scent is being infused.  

Every time we've gone we've had the option to wait for a room in a more desirable location in the hotel (higher floor, strip view, etc.).  At some properties on the strip just a strip view could cost more per night.  At Aria, if it's available, it's yours.  And if it's not, you can wait for it if you choose.  

The rooms are modern, clean and luxurious, and highly technological with a remote that controls almost everything in them - including the curtains, lighting, and the TV's.  You can choose entire ""moods"" and lighting schemes with the touch of a screen and everything in the room will adjust accordingly.  What a nice touch.  And my husband, who loves his tech-y gadgets, got a real kick out of this the first time we saw it.  The bed, bedding and pillows are HEAVENLY.  I want the whole set up in my home.  

We upgrade to the corner suite each time we go and it's so worth it.  The floor to ceiling windows lend themselves to amazing views of the strip and valley.  

Self parking is always easy enough there.  

We've seen Zarkana and loved the theater.  The bars are typical but nice.  We haven't eaten anywhere except Lemongrass, which was OK but just isn't our favorite kind of food.  Service was great there, though.  The property, including public restrooms, is always spotless.   I love the Jean Phillippe patisserie and the gelato\/coffee shop upstairs by the pool, although the lines are always ridiculous.  The buffet was absolutely nothing special but we went about 3 years ago and it's since been redone.  The spa is way overpriced and, although nice, certainly not the best I've ever been to.  But the gym is great and offers everything you need for solid workouts during your stay!  

The service is where things get dicey for me.  I've had terrible customer service around the property, including when we tried to order gelato once with a free voucher, but something was wrong with the computers and the shop could only accept cash.  The employee said, ""well you can either pay cash or not get anything.""  Quite the problem-solvers, those Aria employees lol.  

Overall, this is my favorite place to STAY on the strip.  I can't say it's my favorite place to eat, drink, or gamble.  But as far as hotel stays go, it's one of my all-time favorites!",5,0,1

at the entrance where Haze is located, they blast some strong scent in the air that's so overpowering you cant think straight. it was so strong it gave me a headache. idk why they do that. that's the only thing that bugs me. aside from that, i have no other complaints. the hotel is beautiful outside and in, and if you can afford to stay at least a night i highly recommend it..!",1,0,0

Then only one room was available which was fine so we waited until we got paged that the room is ready and we get our keys and head up to find the room not made and all the dirty sheets in the bathroom all bundle.
We requested better service since we waited longer than usual. We did get a $150 credit and the $40 resort fee waive, Thanks..
The service at the pool sucked tremendous. We had two cabanas and two waitresses...

If you want to try the spa or gym you don't get the usual package deal the other hotels are giving you, which is so funny ""you can workout but you can't shower"". The buffet is a joke.

I'm more of a shopper than a gambler so I spent more time in the retail spaces but I did spend enough time lounging in the casino area to be sufficiently impressed with the environment. Aria has a very distinct smell which I instantly loved and connected with. The ventilation system is state of the art and in addition to the normal system, each slot machine in the casino has a built in air filtration system which sucks in air in the immediate viscinity and filters it back out. I love the al fresco cafe at the pool but it was so hard to find my boyfriend and I nearly gave up before finally finding the entrance. The room itself was awesome. I won't go into details because so many others have, but the room greeting you is a nice touch. As my boyfriend said when we first entered ""I feel like I'm in the future."" 

The spa is also awesome. I'm a spa fiend and was delighted to encounter new spa features. The spa at Aria features the Shio Salt room and the Ganbanyoku Beds, both of which were new to the spa experience for me. I loved the Ganbanyoku beds... just thinking about them relaxes me. One of the coolest features of this spa is the fact that it features multiple ""co-ed"" areas where you can co-mingle with opposite sex companions.

The casino\/restaurant area is pretty nice but I wouldn't expect anything less from a brand new hotel.  We did eat at a couple of the places there but I'm just here to talk about the room.

The room seemed small but it was decorated nicely.  The AC really didn't seem to work at all as the temp was stuck at 70 no matter how low you set it.  We had it set at 62 and the room was always 70.  Not a big deal but it could get annoying after a while.  

One of my biggest complaints is the funky room controller they have there.  There are two control panels on the wall as well as a touch screen thing close to the bed.  You can close the drapes and turn off and off the lights from the things which most people would be like ""wow...that totally cool"" but the response time from you pushing the button and it actually doing it is about 1-2 seconds.  So you could be hammering away at the button and nothing would be happening, which is probably why some of the bottons seemed like they weren't working.

The bathroom was wierd.  The door for the bathroom is an unusually heavy sliding door.  Once you get that thing going it's hard to stop it before it plows into the other side.  The shower stall has a tub in it....not sure why they have it that way because usually the tub and shower are separated from eachother but who knows?

Overall I have to say it is a nice hotel but I probably won't be staying here again.",1,1,1

Contemporary\/Up-to-date\/Hi-Tech design and decorating that I really appreciate. (IOW, not tacky, gaudy or Disney-like) Check out the room photos on their website. Everything was squeaky clean. The staff well trained, friendly and professional. Although we didn't gamble in the Aria casino we did spend a lot of time in the bars and restaurants in or near the casino. The Aria casino was, by far, the best ventilated casino that we toured, and, the best looking. The fact that the Aria is right next to my new favorite shopping area, Crystals, make this hotel even more appealing. If you like to shop in high-end boutiques, this is the mall for you. It's like walking down Rodeo Drive or Worth Avenue. My gf and I toured at least a half-dozen other well known hotels\/casino's, and for our needs, none of them compared to the Aria.

I stayed here only because we got a great deal.  If you are an MGM club card holder you can stay $109 weekdays and $139 weekends.  Our total for 2 nights was $311 which is a pretty good deal consiering you get to try out a brand new hotel.  The hotel istself is pretty nice.  I love all the wood work in the hotel and its pretty easy to navigate.

We encountered our first problem when we were checking in.  So 4 of us stayed in one room and we called to book 2 queens.  When we checked in the lady insisted that they only had one king available and that when you book a room, you are not guaranteed to get two queens.  WTF?  I have never heard of this before.  Then she went on to say that all the hotels in vegas are like this..  ummm NO!  I've stayed in multiple hotels in vegas  and never have I heard of anything like that.  She than asked us to upgrade for $400 per night to a room that does have two queens.  WOW! i was floored haha.  After a very long discussion, we asked to talk to the manager.  We waited about 20 minutes to talk to the manager and she pretty much said the same thing to us.  By that time we were pretty pissed as it was taking us 30 minutes to check into a room that we didn't book.  All in all, we finally got her to ""find"" us a room with two queen beds.  horrible!

when we got to the room, all the decoration pillows were on the floor, not on the bed. hmm..  we opened the window  sheers only to find bird crap and water stains all over our window.  We had a great view...

When you arrive you are greeted by the soaring Aria towers which are simply stunning and breathtaking. They have a beautiful modern feel that seems to go against traditional ""Vegas"" neon. With that, every part of the architecture and styling both outside and in is beautiful and detail centric. They are spot on in presenting this as a luxury hotel from this angle.

Additionally, when you walk into your room for the first time (with a key card that you simply wave in front of your lock) your room greets your arrival by automatically opening the shades, turning on some light mood music,  ambient lighting, and the TV. Very nice indeed. However, with new technology comes new problems. The room is very nicely controlled by a 7"" touchscreen at the side of your bed which really does control just about everything in the room, including the bathroom lights, thermostat, TV, curtains, music, and your privacy status on the door. However,  it seems to be a little buggy since we had to get a technician to service our TV as it had been frozen or crashed and was showing a previous guest's home screen. Additionally, the TV remote was very inconsistent in working properly. I would say it worked 50% of the time.

The room advertised a laptop-sized safe, which we were not able to find right off the bat. We attempted to call the front desk but were on automatic hold because all of the customer service agents were apparently busy. After about 5 minutes of being in this hold state, I decided to hang up since it was beginning to waste my time. When my wife and I went downstairs later, we asked about the safe. It turns out it is in one of the bedside drawers. True to it's description of being laptop-sized, it fit both our laptops perfectly, however since it's in a drawer, it's not tall enough to fit other items like a purse, video camera, or SLR camera.

The staff of the hotel were generally nice and very courteous, however, the main thing we noticed is that they were lacking quite a bit. Everything seemed to take longer because our waiter \/ waitress \/ customer service rep was having to do too much at once. While not their fault this is a poor reflection of the hotel and was one of the things that made our stay less than great.

As to be expected, being in a nice Vegas hotel, all the food was quite expensive. This would be fine if it was completely worth it. I don't feel for the cost of the food, that it lived up to this expectation.

We ate at The Buffet one evening for dinner for $30 a person. It had a good selection of entreés, appetizers, salads, and desserts. However, the actual taste and quality of the food was nothing to write home about. We had to wait nearly 15-20 minutes for our waitress to finally get us our drinks even after she took our drink order before we got up for food at the buffet.

The lunch and breakfast we had at the casual restaurant, Café Vettro, were fine, not great. Our waitresses both time were very kind, but service was slow once again. The lunch was tasty but overpriced for being a ""casual"" restaurant in my opinion. The breakfast would have been better had it come out hot.

Finally, my wife and I did take advantage of the massage services in the spa. This was the highlight of our stay. The facilities were very posh and beautiful (which I would expect at $185 per person for our couples massage). Both massage therapists were very good and gave us the best massages we've ever had. Was it worth $185 a piece? No, definitely not. But our $75 resort credit helped ease the pain, as it were.

Overall, this can be a very nice hotel to stay at once they get their act together. The whole resort has not even completed construction. Until then, we'll be retreating back to one of our favorite spots on the strip, The Venetian.",3,0,0

I'm notoriously snobby at hotels, complaining about nearly anything that gets in the way of my relaxation, so I figured Aria and I would be a poor match. 

But I was pleasantly surprised all the way around. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me was because the pool service menu was spotty (ran out of a few things midday). But otherwise it was flawless. 

Big quiet clean rooms, smooth check in, respectful staff, fully stocked amenities, comfy bed. I did have an outlet in the bathroom blown (when I plugged in too many beauty products at once), and it was fixed within minutes of calling. 

But the most impressive part of my stay was when I returned home and 2 days later realized I had left a not-so-small diamond necklace in the nightstand. I don't know who leaves a diamond necklace in Vegas and gets it returned- but I did. Shipped to my home quickly and in perfect shape. Thanks Aria.",0,0,0

While trying to check in the man we were dealing with treated me like an idiot when my debit card didn't go through at first. Embarrassed, I quickly grabbed another card that also didn't go through. So I stepped aside and called my bank to notify them I was traveling. The whole ordeal was very embarrassing and I realize I should have called my bank before I left but him treating me rudely got us no where.  The second day we were there my partner and I had our phones stolen. We had to hang out in the lobby more than expected to try to get our phones turned off and make sure our ipay was turned off.

We stayed at Aria last weekend for my Bachelorette Getaway.

First, they screwed up our room (Booked: 2 CONJOINING DOUBLE bed rooms \/ Got: 2 NON-CONJOINING SINGLE bed rooms). Then they told us it was our fault, even after we provided proof of our ACTUAL booking - confirmation email. Told us they were 110% booked, and won't be able to ""upgrade"" us - ""UPGRADE""??? We booked the damn double bed rooms 2 months in advance!!! Don't act like you are doing us a favor! On top of it, she was being incredibly RUDE! She actually told us that the entire strip was booked and implied that if we didn't stay there, we'd end up in a crappy hotel.

We were put on a waiting list for the rooms, got a call 30 mins later - 2 double bed rooms became available (10 floors apart - we couldn't even use the same elevators to get to the rooms). We were instructed to go directly to the room, and our current key cards will be transferred to the new rooms. When we got there - key cards did not work. Front desk told us that a bellman would be sent to our rooms with new cards within 5 mins. 10 mins later no bellman, we called, bellman is on his way. 15 mins now - no bellman. After 20 mins of sitting in the hallway with our luggage, my MOH went to get the cards herself.

By now - my MOH was furious and spoke to the manager. After calmly expressing the disappointing experience we've had within the first 2 hours of our stay, the manager CONDESCENDINGLY said, ""would you like to fill out a comment card?"" SERIOUSLY???

Our flight arrived in Las Vegas just before 11am on Thursday, May 04, 2017. The staff was able to accommodate us with and early check in. 

The room (32123) was clean and nicely appointed. Everything about it was perfect. His and hers closets. A spacious bathroom with a soaking tub inside the shower enclosure. Comfortable bed. Heavy blackout window coverings controlled by remote and wall switch.

Once you pull up to the driveway you are amazed by the great waterfall in the back, if you were to pass next to it you will feel a bit of a breeze!!

The lobby smelled vanilla, once you enter there is a feel of openness, lots of natural light and they have marble chairs in the lobby!! Unheard of!!  Last time I was in Vegas, there were NO chairs or places to sit in the lobby (found out later that the Bellagio had a couple)...  Decoration all around is pretty modern, chic and simplistic.  Lots of wood all over, marble and earthy colors.

The rooms are gorgeous!! Just like the other reviews, you have the options for many plugs!! And the best is the little screen on your bedside table were you can control the A\/C, curtains, ALL lighting (even bathroom), TV\/Music, Wake up Call (i.e. opening curtains, turning on tv\/music, turning on lighting) I think the only thing they missing is to include your bed number!!!

The bathroom was big, although it kind of missed a chair for sitting down and doing make up or for even drying your hair... it's always about finding the electrical outlets... behind the box of kleenex!!  it took a while for us to find out where it was.  The shower and tub has a clear window, it should have been frosted just like the one for the toilet!!  It kind of limits ONE person in the whole bathroom at a time... unless you don't care about people seeing you...

Services where great in some areas.  Jean Phillipe Patisserie was great!! The sandwiches were made to order, warm, crunchy and tasty!!  The casino was ok, played a bit of the slot machines and it was ok, no big givers here!!!  Cafe Vetro was nice, separate review to come!  The Buffet was meh... no big deal.  Food didn't look THAT special, it's clean, and neatly arranged but mehh... A OK!

The hotel charges for internet ($15 for 24hrs), Spa access (including the gym) $30 for your stay I think... and of course for your regular treatments at the spa.  Spa has nice ambiance, calm & relaxing.

Sometimes when called by phone Concierge or the Front Desk, they were too busy to answer.  But the majority of the time they would answer our inquiries.

Aria is located in a building complex which include the following: Mandarin Oriental, Vdara, Crystals (apartment buildings), and shops.  What a MALL..... high end stores are here, like Prada, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, etc, etc,  This mall looks like a Museum!!  They even have a restaurant inside a wooden structure!! So if you are staying @ Aria, definitely take a stroll to the shops!",4,0,1

Stayed in a Deluxe King room with a view of the mountains, gave a spectacular view of the sunset each night! I had stayed at the Aria once before in a strip view room, in which I was somewhat disappointed. So I decided to spend the money elsewhere this time.
The room was very nice and comfortable (beds and pillows were heavenly). The location of the Aria is good. A little bit of a walk to the strip, but I enjoyed walking through the Crystal shops. 
The weather was warm enough to use the pool one of the days we were there. There are 3 pools, and the Liquid Lounge.One of the pools is for the Sky Suites guest.
Why the 4 stars? The tablet has true potential, but we found ourselves very annoyed it with. One morning, the tablet would not work to open the blackout shades nor turn on the room lights. The room lights wouldn't even turn on when we flipped the switch. So I called the front desk who would send someone to see what the problem was. After my husband played around with a ""master"" switch near the door, the controls of the room started working again. We didn't touch the tablet after that.

Within the casino, much of the design is contemporary and various areas of the casino are lush with vegetation, very pretty.  Table limits are moderate to high, depending on the time of day. Looking to place a sports bet or just to watch a few games on a big screen?  Then the Sky High Sports Bar is a great place to be--lots and I mean LOTS of big screen televisions.  What's nice about this hotel is that it has great ventilation and it's new so you don't encounter that thick fog of cigarette smoke that other hotels on the strip have, but the downside to it all is that the casino excessively sprays a strong cookie\/vanilla perfume into the air that makes you feel sick after awhile. There's also a tram available at Aria that stops at The Mirage and Bellagio, which makes venturing around Vegas a little easier\/cheaper! 

The pool is really lovely. I think one pool was supposed to be a family\/kids pool with donut floaties available for the kiddies and another pool for adults--except kids invaded the adult pool as well.  I heard there is a topless pool somewhere at Aria, but I didn't spot it. 

The hotel rooms are really nice. The beds are firm and comfortable. The bathrooms are huge: giant mirrors (great for getting ready to club!), giant shower and giant hot tub. There is also a large flat screen tv in the room, mini fridge, and wireless\/internet service for a fee. I encountered one issue at Aria that made me take away 1 star from them. Our group had ordered a double queen room and apparently Aria had overbooked those rooms and could only provide us with a single king room with a rollaway bed--lame.  The rollaway bed was twin sized when we were told it would be as large as the bed in our room (lies!) and was super uncomfortable (you could feel the springs and all!)

If you are looking for mainstream brands shopping, the Mile Long mall is about a 15 minute walk. As well as mainstream food. As for this place being good for families, there is the pool, walking around the strip (my daughter loved the M and M store down the road), or riding the tram.

I wish I could rate Aria higher, but some issues with the rooms keep me from giving a perfect score.  The main lobby and casino floor are amazing. The modern look and feel is refreshing when compared to the aging facades of other hotels. It just feels young and hip. 

The problems arise in the rooms and the technology they are attempting to show off. Everything is controlled by a switch or a iPad like device. But when buttons don't work or when you're not sure what switch does what, you end up looking like a fool hitting all the buttons over and over.  

My iPad devices screen was broken so it had lines running across it. You could still figure it out but it was annoying. The bathroom lights can be turned off from the bed switch so if you're on the toilet hope someone doesn't kill you're only light source.

My wife and I came to Vegas right around Christmas (down time for Vegas) to celebrate our 2-year anniversary and just to have a getaway vacation. When we revealed that it was our anniversary during an early check-in, the guy at the service desk (Matthews) immediately went to talk to his manager and came back with an offer to upgrade us to the Sky Suites for our entire 4-day 3-night stay!!! We didn't even have to ask for an upgrade!!! Best of it all, our original room was their lowest-tier room that we paid just over $700 total for flights, rooms, and Zakarna tickets on Expedia, which was already a great deal. Boy were we excited!

For those that didn't know (we certainly didn't), the Sky Suites is a special section of Aria that's reserved for the ""fancy"" rooms. A security guard is always standing by the special elevator that takes you up to the suites. Complimentary drink (bottled water, soda, juice, wine, etc) are provided 24\/7 and all the rooms have great views of the strip.

Our room was on the 37th floor and the suit was 1,500 sqft. That's bigger than our previous apartment! We didn't even know what to do with all that spaces with just the two of us. Everything was marble, the bathroom was huge, and the bed was soft and comfy. The whole suite can be controlled wirelessly from the control panel by the bed. There's nothing bad to say about it. We are poor students who are used to staying in places like Holiday Inns so this was more than luxury for us.

Obviously, this unexpected upgrade instantly elevated the overall experience of our vacation and made it even more memorable. Thank you Aria!!!",17,2,14

Probably my least favorite area of the hotel... the casino floor is small and just had a very weird\/awkward vibe to it.... only stayed here once as a result because I like to  cable in the same hotel in which I stay so they can track my play... Always good to take advantage of comps but the comps here were almost none existent. Perhaps it was because the hotel had recently opened but it left a really bad taste in my mouth so it is highly unlikely I would return.

Room service was terrible... $45 for a cheeseburger and fries and one coke. Also notice they charged me $2 for extra ketchup which really urked me!

We did eat at the Buffet one night and Jean George's which were both very good... of course the buffet is more expensive than you might expect when you think of ""Buffet"", but the food quality is actually very good. As for Jean George's... WOW! nothing negative to say there!

But, on a recent trip to celebrate my birthday, we decided to splurge and stay at the Aria (which we thought would be the classiest hotel in Vegas with rooms that have the best views). 

Our room was lovely, but we were extremely disappointed when we noticed right away that the windows were filthy. It seemed that the outside of the windows had not been cleaned in a long time. We have traveled all over the US and the world and we have never had filthy windows in our hotel rooms. What a shock to find dirty windows at the Aria! What a terrible impression that made on us. 

Then when we went to use the shower, we noticed right away that the water was collecting quickly and not draining. We were standing in a deep pool of water.almost up to our ankles. We realized that the shower floor is completely flat, so the water does not drain. The shower just keeps filling up. When you shut off the water, the water starts to drain very slowly, but it never drains completely. A pool of water still remains. The next person to shower has to step in a pool of chilly water. In all of our travels, we have never seen such a poorly designed shower floor. Common sense tells you that the shower floor should be somewhat sloped to allow the water to pour down to allow the water to drain on its own. Our shower at the Aria should have come with a squeegee for the shower floor so we could force the water to the drain. I ended up pushing the water toward the drain with my feet. What a shock that the Aria has the worst shower we ever used! 

We were also very disappointed in the way the mini-bar operates. Other hotels have allowed us to remove items from the refrigerator so we could put our own items in like bottled water. The Aria mini-bar is scary -- it knows what you are doing. We were afraid to even look at anything in the mini-bar because we might be charged for it. 

Also, the ironing board is absolutely ridiculous! The largest part of the board is used for storing the iron! There is a metal iron holder permanently attached to that part of the board making it completely useless. And when you put the board away you have to be very careful or you could bang the sharp metal holder into your shin. There was no need to reinvent the ironing board. If you have to iron a dress (especially a long one), the iron holder makes it an almost impossible job.

On a positive note.... the view at night (despite the dirty windows) was awesome! We especially liked the view of the wonderful hotel fountain with dancing waters (unfortunately the fountain was down for repair for most of our stay). We liked the drapes (blackout & sheer). Our favorite restaurant is Julian Serrano -- we ate dinner there twice! We also like Javier's. We loved having dessert at Jean Phillipe, The Aria staff were always very friendly and welcoming. 

We will definitely visit the Aria again (we love to walk around the hotel and enjoy the public features). But I'm doubtful that we will ever stay at the Aria again.  Someone told us that the Aria is changing ownership or management. If this is true, I certainly hope that some positive changes will be made to bring the quality of the hotel rooms up to the highest standards.",1,0,0

The casino floor is small, but has a beautiful shopping stores , and walkways outside. It looks very upscale and gorgeous from the outside, but the inside is just the same generic set-up of every other casino. There is nothing that sets aside Aria's casino from others, and is much smaller than the others on the strip.

I do, however, like that they employ an older range of women as their cocktail servers on the casino floor. As a designer, though, their costumes were so outdated for such a classy, and modern hotel. 

I probably wouldn't return to this hotel, truth be told. There isn't anything interesting that really draws me in unless I have comps here.",7,4,4

All the restaurants are fantastic.  I've only been disappointed twice at Herringbone, but I will review each restaurant so overall I love Aria.  

I am not happy w\/ the new paying for valet parking deal or paying eventually in the garage.  Love the easy access to the T Mobile Arena!

The festive decorations are lovely & easy walk to Bellagio through the Vdara & over the bridge.  When I do stay at the Tower Suites, I like the North valet in between Vdara.  In that check-in lobby they have pastries, fruit & muffins in the morning & other small plates throughout the day.

Love the bartenders & they have the best VIP Sportsbook & team, Keith, Jeff, Jeff & Marcus.  Awesome!

I doubt any of you would be able to get a casino\/hotel\/restaurant up and running perfectly on your own.  At least give them a chance to get all the kinks out and timing down before giving them one star.

We did not stay here, so I can't say anything about the hotel specifics, but this place was absolutely beautiful inside and out.  We ate at the cafe twice this week - the food was great.  They were a little slow the first night but they did continuously apologize and explained to us the night we were there first that this was their first rush of people.  Makes sense to me.  

Fountains out front and waterfall on the front face of the building can be watched for hours. Inside Crystals many of the stores are not yet open but the architecture in there is crazy.

I see others complaining about children not being allowed in the restaurants and the expensive cost of a nanny...... here is a tip for you.  DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS TO VEGAS!  Vegas is not for children.  Children running around Vegas ruin my vacation. Also, bringing your children to Vegas make you a horrible parent.  Vegas is not for children.  They should be ostracized from all establishments.",9,11,15

Valet: YOU BROKE MY BAG. I left my luggage with you for 2 hours and some how you broke the handle. Your lucky I didnt NOTICE til I got to the airport but I am pretty pissed. Good thing there was nothing breakable in it. FUTURE GUEST: MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOU BAG BEFORE YOU LEAVE. 

Rooms: Gorgeous, contemporary, clean, high tech. They have ALL the hook ups you need. I wish I could figure out how to play the music in the room. You can control everything on the TV which is awesome and the curtains are controlled by a switch. When we walked in the curtains drew back and music was playing. Our room was facing the mountains which was WAY better than our friends room facing the city. Ours was also more spacious. It was weird to me though that there was no vent fan in the bathroom. WATCH OUT for the in room snack bar. Not only is it expensive but they will charge a $50 restocking fee. Good thing I read the fine print and I feel like people are smarter than that nowadays. 

Casino level: very nice, new, not smoky, not crowded with obnoxious tourists who just want to come and look. This place is huge and you can definitely get lost.

The first time I visited, it was when City Centre just opened.  There were few people gambling, and the cavernous space made it look totally gloomy, and not even a bit auspicious. 

The second time, we stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, so, Aria became the home away from home, being one of the few walking distance casinos.  Still, wasn't impressed, although it was more crowded so didn't feel so gloomy.

The third time, girlfriends wanted to stay here.  We had heard really good things about the hotel, so, why not.  Turns out the whole weekend people told us we overpaid for a hotel that quality.  Also, the controls for the curtains and lights were just not intuitive.  Every time I looked at the clock the tv would turn on (to try to wake us with soothing sounds)... ARGH!

I like ARIA because it's in the center of City Center. The hotel is clean-cut and simple. The restaurants are all safe and pretty solid  (American Fish won't disappoint!). The club Haze is mediocre but they offer plenty of lounges that are quite chill and not overcrowded and don't charge cover (Gold Club upstairs or Deuce downstairs). It has a convenient tram to Bellagio and Monte Carlo.

Overall the rooms here are all solid and beautiful. Very similar to the rooms at Vdara but missing the kitchenette. Very comfy beds.

If you want something safe that's still quite high end, Aria is a good choice. If you want high end dining options opt for the Wynn or MGM and if you want good shopping and a more romantic getaway then opt for The Venetian.",3,2,1

It was a lovely hotel with a great casino, and I hope to return sometime under better circumstances.

We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and this was the only annoying part of the hotel experience. The line was long as fuck, like at least second-tier Disneyland ride long. Aria must have a population size larger than many towns that voted Trump. Service was great. We were checked in by a nice young woman who'd just gotten her citizenship, who was still an undecided voter (she asked why we were in town, and we told her, but without saying which way we leaned). I hope she didn't vote for her own deportation.

The hotel was pretty in the Vegas way, every decor element over the top but somehow tasteful because of the ridiculous size of the hotel. Like insane light fixtures and velvet and leather walls (I touched all of those walls). The room was comfortable and nicely appointed, with a beautiful view. Beds were plush, and the bathroom clean with a good shower. I also enjoyed the control panel that let us open curtains and turn on lights. Mildly confusing, but very cool in an ""open sesame"" kind of way.

We spent a good amount of time in the casino, playing black jack and poker and pai gow (though let us not speak of the pai gow). We also ate at the pizza place and I think there was some kind of horrible election night party in the Aria, too, but honestly I was sad and a little sauced so I don't remember that in great detail (though there might have been a buffet that was only snack nuts). The parking situation was good, an easy garage with in and out privileges.

I'd recommend the Aria if you're looking for a hotel with a lot of modern luxury and only medium levels of Vegas cheese. The price point wasn't terrible (I won at the tables and covered my expenses easily), and I might come back for a real getaway one of these weekends.",8,4,5

I think Extraordinary is a good word to describe this magnificent hotel and Casino. Over the years I have stayed at numerous hotels and casinos on the Las Vegas strip from the Landmark, Hacienda, Stardust,  Dunes to the  Barbary Coast, the Orleans. Paris  and the Bellagio just to name a few. The Aria was by far the best I have ever experienced in Las Vegas and probably best hotel experience I have ever had. 

This was our second trip to Las Vegas in 2017, the first trip of 2017 we did New Years at the Bellagio. I thought it would be hard to beat the Bellagio however, the Aria was better. They are both MGM properties and we are MLife Members so MGM is us from now on the Aria sold us on MGM properties.

This hotel sits where the former Boardwalk Casino was located. Two of its towers at 61 stories and 51 stories, our room was a strip view on the 20 floor directly above the main lobby entrance and gave us great views of the strip and the mountains beyond. 

The location is great for the strip access to the main parts of the strip.We went and saw Cirque de Soleil's ""O"" at the Bellagio and it was a nice easy and quick walk and it even gets better.

The Aria has just over 4000 room, 16 restaurants, 10 bars and nightclubs (you can never have to many bars), a 150,000 square foot gaming floor wow nice. It has an amazing pool and spa area and an 1,800 seat theatre as well as a convention center. We tried some of the bars and restaurants and were happy with all, all had great customer service, nice drinks and food. 

I can see I am going to run out of room in my praise of this Hotel and Casino, it's so difficult to put into words the wonderful time my wife and I had here (of course a big part of the wonderful experience was spending it with my wife). I think I could now become a spokesman for the Aria and MGM properties lol. 

From the time I called the Aria in July to book our stay in November, everyone we were in contact with gave us exceptional customer service. I was really surprised. 

The room was immaculate,large and comfortable, they even turn your bed down in the afternoon and give you chocolates. It was our anniversary and I wanted flowers delivered and not 10 minutes after checking in the flowers arrived and a little later Chocolate covered strawberries arrived complimentary from the Aria for our anniversary and that my friends was a nice touch that went along way for for us. Customer service at its best.

Went to the M Life Counter to try and redeem MyVegas points early in the morning for breakfast. Upon arriving, with our kids, the wife went off to the side just barely visible to me and not close to any of the machines. Since there was no lines, I was immediately told any MyVegas rewards are not usable during Christmas since it was blacked out. 

I was disappointed, but I get that.  What I don't get, is the person on the floor and immediately told my wife and kids to leave since they are underage. Sure, I get that minors should not be allowed on the floor and it's not legal. But since I barely paused for a second to ask the hostess and was rudely told by the gentleman to leave before I can barely finish hearing my vouchers were not valid.....that was totally uncalled for. 

Sometimes, it's not what you say, it's how you say it...and this time, it could've been told and handled differently.  It didn't sit well with me and I didn't get a chance to voice my concern.

Bell men towed our coolers and liquor up to the room even offered to fill our coolers with ice. The man at the elevator even allowed our guests to come up with a simple name drop and room number. The party was ended abruptly and rudely. Without a warning security demands everyone for an ID card accusing us of being underage (which we are all well over 21) asks everyone to leave the suite. This woman from security even blows a freaking whistle at us. The entire situation was handled very poorly. Louis Orozco ""hotel manager"" and Lisa from security were belittling and uncompensating.

To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. There were however, a few great people who work there who managed to shine amongst all the blunders.

The room was booked mid-December to the tune of $450.00 bucks for a night. Evidently this is reasonable considering the market demand for rooms on NYE.

Like many of you, I was extremely excited to stay here. After all, the hype surrounding this project was overwhelming. This project is currently a big question mark and has the potential to be a star amongst MGM-Mirage properties. Unfortunately without improvement to their consistency in service and attention to detail, it may become their biggest dog ever.

Some highlights of my stay:

1. Check in took around 90 minutes. I nearly pissed my pants waiting  and I got lost trying to find the elevators to the room. Thank goodness my key worked or there would have been a mess on their carpet. Oh and I got a 1 bed King instead of a 2 bed Queen like I had reserved, but I did get a $50 credit.

2.  The room is supposed to be technologically advanced, but it took me a few minutes to figure out how to use the cordless phone in the room. Now I know how the elderly feel. The computerized room menu and TV stations take about 5 seconds to respond to anything. Seems like an odd delay and I'd just as soon walk to my curtain and close it than search for the remote or walk to the button on the wall. 

3. I was stuck on the phone with one of those ""We'll be right with you recordings"" from the bell desk for 45 minutes. My bags finally arrived 30 minutes later. The bellman got me ice though and he was cheerful.

4. I sat down to paint my nails at the workstation \/ desk area and found the light didn't turn on. I walked to press the buttons on the wall that are supposed to turn the lights on and I was about to start shouting at it ""Light ON, Light ON"" until I figured out there was no bulb in it.

5. Drinks at the bar downstairs were $20 bucks each...what a smart way for the hotel get the $50 credit back. AND they were in plastic cups. How tacky. Funny...drinks at the Deuce Lounge in the casino were $27 for two. Perhaps Dubai World runs one side and MGM runs the other side. I just can't figure out who is trying to rip us off. God I hate the way business price gouge consumers here.

6. We ordered pizza at about 1140 and it arrived exactly at 12. The room service attendant Maria was very cool and sweet. She watched the fireworks with us. The room had a great view through their full length window.

7. I went back to the $20 bar at 5 AM--the new bartender was a total a-hole. One of those people who you say hi to and who act like you're lucky to be sitting at his bar. I ordered a drink and he proceeds to go chit-chat with the other bartenders and customers. Other bartender comes by and asks ""May I help you?"" Um, yeah I ordered my drink in 2009.

7. Bad news..the blackout curtain is not completely blackout and I can see the sun peeping in around the perimeter. Also the desks in the room didn't have knobs on them. The bed is soft though and the lighting in the bathroom is great for putting on makeup. 

8. Checkout was way faster than check in. There were a few incorrect charges because I had removed some things from the mini bar to refrigerate my champagne but they weren't consumed. The front desk attendant Jonathan was nice and removed them from my bill. 

9. Valet after check out took about 20 min. A lot of the valets were looking around for the car's owners after pull up. One of the valets pulled up in a black Mercedes and said ""Walters...Ms. Walters?"" And I said ""Yes"" just to joke with him. I wonder if he really would have gave me the keys LOL. God Barbara Walters would have been pissed!

Good luck, CityCenter. I truly hope you guys make it but you're gonna have to get it together--FAST!",6,9,2

It's trendy, chic, and modern like it should be. Unfortunately, I just find more cons for this particular hotel than others I've been to on the strip (i.e. Cosmo, Palazzo, Encore, Wynn). I've stayed here once before in a standard room and didn't find it to be as spacious as other rooms at other hotels on the strip. There wasn't a separate lounge area to hang out in like the newer hotels tend to do nowadays. Not only that but if you want to get out of Aria and CityCenter, it takes freakin forever to walk out of there. You have to walk out of the casino, up some stairs, up an escalator, through the mall... it's a pain in the @$$ especially in 4 inch heels. On this past trip, my friends and I wanted to go to Earl of Sandwich which is across the way at PH. I swear it took us forever to get there because we had to walk through everything. 

Their nightlife is lacking too since I don't think Haze is all that. The club is small, there isn't an open air area, and there's creepy dudes... I can't really hold that last part against them though because creepy dudes are at every club. All in all, Aria is nice... nice enough to be a top hotel in Vegas, but there's something missing to its' atmosphere.

Casino: It's Vegas, it's a smoking casino. Fortunately, it has an amazing ventilation system, this is 100% different from the seedy smoke filled casinos downtown. Everything is shiny, new, and beautiful. Everyone is friendly, from the dealers to the waitresses. Drinks came quickly and had the right amount of ice. This is definitely a nicer casino, almost all the table minimums were at $25, though I did see up to $100. Any more than that and I think you have to go to the high-roller club. We did find a craps table with a $15 minimum and spent all night there! 

Hotel: We stayed in the beautiful room 38109 which I think was a tower suite. It was beautifully appointed with a master bathroom (huge, giant, bathroom)\/bedroom, living area with a couch and two chairs, desk, wet bar, and table, and another bathroom. It had a great technology package with NFC key cards that activated the lights, TV and music, air conditioner, and window shades. This could all be controlled by either of the TVs in the bedroom or living room, or the bedroom nightstand tablet. Every employee was super friendly and nice, from the front desk agent to the housekeepers we passed in the hallways. The incredibly nice turn-down housekeeper even gave me extra chocolates. 

I did have a few minor issues with the room, but thankfully they were not severe enough to mess up my stay. The wet bar sink knob was sticking, so it was either off or full blast, which was annoying when it splashed all over. The living room bathroom sink had a very narrow stream of water which deflected all over the counter top when it hit the basin or my hands. The shower also had trouble keeping a consistent temperature. Finally, there was a brochure on the desk that outlined the media input system so you could play music over the TV. The system on the desk looked like the brochure, except it had no media inputs so we were stuck listening to ""Hot Pop"" TV radio, which was not the business when you are trying to pre-game (they didn't have a good hip-hop\/rap station).

So my family we go and they tell us that our room wont be ready till 3, because our flight was early and we got their before check in time. they were really nice and very sincere about it. So we get to our room which is a corner suite. We go to the room, put our key in and what do we see? Other people in the room! with bags open and everything, so we use the hallway phone and call the front desk to let them know what we saw. They apologized and sent us to another corner suite.

1. The room- Amazing, beautiful room i mean wow. the most nicest\/modern looking room I have ever seen. Tv was Amazing, and the bed was comfortable.

2. Bathroom- corner bathroom with nothing but glass around you, and the view of the strip, with the hot tub on the corner of it, wow what a beautiful bathroom. 

We didnt have time to check out the pool, because we literally stayed for 1 night and  flew back, but from what I hear it sounds amazing.

I checked in and the clerk gave me a room that was on a very high floor and she said it was a great room. I walked in and the curtains automatically open and the TV turned on. I was impressed. Then I noticed the room had an overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke. It was unbearable. I had to request a different room. Which I was told my keys would just transfer and of course they didn't.

It brings back a glamorous  twinkly feel back to the Strip. I have eaten here and stayed here. I have dined at Todd English pub and I enjoy it very much I have been there a few times.

The place is up beat and doesn't reek of cigarette. I have been to almost every casino on the strip and I must say this one is unique and tasteful.

I stayed once in one of the very nice corner suites. Set at the far side of the building. It was a wonderful time. Self warming toilet seats, a perfect spread of soaps and beautifully maintained see through glass shower.

The tub was AMAZING! Huge bubble tub facing a wall sized window that looked out on the strip. I filled the tub full of ever single bottle of soap in there , made a huge outfit of bubbles and pranced in front of the window! Best time ever!!

I have stayed at dozens of hotel\/casinos in Las Vegas for the past 35+ years.
I would have to say most of them are getting old. Even the ones that have been upgraded seem old, but the Aria is all new. But of course it is fairly new anyway.
Once we stayed there, we never looked back. Its our favorite now and always stay at the Aria.
We use our M-Life rewards card every chance we get. And why not. We get free suites and food every visit, not to mention the other comps.
The corner suites are (Bitchin)
We love that there are 2 toilets! I don't need to go into that ok!
The floor to ceiling glass is gorgeous and even the all glass bathroom windows are a sight to see though!
3 TV's and a mini bar and frig with its own ice maker. We use it all.
Oh and the Toto bidet toilet is,  well a treat!
Now we have a casino host since everyone kept telling us we were suppose to have one (people like the ones who worked in the casino).
So now we call our host every time we need something. Nice!
Using the M-Life rewards card also lets us in the buffet line without waiting. We get to see a free show and the last show was Zarkana, and got front roll seats.
We also like the fact that the Aria is a 5 star hotel and LEEDS certified, although my wife doesn't care. 
The casinos have vents built in the slot machines to circulate the smokey air so the air smells clean and they are suppose to have their own scent too.
You can also use your M-Life cards at other casinos like the MGM, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay etc and get points.
Work your way up to the Platinum card and you'll be treated like a VIP.
BTW, the NOIR card is the top players card. NO way are we going to even come close to that unless we sell our house and cars to gamble away! 
We also love the buffet there. More about that later.",3,1,1

where shud i start?  shud i start with the long lines at check-in?  the un-informative front desk person?  the non-working tv-remote? the 300 watts bright touch pad?

the room we got was soooo far from the elevator, it's a good 2-3 minute walk.  i guess that's ok when it's in the am after a good nite sleep but the walk will seem like an hr when you've already been walking for a long time.  when we got to the hotel on late sat (prez day wknd), we noticed:

1.  there was already a long line at the front desk.  the person who checked us in wasn't very informative.  she didn't tell us what floor we're on or what the room # was.  she just gave us a key and sent us on our way. 
2.  that there was no luggage rack to put our luggage so 
we had to put it on the floor.
3.  no slippers.  i thought all hotels provide slippers in the room.  i had to call later that nite to have the slippers brought to our room
4.  the tv remote doesn't work.  i told them at the same time when i called for the slippers and they said it could be the batteries and would bring them over.  however, when they brought the slippers, guess what, the person didn't even know about the batteries.  the person said she would follow up and that was the last time i heard from her.
5.  the master off\/on lite switch doesn't work.  it's the 1st time in my life i had to call the front desk to ask how to turn off the lites.  the lady said, ""oh, you can use the tv remote"".  yea, right...but the remote DOESN'T WORK!  she then said use the touch pad.  ok, at least the touch pad worked.  also, there's no clear instruction in the room to use the touch pad to control everything.  i just thought it was a clock. 
6.  oh, the touch pad.  the backlite of the touch pad is way too bright.  i had to turn it face down to sleep.
7.  i wrote a note to housekeeping to replace the batteries the next day (sun).  i don't know whether it was replaced or not but it still didn't work when we came back.  if they were replaced, it would only take 2 secs to check but obviously they didn't check.  that's attention to details a 5-star hotel should have.
8.  the curtains have openings at top that let the sunlight in so it doesn't completely black out the room.  an easy fix for that is a valence at top. again, that's attention to details.
9.  the buffet is NOT good at all.  not much variety and nothing stands out as really good.  the lobster was overcooked and the shrimp was soggy.

The place is pretty great, and you have to take advantage of amenities like the spa and the gym to really have an appreciation for the place.

Inside you have Haze; which I think is a decent nightclub. Most of it's reviews seem to be about people unable to get in to the club.

The check in staff was great and check in was fast and only took a couple minutes and we were on our way to our room. We ended up on the 28th floor I believe and had a nice strip view. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious, but it was kinda odd with the tub being in the shower, but still being separate. I wish I would have taken a picture so it makes sense what I am saying. The room was a little small though in my opinion, but it was pretty comfortable. There was all the cool electronic fancy doo da stuff in the room which was cool, but I really don't think the room was better than a room at the cosmopolitan or MGM signature

The casino was very nice and the cocktail waitresses were really cool and brought us shots of patron while we were gambling

The pool complex was really cool with a lot of pools and had a really fancy feel but not fancy to the point where one would feel out of place. The cocktail waitresses were really nice at the pool too and ask if you needed drinks

We lost our keys a couple time but the staff at the front desk had no problems giving us new keys and making sure we tossed the old keys. I did have an issue with being charged $20 for a bag of chips from the weight sensitive plates in the room, but they took it off when we checked out with no questions asked. But this has led me to always be paranoid about those plates now

Overall, I wouldn't mind returning, but it would have to be at a promo code pricing as at full price I would much rather go to the cosmopolitan",0,0,0

You cannot ask them to make it without aioli mayonaise.  Jean Phillipe was overpriced for breakfast and snacks, especially when you cannot have them prepare something your way.  

The gym was probably one of the nicest gyms I have seen in Vegas. The hotel shot up further in my eyes because they do not charge you $30.00 to use the gym.  Plus wi-fi was free.  This alone made up for the overpriced Jean Phillipe cafe.

Asked the bell guy what was up and he said ""oh, you got the wedge room... did you check in late? ... we said that was one way to look at it, or you could say we checked in early :-) anyway, he said these rooms get handed out last and suggested we call down in the morning to get moved. Which we did, and they did and we spent our second night in a room with spectacular floor to ceiling windows, very nice. Everyone was very nice when we asked about this and they were all helpful. Oh, and this was fight weekend -- the place was packed. So extra points for making it happen although perhaps the ""wedge"" rooms should be converted to storage or a lower room class.

We called down for breakfast at some point and the very nice operator warned it would take about an hour ... no go for us. She did offer they could do beverages faster and we got some coffee that came up in 10-15 minutes, no perfect but a more than acceptable save.

The rooms are nice, the hotel is clean. It is centrally located. 

The room control stuff is cool -- we have the same system at home -- but I kept opening and closing the blinds at random times. Maybe that was the booze... not sure. Anyway, it is kind of novel.

I think it is always fun to go to these new places. The late night action at the tables (craps for us) is fun and the casino is a total spectacle; we probably had the most fun just sitting in a casino bar and watching the spectacle go buy... wow. Just what you expect at a new hotel, lots of folks out of their mind -- some so loaded they are in wheel chairs, others less loaded and driving those little motorized chairs around (really, just for fun, i guess you can rent them, wtf?), lots of hookers roaming around, the random drunk girlfriend clueless that her boob is totally hanging out of her dress as she walks through the casino hanging on her man (i kid you not). Vegas!!

I'd go back here ... it was fun. The check in thing scares me to -- I think I'll take the same approach next time and just cross my fingers I don't get the ""wedge"" room again :-)",0,0,0

The buffet was understaffed and had a poor variety of food for a holiday weekend in my opinion. The crab legs had been picked over and it took 20 minutes to get more, not to mention that they were not cracked and we were not given proper utensils to try and eat them. After 20 minutes of struggling we had to ask for crab cutters instead of having them supplied. In addition, 2 out of 3 set of silverware were missing a soon while the other was missing a knife. Seriously.. it's silverware. In addition all three of us were stuck in the bathroom sick immediately after dinner. Not exactly how we wanted to spend our night. 

The MLife desk line was always long and the people there were not very helpful. Kept asking questions and being cut off and given different answers to the same questions. Not exactly how you want to treat people who are willing\/wanting to spend money in your casino. 

The staff at the spa for our couple massage were okay, but rather unaccommodating. Did not comply with our gender requests for a masseuse and then acted surprised when we (a guy\/girl couple) showed up because apparently they were expecting a gay couple. Wasn't worth the money and we found out after that our $100 credit wasn't applied. 

The only saving grace at Aria were the bartenders at Gem Bar who went above and beyond. If we do decide to give this hotel another shot, it'll most likely be because of these gentlemen and their hospitality.",3,0,0

What a great place. Been here multiple times and always enjoy it. We usually stay here or the Bellagio. Can not go wrong with either property. Rooms are gorgeous and very modern. Aria seems to be ahead of the future. No need for a do not disturb sign on your door. Just press a button  in your room and a privacy sign illuminates outside your door. Also I will say that the wi-fi at Aria is the best I have had in Vegas. Restaurants are of course on the pricey side. Do yourself and try the Todd English pub located adjacent to the lobby. Great food and drink. Very good happy hour specials on food and drink everyday 3-6. Service was great from the valets to front desk to housekeeping. Only thing I did not like is they charge for a package delivery. My brother send a birthday card to my mother and we were charged $6 for that . Really. After already paying a daily ""resort fee"". A little frustrating. Not the $6 but the concept does NOT make sense. Outside of that I really like this place.-Will",0,0,0

The limo drivers to and from the airport were a great touch, as was the dedicated entrance and lounge for people in the Skyline suites - made checking in and check out very smooth.

The room was divine, with every mod con you can think of.  Comfortable bed, beautiful bathroom. The room service was prompt and delivered with a smile, and dining options in the hotel were many and varied.

The casino floor was being refurbished during our visit - I'm looking forward to visiting again next year to see it fully open without sections cordoned off.

Aria has only two things gong for it, its new and its smells nice when you walk inside. Other than that its like every other Vegas hotel. If you're looking for refreshing decor go to Encore. Or for space go to Palazzo. Aria offers neither one of those. 

After my first visit, I had to come back here a second time for my sisters bachelorette weekend. I tried convincing her not to stay here but she didn't budge bc rightly so she wanted to experience this new hotel for herself .... to put it lightly by the end of our trip I couldn't hear myself say ""I told you so"" enough. 

How wrong can Aria get booking a room? Instead of giving us two rooms with the request of 2 king beds in one and 1 king in another, we got 1 room with only one king bed, for 5 girls. NO. you're joking. are you on crack? where the first three things that came to mind when the concierge told us there was nothing he could do being that it was ""fight week"" and they were completely booked.

How irresponsible of the hotel to over book guests. If they aren't ready to handle that many customers then they shouldn't be open. Lucky for Aria they hired Chris (the concierge guy) and he tried helping by discounting the room for us which was nice and why two points are given. He also told us that he would send up a fold out bed so that we could be a little more comfortable. Fine. 

So we get up to the room and everyone is beginning to cool down from being so angry. We're having fun pushing all the buttons in the little remote when we realize about 30min into being in our room, where is the bed they promised to bring up? 

We call down to the front desk only to be told by a string of people that I need to be connected to this or that person. FINALLY I get a hold of someone and they tell me that they have RUN OUT of fold out beds. Seriously lady!? Weren't we just promised a bed at the front desk by Chris? They seem to not have enough of anything in this place. No rooms and now no beds. Seriously, you should have an extra bed to every room. This is not 1912 and we are not on the Titanic. Be prepared Aria, and go get enough supplies!! 

We ended up getting the bed but only after a slew of yelling. Aria, why would you want someone to have to get angry in order to get what is expected? Just do your job and maybe you'll have a happy customer at the end of the day.",10,8,3

They gave us a room on the 27th floor and had a view of the pools at the Cosmopolitan and the strip. The room was nice and big and we loved be able to control the drapes, lights and music when entering or for our alarm.
Both days we spent out by the pool. The pools were crowded but the staff was very accommodating in finding us lounge chairs. They had no problem carrying chairs around for you.
The casino had plenty of slot machines to choose from but the table games were a minimum $75 a hand that's the reason for four stars.

From the high-tech room, the cleanliness everywhere you look, to the staff and the food choices available, it's hard to think of any place on the Strip that beats Aria.  I brought family with me who had never been to City Center yet on this last trip and they were very impressed with the casino and amenities.  My husband says he thinks the Poker Room here is awesome as well.  Upon walking into this casino the very first time, I sort of didn't like it because it didn't look like any of the other casinos.  But as I kept coming back, I started to feel the energy and really enjoy myself here. The architecture and artwork around the entire property is amazing to look at, very different from any other Vegas casino.  The staff are excellent. Had the pleasure of having drinks at 3 of the bars and although they were pricey, they were delicious.... hey, you're in Vegas!  I especially love the beds\/ mattresses and pillows they have in the rooms.  I was thisclose to buying pillows on this trip but I'll probably do that next time.  The vanilla scent when you first walk into the lobby can be somewhat annoying but I enjoy it and you can also purchase the vanilla scent sticks there to take home.  I will continue to book a room here in the future whenever I will be in town.

One star for convenience\/location. One star for the interactions with housekeeping\/concierge. I feel compelled to share my experience booking directly from ARIA's website so that others who are considering a stay at ARIA can make an informed decision. 

I made a reservation through ARIA's website October of 2016 for a deluxe king room and my reservation summary states that the reservation total was $661.92. I was charged $133.28 at the time of the booking. The amount due upon check-in was clearly listed as $528.64. Keep in mind room rate subtotal, savings applied, adjusted subtotal, taxes, resort fee and tax were all laid out before calculating the total amount due upon check-in. After completing mobile check-out, I received my check-out folio via email. First, it listed the amount I paid during check-in was $536.78 instead of the $528.64 I was quoted when I made my reservation. I was then charged an additional $23.82 difference upon check-out. Nothing in the refreshment center was touched and the fridge was never opened as is evidenced by the lack of charges listed in my check-out folio. After some calculations, the discrepancy in price came from an increase in resort fee (which I was never notified about.) At the time of booking, in fine print it clearly reads ""A daily resort fee of $35.84 (tax inclusive) will be applied to all reservations."" Upon reviewing my check-out folio, the daily resort fee was $39.00 (tax exclusive). The amount of $5.22 for resort fee tax was added on each day. Although the difference wasn't a huge amount, it did leave a sour taste in my mouth and affected my view of ARIA Resort & Casino. It's a matter of principle. I find the practice of changing resort fees without notifying existing bookings unfair practice. Even if resort fees have changed since our booking, I feel that ARIA should still honor what the agreed upon terms were during booking. This is the FIRST time I've ever experienced this with any establishment. 

Yes, the resort and casino is conveniently located. However, I hope you would take my experience into consideration when booking so that you know you are making an informed decision.

My husband and I always love to stay here and we come minimum 3 times a year but the last 2 stays of ours were very unsatisfactory and all due to unprofessional staff at Mlife. 

My husband did not get any points added to his card while he was playing table games and slots and at the time f check out when he went to Mlife he was told that it will take 24 hours to add his points. Fine after 24 hours when we didn't see his points I called Mlife VIP customer service and Sheila answered. 

Upon telling her my issue she was rude and answered that my husband probably didn't put his Mlife card while playing. Hello he is a Platinum member and he played $3000 in table games only not counting the $1000 he played in slots. 

She didn't sound happy when i told her that it is impossible she put me on 30 minutes hold and then came back and told me that ""oh I called downstairs to see why his points weren't added and they told me they are updating the system and will enter the points manually which will take a week"".

Well just dinner one night was 6000 points and not counting the 3 to 4 shows we watch each time that we are there. This is how Mlife is misleading us because we are very disappointed and we always upgrade to tower suite.

To top this while my husband went to the tower suite lobby to grab few bottles of water the representative at the door asked him to show his keys. We went there couple of times already previous day and he saw us and he didn't ask anyone else but us to show the keys???? Why only because we are people of color or he thought we can't afford tower suites????

To become Platinum Mlife member we need 200 000 tier credits which is $8000 in total but each time we stay here we surpass this and now with this type of treatment I rather pay and stay and spend my money elsewhere.

This long awaited vacation ruined because of Aria's poor customer service and mishandling of its issues. I can't sleep right now just thinking about it and we have one more night here. Argh!

Feb. 11 we checked in around 1230PM & was greeted by a pleasant Jennifer at the front desk, all was great & fine until we got into our room. The TV was not working, the screen was a flashing sign 'No Cable Connected', called the front desk and was told they've had this issue 3 days ago and are still trying to resolve it. First of all, we enjoy hanging out in our room watching TV, we rest while watching TV, we get ready while watching TV, and we watch TV to fall asleep. TV is vital for us! You expect a functioning TV in any hotel especially in a five star hotel like Aria. Added to the problem is, you can't even turn it off, the flashing sign will light up the room all night. So we tried calling the front desk again around 540PM through the operator, it kept dropping our call 3x before finally getting hold of someone. We requested if we can at least get the TV turned off and that it was unacceptable to have the light on all night, it's disruptive for us, front desk said they will send someone RIGHT AWAY to fix the problem. 645PM came and no one came. Found out from the other guests, they have a working TV. We went downstairs to follow-up and maybe request to switch rooms. Spoke to a manager named Mike, he explained that they can switch rooms but they don't know which rooms have working TVs, so we might get another room with the same problem. He also explained what's been going on and that they've been backed up for days fixing this issue, he then wrote our room #, I don't know what good that would do, and suggested some guests would just cover the TV with a towel. Ha!

Mind you this whole ordeal we never got a sincere apology for this inconvenience from any of them. When we checked in, it would be nice to have been given a heads up of the technical issue they were experiencing. It was WRONG for the front desk to imply and set expectation that they were sending someone to fix the problem right away. We were practically waiting for no one. Should I believe Mike? I lost my faith in Aria, it's 12 midnight right now, no TV, no apology!

Luckily, the maintenance man they sent was super nice and cool and told us some history about the hotel while we waited for a fix. The lobby and casino were pretty nice and felt clean and new, though the whole thing smelled strongly of vanilla (not the rooms). Decent restaurant selection (buffet was OK, and we got $100 food voucher per room for booking), and the hotel is connected by indoor walkway to the rest of Citycenter's shops and hotels. I felt like we were decently located, but it's not right in the middle of things, if that's a consideration for booking. The pool was pretty nice, but it closed SO early -- 6 p.m.! The sun wasn't down but we had to leave, and they don't have any sort of night activities out there like some of the hotels, so that was disappointing. I guess they have a club (VIP?) but that's not my scene, so I didn't check it out. Overall, I was very happy with the hotel, though it was on the pricey side, and I think for the trip we were taking, we'd have been just as fine at a lower-price-point place instead.",1,0,1

Arrived at 320 and went into their ""Suite check in"" area.  Was informed room wasn't available. Even though check in was 3pm and this was after check in time.  She gave us a room key and said no room number was printed because they didn't want us to go to the room as it wasn't available. So after a 10 hour travel to get here we decided to park ourselves in the check in lounge and wait for our room to be a available. At 410pm we were called that our room I as available. So I asked what room number since we had room keys. Oh those don't actually work. They were just given to us to identify us as hotel guests. So we had to go back in line to get our room keys.  I wrote this review while waiting in line. Still waiting in line to get my room key.  So the line was 10 people deep and another 15 minutes to get working keys.

As we are mLife Gold Card holders, we often get comped rooms so this trip decided on the Aria.  I'm sad to say, for a fairly new hotel (I remember watching the entire City Center being built with much excitement), it was pretty beat up and not very friendly.  

The check in was uneventful.  Meaning, nothing happened except checking us in.  Wait - let me take that back.  They didn't have a king bed as requested so put us in 2 queens.  OK - it happens, but the front desk host didn't seem very apologetic nor happy to even help us.  

The room looked good at first, we had a nice view of the strip.  Upon closer inspection, there was a huge chip out of a high shelf.  Then looking below at the counter\/desk area, it was beat up, like someone had smashed a chair several times in the side.  You could also see water damage on the counter from Ice Bucket which sits above the fridge.  As I was looking at the shelf, I rubbed my hand over it and saw that it hadn't been dusted in a while.   

While a small thing, instead of lotion near the bathroom sink, there was conditioner.  It was like the maid didn't pay attention to the little details when prepping the room.  

When checking out, a similar experience at the front desk.  Very bland response.  I really felt they were just going through the motions.  

The casino tables are expensive.  Minimum bet is always $10, even in the morning when other casino's in the area go to $5.  

When we were considering the buffet or the café, we approached the café to check out a menu.  When we decided on the buffet, the hostess at the café didn't seem too happy.  

One I thing I did like was the pillows.  I'm very picky about pillows and these were great.  

Pillow however, are not a great reason to stay at a hotel.  If you have a choice, I would choose the Mirage or Bellagio.",9,4,0

Front desk was a pain to work with. But other staff was very very nice. Maybe my expectations were too high? but for a fancy hotel like this i expected more out of the organization. 

Over all:
Good to visit, maybe not to stay as a guest. 

Issue:
- Reserved a double bed room, but they ran out. They told us to check back the next day for any openings.
- Offered a roll away but that was never delivered (our friend had an air mattress and we opted for that since we were on hold for way too long trying to follow up on the roll away by phone)
- Called at 2am for housekeeping and extra blankets... which took forever to be brought up
- Called at 10am for a new room... on hold for forever again. Was finally told to check back after 11:30... called at 11:3 and was told to check back after 1:30... and each time it took at least 20mins if not longer to get someone on the phone, and at one point went down to talk to them b\/c being on hold for that long sucks. 
- Finally was told we had a double bed room and was moved... get to the room and found it was just another single... we didn't want to waste time with more waiting for service, moving, etc so just opted for the air mattress again.
- Tried to check out from the room, again a long and slow process
- North entrance to hotel a little confusing... but the looks of current construction in the area makes me hope it will be more straight forward later with better signs to direct the guests
- Cafe Vettro (their late night 24 hr restaurant) not very good

Good experiences:
- Very friendly staff... from housekeeping, to poolside, to security, to valet... all very nice and helpful.
- Beautiful decor (hotel and casino)
- Nice pool area
- On the strip",4,1,1

Beginning with our communications with the concierge prior to arriving in Las Vegas, we were completely satisfied with the service provided by everyone we encountered. This concierge was particularly helpful in providing recommendations for shows\/activities, and responded promptly with great suggestions. Upon arrival, we were out of the airport within 5 minutes, as our courtesy limo was waiting at baggage claim. This luxury is unmatched for those who know how awful the cab line can be in Las Vegas! This hotel is very convenient off of the highway, and future trips were made simple with the express cab line for Sky Suites visitors.

We were next greeted by wonderful staff at the check in who informed us of complementary food\/drinks provided for Sky Suites guests throughout the day. This was an awesome bonus! Varieties of drinks and snacks that were changed at breakfast, lunch and dinner were a great complement to the entire experience. 

Our room was truly the highlight of our entire weekend-wow! The decor and cleanliness was unlike any hotel we have ever stayed in. As we entered, the drapes dramatically opened to display the most amazing view of the strip! Our room was a huge one bedroom\/one and a half bath with a full living and eating area, large bedroom, and massive bathroom that was perfectly elegant. A few minutes after coming in, we received a visit from hotel staff to ensure we were satisfied with our room-we certainly were! The entire room was controlled technologically with a convenient system that allowed us to adjust lights\/music\/drapes\/temperature from a small device. 

The bed deserves its own description because it was so comfortable! King size with the best pillows I've slept on! If there wasn't so much we wanted to do in Vegas, the bed was comfortable enough to have stayed in for our entire trip. In sum, our room was a major highlight-a place we were very comfortable and pleased with the cleanliness maintained throughout. 

In sum, we had an incredible weekend grounded in the MOST amazing Sky Suites experience. We will not be returning to Vegas unless we are staying at the Aria!",0,0,0

Pros
- You can check in early if the room is ready
-They give you the key as many as you need.
-If you are a member of MLife, and play tournaments or 5 hours at the table, you will get comped. In fact, our hotel room became $970 to $550 by playing 1 tournament and 10 hours of poker! (They will be able to add all of our time spending there which is AWESOME)
-The hotel stuffs are very nice. 
-The room is fancy and makes you enjoy Vegas even more with the view from the room.
-The hotel is located right at where you want to be (Close to everything!)
-Drinks are free in casino.
-The restaurant close to the entrance that serves tapas is VERY GOOD!!!! Everything is so great!!! Our server YOSHI was the kindest, funniest, and coolest server ever.. His service totally enhanced our meal.
-Pools are very nice and clean. Service was great also.

Cons
-The waitress at the casino gave me the worst attitude. (Just that person but no body else)
-Lemon Grass (restaurant) was good but over priced.
-Hot tub was cold.

I mean everyone is there to have fun because it is Vegas!! 

I will definitely come back and stay here this summer!

In this case, I had discounted rates for a conference, I didn't get any confirmation emails (Aria's email notifications may not all be going thru), so I called up Michelle.  She went above-and-beyond to remind me of a past reservation I earlier made there at half the price (I did have a later calendar invite to cancel it!), and switched me over hassle-free.

Oh, and it had the funkiest Japanese toilet that comes with its own remote control.  You can guess some things it might do.  And it includes private limo rides, wahoo.

Why it's not 5 stars is for the everything else, other than the room.  The restaurant selections are unremarkable, and in fact extremely formulaic for LV (steak, seafood, Italian, cafe), and the buffet was a huge disappointment.

My brother arrived 45 minutes after me, and after about an hour I texted him not to come here and get another hotel.  He replied I'm all ready in my room at the Aria.  He had spoken to a manager and explained the situation.  I asked for a manager and the guy working said unless you're sharing a room with your brother there is nothing we can do,  ""We all ready made an exception for one family member we can't make one for another""   Really, what college of hospitality did you go to?

I asked him to speak to a manager, the manager said no to the latino guy helping me.  Then I demanded to speak to the manager and she refused and said I can't cut the line the wait is only 30 minutes.  This was a fat black lady for lack of better description.  This is where I got upset.  The line is easily two hours to check in, and I've been on it for about an hour, and your response is a lie. ""it's only 30 minutes and you can't cut the line""!

With that said referred to a new host from a friend of mine as myself and 7 friends headed to Las Vegas for a 4 night stay and 3 days of top shelf golf, food, fun etc.  I will as I get time detail each restaurant and golf course individually.  This is simply the Aria and its set up.  My New Host Nicole Houng was arrainged and she set up King Sized rooms 3 non smoking and 1 smoking for the gamblers in the group. The other 4 guys set up their rooms on their own.   All Rooms confirmed via email and very specific regarding type of room set up. If you recall my last trip outside the Mandalay Bay or Bellagio the Cosmopolitan was a complete phuck up.  This I hoped would go smoother.

We all arrived fairly late in the evening approximately 10-11PM Local time.  on Wednesday evening. Upon check in we were told only the 1 Smoking bed king was available and all others would be queen beds only for night one. Reading the reviews from other clients it appears this is the # 1 complaint. Either they don't have enough kings or they simply do not honor reservations.  Being from a casino reservation you would expect the king beds to be saved but alas it was not to be.  I had a short an animated conversation with front desk manager Ron Miller and told him this would not happen at the Mandalay Bay.  His Response and I quote "" If you would like for us to take you over to the Mandalay Bay we will be happy to"".   I literally was about to jump over the counter and smack the guy I was so pissed off with the complete and utter disrespect he seemed to sense it and backed off. Bottom line NO KING BEDS a bad start.

Check in and the queens and rooms are  pretty dam special. Every modern accoutrement and electronic set up including an I pad to control, lights, temperature, wake up calls, windows etc.  Beds for my taste entirely TOO SOFT. Heavenly mattress and linens but I need firm bed.  Bathroom handsomely appointed with tub and separate shower and toilet.   Twin sinks but the power outlets sat in the middle directly behind all their soap shampoo set up and it was difficult to plug things in without knocking everything over.  All and all rooms pretty impressive king or not.  Unlike many hotels, elevators plentiful with good security checking room keys.  

Step back now as upon check in I sent a quick email off to Nicole (Casino Host) and relayed the evenings spectacle at the front desk.  She was IRATE that we would be treated that way. Mind you I'm on a 100% comp room while the other boys are new casino rate guests.   Nicole went up and beyond at this point first by comping the rooms for the other 3 guests on a casino rate for the 1st night.  She had valets move all the luggage and clothes and toiletries the next day to anyone who wanted king rooms.  Sent us all 8 a Complimentary buffet pass for the next morning and the 4 from the casino received a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and pastries Thursday night.  Let me tell you something, I've been around customer service all my life and this lady gets it.  Thank you Nicole our stay was nothing short of outstanding and anyone I'm sending to Vegas will be heading your way. 

I'll review the restaurants separately.  Bottom line is Casino was spacious and never Smokey. Never made it to the pool but looked nice.  Transportation and bell person service was easy and quick.  Spacious promenade level with multiple dining options casual and formal.   All and All a pretty impressive hotel that understands customer service.  

One small caveat that needs to be mentioned. Playing Craps the last night I walked over to the table with a bag in my hand had a golf shirt in it ""Gift"".  Stan the boxman stated don't forget your bag when you leave ok.  Played craps did very well and at one point a die hit off the dealers chest back into play and the stickman called no roll.  WAIT it was a winner 10 about 1K payoff to me and my 5 friends Playing.  Before we could even start the uproar Stan said PAY THEM.   That's star #1.  Then after we all did fairly well, we went to the cage and I of course left my bag under the table.  10 minutes later Stan runs me down and finds me to hand me the bag.    Again up and above and beyond the call of duty. Super service and then some.

Walking into Aria for the first time I noticed the decor was very intercontinental and had a fall\/winter palette. It was calming and different from the other hotel\/casinos. The check-in was easy and we got the wedge room with a cool city center and strip view. The room had a great first impression. You tap your room key and open the door to hi-tech wonder! The lights came on, curtains open up, and the TV turns on to the home-screen automatically! I discovered quickly that the alarm clock also doubles as the room control panel. It controls all the lighting plus the bathroom, curtain settings, mood music, room temp, and other stuff you'll find out once you stay there! Also for the less tech inclined, all the lights has their own on\/off switch. The TV has a separate dedicated remote.

Aria has the best soak tub! At first it was weird that you had to walk through the shower to get inside the tub but it makes sense now. It makes it easy to rinse and helps with water overflow (especially when you're having too much fun in the tub!). The towels were plush and the robes were comfy to wear for lounging.

Tip for new guests; if you want a room cleaning, you have to turn on the SERVICE light otherwise you'll get skipped. I found that out after I asked a maid who was cleaning a room down the hall. I like having fresh sheets and towels everyday so yes please to the maid. The housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful when I requested more soap.

The bed was perfect! It had six fluffy large pillows and a mattress made from clouds. I was in sleep heaven!

A few things that prevented this review from being a 5 star was:
1) Control4 software was still buggy. Slow response and not intuitively easy buttons functionality.
2) No in-room check out yet
3) They need a quick-access card for non-tech savvy people.

If you have the opportunity to stay at Aria, do it!",11,3,6

The rooms are state of the art with remote control curtains and lighting. Bathroom is large, loved the tub. The beds are very comfortable.  My favorite was the closets, and how they have two large closets with with enough hangers a space to hang plenty of dresses or dress shirts without having to share with the person you are traveling with. 

My only concern and reason I'm not giving it 5 stars was the night club, they need better security. Went in for 20 mins and saw 2 fights, poor bartenders were using the flashlights trying to get security to help and security was nowhere to be found. First time security never showed up and second time by the time security came girl was already punched in the face and pulled away from her friends. This made me feel very unsafe, bartenders should be able to get help from the security ASAP.  
So I left immediately after seeing the second fight and no security.

As the fifth time coming toVegas and explorin a new hotel, I expected it to be top notch as advertised. Instead, housekeeping used my wive's personal products during the stay while cleaning our room. I have pictures to prove this - her brush and makeup was used. Not only that, her curling iron I had given her as a birthday gift was taken by housekeeping. I have called multiple times as they promised it would be found in the lost and found with no call back. For the used products, I called and had the property manager come to the room to show her what we saw (IE dark hair all in my blonde wive's new brush - dark hair all around the makeup products which I have pictures of) and said oh yes someone used this. We can replace the cost of the brush?! No. How inappropriate for a nice vegas hotel to use personal products and offer a replacement brush to fix this. Finally, a hotel manager called back and said yes the property manager confirmed there was a hair in the brush - no, there were about 20+ and again I have pictures to prove this. So finally after having to go thru it all again we had a night comped. However, the $200 beachwaver curling iron my wife had to have for her birthday is still no where to be found and I have yet to get a call back on my stolen property.

Went to Todd English's pub and paid $30.00  for a pitcher of some watered-down sangria.  Unless you go at happy hour, expect to pay $9.00 for a budweiser!!  

Stood back in line at 2:45 until 4:30.  Our room was finally ready. Our view was overlooking a rooftop and the side of the Cosmopolitan, no mountains or strip whatsoever, boo hiss. Ok, can't complain too much since the room was paid for by the company.  

We called down to have our bags brought up and was on hold for a good 10 min before we got to speak to someone.  Got the bags up quick, and the guy was super nice (we were on the 4th floor). Found out the TV didn't work.  Again called to try and get help was on hold for another 10 min.  They said that a tech could come up to fix it, I asked if we could just switch rooms.

Cost-wise, everything is (unsurprisingly) a bit on the high side from restaurants to coffee and whatnot.  There are some cheaper eats if you don't mind walking a little bit across the street like at Planet Hollywood - just be aware that you're going to pay for a bit more nearby.  Still, even though they're price, you do have some solid choices like Julian Serrano to Lemonagrass.  

The casino floor is relatively classy and fairly nice.  It is smoky sure but it has definitely a more mature feel to it with some piano moves going on at a bar to the nice number of tables all-around.  

Service on our part was pretty solid all around.  The only drawback I had was the wait for the room which was going to be hours longer than expected.  Luckily, I was motioned to go to a customer service rep. who helped me get a room immediately (had to slightly downgrade to a lower floor but the rep. was kind enough to still make it as high as possible).  Everything else also came on time or fairly quickly whether it was the housekeeping to the luggage.  

The king bed room itself was awesome.  Smaller than a suite but thought the bed was super comfy and the tech. in the room was cool (the shades opened up automatically as I walked in which was a great touch).  The restroom was also neat and beautiful.  I thought the decor of the hallways were a little too retro but everything else design-wise was great (especially love the lobby which is always decorated with something beautiful).

One final worthy note is the location.  It's really centralized so you can really not go too wrong unless you have to be the far north or south of the strip.  Otherwise, the Cosmo\/Monte Carlo\/Planet Hollywood are a simple walk away.  

All-in-all, it's not the best hotel stay I had in the world but it was well worth the price and worth the location.",2,1,2

I thought we we going to experience a 5 star hotel.  Unfortunately, we had a different experience.  The room was quite nice.  Clean, new, big...but still nothing completely outstanding.  My main gripe is the service.  One one think when staying in a exclusive hotel such as the Sky Suites, you would have top notch service.  What we experienced was definitely lackluster.  Slow response times, un-attentive staff, nothing to differentiate guests at the standard Aria to the Sky Suites, other than Sky Suites having a single inconvenient entry, and the hotel nickel and dimming you for EVERYTHING (except for the free super slow internet).  

One example, while starting our birthday celebration early, we decided to get the bottle of Patron in the minibar.  $40 for the bottle...overpriced, but it is the mini bar, so it was understandable.  What really irritated me was when I called to get some lime wedges, they charged me $15 for a half of a lime, and it took them a hour to bring it to the room!!!  Come on!!  You'd think they could throw in a 50 cent lime for a small $40 bottle of tequila in a near $1000 a night room.  It's only $15, but its that idea of it all that really got to me.  They don't care about the guests, they only cared about the guest's $$$.

I've not been to Vegas since City Center and Aria open, so this was my chance to check it out. I didn't actually stayed here. This is more about the casino.

I did a brief walk around Crystals (looks nice) because I didn't have time to waste. On to the craps table. 

From what I can tell it's nice and modern but then again...you should expect this from a casino that's new. Too much brown for my taste but to each their own. 

Met these guys from Denver, who live in different parts of the country now and they do an annual trip to Vegas. We played craps from 10pm-5am. More than fantastic!!! Dealers are nice and courtesy. Drink service was timely.

2. Super dark casino area...making for a somewhat dark entire first level.
3. -2- service calls for assistance with the tv. This in just the first morning after our 3pm check in. 
4. Unless you want to spend 30 minutes upon check in reading about how to operate your room...book elsewhere.  Just too high tech for the average traveler.   Unless you're under 25.
5.  Lighting in the rooms is ""low"".  While I applaud them for their LEED certification, additional lighting options would be nice.  
6. No automatic doors when arriving with your luggage... And no one to assist except for your friendly fellow check in client ( if your lucky)

When you first enter, all of the hanging paper mobiles and floral arrangements create a modern artsy environment letting you know you have arrived in Vegas. I wasn't too pleased with the wait to check in at the front desk, but that's too be expected since it's summer and everyone's on vacation. 

This is the most high tech hotel I have ever stayed in. As soon as we entered the room, the drapes opened automatically, the TV came on with our names appearing on the welcome screen and the dance music started playing. Everything from the TV to the drapes to the temperature are controlled by one  touch screen pad. So if you never wanted to leave the bed you don't have to! In addition, you no longer have to fumble with those awkward cardboard door hangers to alert housekeeping. Here, there is an electric switch installed in the door.

My favorite part of the room was the bathroom. I love to take baths so I appreciated the large deep soaking tub. There is one door that opens to the shower which is right in front of the bathtub, so it makes rinsing off after a bath very easy. I will definitely keep this design idea in mind when we go to remodel the master bathroom in our home. Thanks Aria!

I really always want to love this hotel. It's so hip, so modern, so glamorous. Sometimes though, it fails to live up to expectations. At first, the visit was not so great. Luckily the concierge was very nice and helpful. Our first room had potato chips ground into the carpet everywhere. Called concierge and they moved us. The second room was not made yet and still had dirty towels and was unmade- they gladly moved us again. Third room was great. We had a view of the fountains and they also gave us $100 credit for all the troubles. I was glad to see how helpful they were! The rooms are really nice, except sometimes the technology doesn't work and it's semi-frustrating. Very nice mega-resort, and definitely a must stay for location and modern atmosphere.

For such a extraordinary price I would expect better. As a matter of fact I would expect the best. Instead your just paying for a decent looking casino. I say decent because it has a modern look to it but in my eyes the bellagio still has a better decor.

We go to MGM Detroit a lot and wanted to try out a MGM-brand hotel in Vegas.  We booked through the MLife website, which gave a very nice discount.

Check-in
We arrived in on a Wednesday around 5pm.  I was expecting to have to wait forever (around Chinese New Year), as many reviews indicated. But, there was no wait. Check in was just fine - the concierge wasn't super friendly though.  

Room
It was very nice.  I loved the big closet area and the mountain view we had.  Kind of a long walk from the elevators, but nothing to really complain about.  Housekeeping was decent, except sometimes they didn't replace all of our towels or empty\/clean our drinking glasses.

Casino
Consistent with most of the other MGM casinos.  I saw lots of table games with $20 minimums, more than I saw at the Bellagio.  Cocktail waitresses came around frequently.  It wasn't super crowded when we there (even on the weekend) so it was easy to get on a table.  I'd say the crowd was mostly well off upper 20s, lower 30 year olds. It's a nice space, but we spent most of our time gambling elsewhere.

Check out
Soooo easy. I just did it from my cell phone and a folio was sent to my email immediately.  Perfect.  Taxi area was well organized and the Aria staff were helpful.

One was the fact that I was able to call for our car at valet in our room. By the time we arrived downstairs, it was ready for us. Even the valet wait area was enclosed especially great for the sweltering heat over the summer.

I was disappointed that they were unable to grant us late check-out. We tried to ask in advance but of course they gave us an excuse that their system was down. Food is relatively expensive throughout the property, but at least you are surrounded by delicious choices. 

I like the fact that there is always an attendant in front of the elevators actually checking whether someone is a guest at the hotel by flashing their key card. It is definitely a deterrent for random people to enter the guest rooms. 

I didn't like our bathroom. I feel as though the bathroom was really a waste of space. Although there was a really large tub, no one used it. Also, the whole point of the door in the bathroom is that people could use it at the same time. Instead, it is a frosted door. Again, the frosted door is a waste. The toilet should have been a separate room.

For multiple people in the same room, it is rather small. However, if you are staying here, this hotel has great amenities. It is adjacent to Crystals if you re into high end shopping and relatively close to the Cosmopolitan.

of minutes"" we didn't want to leave the hotel to explore the strip or find a place to eat. Logic told us that since we were getting our room asap, it would be awesome to just get our stuff from the bell desk asap to freshen up before we did anything crazy. 

We went to the 16th floor expecting there to be a bench or sitting area near the elevator (there wasn't). We waited and waited but no text. 

That was fine so we opted to go to the promenade area where there was a Starbucks, I even told my friends to see what the pool situation was like while I waited at the Starbucks with some of our stuff. Still no text. It was becoming clear that the ""couple of minutes"" was BS. 

After what seemed like forever of frustration - waiting, calling the front desk to see what our
room number was, telling us we didn't have a room yet, putting us on hold, telling us we were not on the 16th floor so where did we get that info, putting us on a longer hold, speaking with the manager, and getting an apology for the miscommunication - we got directed to the 24th floor. They told us the keys we already have in our possession were programmed for our new room (a higher floor, yes, but not an upgrade). 

We go to the 24th floor, and by this time it's an hour and a half after check in, and of COURSE our keys don't work. So we go downstairs to the front desk, where they gave us new keys. Wtf right now. How many more runarounds are we going to go through in this hotel. 

It was such a sour beginning to what was expected to be a pretty sweet trip. After that everything about the Aria annoyed us, from the bell desk taking their time delivering our belongings, to the fact that Lyft doesn't pick you up where valet is, you have to go to the back of the hotel. 

We were told that the hotel was completely full which resulted in this little snafu. But here's the thing ... If the first front desk person just told us that, then we could have used the first two hours to do something with our time rather than waiting on their text and calling management. Telling us it'll be a ""couple of minutes"" was a poor choice on their part and could be fixed with some serious training. 

The employees here have to be aware that almost all their guests are coming to Vegas from far away locations and have a limited time there. If the rooms not ready, don't cover your ass and say one will be available soon. Maybe recommend a place to eat or wait while you guys get everything together. Or if you know you're fully booked, let  your waiting guests know via text or phone call that it'll take longer for the room to be ready? So many ways to avoid a frustrating situation and Aria failed miserably. 

Needless to say, I won't be returning here anytime soon.",3,2,1

I recommend you visit for a view, it's architecturally gorgeous and visually extremely appealing ... but please if you can help it AT ALL do not stay at this hotel.

I came here this past weekend and experienced something I had never experienced before in a Las Vegas hotel, especially one of this caliber; I was disappointed. My disappointment lasted the entirety of the stay and not once, despite the hotel manager's niceness, did it change from disappointment to contentment.

That's something to be said about this multi-billion dollar establishment whose advertisement claims it rivals that of top notch hotels like Wynn and Venetian. When you go to a hotel, some of the basic things you expect are that all of the regular items are there such as cups for drinking, ice bucket, toiletries, towels ... these are pretty normal. I have gone to 2-star middle of nowhere motels or inns where these items were properly in their place. However, after a tedious check in process where they don't have lines and it's literally a free for all at the bar of check in (who does this?) I was faced with a room missing all kinds of basic essentials.

That's okay, I already told myself that I wanted to stay here despite the bad reviews so I pressed on thinking that they are new, they have 4,400 rooms so sometimes there will be little things missing here and there.

The notorious everything remote was actually frozen, and after several calls to the front desk, I ended up fixing it myself by resetting the remote and reconnecting it so that it would work again. It didn't work too well but I applaud them for the effort since no other hotel has this. Still, when I'm watching TV and want to change the channel, I don't want the curtains to suddenly close or open, or all the lights to dim or brighten for no reason. Somebody needs to find a better software engineer.

The TV was also a source of problems, even though it was the nice flat LCD screens that most hotels have nowadays, the remote was geared only for their programming and the TV itself was locked up in terms of physical buttons so when the TV back light kept dimming itself and turning itself back on which is SUPER annoying for TV watching ... more than 8 calls to the front desk and requests to get it fixed went unnoticed. 

Okay, I will deal with the screwy remote that doesn't always work and the annoying TV that keeps changing the back light. The rooms did look nice, our view was nice (although definitely obstructed by the two slanted towers (apartments? harmon? mandarin? I don't even know ...). The bed was by *far* the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in of any hotel I've stayed at ... and the shower had on pressure. All little things I was willing to deal with because after all, it was nice, it was new, and it was Aria.

Then came room service. Despite several calls to complete our basic essentials on the day of check in, after the room was serviced the next day I came back to missing towels, missing toiletries (why did they take them away? more importantly, why weren't they replaced?) and no cups! After several calls again to the front desk, some of which went who knows where, finally the proper set of toiletries and towels and cups were returned to the room. Why couldn't they have been there to begin with? 

Due to my horrible experience with HAZE (please read HAZE review for more information), I complained to the hotel manager about my mistreatment as well as some of these other little annoyances and he was generous enough to comp me $30 to my room for whatever I wanted (i.e. room service, drinks, etc.). We had talked about this for 30 minutes and he encouraged me to file a security report which I did. He said he setup everything.

The next day when I checked out, I found out that even though he repeatedly told me $30 comp, it was only $25. Why would he lie to me? Why didn't he put on $30? or why didn't he just say $25? I'm not complaining about the comp but if you're going to comp, you have to do it right at least?

And when I went to the front desk to check the total bill, they charged me for a $4.00 diet coke from the fridge that I *never* touched and did not have (I don't even like diet sodas). I argued with them and even requested that they check their fridge with no avail. I was out $4.00 for no good reason. What a joke, most places would just take it off since it's a diet coke and probably cost them $0.10 in mass quantities. 

In the end, my stay was littered with bad room service, lack of basic essentials in the room, faulty technology, rude clubbing experience, expensive room that was not really worth all the hype and price tag, and a comp that was half-heartedly given when I was being repeatedly told $30 and only ended up with $25 (again ... its fine if he didn't give anything but why ... lie?)

I guess I should have listened to my fellow Yelpers.",19,9,7

We arrived around 6pm and there was no queue at the Reception so we was checked in right away, we had also received a complimentary upgrade to a Strip\/City View, i had asked for a high floor and the highest they could put us was the 22nd, the hotel did not seem full so I'm not sure why they couldnt have put us on a higher floor but the 22nd was great!! 

We arrived into our room and the music on the TV came on automatically, and the blackout curtains begin to open to show you the view, a really cool idea! I also loved the remote controlled device where you could change the lighting,the TV,the automatic curtains and other parts of the room, the bed was also very comfortable, parts of the room was looking a bit dated from the bedside cabinets and wardrobes, but apart from that a really nice room with a great view of the Aria and parts of the Las Vegas Strip.

What i love about this Hotel though is the chilled out vibe,everywhere seems really relaxed including all of the employees who work at the Aria.

The pool area is also really nice and one of the main reasons why we came back, we love the pool areas alot and loved the chilled out music begging played from the speakers, all the pool attendants was really friendly and couldnt do enough to help, though drink prices are really expensive around the pool, we paid $17 for two beers which was a bit crazy but this can be expected from the Pool bars in Vegas.

If you're a modern architecture and design freak like I am, you'll live this place for the design alone.  The first thing you'll notice is the amazing architecture and the incredible level of design detail throughout the casino and hotel.  You can tell that an architect had final say on Aria's design and not a financial committee (or maybe it was a financial committee with a lot of taste).  It's very modern, very much in the spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright (although he was not one of the architects involved with Citycenter).

The casino itself does not wreak of cigarette smoke as most everywhere in Las Vegas does. I assume it's a factor of a better ventilation system, perfumed air (vaguely sweet), and the fact that people are starting to give up a habit that might kill them.  The casino floor appeared empty in comparison to its more popular neighbors like the Bellagio.  Interestingly, the casino isn't a twisting maze designed to make you lose your sense of direction (see MGM Grand).

The rooms are great.  The beds seemed a little bit smaller than a traditional queen for some reason, but I didn't exactly measure the bed.  The focus of the room is the floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall window that opens up to the view.  From rooms 10294 and 10296 we could see Vdara, a part of the Bellagio, the Palms, and the mountains west of Las Vegas.  Although a Strip view would have been ideal, the desert sunsets were incredible from the room.  Beautiful modern fixtures and the dark-brown wood motif from the rest of Aria is carried on throughout the room.

The bathrooms were decently sized and had two sinks and a separate toilet and a very large stand-up shower with a large bath tub all behind the same glass barrier.

The coolest part of the room is the ability to control everything (all lights, curtains, etc.) from the TV menus or from the touch-screen clock\/""computer"" in each room.  Even cooler was the button labeled ""Goodnight"" near the bed that shuts off every light, closes the drapes, and turns off the TV.

The pools were small and shallow.  They have three elliptical pools with many many many chairs in a variety of locations providing lots of shade or sun.  They religiously enforce rules that don't allow smoking or drinking in the pools which means some drunk-ass bro with his barbed-wire tats isn't going to spill his Shit Beer Light into the pool which prevents the pools from smelling like a fraternity house the morning after a party.  The pools were not amazing but were clean and comfortable.

The staff is also very nice.  Everyone -- including the maids -- greet you as you walk past them (surprisingly, most could speak english).

Price wise we paid $577 for two rooms (w\/ 2 queens each) for an entire weekend.

OTHER INFO:  There is a free CityCenter tram that connects Aria with the Monte Carlo and the Bellagio.  It's difficult to get to the street from Aria so I suggest taking the tram to either casino and get to the Strip from there.  Also, the concierge desk is great -- use them.

Keep in mind that Aria is trying to be a ""different"" Las Vegas.  Earlier reviews got it right; if you're looking for ""traditional"" Vegas go somewhere else.  It's not trying to be a representation of somewhere else.  It dispatches with cheesy gimmicks that are commonly associated with LV (gondola rides, pirate shows, a 1\/4 size model of the Eiffel Tower) in favor of architecture and comfort.  Aria seems to concentrate on the resort aspect of a resort-casino.  It seems like the small casino was almost an afterthought.  

If you want something that offers a nice respite from the usual Las Vegas strip but still put's you close to the action, then Aria is your place.",5,2,0

I've stayed here many times, but this was honestly the worst stay I've had. I wanted to splurge and treat my family to the Sky Suites, which ended up being an amazing room with a great strip view. 

The buffet: despite getting in pretty fast, was seriously understaffed for LDW. Wasn't asked what we wanted to drink until 30 minutes after being seated. The buffet had crab legs which must have been a hot item because they were all picked over. Okay, if a buffet is serving crab legs that aren't precut you would think they'd offer proper utensils. Looked over to see five other tables struggling until we had to hunt down a staff member to see if they can provide the cracking tool. Food tasted fine but 3 of us were literally running to the restroom within 5 minutes of leaving... pretty sketchy. 

The spa: requested a couples massage with a female massage therapist. Ended up being welcomed with two guys telling us ""oh, we were expecting a gay couple"". Weird. Didn't want a male massage therapist at all, but decided I didn't want to make a scene. He was nice, I don't remember his name, but probably the least relaxing massage ever. It felt like I was being jabbed by pointy hard callouses on his hand the entire time. Was not worth $540, they didn't even apply the resort credit from booking our room. 

Liquid Club: didn't even get in despite staying at the hotel in the sky suites, being on a promoters guest list, and being told that gold Mlife members get free access. Ridiculous, we were seriously turned away, so decided to go to the Sky pool instead. 

Mlife desk: you would think they'd know the ins and outs of tier credits, when they get posted, etc. Received different answers on the same questions multiple times. Also, was pretty much cut off and talked over when I was asking a specific question and situation. Makes me wonder why I even want to gamble with Mlife.

I honestly was pretty excited to check it out. It is one of the newest hot spots of the strip. I had also heard that the place was owned by the same people who own MGM grand.

I have to say it is really cool looking from the outside. They have a really neat futuristic architecture design. My friend commented how the building looked like it was twisted. They also have a lot of unique looking sculptures both outside and inside.

I actually expected the lobby of the hotel to be more grand. It's a bit on the plain side. It's neat though. They have a bunch of soft benches with high wooden backs. I can't quite describe the carpet but it had some neat orange designs. I'm sure people who are exhausted from walking around appreciate all the places where they can sit. There is also the latest music being played throughout the casino.

Attached to the casino is a shopping center. It's a pretty cool place. At first it almost felt like I was at a convention center - too white and big but then I walked downstairs and this was where I discovered how really cool it is. The stairs have these pretty and unique flower designs that light up. Plenty of tourists were taking their special kodak moments here. There were also different fountains where the colors changed constantly. Little kids were playing there because every time you touched the fountain water would come down from the inside and the colors would change. Shopping-wise this place had the coolest shops. The Louis Vuitton store was amazing. It was huge and very fancy. One of the best looking Louis Vuitton stores I've seen.

Aria definitely is a cool looking place. (Oh and they're not bad slot machine wise too...those machines tend to give a little and not necessarily take all your money hehe).

I've been in a lot of them the past few years and I usually try different ones based on what deal I can get and where I have and have not stayed.

The Aria is extremely modern and beautiful.  Years of smoking in the older hotels tends to make the hotels smell a little but it looks like the Aria was designed to inhibit this.  The casino itself has high ceilings and is insanely beautiful.  When you walk in there is a whiff of vanilla to greet you and leave you with a nice impression.

The rooms themselves are quite nice.  I think the cheapest I've ever found on a busy time was about $125\/night, which isn't bad considering how fancy the room is.  There is a $25 resort fee which is annoying but I really do use the wifi and it's included so I'm not complaining too much.  If I went to a Harrah's hotel with no resort fees, the wifi is like $20\/day.  Might as well pay the extra $5 and get full gym access too with all the bottles of water I can bring back to my room.  

I've only stayed in their basic rooms but they are still super nice.  When you walk in, everything powers on and everything is controlled by a touchpad that sits on your nightstand.  Bathrooms super clean and everything just has a nice touch to it.  The beds are something I just melt in...I've never had a rough time sleeping in an Aria bed.  

I've never  had an issue with customer service at this hotel nor really any problems whatsoever.  

I dinged a star because it is somewhat pricey and the rooms are VERY far from the elevators.  It's a good 3-5 minute walk in some cases from the elevator to your room and it's easy to get lost.  

Much like every Vegas hotel, look for a deal online somewhere if you decide to book here.

edit:  Crap forgot to review the buffet.

The Aria Buffet is quite nice.  I've only had it for brunch but it's about $35 (pricey) but they serve lobster and all sorts of seafood during the brunch buffet too so I'll deal with it.  I've never really had anything awful from this buffet so I think it's worth it.",4,1,3

Big plus for the tub in the shower, didn't even notice that until I actually took a shower. 

I guess the only qualms I have are the extremely long hallways and having to go back down to the casino level if you need to go to another room. We were on floor 6 but our friends also had a room on floor 20. So as you can see this became a hassel when we tried to meet up the others. First off I don't know why they didn't have us in connecting rooms, and secondinly they should've tried to put us on the same level or at least the same tower. No vent for the toilet area, so as you can understand it can get stuffy in there. There seems to also be a perfumed scent for the casino, which masks the cigarette smell but can also be a little too strong at times.

aria is one of the group of hotels that are the newest addition to the las vegas strip located in the city center. Its basically almost in the middle of everything so transportation shouldn't be so bad.

we got a double queen hotel room which was quite spacious with a modern design. upon walking in, the curtains automatically opened to greet us! Amazing! Haha. There's also a main touch screen remote control (similar to a tablet) that controls all the fuctions of the room. So u never have to leave that comfy bed! 

we also had a situation where we needed to change rooms and they were very accomodating and helped us do it in a quick fashion. 

the casino is nice, the shopping is nice, we didn't eat anywhere in the hotel but I don't doubt their food choices are nice.

the only thing that kinda was a burden was that they didn't allow roll away beds in double queen rooms so someone had to floor sleep :\/ & since their hotel had over 40000+ rooms, its kinda a trek to get to your room, with all the floors and unique curvy architecture but can't really do anything about that.

The casino is a nice casino, they call it a ""fresh air"" casino, and I do think it seems less smokey than other casinos on the strip. They have lots of delicious restaurant options (Javier's is particularly delicious Mexican food), and the guest relations manager is a really lovely person.

There goes my idea to cook...I realize we got there a little earlier than check-in time, but, uhh, previous guest's stuff still being in the fridge when we get there is a little concerning. 

Thank you for giving us a credit to use to make up for it, but I dunno, I feel like for the money we paid, we could've gotten a room somewhere with a bathroom door handle that didn't spontaneously fall off.

Booked a room at Aria, this was my 3rd Vegas trip and I was super excited to stay at Aria...big mistake. Check in mobile is such a fail, was supposed to wait for an email ..after 5 hours still no email, got to approach the lady in front desk and with no apology or anything I get a reply ""oh yes your room is ready"" like what the hell? 

When checking luggage in I gave to the guy few bucks and got the most furious glare ever instead of a thank you, same thing when I was checking out too, working in the service industry I'm always thankful for whatever I get and these guys had no shame in just making me feel obligated and sort of weird. 

Our hotel room was small, nothing like I saw on pictures and everytime we got off elevator it took us forever to find the room and it's a far walk. We stayed for 4 days and every morning we were hearing the construction drill that woke us up. There are no toothbrushes or toothpaste in the room. 

If you are not a Sky suite member at some point you'll feel weird, especially when you stand in line for buffet and there's another special line for Sky peeps that don't have to wait, or when you go to the pool and there's one private pool for Sky suites members only. As such a big brand hotel it's a shame to make some guests feel more special then others, everyone should feel accepted, welcomed and comfortable. 

When playing casino at the a slot machines during my 4.5 days at this hotel not even once a cocktail waitress came by to ask if we wanted a drink. They only concentrated on people who play at the table, and after I asked a floor manager to send a waitress over 3 TIMES she still never came over. You guys suck. 

Never ever again, and I have tons of friends coming to Vegas next month and everyone was messaging me about how I liked it and I just told everyone to book  Wynn , Encore or Bellagio. Stay away from this one. I couldn't wait to get back to New York. Thanks Aria ""Resort"" for nothing. 

Drinks at the pool $22-$55 (yeah and they're not even good)

Control everything through tv including lights and curtains.  Bath was nice, although shower had no pressure.  Fairly quiet, only heard neighbors once, at 5 am of course. 

Not great: The bed was way too soft and pillows useless. One lamp was broken, one of the two sinks clogged, tv remote would not work from the bed...needed batteries?.  There was also a smell of smoke in the room. I am guessing the neighbors.

The bad: We booked a package with two free buffets.  When I checked in I asked about them and was told it was a buffet credit, not free buffets.  She said that meant we had a food credit of $65 and could get lunch the first day and use the rest toward breakfast the next. So that was the plan.  Long story short, I checked my balance and was told the buffet credit was a one time use only so the extra we saved by choosing lunch and skipping drinks went to waste.  I asked to speak with the manager but the young lady spoke with him and said there was nothing her could do.  She was nice, but didn't fix the problem.

I was not expecting anything in return, especially because we were checking in the day of the Mayweather\/McGregor fight; however, they found a room on a higher floor for our stay.

Our room was immaculate, very relaxing and inviting. The attention to detail was second to none. In-room tablet controls everything. Very user friendly and a great compliment to the room.

My check-in was smooth and very professional, with very little wait. So far, so good. But finding your room the first time may be a challenge. I've stayed at LOTS of hotels, with all manner of layouts, but even I was bamboozled by the hallways and following too many signs to find my room number. If you're planning on a few cocktails, you may need to leave breadcrumbs to find your way back. If you ever find your room, you'll come into a sleek, modern space with a nice roomy feel. Soft beiges on the furniture are nicely contrasted by an eggplant carpet with three cream accent stripes. There are 16,296 buttons in the room and you probably won't have time to figure out what they all do, but the sheer and drape controls worked great and the curtains black things out nicely. The bathroom is large and has a ""wet area"", with the shower and then tub beyond set behind their own glass door. (FYI, the glass door is clear, so there's no privacy since anyone at the vanity can see any doodles or hoohahs in the wet area. But hey, if you're sharing a hotel room in Vegas with someone chances are they've already seen you naked. Thankfully the door to the WC is frosted.) The toiletries are boring.

The restaurant collection is tops, one of the very best in Vegas. Standouts are Julian Serrano, Sage, Bar Masa, and American Fish. Jean-Georges Steakhouse is decent but pales next to the chef's own Prime at Bellagio. Casual restaurants are also high-quality. The restaurants all have high-concept design and are all successful, which makes it puzzling as to why the lobby area, the casino, and the spa are all so boring in their design. Some people may see this as an antidote to the Vegas craziness, but when I'm in Sin City, I want all crazy all the time.

My spa treatment made up for the beigeness of the space by being absolute fantastic and restful, with larger-than-average rooms. It was pointy-nipple cold, so I didn't check out the pool.

My girlfriend and I decided to fly in after work on Friday and much to our excitement, a limo was supposedly awaiting us at the airport with my last name on a placard.  This was part of a package for a Sky Suite at Aria, where we planned to stay with 5 of our friends.

-1 star
We arrive at the airport and there is noone waiting for us to take us to our hotel.  I searched for 20 minutes before asking another Aria driver to contact the hotel and ask about our situation; they had no record of us or my friend whose name it was under despite the confirmation number we were given.

We requested a rollaway to be delivered to the room as there were 6 of us total (3 couples) and only 1 bed, but we had an air mattress as well.  The hotel told us not to worry, there would be plenty available and when we arrived, not only was there no rollaway, they were completely out of them.

-1 star 
We finally got the hotel via cab (which is fine, just don't promise me a limo and not deliver), only to find out the hotel had no record of my name on the room, which had been confirmed both the day before and the day of.  We finally got that figured out and were told to go to the wrong elevator where we couldn't find our room.

-1\/2 star
The room had the most beautiful view of any Vegas hotel I have stayed in to date.  With that said, the TV wasn't hooked up at all, but we made friends with one of the IT guys who helped us, who we then invited back for drinks later on with his friends after his shift.  The loss of stars is for the THREE maids they sent up sending us towel after towel instead of an IT guy.  Don't get me wrong, I love fluffy towels, but we wanted to get the Vegas energy going and needed the TV hooked up to listen to our music.

Cool points, but no star given.
In a sky suite (maybe in all of the bathrooms?) there is a toilet where you can wash your *front* and *back*.  There is even an emergency stop button.  Pretty cool stuff, I must say, but doesn't really provide a benefit.  Also, we ordered alcohol from the bathroom, try it, it's quite fun.

You would think one of the newest, most pricey hotels in Vegas would have a great pool.  Apparently not.  They have a ""party pool"" called Liquid Lounge and I'd love to say it's amazing, but even though we were hotel guests in a suite no less, they told us we'd have to pay $40 per guy and $10 per girl.  Not that we're cheap by any means, but the weather was pretty dismal and there was NO line whatsoever to get in throughout the entire day.  You would think Aria would want their hotel guests to experience their private pool and brag about it to friends to try out, right?  Even Hard Rock lets their customers go to Rehab on Sundays for free.  

Also, the music at the pool was horrendous.  The craziest the pool got was a baby splashing around in a little frog raft.  Lay off the chick music and soft rock guys.

1\/2 star
Haze is one of the newest, hottest nightclubs in Vegas and we had a great time....once we got in.  Let's backtrack.  If you're staying at Aria, you can call the front desk and they will put you on their guest list.  The problem is, we went down pretty early to make sure everything was in order for us to get in given the track record of the hotel for that weekend.  After speaking to 5 different employees working for Haze, I was given 5 different answers and only by sheer luck, did we end up in the correct line.  We also had to wait in line for 1.5 hours at the front of our line before being let in after at least 100 girls.  Our ratio wasn't bad either, 3 guys, 3 girls, and hotel guests.

Just silly, but no stars lost:
The attendant at the pool wouldn't let us eat at the poolside cafe because we weren't dressed to use the pool!  He waited to ask permission to let us eat a pretty sad and tasteless lunch (aside from the fries) before allowing us access.

+1 star
The hotel admitted to their f ups, credited the bottle of Grey Goose and  drink mixers ($150) that we charged to our room and credited about $40 worth of drinks at the pool, but we had to do some convincing w\/ the manager; we were extremely polite as we hate people who cause a fuss for no reason.

Summary:  Aria better get their act together if they want to flourish like the rest of MGM's properties.  I don't think any of us will be staying there again, even with a similar weekend promotion.  Also, they need to lay off the Vanilla scent they pump through the air of the hotel, it's obnoxious on the senses.  I'd definitely recommend Haze if you can get in though.  Good luck!

Our room was not completely clean upon check in (fingerprints on the mirrors, used q-tip on the floor in the bathroom, something grimey on the closet doors) and was entirely too obtrusive. They moved some of our things from the bathroom counter into drawers in the bathroom. I understand needing to move stuff to clean but this wasn't it, and it's strange to have a complete stranger handle your tooth brush when there really isn't a need to do so. Creeped me out. All the restaurants are expensive (even for Vegas) and the pool is lackluster compared to other properties. Stay was Ok but probably won't be back.",0,0,0

We came out here for a bachelor party, with the bachelor and best man cooped up in one of their nicest suites - our first stop for pre gaming before we headed out.  The suite (and all rooms for that matter) are neatly  appointed with modern amenities, including split shower\/tub stalls, floor to ceiling windows, and complete Control4 automation.  If you so chose, you could wake up to curtains opening, TV powered on to CBS, and a variety of lighting settings to top it off.  EVERYTHING was connected\/automated and easy to use, whether you reached for the wall light switches or if you wanted to dig through the menus on the bed side touchpad.

While in Vegas, we dined at the on-premesis Jean Georges steakhouse, with our party seated at their private chef's table, but I'll save that excellent experience for another review.

We ran into a few hiccups here however - first, our room's carpets were wet (practically soaked) upon check in.  A call down to the desk revealed that they actually shampoo their rugs in-between reservations, but unfortunately, ours wasn't dry yet.  They changed our room and added another $50 credit to our room account.  In our new room, the safe and curtains did not work correctly.  While they fixed the safe, the curtains were never fixed.  Since they were motor-driven and automated, we had no way to manually open and close them ourselves, so it took several button and a few minutes to simply open\/close the blackout curtain.  Service was friendly throughout, but I guess sometimes all the technology comes with a few caveats.

Table games were $25 and up on Fridays and Saturdays, which is run-of-the-mill for a hotel of this caliber, so if you're looking for cheaper gambling, head elsewhere.  Overall, for the amenities, modern decor, and friendly staff, I'd recommend this hotel for anyone seeking good location and a classy hotel room for their Vegas vacation!",6,0,4

Being an avid player does have its perks, and it definitely paid off with my last visit to LV.  Stayed here comped for a few nights, with comped Elvis tickets too, on top of other freebies.

Location is prime, was very comfortable walking distance to everything we wanted to go to, and right next door to the Crystal shopping center, where I was lucky enough to be able to buy a few goodies.

We got really great service all around, from food to casino floor (including dealers, pit bosses & slot staff), valet and bell desk, housekeeping and MLife - they were all super friendly, super nice and super efficient.  One of the all around best services that I've gotten from a hotel.

The variety inside is good, casino paid out pretty well, table\/slot denominations were spread out, and variety of games was good.

Food was the only so-so thing, lines were long at some places, especially the cafe at late night, so that's half a star off for that.

Other half-star off is for the fact that our room seemed like the Daytona 500 of walks from the elevator.  Comp room considering, and a suite too, but it was just eons away.  Not convenient when you're drunk, or tipsy, or buzzed, or whatever you want to call it.

Oh, and I almost forgot.  Nifty rooms if your tech savvy.  ""Swipless"" entry doors, and fully remote-controlled room.  Definitely could imagine my parents having a nightmare in here, and wouldn't want to bring my nephew here to push all the buttons all night long, so just keep that in mind.

Resort fee covers everything from fitness center, wifi, free drinks, etc., so definitely a step up from other hotels (even other hotels in the MGM line)!",1,0,0

Pros:
Very Comfortable beds
Quiet Rooms
Sleek modern rooms and design
The rooms are great in every way. I like that you can easily hook up anything to your TV monitor - laptop, music, mobile devices, USB drives, etc.
Automatic curtain openers -- not really necessary but adds to the high-tech ambiance of the hotel.

Cons:
Like all the other mega resorts\/casinos it's a lot of walking to get to the restaurants etc.
The biggest con I had that will probably keep me from returning was the wait to check in. After traveling all day to reach the hotel I was greeted by a line as long as any you'd find at Disneyland only this one barely moved. I was exhausted and after about 20 minutes in line without moving forward asked a security guard how long the wait would be and he estimated 2 or more hours! Checked my bags with the bell hop and roamed the shops and strip for a couple hours. Returned now totally exhausted and found the line was still as long. Talking with the bell  hop I got the impression that this was common. If so, it is serious problem. Returned 2 hours later and the line was about half. Waited about 45 minutes to an hour and finally checked in. 

From that point forward the stay has been wonderful. I forgot a razor, house keeping had a free shaving kit to my room in minutes. 

Ate at Sage (excellent) and the Buffet (good). I recommend downloading the property map on line or getting a print copy at check in. For fast food take the bridge to Monte Carlo food court. Convenient and fast. Don't open the refrigerator, they warn that moving food around in there can bring on a $50 charge.

This would be 4 or 5 stars if not for the check in debacle. If that was just an aberration then this hotel would rank as one of the best in Vegas. Though they should at least have someone going through the line and explaining the situation and offering alternatives to standing in line - like waiting in the lounge, get an electronic beeper that beeps you from your Black Jack game when your up.",1,0,1

The boyfriend and I with some friends came to stay here for the weekend with a promo that they had since it was new so the prices that we paid weren't hurting us.  We made our reservations online about 2 weeks prior and entered their promo code for the deductions.  The drive up from the strip was gorgeous.  Being at around 10 ish in the evening, everything was lit up and the fountains were flowing.  The gentlemen at valet were awesome.  They were extremely friend and welcoming.  They opened all our doors, helped with unloading the trunk and getting us on our way to check in at the Front desk.  Ah, front desk, this is were it gets crappy! Everyone that works at the reception that handles check in are retarded idiots!  Checking in took well over 40 minutes.  I'm not talking about waiting in line, I'm talking about after handing them ID and CC took over 45 minutes.  They are sooo incredibly SLOW!  Finally, after getting our room keys and head up to our room, we noticed they gave the WRONG room.  We had requested NON-SMOKING 2 queen but instead they put us in SMOKING single king.  When I called front desk to have them clear the whole mix up, they told me that the rooms were all book and they were COMPLETELY FILLED.  The only thing they can do is to keep us in that room but have 2 rollaways be sent and of course charging us for the extra rollaways during the entire stay. WTF!!!  Not having it, I complained and was put on hold for over 30 minutes.  To my dismay of calling again, they realized it was the same person and instantly found me the room I had originally requested.  Hmm..they told me they were all full?!?!  Once getting into the right room now, all we had to do was call for the bell desk and they delivered our luggages.  Room service was great.  They were prompt and extremely friendly on the phone.  They came by twice each day to clean and tidy our rooms.  At night, they left us chocolates on our pillows.  

The correct room was very spacious for 4 people.  We were all comfortable and had plenty of room.  The decor was very urban and modern.  There were a lot tech savvy toys to play with.  They included the USB cables for iPhone users so you can play your own music or charge your phone.  You can pretty much customize your room to your own liking.  We set how dim\/bright we want the lighting upon return to the room or its temperature.  For an alarm, you can wake up to a set tv channel or music.  You can even have the window curtain open automatically too.

The casino floor was nice.  Very big and had a little bit of everything.  I was surprised the the limited wasn't as high as I had expected.  $10 minimum on  craps and $25 for poker paigow.

I was in LOVE with this place the moment I stepped in my room. I had a living\/tv room, a bar, a huuuge bathroom, a 1\/2 bathroom, and a spacious bedroom. Everything was very high tech, clean, and beautiful. Our view was KILLER! I think we had the skyscraper suite. The bathroom and the bedroom had the best view. I felt like I was in a Penthouse in New York. The settings and switches were pretty high tech and confusing at times but I loved it. The room service was incredible, from the maids to the in-dining experience. I ordered roasted chicken at 2 in the morning and they came to my door 10 minutes later. The lady came with a cute decorated table with my dish and two waters. She set it up in the bedroom and politely walked away. The food was definitely the best room service food I have ever ordered. We even had breakfast, It was so delicious and fresh. We ordered a breakfast for 9 people, it was me and my bf's family, and it arrived in 20 minutes. I also noticed that the maid's knocked at our door every 6 hours to clean the room. In order for them to leave your room alone you have to turn off the ""service"" button and press the ""privacy"" button. I guess the ""service"" button was on when we checked in. I also ordered some extra bath salt and the maid ran it up in 5 min. I timed it. The casino itself is very nice and new. The only thing I didn't like was the decor in the main casino room .

Does anyone remember coming to Las Vegas, 10 or so years ago and the most exciting hotel at the time was the Wynn? Ok, now take that up a notch by another 10. That is where Aria stands with being A W E S O M E.

I went to Vegas just earlier this month, and it was the first time I'd even stepped foot in the Aria. What on earth took me so long, I don't know but I was impressed. My opinion of the Aria is that this is how the rest of Vegas should be, nowadays at least. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan of the old-school quarter machines too, but this hotel is keeping up with the times. 

We're in 2014 people, and we're not getting any younger. It's a pricey hotel, I'll tell you that much, but if you had the cash to blow, I'd say that you would want to try it at least once in your life. And yes, the attention to detail with their interior design is what really blew me away. The choice of tile, the hanging chandeliers, the type of seating that was used, the attire of the staff, all the way down to the matching handles in the ladies restroom. It all screams - CLASS.

Now, my next goal is to try out that super swanky looking restaurant, SAGE. Yeah, definitely. Right after I save about 3 months worth of paychecks.",3,2,2

Just returned from my last trip where I had to tip to get an upgrade (and was well worth it - poolside 3rd floor to city view 37th).  However the room was for my bachelor party and was unable to get a bigger room even after tipping and paying for the most expensive night.  Luckily there was only 4 of us and we managed to make it work - thank goodness for 2 sinks in the bathroom!

I will say it is the little things that caused me to only give 3 stars.  No corkscrew opener for the wine, no ethernet cable provided for wired internet (although the wifi signal was actually strong enough unlike most hotels), the iron kept leaking and to take care of all this involved a front desk trip cuz all 3 of our room phones didnt work! We weren't even offered a change of room and they never fixed the problem.  They sure missed out on a ton of room service!

The casino was pretty good except the only doubledeck blackjack tables were $50 minimum at all times where most others are only $25 for doubledeck.  Best place to eat is cafe vetro before 11 pm to take advantage of the full menu (french dip hint hint)

The bathroom was great, huge soaking tub and shower all in one stall.  A great way to make a somewhat small  bathroom still seem luxurious.  
The one star ding was for dining options.  We sometimes opt for a lower grade hotel in Vegas because we have to go twice a year for business.

PERRRFFECCT amount of time in my opinion! 

I love the casino floor because it's clean and well maintained--granted the place is new, but so what? So far so good, because nothing beats NOT smelling like an ashtray by the time you're home.   Seriously, I got home and I sniffed my clothes... smelled delicious--like PINE SOL... haha.

The pool area is a decent size, separate pool areas and spa areas to suit everybody's needs.  They check room keys, but nowhere near as aggressively as Mandalay does.  Clean water, minimal kids... or should I say, minimal ROWDY kids... parents did a good job of looking after their little ones.  

The buffet is located on the Promenade level which is awesome because it's off the casino floor--you will forget that you're in a casino by the time you leave the buffet.  I didn't eat at the buffet because I was too busy drinking my alchy and being passed out under the bed of my room.

SPEAKING of ROOMS.  Aria has one of the nicest rooms I've ever been in.  Everything is controlled by a bedside touch screen remote.  My favorite feature is the SLEEP feature where you can literally turn everything off and close the curtains w\/ a touch of the button.  Wake up the next day to ultimate bliss.  The other cool open is the Service and Privacy lights outside the door are all controlled by buttons from within as well.

State of the art unfortunately will have it's dangers... at Aria it comes in the form of the MINI BAR in the room.  WATCH OUT! Everything is weight sensored! DO NOT remove items and place your personal items inside.

#1- It's lost that new car smell. The first time I stayed at Aria was just months after it opened, so everything was new, fresh and exciting. Seven years have taken some luster off the shine here. Scrapes on the walls, dingy floors, dirty restrooms, snagged carpet in my room. Nothing major that would keep me from staying here, just things I noticed that I would not expect from a place like this.

#2- The Check-In Process. I tried to take advantage of the Pre Check-in email offer they sent me, so I wouldn't have to stand in line when I arrived. When I got there around 6 p.m. (which is after Check-in anyway), I went to the express check-in and they had no record of my enrollment, so I had to go stand in line anyway. 15 minutes after I got to my room I received an email saying my pre-check-in was available.

#3- The Wheelchair Accessible room I had this time had some issues that I don't remember last time. The first issue was that the bed was like 8 feet off the the ground. Why is this a thing? Do able-bodied people enjoy having to leap into bed? On a positive note, when I complained they dealt with it fairly quickly. Joseph from maintenance was apologetic and efficient. The other issue was with the bathroom, specifically the shower. The bench was extremely small and placed on the narrowest wall of the enclosure with the controls directly behind the bench. this meant that in order to use them I either had to turn the water on before transferring onto the bench or lean halfway off the bench to reach them. For some odd reason, the enclosure also had a door that opened out, so there was no way to close the door. If I could have closed the door, I wouldn't have been able able to reach my wheelchair, so I had to leave the door open and angle my chair and the shower spray so my wheelchair didn't get wet. No one should have to think this much just to take a shower!

Even with these problems, I had a wonderful time at Aria. I love the location, amenities and the friendly helpful staff. In the future, I probably won't bother with the pre-check-in and the shower issues mean I'll take it off my solo Vegas trip list. I would just feel safer with Diane there to help.",3,0,1

1.  Room:  

- Corner suite felt incredibly small compared to the Venetian, Caesars, or even condo-converted units e.g. Trump.  ARIA's next level up from the Deluxe room is the Corner suite, a mere 920 sq. ft.  In comparison with the Wynn's Tower Suite (1,280 sq. ft.) or the Encore's Parlour Suite (2,000 sq. ft.), one would have to wonder why anyone with a similar budget would choose the ARIA.

- Deluxe room felt cramped, albeit modern.  ARIA's Deluxe room (even with an ""upgrade"" to city view) is 520 sq. ft.  Compared to a room at a hotel of equal price point on the Strip such as the Venetian (smallest room: 650 sq. ft) or the Encore (smallest room: 745 sq. ft), the ARIA's most basic room doesn't match up to the value of rooms at other 5-star hotels on the Strip. 

- Room design
Rooms at the ARIA certainly attract guests who prefer an ultra-modern style but the spatial design of the room is just horrendous.  Deluxe room fridge\/countertop faces the bed (as opposed to being closer to the closet near the door\/entryway), bathroom doesn't have a real door (it's a sliding door that slides into the wall),  toilet is divided by a glass door to the sink (not a real separate toilet room), and bathtub is right next to the shower so when you shower, the bathtub and the entire floor gets wet.  

Walkway could have been designed to feel more spacious by placing the headboard of the bed away from view (Deluxe room:  one could see the end of the bed from the door so it feels less private; in comparison to rooms at the Encore where the bed is only seen when you walk all the way into the room -- this can be fixed by simply rotating the position of the bed).  

Along with a lack of lights in the room and dim existing lighting placed in only areas above the bed and near the bar countertop, the room felt dark and depressing.  Poor lighting made it difficult to enjoy the modern design of the room.  

- Technology-enabled room does not work seamlessly
Indeed the ARIA's lighting control system is more sophisticated than that of the Encore, but why would one want to control every single light, sheet of curtain, door lock, iPod\/auxiliary, room service, clock\/alarm, phone, and billing information from the TV remote control?  The ARIA's in-room digital controls are redundant, frustrating, and lack insight into how to truly integrate technology into modern architecture.

-  ""5-star hotel"" with 3-star hotel amenities
    - Two light bulbs went out of order on the first night of my stay.  Shampoo and lotion bottles were of low-grade sulfate washing ingredients.  Towels were low-absorbency and a few were even stained \/ dirty.   Lack of coffee-maker device in the room (ridiculous for a 5-star rated hotel).  Fee for in-room bottled water (absurd considering that even 4-star hotels offer free bottles of water as a baseline, and let's not even discuss the non-working WIFI).  Bed -- extremely uncomfortable, mattress way too soft (back killer!), and I couldn't even sit on my bed without ""sinking in"" quicksand.  Lack of trash cans in the room required me to improvise and construct my own trash cans out of shopping bags.

2.  Service:  Satisfactory overall but room was not clean upon check-in.  Wine stains on the countertop, dust all over the desk and bedding, and dirty windows.

3.  Dining:   Lemongrass: way too salty, over-seasoned, service attentive.  ARIA Cafe:  wide-selection, absurd pricing (only reason I went - I had a voucher).  Jean Philippe Patisserie: good quiche, salads, gelato.  Nothing spectacular.

4.  Casino:   I'm a regular player at the Wynn\/Encore and Caesar's Entertainment hotels and haven't really made effort to increase status in M-Life.  During my stay, the casino didn't look like it had much action (players looked solemn\/bored, dealers looked miserable).  

The clientele: mostly (Indian, Chinese, Iranian) foreigners who have a lot of money to spend but didn't know how to play, drunk posers returning from Marquee, frat-boy types, and families with kids who chose the ARIA because they really didn't know any better (Excalibur is too old, Circus Circus is too ghetto, or MGM Grand no longer had the lion exhibit?  Who knows.).

5.  Concierge:  I had called the concierge to find out if I could arrange a casino rate and they transferred me to a booking agent who really wasn't able to answer my questions about what's offered on the casino floor.  

It may seem like my review of ARIA is entirely negative -- but it is not.  There are good reasons to stay here.  City Center is a great location in the middle of the Strip, the front desk personnel at ARIA met my needs as a guest, and the food wasn't horrible.  

Bottom line:   Not recommended for those who have experienced truly impeccable service and know 5-star quality accommodations.  Probably OK for first-timers, younger crowds 21-30, foodies, shopaholics, and non-serious gambler.",6,4,0

Got a room facing the Vdara, view was very nice and quiet as I could see the Palms, mountains, etc.

Room itself was great, two nice queen size beds, the bathroom is spectacular! Hotel was quiet (was there when the hotel was packed) and did not experience any of the noise issues that others mentioned.

Checking in - could be faster. There is no line, you just stand behind another person being checked in. Once it was my turn, the staff was super helpful, friendly and polite\/patient with all my questions.

Getting to your room - what a walk. You turn around and walk about 2-4mins through the Casino. Its not bad, trust me. I hate cigarette smoke and barely noticed any. BUT, what the heck is that Vanilla bathroom scent they are using? Please, anything else. Even my friends from other hotels on the strip HATED coming here because the smell at times was just too much, especially on the 2nd floor by the elevators.

Casino itself - great venue. Lots of people, younger crowd when I was there.

Celeb sightings - this was one trip I will not forget. One of the nights there, I did see Suge Knight (yes, that Suge) get into a fight..or scuffle with some other person. It was funny to see how SLOW security was. I would expect that they would have moved faster, especially so many were in the area.


Oh, elevator entry, this is a joke. Depending on the guard, you either show your key card to go up, or don't. Some will not let you pass. I left mine upstairs (mistake) and just came down to get a couple of items and had a HARD time going back up...lucky for me, another guard knew me from other days and I was on my way.

Aria is a good place to stay, its a little walk off the strip compared to Cosmo which is right now the road. Also, there is the tram (free) which is a short walk from the inside, so you can skip long walks to get to the Bellagio for the water show.",2,2,1

The resort is modern with proximity key cards for the room and fully electronic window shades! Even the lights, radio, and alarm can be controlled by the tablet next to the bed!

The room is very spacious and they've upgraded the lighting inside the room to ensure it's a tad brighter inside! Water pressure from the shower is excellent.

The biggest challenge seems to be the desert which made the experience an extremely dry one. Numerous requests for a room humidifier were merely noted... A tub full of water and a wet towel by the vents did help quite a bit!

However, when my husband got there, after a wait of almost one hour, he received his wallet back from a security man. (Yes, not at the front desk, or the concierge, but from the hand of a security guy). This security guy told my husband ""it doesn't look like there is that much money in your wallet"" and ""hey, something is better than nothing, right?"". By him saying that, we can't conclude that he took the money, but he obviously look through the wallet. There was no paper work filed or anything like an another 5 star hotel would do. And the manager wont do anything because he himself passed the wallet to the security guy ( very professional, right. Especially at a 5 STAR hotel). And they refused to let us speak to the guest to confirm how much money was inside. We cant do anything to find our money back. But we dont want this happen to anyone else.

True, that your a well decorated hotel. Art collection, rooms to die for, modern in all ways, fancy controls to open and close the curtains. Incredible location.
Oh how I wanted to love you.... To be held in your arms and whispered sweet things to. However, that was merely a Vegas illusion.

Sadly, I was there to witness the complete and utter meltdown of the front desk reservation system over 5 days (Side note, this also affected all MGM property's in Vegas.) While computers do go down, it's the service that should make up for the inconvenience. Sadly, for a property of Aira's caliber, the service was less than stellar. In fact, I've received better service at the HoJo in who knows were Iowa. 

Highlights include, being told that we didn't have a room after being checked in, receiving no less than 4 different rate quotes ($108, to $399) to add on an extra night, being told that ""we have no rooms left"" (After we already changed our outgoing flight to stay said extra night, that did exist just a few hours before) and a security guard who never did show up as promised to let us into our rooms (after we returned from seeing, Love (EXCELLENT show BTW) and found that our add on night reservation had ""Vanished"" from there now running computer system and we were locked out of our hotel room (We were told we'd have to pay a higher rate just to get back into our room and they would ""adjust it in the morning"" ) 

(Side note, had we called security for a more pressing situation, would they have shown up then?)

After explaining our room rate quest, many times over. Seeing many many MANY reports from others who had waited 8 plus hours to check in, or had folks walking into rooms that were occupied already. We left. Upon checkout, after once again going over the rates and bill, I had to haggle to get it lowered and the front desk girl while nice, still seemed uninterested in the problems we had had. Had I wanted to miss my flight out, I would have stayed and addressed this further, as it is I will be following up with a letter to the hotel GM and the BBB.

This conversation, as we were leaving the hotel's taxi stand between a Taxi driver and the hotel porter sums things up perfectly... Taxi Driver: ""How's it going this morning"": Aria Porter: ""Horrible, I haven't made a tip all morning!""

I didn't tip the guy either!",5,4,4

The room I had--16235--was not clean. It looked clean at first glance, but upon further inspection, was pretty gross. The bathroom toilet closet wall had a few small specs of what looked like blood, there was a large hairspray bottle cap left in the bathroom from a prior guest which means the bathroom was not really cleaned from the prior guest and was left there my entire stay. A piece of the light switch in the bathroom broke off just from me pressing it to shut the light. The gold comforter (which I know most hotels don't really clean) had white and\/or some kind of speckled stains on it. (I do not even want to think about what it could be!) I was so uncomfortable in that room. It just felt disgusting. I felt like I was staying in a glorified motel room. The only plus is they let me check in early which is one of the reasons I didn't bother complaining. 

The main reason I stayed at aria was for the convenience, which I liked. I also liked the technology in the room--everything was electrically powered through an iPad-like device. However the hotel room itself was outdated and not really clean. I know most hotel rooms aren't really that clean but when there are blatant deviations from cleanliness and it's in my face, its hard to overlook. Also, the hallways smelled like weed the entire length of my stay and the pool felt like a wading pool--way too small and overcrowded.",0,1,0

Everyday we came back to our room and we had new towels even though we hung them up, as well as all the toiletries being replaced with new ones after we had only used them once.  It frustrated me that they generated so much waste when it was unneeded especially when they give you an option on ways to save waste.  They also removed items from our room before we were done using them.

Toilet seat; broken. Lift it and it swings to the side.

Door to the toilet; broken- hits glass on glass instead of closing. Makes a huge bang and is a total hazard. Someone is going to slam it and it is going to shatter.

Lightswitch in the bathroom; cracked. Not even sure how you can break that. Such an easy fix,  that was just lazy Aria!

Bathroom scale; broken. Why even have it there if it doesn't work?

I took a bath and noticed mildew around the seal\/caulk around the tub; that's just gross!

I thought about asking for a new room but we had so much planned for the weekend and we checked in at 11pm. They gave us room 5019 which is THE longest hike from the elevator- like no joke. 

The carpet on the fifth floor is held together at the seams that are coming apart with black electrical tape; c'mon guys how cheap are you!

The pool was closed due to high winds, understandably unsafe- but nobody ever offered anything or a break on the resort fee for the day.. and our whole day was planned around pool lounging before our flight left that night. Our gambling budget was already spent and we had to kill four hours walking around. Such a bummer.

I politely asked a card dealer who had no patrons where the Aria tram was located and I asked if it was on the second level- she nodded. We went to the second level only to take the escalator back downstairs. Thanks...

There is a Starbucks located in the promenade area with other shops and food- but expect the line to be 25+ people deep in the morning.

Positives: the hotel is big and modern looking, right near the strip, has a yummy bakery Jean Philippe Patsserie.
Negatives: First off, the rooms were really dirty-sheets were not clean, our blankets had black marks on them, the towels had rust stains on them. The bed was really soft and the pillows were high and uncomfortable.
The service was horrible-the staff told us different check out times-one person told us checkout was at 11 and another said it was noon. Then on our last day, the cleaning staff knocked on the door and almost came in at 10 am because they thought we checked out while we were still sleeping. There was no coffee maker or complimentary, coffee tea, or water. They charged us $4 for us to have hot water and it took over half an hour for them to get it to us. They also charge each person a $25 service fee that's not included in the hotel fee.
One night we went out and came home at 5 am and our keys did not work, we had to walk all the way back to the hotel lobby and they told us that their system is down and that's why the keys are not working and made us wait for someone to open our room but we waited for 10 minutes and the guy never came. 
The worst part was after we came back from shopping, one of my girlfriend's lost her bag. The cleaning staff had come in to clean the room and they threw out her bag which had her clothes and accessories in it! We had to file a report with security for her missing bag.

The pools are nice, the casino is standard vegas.

The casino isn't bad, I found the dealers to be nicer than a lot in Vegas.  They have some good food options (Not the CAFE ARIA, stay away), good lounges, play current, upbeat music, and a generally awesome ambiance. 

 The reason they lost a star is the check in line.  Checking in on a Wednesday, not near a holiday or special event that I am aware of, there was a 30-50 minute line to check in, depending on who in are group you were and what specific time you showed up.  That to me is an issue.  You fly in, or drive in, want to shower, or pee, are hungry, want a drink, whatever, and you find out that you are sitting around lugging your suitcase for another while.

It's impressive when a hotel of this size can maintain a 5 diamond rating.
The rooms are tastefully decorated with everything automated.  Temp, drapes, TV, all can be handles through the tablet next to the bed or through the television.  Completely automated!
TIP - grab a taxi on the back side (north valet).  Much quicker and easier and puts you away from the strip for quicker trips.
Only complaint here is the frosted glass toilet walls and doors.  I have been to 3 hotels since January that have frosted glass enclosed toilets.  I don't understand this trend in hotels and I'm sure I'm not alone in hating it.
Why even separate the toilet if you're going to have to close the whole bathroom door for any privacy.
I'm sorry - but after 15 years, I still don't do certain things in front of my spouse.
OK - 1 other complaint.  They need an organized line for the check in\/check out area.

Let's start with the fact that they charge an arm and a leg for parking but they put the parking ticket entrances on a slant while you're going up, so when the car is stopped there is a higher chance of cars accidentally hitting other cars behind them while trying to grab a ticket. I mean whoever thought that was a good idea was either drunk or incompetent. But all that pales in comparison to what I had to endure a few days ago while getting out of the parking garage. 

I was literally stuck in that parking garage trying to get out for over an hour, after paying for my ticket. I have no idea why there was such a line or why there was a huge delay. More and more cars were coming adding to the huge backlog of cars. I felt really bad for the person behind me who had to catch a flight and he couldn't get out. I'm pretty sure he missed his flight and I'm pretty sure Aria didn't pay for him for causing all the delays on his time. And yes I had time to get out of my car and actually talk to people stuck in that line. 

Seriously avoid this casino at all costs. When it first opened the place was amazing but they nickel and dime you and then on top of that they purposely cause delays to force you to stay in that hotel. Maybe the treat hotel guests or conference guests differently but for visitors just going there to have a meal or walk around they treat you like garbage. I shouldn't have to pay to go to a place looking for a fun time and good food and experience a crapfest and forced to be stuck there. If you can't efficiently clear out cars out of parking garage in a timely manner then you shouldn't be charging an arm and a leg for parking.",0,0,0

And the great part about traveling to Vegas on weekdays for business is that you can find some pretty reasonable deals here, despite its top of the line furnishings! 

My favorite part was the elaborate turndown service they provide - they make the lighting sexy and turn on some soothing music, and even leave two packs of delicious chocolates on each nightstand. It made me want to jump right into bed when I entered my room that evening! 

I also love (and hate) that the Jean Philippe store is just downstairs. It's the perfect souvenir to bring home to friends (or to eat by yourself on the flight back)!

Then why only four stars? Well, I guess what I felt was a lack of FUN. When I come to Vegas I expect fun, whether it be edgy decor or exciting restaurants. The Aria felt extremely huge and pretty sterile. I think next time for similar prices I'd prefer to go back to the Cosmo, which seems to have whimsical touches wherever you turn.

We had the AC set on 68 degrees and still seemed warm.  They key is to keep the blackout curtains shut for the majority of the time...if not, it just gets too warm in there.  

As for the casino and restaurants.  Always enjoyable, even more so when you come home with more $$$ than you left with!  Here's tip though.  The Starbucks there is CRAZY busy, and they charge for a cup of water (yes, even with a coffee.)  On the back side of the casino near the Zarkana ticket office is a pastry and coffee bar.  There was never a line at it...ever.

Dealers are friendly, but the minimum on most craps tables was $15.  That's ok though, because Aria is where we won the most...And if you like craps, try out the Craps video game towards the back, just past the high limit lounge...We won several hundred on it each in one sitting.

Reservations were made well in advance.  The room ###### was just a few steps away from the ice machine which was broken or not in service for the two nights we stayed. I mentioned to two housekeepers that the ice machine was broken and to please report it and also to a bell person.  The room looked as if it hadn't been dusted in a couple of weeks.  The windows were covered with dust and coated there from a previous rain.  

Our room overlooked the pool of a sister hotel that we found out was closed. I had brought my swim suit as I was hoping it would be absolutely beautiful outside while we were there.  But...I'm sorry the hotel pools are not open yet.  So my son spoke with Megan, Concierge Manager and she told him he could go over to the Bellagio to swim, no problem.  Well it took 35 minutes to walk there with the worst directions and two maps given to us by the Concierge at Aria to find the Bellagio.  By the time we walked into the pool area and settled down an announcement was given that their pool would close in 15 minutes!   Thank you, Megan!
Well the next morning I wanted to let my son sleep in so I went down to their cafe and was seated.  I waited in a near empty cafe and waited...looked around...waited...wasn't even offered coffee and I walked out.  I mean come on!  So I decided to try and find something else.  
When I approached an escalator one of a group of men surrounding it told me I'd need to walk around because the escalator was closed due to glass breakage.  Well I was upset by then thinking that there was no one who even cared about our experience at the Aria...but a young man saw that I was upset and walked me over to an elevator and took me up to the Buffet area.  I did appreciate it so much.  He told cashier that I'd had a bad experience and to take good care of me.  But before being seated I was informed that the Buffet was $29.95 and needed to pay before being seated. Well, I truly wouldn't pay $29.95 for breakfast!!!!!!!  So I thanked the cashiers but I told them I just wouldn't pay that much for breakfast.  So I went downstairs and purchased some coffee and went back up to our room and decided to just give in and go home.  Aria doesn't want my business.

Yeah the curtains are remote controlled, but the fancy stuff stops there. The room was a lot smaller than the ones @ the Wynn, and the bathroom didn't have that wow factor. No tv in bathroom, super scratchy towels, stinky shower with bathtub in it, and the very new bed had a big dent (aka hole) on hubby's side of the bed.  We should have complained, but hubby said no point moving rooms since just walking to the room from the lobby is a feat since this place is so huge. I believe there are over 300 rooms on each floor and the walk to the elevator is looooong.  We parked in self-park and followed the bad signs which just meant meandering through the casino for eons before we found the lobby for check in. Check in was easy and smooth, but by the time we got to our room it was 1 1\/2 hour after we landed @ LAS!  Be prepared! 

The decor and ambience was new, but blah and looked like any other generic hotel you see these days. There was no Vegas vibe at all, and it lacked any character.  Checkout was easy, though, as you can just leave the keys in your room, at 11am.

Been drinking in their bar for days, afternoon and all night. Wake up 3rd morning go down the elevator to have a smoke like usual and this morning security asked for my id. Keep in mind I'm pushing 50 soon. Me and the wife thought it was cute the guy asked but they were serious. I asked for the manager as I have been drinking Day and night in this bar and nobody carded me to order a drink but the second I don't order a drink and just want to sit in a chair I need id? Was strange to me so I asked for a manager.

Joe Carrington came over I tried to explain I been drinking for days at that same bar and never id asked and all we wanted was to sit in a chair and smoke as it was very early. Aria explained at this time this morning it was mandatory if I wanted to be in a casino I needed my id to be there? So was I to leave the property because I left my id in my room at 7am to get a coffee and have a smoke? 

I again asked so I shouldn't gamble or be standing in a casino due to not having any id at 7am? He said yes I shouldn't be in the casino without my id on my person? 

I think that's going way too far with a customer who clearly looks of age and have been drinking in same bar for days with never an issue. Shoot I play tables and slots and get drinks at every casino this trip every other trip and never carded. 

I think the hotel is gorgeous just like many others on the strip so I will now start choosing other hotels in the future and I will advise all my friends to stay away from this hotel as the security there picks and chooses when to enforce the rules Joe Carrington decided to enforce. 

In the end you cannot argue with security if they choose to pick on you for no reason put your tail between your legs and do what they say. No scene was caused because I let it go but my words and recommendations to all my friends who come to Vegas will be to avoid this hotel. 

Thank you Joe Carrington for showing me the light with Arias customer service, common sense and unwillingness to make a customer happy. 

I'm very disappointed in Aria and will forever make it known! If I was not leaving back to Florida tomorrow I would change hotels but we already been in a suite and corner king our entire trip with one more night left. 

Our friends staying that came out on vacation with us cannot believe what happened and will also not come back to this hotel. As like I stated so Many beautiful hotels on the strip to choose from. 

Aria you cannot pick and choose when to uphold your rules and regulations. Either you uphold those rules at all times or do not. That's good business to practice and teach your employees. Consistency in what you expect from guests! 

I'm glad Aria showed me how they operate this trip before I booked my next trip back. Actually was thinking of booking here already for next trip.

Like any other hotel on the strip, the architecture catches the eye and lures you in. Our arrival went without a hitch. Valet parking, friendly\/helpful employees and fast check in. The place has a nice little set up. 

Had a one bedroom suite on the 20th floor. First off, walking in our window was facing the strip with an amazing view. Once you calm down from the whole ""Vegas, Baby!!! Vegas!!"" high, then you begin to enjoy the finer details of the room. 

-Living room was a decent size. Nice size flat screen, comfy couch. You get the techie control that allows you manage almost anything in the room from the living room couch. With this you can, order room service, check. Open and close the blinds, check. Control the lighting, check. Hook up the ipod to get the music going, check. Among other things. Good touch. I felt spoiled already. 

-Bedroom was huge. Nothing much to it. Comfy bed, flat screen TV and a great view of the hotel. That's all i need. 

-Bathroom was amazing. hot tub, shower, walk in closet, toilet, couch, two counters, 3 mirrors, on and on and on. Truly makes you feel like a king. The best part was the toilet. It had this little option that shoots water at your *front* or *back* after you are done handling your business. Talk about high tech.

-Casino was cool, didn't spend much time there. But the black jack dealers were cool and super friendly. 

-Staff was great. Helpful and courteous. No complaints. 

-Over all layout was nice. Pool was cool. 

Overall, it was a good experience. Would definitely go back. I would rate a few of the restaurants at the location, except I can't remember. Lets just say Vegas was a great time with many ""experiences"" that only Vegas can give you.  Great hotel, good time.",0,0,0

For all my Vegas trips, I pretty much get a rental car, arrive at the hotel, valet the car, and I only see the car when I am checking out to head home. Why worry about drinking when you can walk or just take a cab? This way I don't have to worry about getting back to the hotel... well, at least getting the car back to the hotel.... I can't say the same for myself even if I take a cab. =)

The rooms are quite nice. Definitely in the top 2 or 3 in Vegas. The rooms are clean, the bed is soft, and housekeeping is awesome! The restaurants at the hotel are top notch (Julian Serrano is my favorite here), Liquid is great, and room service is prompt and on time.

On the last day of my stay, valet grabbed the car and unfortunately, I didn't noticed the rear passenger door had a huge scratch along the entire side of the door until refueling half way back home. Had this been my car... I would have pissed beyond belief. I am one of those people that park my car way the F out there because there are a lot of drivers who cant park right or just don't care when they open their car doors.  Fortunately, I always get the insurance on the car and Enterprise took it back with no questions asked (this really should be a review for them). Trip saved!

5 star for the hotel and 1 star for Valet being horrible. Negative stars if they knew the car was damaged and didn't say anything. Split the difference and you get 3 stars. I don't mind loosing cash gambling, eating at expensive restaurants, or dropping cash on the pool parties... but the line stops when you have to drop cash to fix your car because you used valet. 3 stars might even be too generous.",5,1,2

It was between the Bellagio and Aria; pon a friend's (who had just stayed days prior) recommendation chose Aria. It was only a $10 difference.

Words that come to mind when thinking of Aria:
Sleek. Modern. Technology. Comfort. Excellent Service. Tasty food. 

THE ROOM
Walking into the room, all I could do was smile. This was totally how I'd love to have my own room at home decorated in shades of brown and blue with clean lines.  I can only imagine what an actual suite here would look like if our ""normal"" room was hitting the mark.  


THE BED
Comfy!!! Best pillows ever. Not too firm, not too squishy and no annoying down feathers poking out! 

TECHNOLOGY
love. love. love how technologically advanced the room was. The room is controlled via remote\/tv or with the lcd screen by the bed.  The home screen provides SO many options for lighting (refreshed, turn down, etc) and for the curtains.  Manage the curtains\/sheers with the ease of a few buttons from the comfort of, well - wherever in the room you are. AWESOME. Don't wanna fuss with a bunch of buttons? Just press turn all off and all the lights and curtains shut off\/close simultaneously.  

Long are the days of awkwardly placing a Privacy sign out on the door too.  Now, you simply select the Privacy button on the screen (or Service if you need service: no, not THAT kind) and voile - the thin LCD screen outside your door illuminates in red with PRIVACY or in green with SERVICE. 

At the desk, there's ports for nearly everything; your iPod\/iPhone, computer, and USBs galore.  Right there in between the overpriced snacks is a box complete with every charging cord you could possibly want in case you forgot yours.  

I will say this - AT&T service is spotty here at best. I mean, no internet service, no 3G - nothing. For $15 you can, after verifying your room number and name, register for internet access. Yes, I did this and was satisfied once I had my electronic leash back in tact. ;)

SERVICE
Everyone spoke perfect English. Call me old fashioned- but speaking English is a big deal to me. 

The guy who came up to deliver our room service, who upon appearance you might assume wouldn't - totally did. AND he rocked at a quick set up of a table and arranging food, along with describing everything brought up - including a few extra items - as though my requests were anticipated! 

On another occasion, walking back to our room - one of the service ladies (who was just outside another room) asked us how we were doing and if there was anything they could do to improve our stay, to just let them know. SO nice AND so genuine.

The people in line before us were trying be up sold on a bed frame. I kid you not. So after we get through and go up on to the room and there were two dirty glasses by the door. So no big deal until 72 hrs later and they were still there. So being the true Bostonian that I am, I moved them to the middle of the hallway so they would trip over them and take them away. 8 hours later they were gone. I guess the main thing about Aria was there was not much going on in the hotel itself. I have stayed at Cesar's on previous trips and just the liveliness there is second to none. I know it seems kind of picky but they state themselves as a five star hotel and just did see it. One major gripe was when you go into most hotels there is a newsstand right near front of the hotel. I could not find one in Aria nor was I informed where such a store would be located. After complaining to a cab driver he told me that it was in the back of the Aria Men's store. Really.. So I found it and much better then walking the 20 mins to CVS for a water or anything else I mat have forgotten.",1,1,0

It was all very new and nice and I am not sure what they could have done to be aweinspiring but other than the sheer size, I didn't think it was awe-inspiring.  

A big drawback is that it is dark everywhere and so even though it is new and nice it feels dark and gloomy and almost dirty in some places ont eh main floor because of the darkness.

The service wasn't great.  We tried to call the front desk one morning for something at around 7am and there was no answer.  We waited a few minutes and tried again and still no answer.  No message saying they were busy just a couple minutes of letting the phone ring with no answer.  I am not sure how they could have good service with so many rooms but maybe it should be easier with so many rooms because they would have an effiency of scale.  Who knows?

The rooms are really nice and well done.  The technology is impressive in each room but also a little clumsy to use and we found ourselves going back to the regular light switch, regular TV remote and regular AC thing on the wall instead of trying to use their all in one box.

There were also  used Tampons in the trash basket in the bathroom.   There was a used soap bar in the shower and the drinking glasses in the bathroom were dirty.

Complained to Housekeeping and 1.5 hours passed.  I called again and no one came.  I called the concierge and she gave me a $50 credit and moved me to 19036 which supposedly had a better view.  Unfortunately, the intense colored light display on the Las Vegas Blvd side of the Aria reflected onto the white ceiling all night and made it hard to sleep (it was so bright, it penetrated my closed eyelids).   However, I did win at the slots and am not complaining at $108 per night.

The art and the decor were delightful.  The walking art tour was okay, but the pamphlet should have had photos of the art because sometimes they were hard to find.

Parking was strangely roomy - really weird.  Many if not most of the spaces had a huge stand-off distance from the adjoining spaces.

Also, we felt secure within the casino and hotel.  Security guards were posted at each elevator access.

Housekeeping wasn't all bad though.  They were well-trained in courtesy.  Whenever you past them in the hallway, they acknowledged you and went  out of their way to say hi.

One thing though.  I think these problems with Housekeeping may be an indication of deeper mgt problems...which would make me think twice if I were to buy a condo-hotel unit at the Vdara.",0,0,0

This hotel has some serious pros and cons. It's huge, everything about it huge. The casino, the restaurants, the whole complex. But being all the way in the back of City Center really removes you from the action on the Strip. As cool as City Center may be, nothing replaces the Strip. You can walk to the Crystals mall, which is more an empty space than anything right now, and catch the tram to the Monte Carlo or Bellagio, but that still isn't getting you very far. 

The Sportsbook is one of the highlights of this hotel, possibly my new favorite sportsbook, with a great unique setup and some of the best quality and highest quantity of flatscreens. Tons of couches and room to spread out to pick which TVs you want to focus on. 

There are a ton of dining options, but expect to drop a good amount of cash wherever you end up eating. 

You can find some pretty cheaper minimums at the tables during the off hours. I found $5 roulette on Sunday morning.

The standard rooms are very nice, sexy, and high tech. Everything is operated by a touch screen control and the flat screen seems to be around 40 inches. 

I can't complain, the Aria really has everything, but the problem with that is you don't feel the need to leave, which takes away from the Vegas experience of hopping from one casino to the next. I probably won't stay here again, but it will be interesting to see how it fits in once City Center is fully completed.",5,1,1

The room: The standard room is much much smaller than the standard 'room' at Palazzo so it was kinda O__o for me after being used to Palazzo for the first few days at Vegas, but I got used to it. What they make up for space is the crazy tech stuff that is their....remote\/alarm clock\/pad\/thing which can turn off the lights, turn on the TV, close the curtains, set the alarm clock, get room service, and all that jazz. The bathroom is pretty small, especially the sink area. There are two sinks, but the area not occupied by the sinks themselves is very small and there isn't a vanity table in the bathroom so I have to put my makeup on top of the drawers by the TV. Despite the small inconvenience, the bathroom has its perks. The layout of the shower and tub is very neat and the shower has a seating area which is nice. The tub is deep so you can easily soak in and enjoy yourself without worrying about spilling water since the tub is right beside the shower in the shower\/tub area.
The bed is really comfy and there are a lot of pillows and they're pretty soft and comfortable. Overall the room is small, but not bad.

The casino: Pretty big with a ton of different stuff to offer for everyone. Most of the minimums I've seen are about $25, sometimes $15, so not too too bad.

Location: Great location, close to The Cosmopolitan, Planet Hollywood, with tram rides to Monte Carlo and Bellagio, so you've got your options if you don't want to hang out at Aria the whole time, but don't want to walk too far or pay for the cab. Planet Hollywood has the Miracle Mile Shops that have the more lower-end stuff and there's the Crystals beside Aria for LV, Gucci, and all that, so you're good with all kinds of shopping.

Parking: Multiple levels of parking, make SURE YOU READ THE SIGNS on your way to the parking lot. There are different signs with different directions depending on where you're heading so be careful! The parking lot for Aria has multi-levels, but you have to walk a bit to get to the entrance even if you parked on the same floor and near the entrance area. At least it's free?

Overall, it's a pretty good place. After staying at both Palazzo and Aria, they have their ups and downs, but they're both really good in their own ways and neither is better than the other, so it comes down to personal taste.",3,0,0

I cry a little time everytime I see the Aria come up on my schedule. The hotel is pretty nice, they don't play muzak on the soundsystem (although I hope you like the same songs being on a 24 hour rotation... Melissa Etheridge is guaranteed at 4:55 pm everyday), and the casino and conference center are condensed\/easy to function spaces. The rooms are ok, but like the W hotels...sometimes are too trendy for comfort. I like how the room turns on when you walk in, but it can be a pain in the ass when you want to just turn off your lamp and instead the whole room turns off and puts you to bed. Hope you don't get a room over the Metropolitan pool unless you plan on being down on the party deck, since it can get pretty loud most nights. The connection to City Center is nice because you can get to more restaurants and coffee shops than many other Vegas hotels. 

I used the spa when I was here last, spent almost $180 on a massage, but at least my back wasn't in excruciating pain when I left. Aria does have THE most comfortable beds I have ever sleep on, but beware if you have back or neck problems (like I do). The first night, it's always a dream. The second night, I woke up every 20 minutes in near tears because it was so soft it provided no back support. Nights 3-8 I slept on the floor. Lucky for me, they also have amazing comforters so I just made myself a little pallet on the floor and curled up. Just an FYI tho, if you have back issues (you don't want to be paying $200 for that previously unnecessary massage). 

But the conference staff...holy HELL. You'd think they'd never run a big meeting in their existence, which is crap because I stay there enough to know they do. Every single time, though, you'd think it was their first time at the rodeo. Working in meeting planning, you come to have certain standards for conference hotels, and the Aria is notorious with my co-workers as having painfully subpar conference service.

The bad: perhaps because it's still new, nobody seems to know where anything is.  It's either that or they must have a high turnover in staff.  If I ask for directions and that person just points and says ""It's back that way"", that person just doesn't know.  I also find the ""high concept"" design and attitude somewhat jarring.  It really sets itself apart from all the other hotel\/casinos on the Strip.  Other than that, it's an OK place.",0,0,0

The hotel is beautiful and, after staying at several of the older hotels on the Strip on past visits, I really appreciated staying at a newer hotel where everything looks sleek and modern. And it's quite hi-tech too! As soon as we walked into the room, the blinds automatically opened, the lights turned on and the TV welcomed us with some relaxing music. 

We stayed in a king room and the bed was so comfortable and luxurious that we didn't want to return to our old queen bed at home. There were plenty of pillows, which I loved, as it added to the cozy feel. I'm obsessed with the automatic blackout blinds and want my future bedroom's window blinds to open and close with the press of a button. My only small complaint about them is that they're not flush with the wall so some light did slip through. If you're a sleeper who is sensitive to light, like me, you may want to bring a sleep mask or plan on burrowing under the blankets when dawn arrives. 

The bathroom was probably one of the nicest bathrooms that I've seen at a hotel. The bathtub in the shower stall was an interesting design but worked out well. I managed to take two baths during my stay and the deep tub was super relaxing and a great way to soak your sore muscles after walking around Vegas. It was also nice that the toilet has it's own door from the rest of the bathroom although a little odd that it's frosted glass so you can still see the outline of the person. I was staying with my boyfriend so it wasn't a big deal but it may be strange with a friend.

I wish Vegas hotels provided a mini fridge in the room. We had beers and ciders to chill and I ended up dumping a bucket of ice in the bathroom sink instead. It worked but it also would have been nice to have a spot to store leftovers and snacks. 

Everyone was really nice and the maids and maintenance workers greeted us each time we passed them in the hallway. We should have taken advantage of the Do Not Disturb button because we were ""disturbed"" around 10 AM both mornings. First by someone who said they were there to pick up our room service tray (we didn't order room service) and second by a maid asking what time we were going to check out. Seeing as we didn't use the Do Not Disturb sign, I'm not going to hold this against them though.

The central location of the Aria is great and we were able to easily walk to Caesar's Palace and Planet Hollywood. The restaurants at Aria are a bit pricey but you can find cheaper options at the Miracle Mile, which is only a ten minute or so walk away. 

Overall, it's a great hotel and definitely one that I'll be keeping in mind for future Vegas visits.",11,0,6

I checked in online as they offered, Aria put a hold on all four nights room charge and extra for minibar usage, and and then when I got to the hotel at the front desk to get my room key they charged me again. So now Aria has $2,700.00. That left me with enough to pay for the rental car. After going to the front desk, and got no where there, I made a call to the manager on duty, and they said nothing they could do until I checked out. All that money they take in? 

So my spending money was gone (food, car rental, a Romaric dinner, gambling, a couple of shows) NOTHING NOW! and they offered me ONE measly $50.00 meal voucher, FOR 3 NIGHT? So there went the nice Christmas present for my girl. 

Fast forward 2 months February 17th, and I am charged $1,358.53 again! No call, not present with the card. I immediate call and am left on hold for 45 minutes, to be given some lame ass excuse about there new credit card system, and excuse after excuse. No apologies, no special offers not DAMN THING! Now I have 9 overdraft charges in my account because I am now in the hole, and again no money until the end of the week. ""AGAIN""!!!!! Screwed by ARIA

This hotel has a lot of good points but also a lot of bad points.  If you are willing to overlook the complaints that people have posted about the airport-like architecture and service glitches - you will definitely enjoy your stay.  This place has a lot of potential, they just need to listen to their guests feedback and improve.

Pros:
Pillows, Linens and Beds: absolutely decadent and comfortable.
Staff: Everyone was very pleasant and enthusiastic about their job.  Everyone I dealt with at check-in, bell desk, players club, concierge and housekeeping was cheerful and accommodating.
Room:  A beautiful room and bathroom setup.  The minibar offered a lot of unexpected conveniences, although overpriced.
Technology: This can be a pro or con depending upon your level of comfort with gadgets.  I thought the touchscreen was very easy to use and it was nice to be able to control the room privacy, curtains, and lights from bed.
Restaurants and Shopping: The Crystals shopping center is directly attached to the hotel.  The selection and quality of the restaurants at the hotel is astounding.
NO RESORT FEE: The price they advertised was the price they charged.  Resort fees are ridiculous and Aria does not charge them.

Cons:
Valet\/Taxi Pickup:  You have to walk a full block to get to the valet pickup and taxi service.  There is so much empty space in between the front of the hotel and where you pick up your car where they could have conveniently placed the pickup or at least a scanner where you could scan your ticket on your way towards the valet.  The weather in Vegas is very uncomfortable 75 percent of the time - why they would subject their guests to this trek is beyond me.
Check-In\/Concierge lines: There is no central line for everyone to wait in.  There are just several little lines like at the supermarket and you can wait a very long time if you happen to be unlucky behind another guest who is being served for a long time.  I could see that this frustrated people and I hope they change this.
Hold time while contacting the front desk:  You can wait on the phone to speak to the front desk for 5-10 minutes.  This is unacceptable.
Casino drink service: You will not get a complimentary drink while sitting at the slot machines unless you jump up and down and flag down a cocktail waitress.  Even then, they might just walk by you.
Sound Insulation: These rooms are not very well sound-proofed between the hallway and the room next door.  You might want to bring earplugs.  Also, you can hear *everything* that happens in your own bathroom.
Bedroom Lighting: The room was very dark - if you like to read in bed you should bring a booklight.
Power Outlets: There were no power outlets that were reachable by the bed.  The lamps were plugged in behind the headboard.  If you need to plug something in bring an extension cord.

This is a great hotel, but there are some missteps that could improve overtime.  I had a great time during my stay even though some things were frustrating.  But I would still go back.",2,0,1

Requested a late check out at the time of reservation. Once arrived I was told by the front desk that the room was not available but they were happy to upgrade my room to a suite at 100.00 extra charge. Since my original payment for this reservation was a non refundable purchase I had no choice but to accept the offer. 
They charge 25.00 a day for valet parking that will recharge again at 11.00 PM. So if you arrive at 3.00 pm and check out at 11.00 Am the next morning you will be charged 50.00 not including the tip!!!
The WiFi was terrible and would not connect. After a few times of calling the front desk I gave up on having it fixed since each time the hold was more than 20 minuets. 
I have had much better beds to sleep in before this Aria deal. My own bed is more comfortable than what they are providing for their guests. 
The water pressure was so so slow with no pressure that taking a shower would take a lot longer than planned. There is no Netflix or amazon or anything like it. 
You would think if they are charging 750.00 a night at a regular price they would at least provide some kind of in suit entertainment. I called and asked again for one hour extra before checking out since taking a shower was delaying our departure and was denied of it by a very rude concierge.

The casino space has a dark ambiance around it. The light opens up when you head towards any entrance to the hotel\/casino though. I thought it was alright. Their hotel store is huge. If you can't find something in there, you're not looking hard enough. What gets you is the immense size of the project though. The hotels, casinos, resort hotels, condos, shopping mall, tram, and parking structures all pretty much went up at once. That's Vegas for you. Overnight sensations. It's really impressive.

The Good.... 
When I first arrived I fell in love with the place. The employees were super nice (AT FIRST) and were constantly greeting you. The casino area actually smelled good, there was a scent all over the lobby and casino area.....huge plus for me....We came in groups and had reserved two rooms. We requested connecting rooms but it was not available at the time of check in and since it was not requested ahead of time it was no big deal. However, they did agree to reserve a room on the same floor as mine so that when my cousin and friends arrived her room would be ready to go. I really liked the decor and ambiance of the place overall. The rooms were very clean and put together. I really do have to say that I liked the all in one remote that controlled everything in the room. The pool area is amazing and huge with several pools to hang out at. Before I get to the BAD I would like to mention that the Cafe Vettro at Aria was amazing (even for a very picky person as myself). We ate there a couple times and will definitely be back for more. 

The Bad.... 
Once our second group arrived a couple hours later they were advised that there were no rooms reserved on the 19th floor (same floor as mine) and the only thing available was a king size bed on the 15th floor and two queen beds-smoking on the 11th floor. Before our second group arrived we were guaranteed the second room on the same floor and even received confirmation from their manager. After listening to lame explanations from the front desk and their worthless supervisor we took the room on the 11th floor room since the room on the 15th floor was king bed only. We definitely did not want a smoking room since I can not stand the smell but we had no other choice since Aria screwed us over already. Anytime we wanted to go to each others rooms we had to take the elevator all the way down and take a different elevator due to the floor difference. 

Now to the PLAIN OLD UGLY......... 
To make matters worse we were in our room and other people opened our room with a room key to get in. The stupid front desk had assigned other people to the room we were reserved under. Thereafter, we left our room as we were assured by front desk that it was taken care of. The whole mix up was that they had assigned us to the room on the 15th floor even though we told them we do not want the room with the king bed. We were once again told everything was okay but to our surprise when we returned our room keys did not work. We once again went to the front desk and spoke to a rude manager. The manager informed us we were STILL listed to be on the 15th floor not the 11th. We were once again advised that things were taken care of and we were assigned to the room on the 11th floor. 

Things did not end here. Saturday night I went up to the room drunk and ready to knock out and of course they messed up again....At this point I was no longer surprised. My card did not work again. I called front desk and they called security up but since the room was under my cousin's name I was not able to get in. The room on the 19th floor was under my name and the room on the 11th floor was under my cousins. Security then informed me the worst that they had once again given key cards to our room to other individuals to check in. Those people found luggage's and called front desk. I do not appreciate strangers going thru my stuff or looking into our room. Front desk then sent over security to go thru our stuff to find ID's then the room was completely locked out with our stuff inside. We had requested that our names be placed under each others rooms but we were advised that it should not be a problem.....WELLLLLLLL....IF WE ONLY KNEW HOW INCOMPETENT THESE EMPLOYEES WERE....... 

I then decided to make a scene to hopefully get these so called employees to work and me into my room. After I called the manager and yelled and told them that I will wake up everyone on my floor and cause problems they agreed to hear me out. I advised these idiots that I can open the safe and pull out my checkbook with my name on it they agreed to let me in hours after I wanted to get in....At this point I was no longer drunk..... Just when we thought we were done dealing with screw ups .....came more trouble. During checkout we were advised that we were supposed to leave on Tuesday and they were not sure why we were checking out early. We were checking on the right day and did not want to spend another night there. I understand this hotel is new but it has been over a year and I have never had this type of horrible service ever in life. It was one thing after another and it was never ending. My birthday weekend was ruined thanks to Aria. I was so excited to stay here but within hours of arriving I was so disappointed.

Room\/Pool:
As for the room and pool I liked the Vdara better.  Just a little bit nicer and a larger room.   The best part of the room is the bed.  WOW!  The most comfortable bed I have been in.  I fell in love with the pillow.  They sell the pillows downstairs at their store so I bought one for my house.  I also liked the room controller and the automatic curtains.  2 sinks in the bathroom was nice and the 2 closets were great.  

Location:
Staying here was better for location because the casino was downstairs and it is close to many other locations.  

We had a group of friends come over from Planet Hollywood and they loved the way the hotel smells like cupcakes a bit.  Also the quality here was much better.  

We noticed a calmer relaxed feeling when we stayed here.  Even our friends were staying that.  At PH it was loud and felt a bit crazy.  We were partying and having fun being in our mid 20s but just felt better here.  I have also stayed at PH a few times.

One of the newer hotels on the strip, Aria was an incredible venture that took years in planning. 

Since my aunt travels to Las Vegas multiple times yearly as a professional gambler, she receives VIP invitations - and EVERYTHING is comped. 

The hotel: catered to the stylish and hip crowd under 50, Aria was designed to impress, and be luxurious. It doesn't fail with scent machines pumping in a light fragrance, amazing bathrooms with floor to ceiling doors (30 foot ceilings) and an excellent staff with a VIP Host that was amazingly attentive. 

The crowd: young, trendy, and ready to party!

The gambling: all sorts of tables and machines available, with 3 VIP gambling rooms.

Chinese people (and others) hold a strong belief in ""Feng Shei"" which is balance and harmony. 

This hotel - and many others, were specifically designed in favor of the hotel. The entrance to the VIP Baccarat room - and the exterior of the hotel, has 2 huge, giant pillars that are in a V shaped formation, with the idea that the house will receive, and capture all monies coming into the hotel. 

Notably, all seasoned gamblers I came with were familiar were very aware of this, and chose to not spend a large amount of money. And they lost. 

However - this place has excellent style and energy, with several choices of dining. I loved the Vietnamese inspired cuisine, and I tend to dislike Pan Asian foods - but this was kind of amazing.

I did however win 17th in a 400 person slot tournament. That was fun, the rooms were free, though be prepared to walk a 1\/3 mile to get to your room.  Whoever designed these walkways should be shot, tarred and feathered and then beaten.  I will be coming back, however, they keep sending me free rooms, but I won't like it, and I won't gamble here.

The king deluxe room was small.  Their shower is in the same space as the tub.  Not a lot of walking room around the bed.  You can find all-suites hotels on the strip for a little bit more than what Aria charges for their deluxe rooms.

I lived in Vegas for nearly 2 years, was probably there 30 times before I made the move, and have been back twice since I've moved. I know a thing or two about a thing or two and this hotel didn't really do it for me. 

The Good: 
-Room itself was fine, the shower and tub were pretty awesome, view was pretty good.
-Rate they offered me was very reasonable, cheaper than some of the other hotels
-Staff at the Casino bar by the elevators to get to you're room. Same guys were working all weekend long. Awesome group of guys made hanging out there fun, you should commend them.
--Great dinner spots here, not really much for breakfast or lunch, but dinner they are covered on

The Bad:
--There's no place to get food by the pool. I mean they have a menu but it's extremely limited and you have to go inside to find something decent. PS- the casino is like 10 degrees below zero. So when you are partially wet outside by the pool and it's 115 outside, your implants basically freeze and you become a Popsicle this is not the look you are going for...trust me.
--It took us almost 30 mins to check into our room. Now granted it was ready, and it was like 1 pm, we actually walked by the line earlier say around 12 but the line was really long then too. So, we went and had lunch then came back and indeed it was slightly shorter, but not really. 
--Loosing, loosing money is bad we all lost money. #boo

The Ugly: 
--Coffee-I need it, I want it, I got to have it. There are only 2 places to get coffee here, you MUST go downstairs, and both are going to have lines that are at least 15 mins (no joke 20 people deep).  I can barely walk w\/out coffee in the morning and I also hate lines. I also was too late to do room service b\/c I'm out having fun 
--Couldn't get a late checkout, had a knock at the door at 11 am to make sure we were checking out, I hate this. I was offered a rate of $49 if I wanted to extend the room to 6 pm. My flight was at 420, Just needed the room to like 2 pm. Got a big no go on that one. Had to then go check my bags w\/ the bellmen, go to another casino for lunch, come back and then head to the airport. They made this alot more difficult then it really needed to be. And lost me to another casino. 
--Table minimums are freaking STEEP here!  It's 4th of July weekend, I get it, but $100 mins at 7 pm for Black Jack?  The other mins were $200 and $300.  We had to go to another casino to gamble...now does that make sense at all to you?  The tables were not busy at all. Not surprising.

I reserved the corner suite 3 months in advance for Friday and Saturday nights. As the date got closer, we decided to come in a day earlier and reserved a deluxe king with city view since the corner suite was all sold out. As we arrived, we chose to park our car through the valet service and they were helpful. As we entered the hotel, we were greeted by a staff member that was really friendly. Made us feel welcomed. Check in was a breeze. We went up to our room and it was clean and modern. The bed was sooo comfortable and so were the pillows! I thought this was all we needed and was going to settle for the deluxe room and cancel the corner suite. 

We had room service for breakfast and it did not disappoint. My boyfriend got the steak breakfast and it was yum! I got the breakfast burritos and it was huge! Time to call down to see if the corner suite was ready and it was! We then switched rooms and the corner suite was even better than the deluxe. The bathrooms was plenty big. I'm glad I didn't cancel the corner suite. There were two bathrooms. One with a bidet. There was a nice separate tub you can relax in while watching tv in the bathroom. There were two sinks and there was mouthwash, bath salts and a razor. House keeping came twice a day. They cleaned up everything and even organized our things in the bathroom. 

Of course, there was the pad, where you control the lights, curtains,tv, etc. My boyfriend loved that for sure. Nothing in our room was malfunctioning. Everything worked like a charm. 

Later Friday night, we ordered room service again. The seared scallops. Oh my god! They are so delicious! Came in a timely manner even though it was past midnight. 

Sunday morning came and i was sad. I didn't want to leave but i had to. Check out was fast.

Yes, it's new and modern. The rooms have a freshness about them and the hi-tech entertainment system can do everything from control the curtain to the tv to the lights (Mandarin Oriental has the same system in place).  Service was solid.  And the glorious fruit plate I ordered one morning while in the midst of a stomach flu situation was a godsend. All good.

Where the Aria fell short for me was with respect to the casino itself as well as the restaurants and bars.  The casino floor had no ""feel"" to it, just seemed like a vast, too dark open space. Not a great vibe. That said, I managed to play blackjack (and win) with a table of Japanese business guys who yelled with delight every 5 seconds. Best run ever.   I wasn't impressed by the food offerings either. Nothing stood out. Yes, that could apply to the all of Aria.  Good but nothing stood out.

The staff was always accessible during my stay. Very friendly and willing to answer my questions and the concierge made some great recommendations.

The shopping at Crystals is beyond belief. If you are looking for the latest and right off the runway looks, you going to be happy. I liked the size of the casino. It was a good starting point. If you want higher stakes you will have to go to your favorite spot.

Good-The hotel is beautiful, a modern feast for the eyes in every direction. The bar justvinside the checkin has delish, fun & unique drinks. Some Vegas hotels try to reproduce an 'old world' feeling, but Aria is contemporary and luxe. Decorated periodically with florals by Kim Parker which offered some whimsical color thruout the otherwise rustically elegant high-end decor. The checkin line was a little too long for a Monday afternoon & the woman who checked me in was less than friendly. I had to ask about & pay to upgrade to a king room (with a ""view"") even though I had booked a standard king room 3 months ago because all they had was dbl queen rooms. The room itself was nice but the ""cutesy"" light switches are dumb. Theres a delay when you hit the switch and several dim\/on\/off options within the same switch so kinda hard to figure out. 
Mastros Ocean Club right outside Aria is excellent for dinner in the treehouse and thevpiano bar singers are sooooo good, not cheesy Vegas lounge lizards.
Not so good - Showing the key to the ""elevator keeper""  every single time I used the elevator is maybe ok for security but annoying and inconvenient. Id rather get a hand-stamp.Upon checkout, had to wait in another line because they printed the bill incorrectly and when I asked them to print my boarding pass (as miss unfriendly suggested when I checked in), I was told I had to go wait in another longer line at the concierge desk or go back to the business center and pay. ;( 
The taxi line stand is on the complete opposite side of the hotel exit, so you have to walk the long horseshoe just to get to the line. I realize nothing is quick, cheap or easy in Vegas, but Aria's design is worse than other hotels in this regard...and the service is kind of ""Motel 6"" for such a lavish ""money"" place.",1,0,0

This was the first time I had been to Vegas since turning 21. Rooms are very nice and modern. Bed was super comfy and bath room was very luxurious. Some areas were I could see some improvement would be that the TV sound went up and done on its own and the picture quality looked like something out of the year 2005 when flat screens just came out. I would expect more from a hotel like this. There was also no table in the room to sit and eat. How would you eat if you were to order room service? I suppose they would bring a cart but it would still be nice to have a table.  I should mention this was the basic king suite room that I stayed in. Housekeeping also accidentally moved some bottled water from the minibar while cleaning which was not appreciated since they then tried to charge me for it. After complaining they removed the charges. Once again never should have happened though. Casino I can't say too much on since I'm not a big gambler but the actual casino floor was one of the best I've seen. Clean and stimulating and was not reeking of cigarettes like some of the older casinos. Good variety of restaurants but don't waste time with the buffet, it was over priced and not very good. I always thought buffets in Las Vegas were supposed to be the best in the world but I wasn't that impressed. As far as buffets goes it was average at best, and the wait was over an hour.  Aria is definitely worth checking out, I would stay there again if I had the chance to get a better idea of the pool and spa which I didn't get to visit.   I would probably get a bigger room though something with the table and maybe some additional seating.",0,0,0

I highly recommend staying at Aria, check in was a breeze but the only downside is the resort fee because they make it seem like you are getting the room at a certain rate but then they hit you with the resort fee.

The rooms are very interesting and everything can be controlled with a single control remote. There is also a button on the wall next to the bed that says goodnight and pressing this will turn off every light and close the blinds.",3,1,2

We ended up getting the room for a good price on Hotwire, and they were able to accommodate an early check-in for us the day of. Although our room was on the 3rd Floor and didn't have a great view, the room itself was nice. The beds and pillows were soft and comfy, which was great. However, the bathroom set up was definitely weird since the frosted glass separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom is only opaque. As soon as you turn on the light and close the door, you can clearly see the silhouette of the person inside. There is also no fan for a bathroom that has no window, so it can get super steamy. I also thought it was interesting that the tub was behind the shower, so you had to walk through the shower stall to use the tub. The other negative is that the curtains and blackout shade are powered by different control panels that aren't super intuitive to use, so sometimes we'd accidentally close the wrong blind.

Other that the strange set up of the bathroom, and lack of full length mirrors in the room, we really enjoyed our stay. It was awesome that the Jean Philippe Patisserie was right in front of the elevator area. We also loved the selection of slot machines, since they had a wide variety. If you play Video Poker, make sure you look for the ones with better odds towards the back of the casino by the taxi stand. 

It can take a while to check in when they get busy since they are VERY thorough when you check in, so try to come early if you can!",2,2,1

Over the years (10 years as a regular visitor to the Mirage and Aria, 4-5 at the Platinum level) the rate of comp has drastically declined at MGM properties but as a long time customer I felt as if loyalty still meant something. Today I logged into my account to setup some rooms for my staff for an upcoming trip and realize that they reset my status to the basic level. Obviously loyalty and long term customers mean nothing to whoever is deciding hospitality programing for the MGM group. I called into the Help Centre and they told me the policy changed a year or two ago. I didn't receive a notice about this change and I can guarantee that I wouldn't have gambled, stayed or eaten at anyone of the MGM properties If I knew this policy was in place. I also sent an email to their ""comments"" address.... bounced back.... they obviously are not interested in feed back or addressing concerns of clients. As a customer all you have to is the right to spend your money in venues that treat you with respect and offer a good all round experience... And if you don't have a positive experience all you can do is to make sure as many people know about it as possible so they don't get taken advantage of too. Buyer beware!

Especially after preparing, packing, and traveling the last thing I wanted to do was argue with some lady. I get complementary benefits because my uncle is considered a VIP gambler and spends well over what it costs to pay for the hotel room in the casinos. Anyway, when I got to the hotel I explained that the room was under my uncles name and I gave her the confirmation code and all the information my uncle sent me like I always do, because this is not my first time in Vegas. The woman (who's name I wish I remembered so I could put it on here) was completely careless of my situation and had the worst attitude I've ever witnessed in the hospitality industry. I say this because I have worked in it all over the world. When I asked to speak to the manager I watched her proceed to ignore me and not even say something like ""sure right away"" or anything along those lines. She just walked away and then I watched her bob her head with an attitude as she gave the manager an obvious low down on how she didn't want to accommodate me for whatever reason. After the manager came over I had a similar conversation and had to call my uncle who was in Mexico at the time dealing with some family related issues and I didn't want to have to bother him. Not to mention it was late at night. The manager first told me that she couldn't help me because my uncle had to be present to check me in and that she was going to ask her supervisor. I waited for about another half an hour after already waiting in line for a long time to check in. Finally the manager was able to check me in after waiting and frustration. If it wasn't for the HORRIBLE staff at the front desk then it would have been a really nice stay. It is a shame because it is a beautiful hotel.

Our room was very dim and there was one lamp that wouldn't go on...it was unplugged and there was no outlet in sight, so basically it was a decorative lamp!

The room was spacious and modern. Everything is controlling by a tablet. The shower was amazing! I usually like to get in and out but I took my time. Loved the 2 sinks! Not a great view but not bad.

We didn't realize how amazing the place would be.  We walked into our rooms after a bit of a long check-in and witnessed a beautiful room come to life.  Lights on, curtains open, and voila! Welcome to the Aria!  Room was absolutely spotless and comfortable too.  We had a phenomenal view of the strip and were able to explore all kinds of levels the hotel has to offer.  Now comes the time for Pros and Cons

Pros:
Fantastic pool and spa location 
Gym offers a variety of workouts
Food throughout the hotel was decadently delicious
Spacious rooms and bathrooms
Great bathroom amenities selections 
Master light feature is fantastic(Curtain feature too)
Decor of hotel is timelessly beautiful and the aroma was delightful.
Bed was amazing!!!!
Conceirge and overall staff iwas always helpful and courteous
*Always make sure to get an advanced reservation with a package plan that includes free buffet meals.


Cons:
Sadly the pool is only open til 5pm
Tv could be a little slow
Free internet connection took a bit of time to figure out
Towels could be softer
If a Pina Colada with no alcohol, lower the cost, shouldn't be $15 for a juice drink
Internet machines(on casino floor) that cost money make sure they're all running properly.
Have an accessible fridge and microwave optional to those that eat out and want to save their food\/drink.



This Hotel & Casino Resort truly is a 5-Star Caliber location.  My wife and I rate this 4.5 stars, though it'd be 4 by Yelp.  Like anything in life always room for improvement.

+Staff all around was extremely professional and friendly. Everyone from housekeeping to front desk to concierge was helpful and nice. 
+Got upgraded to a corner suite upon check in and it was divine. 3\/4 of the room was windows and it was super high tech. The tablet next to the bed controlled everything in the room! 
+Fitness center was spacious and reminded me of the Equinox gyms. The complementary bottles of water with the towels was a nice touch. Not to mention there's lots of equipment besides cardio!
+THE POOLS! Yassssssss I loved them. Ample lounge chairs provided enough seating. There's 2 general pools for guests and one for people staying in the sky suites. Loved the pool bar too good selection of food and drinks. I was obsessed with the chicken pesto sandwich and the herb fries.
+The Aria express trams are free and super convenient. They go to the Bellagio and the Monte Carlo which saved us money.
+Possibly the best part is that this is not a hotel for families so there's hardly any kids here. I only saw 2 ""kids"" during my stay and they were around 13-14. The Aria really does cater to the adults, as it should being that this is Vegas after all. 

After seeing many other hotels on the strip I can say without a doubt that my next time in Vegas I will be staying here again :)",2,0,2

The cons: 
Shortly into our stay we noticed that one of the bathroom sinks wasn't draining properly. We aren't big complainers so we just shrugged and started using the second sink instead. However, by the 2nd or 3rd day, both sinks were clearly clogged and it would take around 30 minutes to drain. My husband would shave, and because it took SO long to drain, the hair would still be there once the water finally drained-- it was gross, to put it shortly. We decided to talk to the management in the morning (to see if we could get upgraded or moved to a different room with properly working sinks). 
They claimed that they couldn't move us to a different rooms because there weren't any available-- which is interesting because we had just seen a huge line of people checking out, and in addition to that, it was a week day which is when hotels are less busy.  
Instead, they offered to send maintenance up and gave us a $50 dining credit. We assumed the sinks would be fixed right away, but it was already late into the afternoon and the maintenance person didn't show up, so we called the front desk again. They fixed it by that evening. 
Honestly, it would've been nice to have gotten a discount on our stay since we had to go through a hassle in getting our sinks fixed. Oh well!",0,0,0

As another reviewer noted, our room was really, really far away from the elevator, which got sort of tiring.   Now onto the common areas.  The crowd seemed a little more sophisticated then the average vegas hotel. We had drinks each night at the bar next to the elevators, bar moderno. It was great, we had awesome service!!

You can usually find a great value deal to stay here, and it's better than what the typical price point would suggest.

Some pros: 
* The air they pump in makes the whole place smells like vanilla
* Casino floor is good size
* Great center strip location
* Still feels new

Some cons:
* The remote control interface they have is bizarre.  Want to adjust your lights?  You have to use your TV remote.  Accidentally hit the wrong button?  Every light in your room shuts off, it's now pitch black, and you're trying to figure out how to undo that.  For millennials, not that big of a deal... if you're older than that generation or aren't very tech savvy, your room could drive you crazy.  
* You almost get the sense walking around the City Center complex that they went out of their way to try to waste space.  Their ceilings are massively vaulted; walking to the ""next door"" Crystals mall will take you 20 minutes; Aria is on The Strip, but it's a hike to even get to Las Vegas Boulevard because the hotel is set back so far.  

It doesn't have the popularity of the Cosmopolitan, and it doesn't have the luxury of the Wynn\/Encore\/Bellagio tier.

Best of all, the HVAC systems minimize the smoke in the casinos. 

There are some down sides. First, it seems unremarkable for a newer property on the strip. It is contemporary, but uninteresting. My biggest problem was with the ironing board. They bolted the iron holder to the board, just like a Motel 6 would. Anyone who actually irons will quickly realize that renders half the board useless. Want to iron a shirt, you'll have to iron the back in 3 inch strips. Ironing pants? Plan to move them three times per leg. Pathetic for a hotel that caters to business and upscale travelers.",0,2,0

I really thought I was going to be blown away by the architecture, decor, or 'something'.  Well, I was!  I was blown away by HOW BAD the whole experience was!  

Getting to the casino\/resort was extremely confusing.  The signs were barely visible from the street.  You go round and around, only to to find yourself at the valet parking.  Where the hell is the 'self-parking?  Fine, I may have turned too soon on the strip.  Making a U-turn then back to the strip, I finally saw the 'self-park'.  The parking lot was one of the most poorly designed I've ever seen.  Considering how big\/tall the casino is, there are very few parking's.  I think they prefer you to use their valet.  They also marked the parking spaces VERY wide apart.  Basically each car is 2 parking spaces wide.  WHY?

The walk way from the parking lot to the casino is just ugly!  It's nothing but monotone gray.  There were 3  chrome sculptures by the entrance which weren't all that interesting.  I was hoping maybe once I stepped inside, it would finally wow me!  Boooooo!  Yes, booooo!  I HATE it!  It's dark with low ceiling!  Who builds casino with low ceilings anymore? 

I walked around the casino floor and didn't find any of the slot machine interesting.  Tried to play a few and they were among the tightest slots I've ever played.

The check-in line was pretty long on Sat, but not horrible. We arrived at 11:45am and our room was ready. We loved the room! It was on the 11th floor and the view was gorgeous. The only thing I really didn't like was that you have to pay to use the fridge in the room. I get why it's that way, but I don't like that. 

The pool area is beautiful at Aria. It was packed on Sat and we couldn't even find an empty chair, but on Monday morning there were plenty of empty chairs to lounge in. 

It's Vegas. Yes, drinks are expensive, but at least they are mixed well at this casino. Do yourself a favor and buy a bottle of rum or tequila at CVS and a jug of soda or juice if you're trying to save money. This casino also has great ventilation, which is rare in Vegas. 

We checked out on our phone and dropped our bags off at the bell desk, so that we could get breakfast before we went to the airport.

Not your traditional casino look.  I appreciated not having to walk through the casino to get to the pool like at most hotels.  We stayed there for three nights this past Memorial Day weekend.  By the end of the stay, I was done!  Ready to leave.
This is a very pricey resort.  Expect to pay a minimum of $35-40 dollars for an entree for dinner.  We ate at the buffet (because it was free) and three other resorts.  None of them were outstanding.... in fact I wouldn't recommend any of them.  
The high tech rooms were nice except for two inconveniences.  One is that there is no plug ins by the night stand.  I arrived to Vegas with a sore back and my much needed heating pad.  Ended up either calling for an extension cord or plugging it across the room and risk clothes lining myself in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.  The second inconvenience was the control panel for the room.  It is not wireless like a remote control.  It's short wire only reached to one side of the bed, which of course was not mine.   From talking with the maintenance staff, they are kept very busy with all the tech problems in the rooms. 
We witnessed numerous instances of poor customer service.  At first I chalked it up to the chance of rude customers feeling that they were privileged to EVERYTHING.  However on Monday I heard a conversation regarding a cancellation of a cabana after the group had reserved it for two days (for not a cheap cost).  The man simply asked for permission to take the generic towels from the cabana to the public lounge chairs.  ""You canceled your reservation and now you want my towels? Either you or me need to get the towels and it's not going to be me"" said the staff.  Cocktail waitresses were short and a couple of customers ended up walking to the bar to get their drinks and not have to deal with the rude staff.  The gusts of wind send several clothing items, newspapers, etc. blowing pool side also.  A pool staff picked up someone's cover up and simply walked away with it.  Not bothering to ask anyone if it was theirs.  My final straw... or so I thought was upon returning from the pool (I was there by myself) my towels was all gone.  I had left a flip flop on top, but the wind apparently blew it off.  However, my dress, magazines and big bag were under the chair.  You can see through the chair!  Another couple beside me went to pick up lunch.  When they returned, their towels were also gone and their cell phones were left exposed on the loungers.  
We arranged for a 7 pm checkout; and paying extra to do so.  Two knocks on the door from housekeeping; one at 9 am and another at 3 pm asking if we were checking out.  We called regarding this, and they said that we never made the request and had 30 minutes to get out of our room. What the hell?  I was in the shower and still had to pack.  We said that wasn't going to happen.  It was their error.  
Upon checking out we just wanted to get out.  Luckily we requested a print out of our bill.  When we got home, we saw that they double charged us for Elvis tickets.  We had a 2 for 1 deal through the hotel.  (BTW... skip the show.  It's not worth it.  The audience was half full on a Saturday night showing).   We called the hotel last night and told it could not be resolved.  They would not let us leave a message for a call back.  Again, another 'x' regarding customer service. 
No matter what the issue was, it seems the person who picks up the phone can't help you.  Expect to be transferred to multiple staff and departments for any kind of concern.  If you do need to make a call, make sure to get the staff's names.  That was the only way we got any kind of prompt responses. 
I wouldn't recommend this hotel for the price and service.  There are plenty of beautiful options on the strip.",3,2,1

I have stayed at ARIA several times, and it is absolutely my preferred hotel in Vegas. During my most recent stay, to my surprise my boyfriend and I were upgraded to one of their Tower Suite rooms. This also included access to a private lounge with its own check-in desk as well as refreshments and little things to snack on throughout the day. This amenity was so nice to have since everything in Vegas can be so pricey, and it was nice to just pop down there and grab coffee and bottled water complimentary in the morning. 

The room...WOW WOW WOW. The Tower Suite is gorgeous, and it has one of the largest bathrooms I have ever seen. If I could stay in that bathroom for the rest of my life, I would strongly consider it. We were on the 52nd floor and had a gorgeous view of the strip from our room. The beds they have at ARIA are some of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, and the pillows are absolutely heavenly. If anyone happens to know what brand of pillows they use at ARIA and could tell me, I would love you until the end of time. 

I don't have much of a critique on the actual casino aspect of ARIA, because I am not much of a gambler. As far as the casino and other common areas go, everything is always kept pretty pristine. 

Thank you to everyone at ARIA for a truly unforgettable experience this past weekend. I wish I didn't have to leave!

Pros: Chocolate smell cancels out the tobacco smell from the casino floor, restaurants are of great quality, room service is impeccable [they even rearranged all of my hair\/makeup\/toiletry products around the bathroom vanity and my shoes all in a neat line],fantastic view, modern amenities and decor, thoughtful staff.

Cons: slightly more expensive than what it's worth, buffet is a little above average but not worth the $50\/person... bed is slightly stiffer than what I would imagine a high-end hotel to have... [I've stayed at Marriott's with comfier beds... WITH down bedding, which Aria did not have.]

Overall, I liked my stay there.  I couldn't help that I kept eye-balling the Cosmopolitan right across the way though, and it was nice to not be so far off the strip.  

We had a deal with a friend that helped set up our entire trip, so we got the hotel rooms at a discounted price since we traveled with a group of 30+ people.  I would def. return if it were cheaper, but I don't see that happening in the near future, and by then, I'd probably want to try the Cosmopolitan.

Aria: 3.5 stars, but I'll be nice and round up since I came up a few hundred w\/ your slot machines.

Extra tips:

Tether our wifi from your smartphone to your laptop so you don't have to pay the wifi charge.

CVS is a godsend around the corner.

Let me say that I came here with my boyfriend in May on a recommendation from family. We were also interested in staying here because it's brand new, the City Center seemed really neat, and the Aria is a green, LEED-certified hotel. 

We booked via Southwest Air - hotel & flight together because we found a deal for 20% off your room rate and 2 free show tickets. Nice deal.

We took a shuttle from the airport and were confused when we arrived at the Aria because it dropped us off in back in this underground garage area. Ok..strange. A gentleman took our bags and directed us to the lobby which seemed like forever away. The lines to check in were extremely long and very slow. There was little to no organization at all. We were tired, hungry and ready to get into our room, drop our bags off, and head to lunch. No such luck.

When we finally arrived to the front of the line, the woman behind the desk was very bizzare. She did not look at us, greet us kindly nor was she informative. She reminded me of Marla Hooch from A League of Their Own! She basically just told us that there was not a non-smoking room available for us and to check back in a few hours. WHAT? To be honest, this is probably the most inconvenient thing that can happen to a traveler. 

We considered grabbing food nearby but didn't want to leave our bags for a considerable amount of time so we sat in the lobby discussing our (nonexistant) options before getting in line again. Not only did somebody completely switch lines and cut in front of me when I got to the front of the line but the person at the desk said nothing! Wow. Way to be. I was told by a much friendlier gentleman that there were no non-smoking rooms clean or ready and that it'd be about an hour. Desperate to freshen up and get our bags into a room, we took it. He said they would put us on a list for non-smoking room (you mean the one we booked months ago???) and we'd receive a phone call. 

Crabby and starving, my boyfriend and I arrived to our temporary floor and room. IT REEKED! The attempt to cover the cigarette smoke was a joke and made the odor worse. We thought about just checking out and going back to the Bellagio, where we had stayed a year earlier and enjoyed very much. We decided to stick it out for the afternoon.

After calling 3 times and being told to call back in an hour, I was getting impatient. What is the point of booking a King room on a non-smoking floor if you aren't going to get it? I called for the last time and actually chose my words carefully. I said that I was calling about my new room (instead of asking for it) and they told me they had one ready and they'd update our key cards and we could go straight to our room. Reluctant to believe this news, I left the bags in the smoking room and went to the new room to make sure the key worked. If we dragged our bags there only to be locked out, I would have been livid. 

We noticed that in this temporary smoking room the name on the electronic hub control thing that controls the TV, lighting, blinds, etc. was NOT ours. We were in someone else's room? When we got to the new non-smoking room our name was on the controller. Who was in our room earlier? Very strange. 

The rest of the stay went smoothly. The pool is fantastic and the food is good. I encountered a very frustrating situation when I went to the business center to check in for our flight. I was told that I could print our boarding passes for free and that was great. However, I arrived a few minutes before I could check in so I was sitting at a computer killing a few minutes before I could log in. The man working there entered the small office area that I was sitting in and rudely said, ""I THOUGHT you were printing your boarding passes. The internet is NOT free."" 

Basically I was scolded by this man as he was very forward and rude. I apologized and clicked out of my personal email and waited a couple more minutes for the flight log in to open up. I sent my boarding passes to print and picked them up at the desk where I was greeted. The person working there was a younger gentleman and asked how everything went. I told him that aside from being scolded for opening the internet while waiting to sign in to Southwest Air, it was fine. He continued with the same bad attitude as the previous guy! I could not believe my ears. I told him very sarcastically, ""Thanks for the great customer service, so sorry I was online for 3 minutes checking email while waiting to check in to my flight."" He continued to be sarcastic and rude back to me. I was absolutely APPALLED. 

The very odd thing about this place is that some of the people there are very thorough, kind, and great at their jobs. Then there are a few rude, strange and unprofessional ones. It was very inconsistent and disheartening.

We will not be back to the Aria or the City Center for that matter. We will indeed be back to the Bellagio next time.",8,0,0

here are some reasons why:

- took an hour to check in
- booked a room with double queen, but was told its not available and was instead given a king with a roll in
- carpet in the room was stained with white spots all over
- vent above toilet in the bathroom was not closed, exposing all kinds of pipes and etc.
- remote to control entire room does not work
- 45 minutes to reach the front desk
- spoke to the manager and was upgraded to a ""sky suite"". waited another 1+ hour to get set up in our new ""sky suite""
- ""sky suite"" room turns out to be the same size as our regular room, just a farther walk from the elevator in another tower.
- was told keys were transferred over
- keys didn't work, got new keys. second set of keys didn't work.
- ended up with 12 keys that didn't work. locked out of room in the middle of the night
- employees don't know where anything is and don't try to figure it out. instead they just say ""sorry i don't even know..."" instead of ""i don't know but let me find out for you"" 
- horrible service at cafe, we asked to move one table over because we had 1 person joining us at a 4 person table and they denied us because that section was ""closed"" even though the table was 2 ft away.


i do understand that they are new but at least train your employees to know the layout of the casino before you open?

also to the guy complaining about no DVR, i don't know which hotels you've stayed at but i've never seen hotels with DVR. 

also the entrance to the crystals mall is 10 ft away from the aria door so its not that far of a walk in crazy weather conditions..

the remote in the room is very straight forward, the person saying it takes a tech genius to operate it is obviously just complaining to complain.",5,2,0

I must say that driving up to you , ARIA , is a feast for the eyes, gorgeous modern buildings with visuals extras such a beautiful fountain, great statue and clean cirular drive add to your visuals.  From the start ,we were greated and treated well. Everywhere we went the staff greeted us and acted liked they enjoyed their work . The valets were courteous and listen to our needs . ( not all my encounters with valets are that nice ) Bell hops, clerks and other various workers greeted us , smiled and acted friendly. Thank you Aria , not all Hotels do that anymore. 

The lobby and entry into Aria is modern yet there is a warmth created by the use of earthy decorations  such as leafy screens and tree structures that were soft in their design. Mettalic structures and decorations abound yet they are soft in circular in their look.  Also I swear they pump in the smell of vanilla in the Casino , smart  move ARIA  , makes me feel welcomed, hungry and relaxed all at the same time. 

 I was surprised when I finally arrived at my room (it's a bit of a trek , one of the furthest from the elevators, not a big deal to me but to some it would be offputting).  The technologically advanced  room  is a fun  , the automatic opening of curtains, mood music, and a personalized welcome written out on the TV screen are neat touches. We had a view of lights from a windowed wall of our room , beautiful buildings and it felt amazing to look out and see the strip. 

The rooms at the Aria are clean, modern, and pleasant, the maid service went beyond clean  she even organized my Diet Coke cans!! ...Loved the button that highlights outside the door whether you want privacy or the room cleaned. They have all of the amenities you'd expect from such a fancy\/high end hotel.  The bed is super comfortable and the blackout curtains are pretty amazing.  Great robes and toiletries too! The bathroom is like a mini spa..You have a  marbled shower room that has a sunken tub. Aria, I love you ! I could have stayed in there forever.

You need to know  that the Aria is huge - if you go here, be prepared to do a lot of walking.  Be prepared to do a lot of spending $$  for munching also;.

I actually had my stay at the Aria recently and am updating my review based on that.  

With respect to the credit card issue, it took about 3 weeks after cancellation and a post on Yelp to get this rectified.  I still recommend watching your credit card statements because they were definitely a surprise.

The hotel itself is pretty nice.  It's a newer hotel compared to the Bellagio and you can see that during the stay.  The bed is as comfortable as others have noticed and the rooms were clean.

The food selection at the Aria is fantastic.  I am one of those folks who hates dressing up but still likes having nice dinners.  Most restaurants at the Aria allow casual dress but still have excellent quality.  

Happy Hours are plenty.  A number of the restaurants on site have happy hours with discounted food and drink.

Awesome spa.  I bought a pass to use the spa facilities (around $30-$35) I believe.  The spa facilities include use of a private pool, multiple Jacuzzi's (Cold, Warm, and Hot), sauna and eucalyptus steam room, salt room, and Japanese Stone beds.  All of them were awesome.  The amenities are also some of the best I have seen out there.

There were some things that kept me from giving them the full 5 stars.  Most of the reasons are based on my past experiences at the Bellagio.  Both are MGM properties and both are AAA 5 diamond award winners.  Here are some things that the Aria does not do:

1. Turn down service is not done for standard rooms
2. Location.  It is a little more of a challenge to get anywhere outside of City Center from the Aria.  Even with the train, it's still a pain to get anywhere
3. Level of service was kind of dry.  Not sure what it was but I didn't feel as though the staff was willing to do what it takes to make a customer happy.

- gym was super nice. free towel service and bottle water. tv's on pretty much all the cardio machines. made me feel a little less guilty about the buffet trips. yeah. plural. T_T

- buffet was good. not great, but I've paid more for less. more than $30 for weekend lunch and unlimited champagne for like $8 more. snow crap legs are light-sabred for your convenience. try the veal. seriously!

- room was pretty nice with great view of the pool area. the ac was not working and they sent a dude up to fix it within 10 minutes. 

- loved the pool area and I have to agree with my friend that for Vegas, the douche factor is actually pretty tolerable and people were cool. just be careful, the ground is super slipery, especially with sandals on. one dude slipped and it was not pretty.

- staff was great throughout, helpful and pleasant. although checking keycards everywhere is a little much.

Looked more like a conference center in the midwest than a hyped new Vegas hotel. They were going for a 'minimalist' theme, but it just came across as cheap. Cheesy cream-colored vinyl wallcoverings in the elevator lobbies was all peeling off. At check-in, all they did was talk about how the room 'welcomes' you - playing music and opening the curtains and everything. We had two separate rooms during our stay and neither did this...I really didn't care, but this seems to be their biggest selling point...it being a ""smart room"" complete with an ipaddy thing to control all of the lights, curtains, tv etc. But the system was tempermental and they probably would have been better served  putting that money into something else - like the finishes.

Also touted as ""cool and innovative"" at check-in was the ""Indiana Jones-style"" minibar, whereby if you lift something off the pressure-sensitive pad, you have something like 30 seconds to put it back or you will be charged for it, regardless of whether you actually consume it or not. Bad for people who want to check out what they might be paying for. And sort of obnoxious, imho.

Other miscellaneous things: There was vomit in the corner of the elevator the first night. For several hours nobody cleaned it up. Concierge closes at 8pm on a Sat night? Staff only recommended the hotel's Thai place to eat (Lemongrass). They must be instructed to do so be because nobody is going there otherwise. Crappy chain-restaurant food. Sweet and sour chicken with neon red corn syrup? How is that even Thai? Also, pretty sub-par toiletries in tiny disposable containers when they are touting how 'green' they are in all of their literature? Why not (as many other luxury hotels have done) have truly great toiletries in regular sized containers that can't be stolen? I got way better toiletries at a Courtyard Marriott in Hagerstown, MD. 

Pool area was nice, but didn't order food or drinks.  And very nice gym. Otherwise, ridiculously underwhelmed.

BTW, we were only traditional Jack and Sally from the nightmare before Christmas, didn't even wear costume, only a little face paint!!! Disappointed Halloween! One more thing, the door lock was missing and the privacy light was broken in our room, we called the front desk about the light and more importantly not to have house keeping service that day. They did fix the privacy light, but the house keeping came anyway. I thought Aria was a new and five star hotel! Not to mention we paid over $70 more per night when book on Priceline.com...

Bummer. Book direct to save yourself from surprise fees. We scored an awesome room rate with a free buffet EVERY night. Not too shabby.

Wikipedia describes the structure better than I can,  ""The completed structure comprises two curvilinear glass towers, measuring 61 stories tall."" and a walk to your room from the elevator to match.

The rooms are nice with tasteful furnishings and posh looking bathrooms. The motorized sheer curtain and blackout curtain open to reveal windows floor to ceiling with a fantastic view of the strip. The amenities are about what you would expect, the standard shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. A nicety is they added a small kit with q-tips, cotton pads and even a sewing kit. The room was clean and everything was functional.

The bad was the bed, as it is shaped like a ""w"" with sags on either side where people have slept over the years. There were also holes in the linens, perhaps I am nit-picking but for a hotel of this caliber [AAA Five Diamond] to have holes in linens is unforgivable. 

Finally the casino in general doesn't seem to circulate the air very well. Cigarette smoke can loom and you typically walk through a small cloud of it as you exit the guest elevators with the ""Lift Bar"" adjacent.

I really loved this hotel.  It's has a calm very refined vibe to it. Once you enter, you get hit with a warm vanilla calming aromatherapy permeating the lobby. Very soothing.

The staff is extremely professional, the rooms are refined, not glitzy. The views from my room were amazing, especially at night.  The tub had a nice depth and soaks were really relaxing.

It was kind of nice having the hotel location kinda deep into City Center and off of the main drag of the strip.  I liked it being recessed.

I had some incredible sorbet (rum raisin and Tiramisu) at the Jean Phillipe Patisserie.  They also had paninis and incredible desserts.  Didn't have time to go to Julian Serrano's restaurant. Next time.

I paid a really nice rate for early week and I enjoyed the first class experience and paid probably 35% less than what I would pay at Encore and have a comparable experience.

I signed up for the Aria email list and was able to get a great rate about a week before our stay. $25 resort fees are lame but seems to be the standard thing to do in Vegas. I would rather just get an honest room fee up front. 
Check-in was a bit of a mess since it was Friday early evening. They had 100 little lines and of course the people in front of me took forever. I finally had my husband go get in another line and he beat me to the front. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get a room on the same floor as our group, which meant we had separate elevators. We had to go all the way down to get on a different elevator to go back up to their floor. 
The room was beautiful and modern. Maybe even a little too high-tech. You can control the curtains from the TV. The bath area is in the shower stall, which is kind of weird but I have no desire to take a bath there so it doesn't matter.

The hotel room was a standard Vegas room, but was above average in square feet., the double sinks in the guest room made a girls trip to Vegas more productive when getting ready to go out. The universal remote that controlled the curtains, TV, Lights and music was VERY cool... yet very frustrating at the same time. It took a little while to get used to the whole system.

I read the negative reviews before we stayed at Aria, but chose to try it anyway. We came in as VIP full comp guests. We have stayed in hotels all over the world. Aria by far is one of the worst. Let's just start with the check in. We are supposed to have a 900sq ft suite. We are told upon check in that the suite is unavailable and will not be available for our entire stay. We are put into a 500sq ft regular room. We get to the room and it looks like a room at the Marriott. Unexciting & cheap decor, dirty windows.  Almost every review compained about the all in one remote. Its beyond confusing. It doesn't work. We had to have maintance up to fix the issues.  We then go to Liquid, the adult pool, $50 per person to get in. And it's tiny!!! My pool at home is bigger. No discount for girls or hotel guests. And it's not like we are a couple ugly overweight chicks in moo moo's. We opt out on the adult pool, head over to the regular one. No music, 1 bar with a 45 min wait for a drink, no servers. Next day we leave the room, put on the service room light. Gone for 6 hours, no service. Call for cleaning, 2 hours finally they come to clean room. Call for room service that night on hold 30 minutes. NO joke. Hang up, have to go down stairs to order the room service. The spa was outrageous. $40 for a brow tint.

Slots it is! We played QuickHits and many themed ones, all about even to what we put in. 

We won $180 on the Megabucks machineon a $1 slot betting 2 lines. That was awesome since we were down from VP!

Upon check in, I was informed the concierge actually got us a panoramic view corner suite. Big brownie points for them providing those little extras for their M.Life members. 

The hotel itself is huge so it does take a few minutes to get from A to B; being in a corner suite means you have to walk all the way to the end of each wing from the elevator but need to work off the alcohol somehow right? Our suite was nice but the windows were filthy (kind of defeat the purpose of being in a suite with a view when all you see are muddy dots). The suite also had a lingering cigarette smell even though we were on a non-smoking floor. The living area was nicely equipped two large sofas, coffee table, a working desk, a separate half bath and a mini bar area. I do like the fact that they gave us an empty fridge in addition to the mini bar. One quick note, the mini bar in most M.Life properties (Bellagio, Aria, etc etc) uses sensor technology, so if you pick something up for more than 30 seconds, whether you consume it or not, you will be charged for that item (of course you can dispute any false charges upon checkout). 

The bedroom was nice and bright; bathroom was very spacious with a tub in the corner facing the strip. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to take advantage of that.  The suite is meant to be 920 SQ but it felt a lot smaller because the space wasn't correctly utilized. Both baths were huge but the rooms itself were small. One friend had to crash for one night and we couldn't even get a roll away bed in the living room until we moved the coffee table and part of the sectional in the entry way.

We had great room service everyday, the staff at the hotel were very friendly and I for one, did not think the Vanilla smell was overwhelming. I might be the odd ball here but I didn't really care for the touch-screen control panel. Call me old fashioned but I don't consider walking into a room and just flick the light switch once to turn the lights on; then once again to turn it off a complicated task that I need a technology device to help me do so.

The only thing I would say to keep in mind is that Marquee night and day club is right across the street at the Cosmo hotel and it is VERY loud. We were 15 floors up across the street but heard every single song when we were in our rooms. I was fist pumping in my sleep! It didn't bother us because we were in Vegas to party as well but if you're looking to relax then I would suggest perhaps moving over to the Bellagio or another hotel that is not within close proximity of the IT club in Vegas.

Aria is built in the midst of City Center, a brand new development featuring The Cosmopolitan, Aria, Vdara and more!  Everything is shiny and brand new.  Every single feature here has the utmost detail paid to it.  Modern, abstract art is a consistent theme as you meander your way through the lobby, the casino, and into the room.

I was expecting a bit larger room, but for 2 people its perfect.  The room is controlled via a large Remote control.  The blinds, the lights, the tv, the music and heating\/ac are all run by a nice little LCD handheld gadget.  The user interface for this thing takes a little getting used to and is definitely not user friendly even for the tech-savvy.  

The bathroom has a nice layout, the shower and tub are in the same tiled room so you can enjoy both at the same time, and even run them both if you feel like wasting water.

Don't touch anything in the minibar, like most of the newer hotels in vegas, these things are controlled by sensors which automatically charge you the second the product leaves the sensor!  Look out!

Back to the bed though, its kind of curse.  I felt like the bed was the best thing in Vegas.  I had never slept so well in my entire life.

Just spent our first night here and I have to stay that it was just OK.  

The front desk was fun and helpful.  Got our key and when we entered, the room was a mess from the previous guest.  No biggie, it was very early in th morning and we just called down to housekeeping and told them we're dumping our luggage and please attend the room and leave lots of pillows.  When we returned later in the evening, there were literally 6 pillows on each bed of all different sizes.  Divine!

A few negatives.  Cell reception is terrible.  Been told it's on the list to get handled.  No electrical outlet near bed.  Called down to housekeeping and they brought one up almost an hr later.  

The AC wasn't working and lucky for us, the tech who brought us up the extension cord was able to repair it ( well it took him almost an hr). It was almost 1am by the time we were able to get the room back to ourselves.  He did apologize and noted that they would change rooms if it wasn't able to be fixed.

Yes, there's quite a bit of ""issues"" and even the service techs mentioned that they opened too soon.  But we knew that when booked it, and you know....it's OK.  We got a very good fare and now that everything is fixed, it's fine.",3,0,0

We just wanted to drop our stuff off so we went with the 3rd floor room...MISTAKE.  Our view was of the roof top.

Overall, the room was very nice.  Bed was great and the room was spacious.  The 'fun' of the control pad for the room lasted...for about 10 minutes.

Really nice rooms, great beds, awesome views.  The pools were nice too.

Only complaints:
Extra upcharge for everything including late check-out
We ate at the Mexican place in the hotel, Javier's.  Overpriced and not good!  They did make a wonderful Jalapeno Margarita for $15!
You cannot bring your own alcohol into the pool area.  They have security checking your bags.  Major bummer if you dont plan on spending $10 per drink.

close to Crystals mall: all the high end shops are right next door. 

food: great places to try different food. many restaurants on property. 

location: in the middle of the strip so a taxi ride is a great deal in this location because you never have to go too far either way of the strip. 

staff: very friendly and professional

rooms: they are a little small but they are nice and modern. the only big thing is that there are no power outlets by the bed, so its hard to charge your phone right next to your bed. also the hallways are long so try and get a room in the middle of the hallway. 

vibe: really nice. i like this better than cosmopolitan. ARIA seems spacious and roomy and cosmopolitan seems very smushed together and you have a lot of people that walk through that property to get to the other side and the shops as they are not disconnected from the hotel.",0,0,0

Unlike other strip hotels, I got the feeling that I was being nickel and dime all the way.  For example, contrasting from other strip hotels, this was the first one we found that you had to pay for extra things like borrowing a crib.  The bar and snacks in the room have the sensors to charge if you pick them up.  In contrast for example, the Palazzo allowed a free crib, free refrigerator, and free teapot to make hot water.  

I thought the room was usually dark and could not make it brighter even with all the lights on.  I suppose that's for the mood.  However, as our room had no view and was blocked by a big air conditioner, it was just dark.  I came for work and ordered the room on the convention website.

The valet had some really nice people and some lazy people.  I thought the cafe staff at night was very nice.  I would rather pay $50 more a night somewhere else though for nicer service and a nicer hotel.  I suppose if you are on a budget and need to pay less than $200 it would be ok.

Note: I just saw in Tony J's review that Aria was given the AAA 5 star award.  I do not agree with that at all.  I really can't see how that is possible.   The Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, Encore, Ceasar's and MGM at the very least are all far nicer with staff and rooms.",0,0,0

The room had a lovely view (19th floor) and we loved the wide open, floor-to-ceiling-wall-to-wall window accented by wrapping around one of the corners. The decor is tasteful, elegant and modern - as is the lighting. The pillow top beds are heavenly soft and comfy, and whoever thought of putting a large tub within the shower deserves an award. The hyper-modern light-blinds-appliance switches are another story and seem to prioritize flashiness over function. A late check-out of just noon was a bit of let-down and having to traverse the entire Casino on the way from the hotel to the self-parking area is inconvenient to say the least (some of us prefer not to use a valet because we take several car trips a day). There was also a candy wrapper left in one of the drawers of the nightstands that housekeeping missed from the guests before us.

I love modern design, and while Vegas is known for it's over-the-top, kitschy, and extravagant  hotels and casinos, I am happy to have a new place to stay that is more my style.

Do me a favor though, if you don't like modern and hate glass and steel and skyscrapers and ""cities,"" don't go here and then complain about how it is soooo not Vegas and you were disappointed and blah blah blah....just go to the Bellagio, the Venetian, or Caesar's Palace and stay clear of CityCenter.

I could go on and on about how great Aria is, but as an interior design for high-end hospitality around the world, I would like to point at some key things that were missing\/lacking at my stay at Aria.

First and foremost, the worst thing about Aria (in my opinion): No hand towel rings in the bathroom.  This, along with little counter space (because they put so many damn things on the counter), made me pretty frustrated in the bathroom.  Where are you supposed to put your hand towels and wash clothes?  The housekeeping just places the hand towels and wash clothes on the edge of each sink.  It's weird, and it seems like poor attention to detail, or a budget cut or something, but it needs to be fixed.

One other thing I think everyone should be aware of is that this hotel is green, meaning it is very energy efficient, and normally this shouldn't be a problem with comfort, but I did notice in the elevators one day that it was quite warm.  I was completely fine with it, but I am always cold and prefer to be hot.  For those people who hate being hot (why are you in Vegas?) it would be uncomfortable.

Now for the positives:
This place is a techy's dream!  The room opens up to great you upon entering for your first time.  Then you control everything with this remote which is also your alarm clock.  I really liked the way you can set the alarm to wake you up by opening the curtains, turning on the lights, turning on the tv to whatever channel you choose, and\/or making the room colder\/warmer.  I did find using the tv for the first time a little difficult and even left there not knowing 100% how I did it each time, but if you have ever used an iphone or ipod, you can figure this out.

For turn down they leave a pomegranate dark chocolate on your pillow, I thought it was good enough to be noteworthy.

There are a ton of restaurants on the promenade and casino levels and they are all beautifully designed, if you don't eat at them, you must at least have a look at them.  The casino is really beautiful too, very subtle and has a nice natural look about it, pretty graphical, but in a tasteful way.

There is a tram that takes you from Aria to the Bellagio, so that is very handy.

The location on the strip is perfect, the whole CityCenter is absolutely amazing and beautiful.  If you like modern architecture and design and want something new and different for your Vegas stay, definitely stay here!",5,3,2

We were able to check in upon our extremely early arrival from the airport. That was great and I'm glad they accommodated. Our room was beautiful. Very adult. Dark shades. Dark walls. Dark furniture. Not bright and crazy like other Vegas hotels we've stayed at. I'd actually decorate my house like this. We had a view of the pool, which we scoped out every morning to get the best seats. 

They even brought a refrigerator to our room so we could store our own water. It was very prompt. After a incidence with the pool at XS my phone needed some uncooked rice to soak in. They accommodated the strange request. Housekeeping gave my husband several shampoos that he enjoyed. Their vanity kit came w a much needed makeup removal wipe. Maybe more for their sake that my mascara doesn't smudge all over their linens and towel. 

The hotel was beautiful. Beautiful architecture. We had a nice workout in their fully equipped gym. $50 for a yoga or workout class was too pricey. They had great treadmills with screens and tv and synced your workout. But too bad they didn't have a USB for the iPhone 5. Not a biggie. I'm not one for looking at my workout anyway. 

Loved the pool. Great sun. Cold water jugs perched everywhere. We had to chase down waitresses sometimes. But their delicious refreshing alcoholic drinks and food hit the spot. The furthest pool seemed a bit dirty. Mostly drinking adults. Smaller and just seemed trashier.

The total costs for the drinks they charged me was plus 50 dollars, which was 1\/3 of the cost for a night stay at this at best ""average"" Vegas hotel.

The staff was amazing! From the front desk, the cleaners, the concierge desk and just the various workers throughout the casino we were treated politely.

We checked in on a Sunday, so the price was right and it wasn't too packed at the front desk. If you really have to check in or don't want to wait in a line (which all popular hotels have on the strip at many different times in the day) you can talk to an Aria helper in the gray suits roaming around the check in area. 

Yes, the rooms are on one side while the elevator is on the other side but it never took us 15 minutes to get to the elevator and we were pretty far down. Taking 2 minutes to walk to an elevator doesn't at all seem to me a good reason to knock on the hotel at all!

The room was awesome. In the other reviews, everyone brought up awesome technology. You press one button and the room lights come on, the tv turns mood music on and the wall to wall curtains open. Pretty sweet. The room was a great size for me and my husband. Very nicely done! I loved it. I also LOVED the bathroom. I was here with just my husband, so the foggy glass door that separates the toilet from the rest of the bathroom didn't bother me as one reviewer was bothered by the ""lack of"" privacy. You can always just shut the actual bathroom door. 

The tub in the shower is a PERFECT idea. I liked taking a bath and not worrying about the water overflowing onto the floor. This way, it goes into the shower and drains! Awesome.

My favorite part of the entire room was the BED. Oh my. It was like sleeping on a cloud. If you like super plush mattresses, this is the king of all mattresses. I even looked to see what the brand was so I could rush home and buy one for my husband and I!

I can get that quality at Motel 6 for under a quarter of the price.
 It took us nearly 30 min to get checked in since they were training new employees (why do this on an incredibly busy evening?) and another almost 30 min to get drinks at the bar since the bartenders ignored me for over 15 min to conversate with each other. We had to call the front desk to have maintenance come up twice, once to fix the tv & once for the heat\/air so we ended up spending more of the night with hotel staff than with each other.

Upside:  Modern, New, kinda clean.  Staff is friendly.  Room design and views are good.

Downsides:  The modern feels like they tried a bit to hard.  I have a feeling the design in this hotel is going to feel dated in about 5 years.  Lots of different artsy stuff slammed together and feels a bit incongruous at times.

The hallways are kinda hard to navigate and in general the hotel seems difficult to navigate.

The entryway of my room on a non-smoking floor smelled like smoke every time I walked through it.

The closet doors clack very loudly every time you close them.

The TV in my room didnt work.  When I called the front desk I was put on hold long enough that I didnt wait.

I could not make calls out from my cell phone from most places in the hotel.  However I had 3-5 bars most of the time, and seemed to be recieving calls.

I ordered the apple pie and ice cream desert from room service and it was decidedly mediocre.  Not what I expect when I pay 20 bucks to have a piece of pie.  Especially the ice cream was terrible.

There is a location on the promendade floor near the gelato\/coffee shop where you turn to go toward the spa\/gym\/pool that smells like mold.  I dont know if it is in the carpet, or what but I walked through that one small part of the hallway like 10 times in two days and caught the mold smell every time.

The mini bar items are like laser sensored or someththing so you are charged if you even touch them.  You have to sign your acknowlegement of this policy on check in.   Its like signing a policy 'we are going to nickel and dime you to death while you stay with us'.  Wow, that makes me feel really welcome.

The pricing of everything in this hotel is just terrible.  Just one example is the $14 pannini I had at the Chill cafe on the Promenade deck.  I mistakenly didnt look at the menu but picked the sandwitch out of their display case.  It is a pre-made sandwitch that they just throw on a grill\/press.  It was a decent sandwich, and in a casino like this I expect to pay a premium.  But $14 is about $4 too much in this case.

Light pours in through the top of the ""blackout curtains"" all night.  I was in a room that faced the cosmopolitan hotel.

there is a large enough space under the door of the room that I could hear everyone walking by all night.  In a city like vegas, where people are up all night, this is a real bad thing.

My general experience was very poor and I definately wont stay here again or recommend it to anyone.  For kids who dont know what it is like to stay in a real high end hotel, this will feel really modern and fun.  But for people who have stayed at a lot of nice places, with high expectations for comfort, this place will not cut it.

I rate it two stars beause the expectation is high at a place like this and they missed the bar badly.  I would rate it one star if it were not so new and in such good shape in general due to that newness.",0,0,0

I go to vegas about 30 visits a year, about 90 nights.  I mostly stay at Aria or Vdara which are both owned by MGM.  I stayed last week for 4 nights and they messed up my reservation and had to get special approval to reduce the five nights to four nights without charging me a penalty.  I called to change a week before my visit and they didnt email me the changes  For some reason i had a hard time getting me a email with the changes.  They had a few mistakes with my reservation.  I requested it again after i changed it and still didnt get the email.  I use the M-life line to book my reservations.  I checked in early and the girl at the invited guest check in counter said my room was ready.  I said great and then she told me it was $35.00 to check in early.  I asked to talk to a manager and she left to speak to someone and then came back and said she can waive the fee if i am willing to go into a deluxe room with two queen beds so i took a lesser room I guess for four nights to be able to check in two hours early.  Also when i got to my room my keys didnt work and so i had to wait for security to let me in and then i waited in line of 7 for the key only line.  No one at the hotel seemed to care less that i wasnt happy.  I guess i dont gamble enough for them to care but i do lose money there.  I called to speak to a manager and he really didnt care at all and was annoyed i had a complaint.  If anyone would have cared at all and was sympathetic I would not have been writing this review.   I currently have four reservations there or Vdara over the next five weeks.  I would cancel them and move to another hotel but i have too many people coming in to work with me and they already have there reservations.  Not only are they losing my business but they are losing about another 40 nights of people staying there because of me.  And i entertain a lot at the restaurants that will be changing too.  The place is huge they dont care about me but i feel better letting people know they are going to be getting bad service.  Moving forward I will be staying at Cosmopolitan earning Marriott points or the encore, wynn or some other options that have been recommende to me. Oh yeah, also the resort fee has been increased to 32.00 a night.  I have stayed at the SLS a couple of times and it isnt as nice but the time before last i stayed there for 50 a night and they waived the resort fee.

We booked via orbitz for a king city view and ended up being told that there is none available - nor was an upgrade on the horizon. We ended up in a smaller room that we didn't like as much. They make a big deal about high tech room but I found it rather basic so am not sure what the hype is about.
We tried the restaurants - there is a French brassier that really lives to the service. It takes an hour to get an omelette in a fast food setting ( you wait in line for 30 mins) and another 45 just to receive your order. 

Finally this put the nail on the coffin. My keys got deactivated before I checked out. When I called front desk they sent security instead of reactivatkng my keys. It took them 3 calls and 30 mins to send security and get us back in. We almost missed our flight because of these guys. 

And now I see room charges appearing for a stay that was already paid out to Orbitz. A new battle for me to fight. Needless to say I am never coming back. Better stay at tried out hotels like Venetian.",3,1,1

Huge, huge let-down. I had such high expectations. When I went to Vegas in 2011, it was my first time since I was 11. I saw the magnificent Aria & Cosmopolitan and told my GF when I made more money I would take her there. We stayed at the Hilton off the strip at the time through a deal seen on SlickDeals.

Came back in 2012 for the Yelp event and stayed at the Platinum. The Platinum really wowed us. Basically was a fully furnished, modern condo. Through some business conventions and a bachelors' party throughout the rest of 2012, I stayed at the Stratosphere, Mandalay, & Venetian. 

Fast forward to 2013. Cosmopolitan was booked, but I was just as happy to reserve a room with Aria. I would say Aria is a bit more casual, hip, modern. Cosmopolitan is a bit more refined and upscale. As for me, I was dgaf with my exercise shorts, New Balance sandals, and an oversized shirt. GF was embarrassed walking next to me. But hey, I come here to be relaxed and eat the buffets. No gambling or night life for me.

The staff at check-in were extremely courteous and friendly. All staff were courteous and friendly in fact. However, the room was just terrible.

After the initial oooh and ahhh of the automated blinds when we first walked in...the flaws became apparent. The Wifi was incredibly slow. The majority of outlets & plugins centered around Aria's Audio\/Visual Panel near the TV. Not enough outlets for multiple devices; with my GF, we had 2 iPads, 3 phones, and one laptop so we had to charge one of the phones and iPads in the bathroom. I really wished there were some bedside outlets. There was also no refrigerator...although one could be provided for a daily fee.

Ventilation very poor. It was very hot throughout my stay--temperatures were at an all time high of 113 outside. The room was 77 degrees when we went in and with the A\/C struggling and constantly on, it managed to bring it down to 75 by the time we left. Both of us tossed and turned the entire night without good night's rest due to the heat and possibly uncomfortably soft bed.

I complained to front desk. To their credit, a technician came by within 15 minutes. he flushed the coils and replaced the filter. Unfortunately it did not resolve our problem. Checkout was willing to waive the resort fee but nothing further.

The view was very nice. I felt at the center of the hustle & bustle.

All in all I felt restricted and I didn't enjoy my stay. I would have preferred to pay for a suite at Platinum off the strip or a suite at the Venetian for a comparable price to a regular King room here. I don't mind paying for the experience, but there was just no experience to be had here. I live in a fairly modern home, and I kept wishing I just stayed home, which after a 4-5 hour drive to Vegas as an ""escape"", is not something I would have liked to feel.",4,1,1

I travel to Vegas 3 to 4 times a year and usually always stay at Aria. I used to love Aria, the rooms were always super clean and beautiful, well not anymore. 

I'll start from the beginning. Me and my wife were coming to Vegas for 4 days to celebrate our wedding anniversary. After a 4 hour flight we get to Aria around 2 pm and wait in line for check-in. I get to the front desk about 2:45. The front desk girl was very nice. She checks us in and we get keys for a room on the 18 floor. 

We get to the room around 3:15 pm and only one of the two keys worked. We unpack and my wife wants to take a bath and I decide to take a nap before we head out to gamble. When I get to the bed I started to notice stains on the bed sheets, so I think to myself, ok no big deal they just need to change the sheets. I called housekeeping around 3:30 pm for them to come change them. Well while waiting for housekeeping to come I decided to look around a bit more and notice more nastiness around the bed. There were boogers and snot all around the bed, bed sheets, and headboard and on the tables next to the bed. Then there was also stains on the floor and there was a cigarette burn in the blanket even though the room is suppose to be non-smoking. For whatever reason there was also small metal beads all over the room. It was absolutely disgusting. This is something you would expect at Circus Circus, not Aria. So this time I called housekeeping again and told them what was happening. They sent a housekeeping supervisor so I could show her all the nastiness and I asked if I could switch rooms and was told to call the front desk. It is now about 4:30 pm and I called the front desk and told them what was happening and they changed my room to another room on the 28th floor and was told to reuse the same keys. So we repack and start heading to the other room.

We get to the next room around 4:45 pm after lugging all our luggage to the new room. This time before we unpacked we decided to check to make sure we didn't get another nasty room. The only issue we found was stains on 2 of the pillows. We called housekeeping again to come change them. So now its about 5:20 pm and we unpack again and I find out that the safe in the room is already locked, so I called the front desk and they tell me that they will send someone up to fix it. The maintenance guy comes and unlocks the safe 20 minutes later and finally settle in and my wife goes and take a bath finally and I finally get in bed to take a nap. About 5:55 pm l get woken up by a phone call from front desk telling us we need to move rooms again. At this point I am livid, I literally thought they were joking after we unpacked and settled in twice already. Apparently the room we were in was never suppose to be used due to water maintenance or whatever. So here I explained to them that we literally wasted the first 3 hours of our trip moving around rooms in the hotel. So this time they upgraded us to a sky suite room for all the trouble. So we repack our luggage again for the third time, this was getting old. This time we also had to wait for someone to bring us new keys. The keys finally arrive around 6:40 pm. 

The sky suites are at a different elevator and it was a pain move to this room. We get to our new room and it is exactly the same thing as the last two rooms, it actually seems smaller than the regular room and I swear it is. The regular room has two chairs next to the window, but in the sky suites there was only one. From what I saw on the room layout on the floor, this room was sandwiched in between two real suites so this was the smaller version of a regular room on a sky suites floor and thats all it was. At this point me and my wife are exhausted from all the room moving its about 7:30 when we finally unpack and settle in again for the 3rd time. Except for the big stain on the floor, this room was actually way cleaner than the last two. 

So we arrived at the hotel around 2 pm and took 5 hours for us to finally get a room we can stay in. The night before we checked out I went to the front desk at the sky suites and asked about late checkout and was told there was no late check out available, but they can call me to double check day of, well never heard anything back I'm sure she just threw my request in the trash since you can tell by her attitude that she really hated her job. The last day we were there we woke up around 10 am to get ready to check out, only find there was no running water. Called the front desk and was told the water was shut off for maintenance. So no washing up and no using the toilet, great. Would have been nice if someone warned us about this.

Aria is suppose to be a high end hotel, used to be clean, and on top of things. I guess not anymore. Thanks for such a terrible experience on our wedding anniversary.

Of course, weekends are always more expensive, but, because of our work schedules, that's the easiest time to get away.

If I had to give this a negative mark, it would be for the valet. We valet every where, even here in L.A.  I have never had to wait for more than 5 minutes to get my car, we were left wondering if we were ever going to see our vehicle again.

We were given a corner suite on the 37th floor, overlooking the strip- the view was gorgeous!  The room was huge- with separate living space, bedroom, and bathroom.  Everything was remote controlled- the curtains automatically were opened to reveal the sights from every angle- could even look at the strip from in the tub!  

Our first night, chocolate covered strawberries were sent up- delicious.  Going out to see the sights from the Aria was extremely easy between the tram and the central location.

Beautiful hotel with great customer service from checking in to calling house keeping they made you feel so taken care of! Im from California and aren't used to the smoking inside thing but the Aria keeps the hotel nice and ventilated so you don't feel like you're breathing it in. When we walked into our hotel room the automatic blinds open with a great view, the lights come on and the TV turns on. everything is just a button push away. The bed is so comfortable it was like sleeping on a cloud. You can actually buy their whole bed set up if you want. We are going to buy the pillows they were great! My only complaints were that the hotel is a little bit off the strip so if it's a 110 degrees outside going anywhere can be a little over whelming. We enjoyed the pool one day which was very mellow (MONDAY)  they have 3 pools which seemed to be divided up with families who have kids, young adults etc. That was nice because you can pick your crowd. One complaint I had was the bathroom in the room wasn't cleaned very properly. The tub seemed to have some soap scum or cleaning product in it, same with the toilet and had a bit of a funny smell over all. I know if I would have called house keeping they would have taken care of it right away for me so I wasn't too concerned but it did keep me from using the giant awesome shower tub combo. Make sure you have the concierge print your boarding passes when you check out, thats a great service. as for restaurants the Aria cafe was OK but it took 20+ mins to get one order of ""late night"" chicken strips when it wasn't even busy. We also went to Julian Serrano for Tapas which was good (not amazing) but I'm from SF so I'm a bit of a tough critic. Very good service everywhere we went though! The golden club (sunday night)  was very small and not that impressive... no where to sit unless you had bottle service which was annoying if you just want to have a drink not even any bar stools. Dj was old school hip hop\/ rap\/ house\/ top 40. Needless to say we left after one drink. I would check out other big clubs if your looking for a good time. One plus about the club was that my boyfriend was $20 and I was $10 plus we got two free drinks- we did have to get wrist bands for this from a guy who scouted us downstairs to get this deal. This is a cheaper deal than most clubs in Vegas. Over all great hotel and I would stay again!",0,0,0

I am still sitting in an 80 degree room after Aria dropped the ball on fixing the AC. The AC fan buzzed all night the first night, and quit working the next day. I called for maintenance at 7PM after arriving back to the room and they said someone would be up to fix it. I left the room and expected it to be fixed when I got back; however, the room was as hot as I left it, and no one had been by to fix the problem. 

I call the front desk again and tell them someone should've been by at 7PM, now it's 11PM and they are going to make a customer wait while they send a technician to fix their faulty system. No apologies from the front desk person, and no offers to change the room except to a 6th floor room which has a worse view, no compensation offered at all. 

Checking in was also terrible. They have an awkward system of sending you a QR code to pick up your keys, but no way of using it after a certain time, in effect making you wait 15 minutes in a long line just to check in. The email also tells you not to bother checking in unless checked in online. 

I won't be staying here again, will be sticking with Wynn where their customer service a lot better. Even a 2 star Motel has better check in and customer service than Aria does. It is evident that the front desk robots do not care, and it shows.

Finally at 12:30AM the fan is fixed. Thank you to the maintenance technician, the room is finally cool.

CHECK OUT: Upon reviewing the mobile check out bill, we were charged for some cashews we did not eat for $17. Waited 10 minutes at the long check out line, and front desk person Deborah asked how the stay was. Told her about my terrible first couple of nights and she offered to take off one day of resort fee. I asked if that was all she could do, and after some typing she took off two days worth of resort fees which was around $70.

I know this, because I have been to the Aria several times and have never had the headache that I experience this last time. The room is still quite comfortable and nice and quite. The A\/C was never able to break 70 degrees (even though the thermostat went down further). I had room service on several occasions. Each time, the person bringing the food refused to follow directions. Each time they asked if I would like my food unwrapped. Each time, they proceeded to unwrap my food. This bothered me, mainly because I was asked a question and then my answer was ignored.

The staff could not have been nicer. Check in was easy, and the information given was easily understood and relevant to my stay. 

Trip to the room required a walk through the casino.  This is the norm for Vegas, but I hate walking through the smoke to get to the elevators. 

The hotel has one central bank of elevators, and the floors are huge. Took a few minutes to walk to my room from the elevator once I reached my floor.

The room was a good size.  When I started to unpack, the drawer in the bathroom has used q-tips, hair band and wooden pencil in it.  This was unpleasant. I called housekeeping, told them, went to the gym, and they had cleaned it up by the time I returned.

The gym is very nice.  Lots of machines, water, fruit, headphones etc..  It overlooks the pool area and each machine has a television attached.

When I went back to my room to go to bed, pulling the covers, I had hair in my bed.  Many pieces, dark and long, and the sheet was tattered. I again called housekeeping, and they came up in a about 10 minutes and changed the linens. They were very nice and quick, even doing turn down service.

Food at the restaurants was very good as was the catered food at my meeting.  Meeting room was very large, spacious, and the sound system worked well.

Check out was easy, did this via the TV in my room.  

Given the 2 problems with my room, I would have liked a manager to call, leave a message or note apologizing for my room, or an offer to change rooms, get a drink, something. No one contacted me, making me think the cleanliness of there rooms is a common problem.

Even though there's a lot of slot machines and poker tables there, it's not as flashy as to cause you immediate migraine.

Upon check-in I was kindly informed by the staff lady that 75% of Aria's rooms are King-size beds. So for the customers who are eager to check-in into a 2 queen bed, you better make sure you arrive there early (especially on the weekends).  

What I like about Aria was the restaurants that are available. They're decent and not too pricey. I do love the pastry section of the casino. I feel like I'm a little kid all over again; spoiling myself with sweet goodies. 
- The minute you step into the room the curtains open and you get the beautiful view of the pool and the other hotels. The view was just breath-taking!
- The bed was pretty comfy and the room has a touch of modern decor. Another plus thing about the room is they have a touch screen remote that controls everything in the room. I was pretty cite about that cool feature.  


Dislike about the hotel:

- Beware the sink in the rooms can get pretty dirty. And no, I don't mean it in a sexy way. I swear every time I use the sink, I end up with water all over my shirt\/dress. The water shoots at a weird diagonal and so you're meant to get wet, regardless if your careful. 
- The walk to the pool and to the other rooms are ridiculous. If I want to go to a certain level I had to go down to the lobby and then get into the correct elevator that takes you to your desire floors. What is that?!?! It's such a waste of time!!!   

Overall, I would stay here again, but I hope they do something about the restroom issue and the elevator convenience.",1,0,0

First the Pro - 

1. A high end hotel with high tech rooms. All the lighting, curtains, TVs, music, can be controlled through a tablet device next to the bed. 

2. Stellar customer service all the way from bell desk, to house keeping, to concierge, and to the valet. 

3. The hotel is not nearly as crowded as Bellagio and Caesar's palace. On Christmas day, those two hotels were like an over crowded farmers market, while Aria maintained a steady, and nice number of players and guests on the casino floor. 

4. The gym was very nice. 

5. Got a $75 meal credit to each room we booked. This deal effectively paid for the resort fee charged. I thought that was a nice touch. 


Now the Con - 

1. The drinks served at the poker tables were extremely watered down. I might was well paid for a real drink as I was sure that I was drinking sugar water. 

2. The concierge girl gave me tons of wrong information including business hours of the nearby outlet, and location of the nearest Burberry store, which resulted in me walking an extra 15 minutes just to get to the correct location. 

3. Made a dinner reservation at Lemongrass through the hotel reservation line. The restaurant later said they never got the reservation. 

4. Luggage service had a 45 minutes wait time at check out because they were receiving all calls at one time. I understand it was busy... but I think the hotel could have anticipated this and hire extra shifts for holiday seasons. The lady I spoke to at the bell desk was not patient (an exception to rest of the great service I received throughout my stay).

The staff was friendly, however the service was just mediocre. Just one of the many issues that i experienced to support my two star rating: i called and asked for a mini fridge.

I considered placing in their mini fridge with all their food and drinks, don't worry i didn't, however let me tell you that cleaning service must not open these refrigerators because i found the previous guests leftover food in it.

The good:  
-The staff is extremely nice and helpful!!  From the bellboy taking our things to our room to the concierge girl and the room service.....everyone was great and made the stay really pleasant.  
-The pool was great!  There are a few pools to choose from, so our party chose the one without any children - Bonus!  There were plenty of chairs, although we did get there around 8:30am (we couldn't sleep!).  There is a nice bar right by the pools that serve really great mixed drinks and buckets of beer that aren't too ridiculously expensive.  There are also massage therapists outside with massage chairs that are very reasonably priced.  I was planning on getting a morning massage but forgot because I was having so much fun in the pool!
-The location was pretty central.  It's right next to the Cosmopolitan so our trip to Marquee was easy, and there was a great little sushi place in the Crystal shopping area too.

The bad:  
-I think that it's over-priced.  The rooms really aren't that big, fairly standard if you ask me and I've stayed everywhere there is to stay in Vegas.
-The decor is lacking.  I was expecting a grand lobby area but I was really disappointed, it was just sad looking with these dumb pieces of plastic paper with printed out daisies on the ceiling.  It just looked so cheap.  I was just really surprised with how little decoration they had considering they were supposed to be an upscale and expensive hotel in Vegas.  I mean MGM is better!!!

Pros:

+ They have a really pleasant scent they spray in the front lobby area, makes for a nice aromatic first impression
+ The massive waterfall fountains on the exterior are a great place to take pictures

Cons:

- One of the cocktail girls was quite curt in responding to a request for where the men's room\/drinking fountain was (my mouth felt parched from all the smokers, seems she was only interested if you wanted to buy hard booze?)
- The layout of the Aria is very confusing, and is more or less like a maze, both on the inside of the building and out

This was the perfect hotel for us- newish, modern, hip people but not to the extent of the Cosmopolitan, good location.

The pool area was really nice. Plenty of seats- even on a crowded holiday weekend.  Quick drink service. One pool was a little louder...the other two a little more quiet. 

The rooms were great with nice size bathrooms. Loved the strip view that we had. I'd recommend this view.

The location of the hotel is perfect since it's basically in the middle of the strip. You can tram to the Bellagio or Monte Carlo if you want. We easily walked to the Venetian on one end and Mandalay Bay on the other. 

I'd definitely recommend this if you want a little Vegas scene, but not a lot. If you want the hip scene, the Cosmo is for you.",2,0,0

The bathroom was large with a great shower, but they could really use some better towels. The high-tech aspect of the room was a bit much and had a bit of a ""laggy"" feeling to it. The art and carpet in the room left a bit to be desired. The large window was about as dirty as a window could be: it was absolutely filthy.

The key system was by far my biggest complaint. I had to visit the front desk five times for new keys, including once in the middle of the night in which they eventually had to have security let me into my room, due to them not working properly. Front desk handled the situation with class, eventually giving me a handful of keys and a food\/beverage credit. Even still, being forced to sit in the hallway outside of my room at around 4am in the morning was a real drag.

Everyone working at Aria was extremely friendly and helpful. All-around great staff; I wish I had written their names down but then again they were all impeccable. Checking in and out was a bit of a mess, there was no real order to it, with a big mass of people lining up in seemingly random fashion. Sometimes it took a long time for the front desk to answer the phone; it seemed like they were under staffed. 

Aria was built in such a way that walking anywhere takes a long time. The walk to the strip from your room is pretty long, but the walk from your room to anywhere is ludicrous. For example, the valet is next to a set of doors on the entire other side of the hotel from the front desk. The room elevators are directly in the middle. Not sure why the elevators are so far away from the front desk or why they decided to put the valet where they did.

Overall it was a decent stay, but I found myself asking time and time again ""what makes this better than TI, Planet Hollywood, or any of the other mid-range properties on the strip?"" Nothing really made it jump out as a top-of-the-line place. 

P.S. The whole $20 + tax resort fee per night is incredibly shady. Just include it in the base rate instead of trying to sneak it in under our noses.",0,0,0

the entrance\/exterior is space age and sleek; fountains, walls of waterfalls, interesting angles, and lots of lights; new and modern inside - just  like you would want the main hotel\/casino of City Center; there's even a legit relaxing lobby bar; the restaurants all look fab - Sage, Javier's, Julian Serrano Tapas - all make you want to come in & eat there; even the coffee\/dessert spot Jean Phillipe patisserie is cool & interesting; adjacent to the fabulous high-end shopping at Crystals mall; the sports book is really nice & tucked away, conveniently next to the Five50 Pizza Bar; there's a 2nd floor with a few more shops & restaurants, plus the Zarkana theater; best craft beer bet = clearly, it's at Five50 Pizza, but even slightly better is Todd English Pub just next door in Crystals (though the prices are high!)",2,0,0

On the center of the Las Vegas strip, in the famed ""City Center"", yet set a bit back from the strip, an upgraded ""City View Room"" at
the richly accentuated Aria Resort Hotel and Casino offers glimpses of The Monte Carlo, NY NY, MGM, The Cosmopolitan, The Mandarin Oriental, Polo Towers, and Planet Hollywood.  A huge Picture window takes the place of the fourth wall in your room to present a nearly floor to ceiling unobstructed view.  

The room itself is sophisticated, ultra modern, and well appointed.  It is large, and features well appreciated his and hers closets, double sinks and a unique tub-and-shower-in-a-room set up that is difficult to picture, but works well when you use it... Touch remotes control everything including drapes, lights, air and more...  One point of contention is the lack of a coffee maker in the  room.  And they will not provide one if you ask, thus the reason for my 4 star rating instead of 5.  Having coffee while I prep and get dressed for the day in the morning without taking a trip through the Casino hotel is that important to me.  

The hotel grounds are extraordinary... Interesting pieces of contemporary art abound, and lively pop music plays definitively throughout.  Bruno Mars, the Smiths, an interesting French selection, even Andy Gibb!  Surprising and wonderfully random.

Not content to simply have a place for some pastries, The Aria boasts the John phillipe Patisserie, where extraordinary decor rivals even its deeeelicious pastries!   The restaurants are too numerous to mention here, and tasteful, alluring and elegant bars invite.

Even the The North Valet car pickup port exhibits an interesting play with light and art.

Over all, this hotel truly is hip, luxurious, and swank, and a proud rival to the equally swank and nearby Cosmopolitan, which doesn't have a darn coffee maker in its room either.

 And it wasn't ours. 

 I pulled the sheets back and there was a handful of short hairs in the middle of the bed sheets on our FIRST NIGHT that clearly didn't belong to me or my husband. 

Called down to the front desk. Was on hold for 20 minutes before I got someone on the phone. This, mind you was already past midnight and I was on hold for that long. Please note that when we checked in that afternoon, I tried to get a hold of the front desk for something entirely different, and I also was put on hold for so long I hung up. 

Someone did come to change our sheets, and we watched her do so. She profusely apologized and explained that she was the graveyard shift and could not vouch for the day shift, but asked if we needed the tub cleaned. I looked at her and said, ""I hope not. I'm assuming that the tub is clean since we haven't used it."" I sent her on her way. Sadly I should have had her check because the shower drain was also filled with hair that wasn't ours. 

Disgusting.  It's better when it's sight unseen. You try NOT to think about who's used the amenities before you...So when there are souvenirs to let your imagination wander...shudder. (I envisioned a hairy-backed man before us since the hair in the bed was at mid sheet and not on the pillow. You catch by drift? )

Other things to note: The ""touch screen"" by the bed, while cool as an idea, turned out to be more like a JAB screen. In order for it to respond to requests, I literally had to stab at the screen several times to get a response. OVERRATED. Also, one of our light switches was completely missing its front plate. We had an exposed panel. No big deal, but how long has it remained exposed like that? Unattended?

So why even two stars? Despite the cleanliness issue,  the overall hotel experience was nice. The service we experienced was great, and while the price for everything was expensive, it separated the boys\/girls from the men\/women. Did I like paying those prices? No. Call me old, but when we sauntered over to another hotel and dealt with the drunk, loud, bachelorette, bachelor parties, we came back to our hotel and appreciated the clientele of the Aria. The high drink prices and lack of clubs on the casino floor, helps weed out some of the loud and obnoxious. 

On the plus: The attention to decor detail did not go unnoticed. Did I notice the elevator foyer consisting of embroidered leather wallpaper? Yes. Was it appreciated? Sure. Was it necessary? Probably not, but I I did notice all the ""little details"" all the way to the filler in the flower planters. 

Another cool thing is that I believe the hotel is built so there is no real bad view. We had a really nice view of the mountains and not the typical rooftop of an air conditioning unit or a parking lot. We were privy to a really nice sunset each evening. Put on one of their robes with a glass of wine in hand and enjoy.  

So, if I could, I would give two and a half stars as a nod to the overall experience of extravagant luxury and a hope that the housekeeping mishap, was just a that.",1,0,0

- The elimination of lines and wait - you get picked up at the airport and there is a private check-in with snacks and coffee available (cocktails too). The snacks and drinks are available most of the day, so if you need coffee or a quick bite, it is quite easy. The cookies were amazing and the coffee was good too.
- The bed, uh, have you ever slept in a cloud. We got home at 3:30 a.m. and the beds were to die for. We are all thinking about how we can buy one
- Huge bath tub and bathroom with the ""heated"" Japanese toilets 
- Amazing shopping if you like very high end designers - Lanvin, Miu Miu, LV, Hermes, Bottega
- The ""lobby"" is calm and not crowded with people
- The concierge is great (upon arrival my assigned concierge did not get back to me that fast every time, so they might need a little more staffing here or maybe I am high maintenance)

When my boyfriend and I checked in, we were given a low level floor that looked directly into other rooms.  We asked if they had anything else and they said they could move us to another floor with two queens instead of a king.  We went for it and as soon as we stepped into the new room I had to hold my breath because it reeked so badly of smoke.  I should have never made the first simple request.  The front desk rep on the phone told me to call back later and also that there were no smoking rooms in the hotel, yet they had just switched to non-smoking the day before (and we were asking if we wanted a smoking room when we checked in).  A few hours later we called back and after being on hold for 45 min and eventually going back and forth between the front desk and calling from our our room we finally got our room changed.  Management did give us a food\/drink credit, but I would much rather have not had two hours of hassle when I was looking forward to relaxing.

Then the TV in the room was broken and we had to call service again and needed a new cable box.

Housekeeping did not come by to clean the room the first day.  The second day I had the service sign illuminated for over 4 hours in the afternoon while we were out and it still wasn't made up by 4 pm.  I had to eventually call to schedule housekeeping.  Once they came they did do a good job.

The casinos don't smell very smoky like you smell at the other hotel.  At least it is like that for now until a couple of years.
The room are very elegant and CLEAN. when you walk into the room, the flat screen TV welcome you to the room and the curtains open for you.  Our 3 days there was fabulous!
The pools and hot spas are great and lots of people so go early to reserve your spaces. Free water for you to drink, too.
Our package came with the free buffets and the buffets aren't the best but hey it is FREE so we took advantage of it and it saved us a lot of $$$$.  Free drinks to welcome you to their hotel :-)
The downside: we had to pay a resort fee that we didn't know about, it is a long walk from the elevator to the room, and another long walk from the hotel to the strip.
Overall, the hotel isn't bad at all :-)",0,0,0

NO smoke smell on the casino floor, the room was incredibly nice, the service was nothing short of phenomenal. We did not spend much time on the casino floor here as we wanted to head out and see more of the strip. 

We had dinner up on the promenade in one of the conference rooms with our party from work. The food was great. I cannot say I have had better prime rib on the strip. We will definitely be back to stay here again in the near future.",1,0,1

First off, the service is amazing! We have stayed at several 5 star hotels and this was the best yet. They learned it was our anniversary and sent us a box of chocolates to the room.

Secondly, the amenities are fantastic. The gym is included with the resort fee. You are greeted, offered a towel and bottle of water upon your arrival . The facility is very clean and you can refill your water bottle after your work out and grab an apple for the walk back. Very nice!

We also tried several restaurants and were very happy. We went to Javier's, Bardot, and Julian Serrano and enjoyed very nice meals. All were fantastic with excellent service. 

Lastly, the pool was great. There are several pools to choose from but we always found plenty of lounge chairs and the pools never felt overly crowded. The pool drinks are a bit expensive like all Vegas pools, but we made drinks in the room before hand to enjoy and it was fine.

Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here. Especially if it's for a special occasion and they will take good care of you... Just make sure to mention it when checking in.",2,0,0

It's hard to get to, being situated waaaay back from the strip - cab ride from the Venetian was $12.50.  It smells nasty inside, something like dirty feet, but I think it's wet concrete.  It's ugly like a big empty cavern - a building as huge as Aria needs decor with huge scale, but MGM Mirage went on the cheap and it shows.  Staff are super nice but I don't think the good ones will stay because I heard staff complaining all night long.  Minimum bets at the tables were $5, which was wonderful for me but probably not a good sign for Aria.  When it was time to go I felt trapped because the idiots placed the taxi stand a full 1\/4 mile from the casino's exit.  Even though a cab had just emptied right in front of me at the exit, they told me I wasn't allowed to get it and had to hoof it all the way over to where I would be allowed to get in.

Got comped here for 3 nights. they gave us a 1 bed corner suite. The room was that contemporary style with simple looking features, but high quality. every room had a good size LCD tv with a great picture quality(living room, bedroom, main bathroom). the bathroom was beautiful: double sinks, marble everywhere, large soaking tub, steam shower, and one of those toilet seats that is heated and squirts your rear end when you are through dropping a Deuce. the entire room could be controlled by the TV remote including the automatic drapes. and all the lights. overall, very very nice.

the entire hotel is GREAT. with some great restaurants and bars. and its at a very convenient part of the street( almost the center) SO to sum it up. there is nothing wrong with this hotel. its great. BUT, i went over to the Wynn\/Encore and you just can't compare. The wynn really is in its own category, but then again its a lot more expensive.

I usually like to stay at the Mlife hotels and never had any problems while visiting. So what went wrong here was first of all the check-in took forever and my party was given the wrong information regarding the transaction. We we're suppose to be check-in at 9am, but was delayed by the person checking us in at the hotel because she gave us the wrong information and made us waste time by having us run around trying to find a Wells Fargo. Next the maid open the door during our visit when the light was clearly marked as privacy. The toilet broke and we had to wait for maintenance to come fix it. The light was flickering off and on. Also there was a red stain on one of the sheets. Finally when we checked out the lady checking us out was giving us attitude about printing a receipt. Honestly there are way better hotels then this place. Also for something that is more new to the strip compared to the other hotels it looks old in the rooms and hallways. The only reason I am giving the one star was because the Zarakana show was really good and so was the theatre it was playing in. I was just really frustrated with everything that I even took the time to do there 30min survey and explain everything that went wrong with there staff. I am so mad i even created a yelp account just so I can rate them and share this with people planning or thinking of staying at the aria. I will no longer be staying at the aria.",0,0,0

I've read some other reviews that the beds here are too soft. This, to me, is just crazy talk! They are a medium firmness with a wonderful pillowy top. I have scoliosis and if a mattress doesn't have a certain amount of 'give' it causes me numbness, pain and even migraines. In my opinion hard hotel mattresses are far too common (if I wanted that I could sleep on the floor), but if you need that extra firmness, let them know and they will modify the mattress with an extra baseboard. My husband and I have stayed at 5-star hotels all across the country and this was the best mattress I have ever slept on! The room was incredible, the shower\/tub area with the 'rain' shower was reminiscent of a spa (and I love the Citron moisturizer they provide), the city views were beautiful, and the employees were unbelievably pleasant and helpful. We arrived on a holiday weekend and the line to check in was a mile long, but everyone, (from the valet, to the bell hop, to the receptionists) showed genuine concern for our well-being.

The thing that caught me was the fact that it didn't wasn't like walking into an ashtray. Yes, you can still smell smoke from all the smokers but you could tell they were trying to keep that old smokey casino smell down. 

Rooms: This place looks modern and the rooms are modern. When you open your door the curtains open automatically and the lights\/tv turn on. You can pretty much control everything in your room from the TV (lights, temp. privacy settings). The bed is super plush and makes you just melt into the mattress. I love how they have a little data center with all the ports, connections and everything you could need for business built into their desk. 

Parking: The parking structure if kinda far away from the actual hotel and the whole layout is kinda confusing but to be honest most hotels in Vegas are like that. 

Food: They have a variety of places to choose from to eat. Everything from quick cafes to their buffet and also more upscale dining. 

Price: The rooms are a bit pricey. their lowest price is $259 I believe. My recommendation is to join their Players Club. You can get special offers for all of the MGM affiliated hotels and they offer seasonal rates which may differ from person to person.

This may have all changed.  Meeting a girlfriend in Vegas to celebrate my birthday, she chose to stay at The Aria so I stayed there too to make things easier. 

Oh, the joys of a modern hotel.  Visible and easily accessible plugs on the nightstand for my phone and Kindle.  A nightstand safe for laptops that is super easy to operate.  A nightstand control panel for damn near everything in my room. Lots of nooks and crannies for storage, suitcases, etc.  Curtains that open and close at the touch of a switch.  No more fumbling with the privacy card as it's just a push of a button.  The complimentary toiletries are NICE (nicer than the ones I brought so I may be squirreling them away for home use).

My room is quiet and the blackout curtains do a wonderful job of letting me sleep when I want to sleep.  

There are a couple areas they could improve:  

Check-in was dreadfully slow.  I probably waited in line for a half hour.  (To be fair, it was exacerbated by a five hour plane delay...I was quite tired of waiting by that point.)

As it hasn't been convenient to go shopping and buy bottled water, I've been drinking water out of the tap and it's akin to Phoenix water.  I'm reluctantly staying hydrated.  

The mini-fridge that is stocked to the gills with room for nothing else is irritating (although standard Vegas).  You can request another fridge be delivered to your room but that seems silly.  Just leave me a shelf.     

The disinfectant they use distinctly reminds me of my great grandmother's nursing home.  It's a little off putting but only because I have that association.

You don't choose the Aria if you want a family environment.  You don't choose Aria if you want a secluded getaway.  You don't choose Aria if you're on a budget.

You choose Aria because you want a fancy, modern, hip and exciting onslaught for all of your senses.  And Aria delivers.

The City Center is frigging impressive people.  It's like being in downtown Tokyo\/New York City in the middle of the LV Strip.  The buildings are SO modern and SO beautiful, you feel like you're somewhere special.  And it's NEW...which means clean and comfortable and awesome materials and textures.

The casino is bustling with activity, and is very well laid out.  Finally a casino that doesn't try to make you lost and confused so you'll end up spending more money at the tables or slots because it's easier than hunting for an exit.  Oh and the piped-in vanilla scent...Let me tell you...after a night out in Vegas, with the smoke and sweat and booze all lingering in your nostrils...when you walk in that front door and inhale vanilla...there are no words to describe what a wonderful moment that is.

The rooms...new, modern, beautiful, advanced, superb.  The touch screen control panel is brilliant (and fun to play with).  The electronics dock that allows to plug in your iPod, iPad, laptop, etc....brilliant.  The wi-fi throughout the building, finally!  Beautiful materials and textures everywhere.  Ample people space, closet space, bathroom space, etc.  The single most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, in my life.  I ALMOST didn't want to leave the bed to go to gamble\/eat\/party.

Even the service was impressive.  Every cleaning lady I passed was friendly and...get this...spoke English!  The rooms were always left spotless.

The concierge was ON POINT too.  I called ahead of my stay to set up some romantic gestures for the weekend.  Special orders, special times needed, etc.  The phone support was a pleasure to deal with, and extremely helpful.  And they nailed everything they promised me.

Maya Lin welcomed me; her 84- foot cast of the Colorado R. Is splashed and suspended over the impressive hotel reception desk.

Aria is a whimsical place, with its very lofty lobby and beautiful pieces of modern art. Lovely to stay here. Guy who checked me in was sweet: gave me a room that was on the 24th floor. Like the layout of the bathroom with the tub sitting behind the shower. Like also the fact that I can use the large flat-screen to set my alarm for curtains to open and TV to turn on in the morning. 

It's not solely the beautiful decor throughout, but features such as coffee bar near the front entrance that makes this place rock.

Aria's buffet is above the cut too. Homemade sorbet was off the charts. I tried 2 mini flavors. And the crab legs were satifsying too. Great breakfasts there as well. 

Able to enjoy the Aria theater that played the Cirque Elvis show (smaller, but nice), as well as Jean Georges across the way.

Let me start off by saying that New Years is Vegas is ALL THAT WITH SNACKS!!! It's one thing that I always wanted to do. AND I DID THAT!! First of all, this is my fave hotel in Las Vegas. And, I like it's close proximity to the Bellagio, Vdara, Cosmopolitan, Planet Hollywood, etc. 

Dining: Excellent, Expensive. The Buffet ,well it is a Buffet. Let's just say that the food is decent at the Buffet. I think that all too often ppl expect it to be like fine dining at the Buffet. Me, personally, I don't like Buffet food. So, it's not a big deal to me. I like the fact that the restaurants at the Hotel have a separate line for their Valued Mlife clients. I love that. Just as long as you are at the ""Pearl"" level and above you can go to a separate line. I always make sure to charge everything to my room. Food, drinks at the bar, etc. I also ate at the Cafe and the food was delightful (Also charged to the room, of course). I had the fried chicken and waffles which I liked. I also had some fresh fruit to go with it and some Watermelon Juice which tasted like they had just processed it in a juicer. Nothing bad for you and nothing processed. I really appreciated that, myself.

I did not do any clubs on this trip.

Ambiance: The first thing that really impressed me was the fact that the front check - in desk is located right on the Casino Floor. Everything is right there. The restaurants, the lobby front desk, the slot machines, etc. I like the idea of an open floor plan. It really works. I also appreciate the fact that the air is so fresh in the casino. I've read that they have a more modern ventilation system there. Thanks for that! I hate being in casino where they have a cloud of smoke hanging over the tables. 

Rooms: Very nice. As soon as you walk in the curtains open and the lights come on. Very comfortable bed. Everything in the room is controlled by remote control. The lights,TV, curtains, sheers, everything. Even if you lose the remote they have another one hardwired on the nightstand. And, if you are not by the nightstand you can control the curtains and the lights with buttons on the wall. You can also set the do not disturb via a button on the wall. No card to hang outside the door. I love the shower being in front of the tub (Which is very deep when you sit in it). The toilet is also enclosed behind a fog glass wall with a privacy door. 

I will also say that they have some very sexy women working there also. They must have been hand picked.",2,0,2

Hotel rooms were very reasonable at around $180 for a high floor (mid-30's.)  Very quiet in rooms and fun in the common areas.  This is the nicest and cleanest place I have stayed on the strip. The check in line was a bit long at times.  If you want your room in the morning pay for the guaranteed early check in or you may not have a room available.  This resort is outstanding! We will definitely be back!",0,0,0

The rooms are beautiful, and I love the decor.

It's a small hotel, so easy to get around.

Love LIQUID on a Friday or Saturday. It can get pricey, but it's worth it. They have much classier people then, say, Rehab or the other day parties.

The Thai restaurant, Lemongrass, was very yummy, reasonable, and many vegetarian options.

Saw Viva Elvis, loved it. BUT loved LOVE at Mirage a little better. Depends if you like Elvis or Beatles music more, but I recommend both.

Gold Bar is trying to be a little too clubby. If you want a good lounge, go down stairs to Deuces Lounge.

The room has a lot of electronics; there are controls for the lights, curtains, music, tv, and lock on the touch pad by the bed.  It took a few minutes to figure everything out, but in the end it was nice.  The bed was very comfortable and the turndown service and chocolates were a nice surprise. The hotel food options were quite expensive and I was glad we had received a $100 food credit for our stay.  We ate at buffet for both dinner and breakfast since the price of the buffet was close to the price of an entrée at one of the restaurants and it came with unlimited wine and drinks at dinner.  Both times the service and food was great.  The variety of food was extensive at both meals.  Our only complaint was the check-in and check-out procedures.  For both we encountered a long wait.

On one hand, I cannot stop raving about the contemporary rooms, however I had a bad check in experience. After waiting in a long line for check in, they said they'll text me when the room is ready. 

I waited, waited and waited until it was way past 6 and never received a text. My cell phone was running out of charge as well. I waited in line again for follow up and finally got the keys.

I had stored my bags with the bell desk and they asked me to go to the room, call the bell desk, so they can bring the bags to the room. So I go to the room and called the bell desk. Nobody picked the call, I tried tried and tried, nobody picked the call. I gave up and came down to get the bags myself. The whole experience turned out to be very frustrating.

The room was fabulous though. Everything was so chic and contemporary. With a touch screen in the nightstand, you can do everything from the bed, right from opening and closing the window drapes, turning on and off the lights, controlling the room temperature and turning on the TV.

Customer service offered us one night comped and rest @$149 in sky tower suites. The bottom line was the wife didn't like it so we won't be back. My mistake thinking Sky Tower suites was a tower of suites, like Encore, Palazzo etc. They gave us a deluxe view room which at 520 sq ft seemed small compared to Encore (our last stay). To upgrade they wanted $400 night for next size up.
Aside from the room I thought it wasn't a bad deal. There were lots of pluses from the stay. The stretch limo pick up, half a dozen people waiting outside to greet you by name and escort you in,fast pleasant check in and again escorted to the room. Choc dipped strawberries waiting and nice note from customer service.
For me the best part was the lobby, free coffee, sodas, juices, snacks 24\/7. 4-9pm the opened up the liquor cabinet. All premium stuff. Not exactly help yourself but they will pour you at least a double shot. Taking back to the room had 3 bottles figi water, 2 bottles sparking water, 2 bottles tonic, a triple shot bombay saphirre, 6 choco dipped strawberries, 3 oz blue cheese and crackers (there were a few of us).
Price that in the gift store and you can see that $149 rate enable us to skip a meal. 3rd day stay they changed policy and only wine. Taxi driver who's wife works there said their earning report just came out.
At sky tower they give you vip line pass for buffet and cafe. Great around 10:45, line very long. Not so much of a buffet fan in general as have small appetite but we did it twice for for convenience. Alaskan crab legs the big draw. Prime rib tasty. Champagne brunch good. Just never figured out why they would walk off with my glass and vanish to fill it. Hope they didn't have it on tap in the back??
Pools were really nice. Great security guard keeping the non guests out but making it fun and not looking like an asshole.
Machines were ridiculous. I barely played VP there. Payscale like 7\/5 and so tight. Drinking one beer at the bar playing slow could drop $30.
Saved playing for a trip downtown.
All architecture looks great, staff very friendly it's just that vanilla fragrance that gets sickly very quickly. Bellagio has a 'hint' of fragrance, a much better idea.
Ate at the Sky Box place next to sportsbar. Nice comfort food well done and not over priced. Had the best bloody mary ever. The use a super hot Indian chilli pepper. Has a real nice kick. ($12)

I always found them to have a cold museum, futuristic feeling and never had much urge to want to stay or explore them further. I spent the late 90's and early 2000's working at Kenneth Cole at the Forum Shops & Venetian and Prada at Bellagio, so I'm partial to the design and feel of these grand resorts. However after my 16 month son and I decided to join my wife for her business trip for 5 nights at Aria night I became a fan. As much as I prefer the smaller scale, off strip, friendliest casino of Red Rock, Aria really grew on me. 

My top things about Aria are:

-Very friendly hotel staff. Greeted 100% of the time whenever we walked by or encountered any hotel staff on the long walk to our end room from the elevator. I cannot say enough about how a friendly staff can make any property enjoyable.

-Beautiful design of hotel. The finishes of the hotel are very classy and high end.

-Friendly valet staff. Always running and offering directions. There was an older great Grandma valet person who outran all the younger valet staff. Very inspiring woman who told me stories about living in Vegas 50 years.

-Location: right in the middle of the heart of the strip. There is another overpass to west side of I-15 (Harmon) that goes from the back of Aria and Vdarra. This is a great way to get in and out of the hotel and avoid the strip traffic. Therefore o encourage the use of the north valet for ease and to be closer to you hotel elevator. There is also a tram in the hotel that runs from Monte Carlo to Bellagio.

My top negatives of Aria: 

-Small sports book. Very limited seating.

-Unfriendly dealers. I dropped a good amount of money on roulette, blackjack and high limit slots and dealers were not friendly whatsoever. Huge turn off, especially considering their table limits. Gamble elsewhere. Cocktail waitresses were friendly, but surprisingly a little older like at Caesars.

-As far as restaurants we liked the Todd English pub (do a yelp check in and get a free Corona), but Lemon Grass was flavorless and not worth the money. Room service was good but very expensive for small portions.

Overall I'd go back, but prefer Bellagio or the rooms at Venetian as far as the mega resorts.",3,1,0

Most people came Friday so we wound up with a crap room on the 3rd floor at the end of the hall.  And they ARE long  halls!  Our view was the roof of an atrium.  I complained and they moved us upstairs the next day to a MUCH better location with a view of the strip.  GREAT view.  It helps to complain.  Plus they gave us a $50 credit for the inconvenience.  

The first 3 employees we met there were less than helpful we thought, and we were afraid it was a portending of things to come.  HOWEVER I must admit, from then on everyone we met was great and super helpful.  The housekeeping was spot-on, excellent and very attentive.  The hi-tech ""smart"" room was awesome, you could control most  things from the TV remote including lights and blinds.  The bathroom was so cool we're going to use it as a model when we re-do our master at home.  Yes it's a bit contemporary, but in a bathroom I think it really works.  I'll say this, the water got hot fast but the pressure wasn't great for a new building.  But that cool smoked green glass and separate shower... very sleek.

Yes the bed is great.  But no fridge in he room other than the mini bar.  I do get sick of the cash-vacuum mentality of these resorts.  Just put a regular fridge in the room.  We're not paying $12 for a few liitle cookies, or $7 for water.

Yes the place does have a peculiar smell, or scent, about it...not bad, just different.  Maybe from all the new materials in one place.  Maybe like new car smell for a hotel.  Not sure.  Maybe they pump it in, like they pump food smells across the pool decks.  My wife thinks I am nuts but I am sure, it's intentional.  They want to sell those $20 burgers.

Yes it is a young crowd, very young.  In some cases, like the pool, TOO young.  There were lots of little kids in the first pool, but it WAS a holiday weekend.   Seemed like 1\/2 of LA was in Vegas for the weekend.  And it thinned out Tuesday, but was still really crowded in general.  We used the rear pool and it was all adults.  Much better. (I don't mean Liquid, the lounge pool that costs $$ and is filled with drunken twenty-somethings.  I mean the free pool.)

One thing we didn't like, on 2 consecutive mornings we were in the room lounging around and looked out to find the window-cleaners on a scaffold.  No warning.  One minute you're enjoyng some privacy with the sheers pulled, next minute some strangers are staring at you from 10 feet away.  They need to warn people.

DO beware, if you don't like to walk this is not the hotel for you.  It's far from the strip, and the tram doesn't save any steps.  It may actually be more, by the time you get to it.  

And I think the machines in the casino are really tight.  We didn't win anything in Aria.  Another cash vacuum.   The smaller and older properties pay better.  If you like the slots, the Aria will soak you.

Overall Aria was a good experience.  But for us, the next time we're going to stay at TI again I think.  Better overall location, more managable in size.  Rooms aren't as cool, but there's more to LV than a cool room.",1,0,0

We had been here a few times before to gamble and enjoy the bars. We had never actually stayed in one of the rooms. It was very basic. In need of updating.

I know it's the strip and it gets expensive but I didn't mind paying for the extras at the Wynn.
The hotel set up is not convenient either. I didn't see to many good reviews for the buffet so we just ordered room service for breakfast. Also the air quality is horrible! Last time we where here it smelled a lot better and that is why we would hang out here.

Aria is better than Cosmopolitan, any day.

I love Aria, (but not Haze) - it's so sparkly and it smells good. The place feels swank, yet cozy, rather than cold and impersonal (Cosmo.) It's easy to get around, unless you've never been to Vegas and you're trying to figure out parking around CIty Center - it's a mess. Signage around all of City Center, not just Aria, could be loads better - so could finding your way to the tram.

My cousin came for a visit and stayed with my aunt and uncle in one of the Sky Suites here, and therefore, I got to hang out in their suite. Holy Moly - it's so swank. The room included 2 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, a small kitchen, living room and dining room. It was like stepping into the fanciest, nicest apartment ever. The bathroom in my cousin's room was my favorite - there was a huge soaker jet tub, flanked by two separate  vanities, a steam shower and a toilet room with a fancy toilet that had a thousand, zillion buttons on it. 

The bedroom my cousin was in was huge and had remote controlled curtains that had a gorgeous, floor to ceiling view of the city. The bed was super plush, as was everything else in the room.

Although modern\/contemporary really isn't my thing, I could appreciate it for what it was - very nice. My aunt and uncle didn't really like the place but it was still super swank.

As this will be my first review, I thought I'd just explain a few things about why I'm doing this. We have the good fortune to live in Las Vegas and as such, take advantage of the large number of great restaurants and beautiful hotel rooms that the city has to offer. We will take a ""mini-vacation"" about once a month or so.
Hey, it sure beats the lines and all other crap associated with flying and also beats being stuck in traffic for hours. In the time it takes you to get to the airport or the outskirts of town, we are home. Can't beat it.
Most of my reviews will feature photos of the rooms, views that are available for those who wish to spend some time in the room and also the food & drink in both room service and restaurants. They are already posted in the ""local photos"" section of my profile. That being said, let my yelping begin.................................

I'm starting with the Aria Hotel as it seems to have really taken a beating in the reviews. Some of these may well be true, but I can only speak for our experience which was for sure, worth  4 stars I've given it.  Our experience started with meeting Jonathan who is head of security for the property. Why, might you ask. While navigating the tight confines of self parking, my hubby took out a handicapped parking sign. We waited for security and it was Jonathan who politely handled it. When I pointed out that in a row of seven signs, 5 were knocked over, it became apparent that the problem lay with the garage design. Jonathan then escorted us straight to check-in where the very efficient Cass was waiting to get us into a room. When I explained that a view and room to move about in was paramount, she took care of it with no questions. The pictures can attest to the view. The room was light and airy and the bathroom had tons of room and counterspace to spread out. Our son was in town and had arranged dinner at another property so that dinner will be covered at a later date.
The next morning we ordered up room service and it was unbelievable. The Bloody Mary's were perfect and the final mixing was left to us. I had the Belgian Waffles and Steven has Bacon and Eggs. Everything was done to pure perfection. Could not have asked for a better room or food. 

O.K. let's deal with the negatives which are mainly the casino which has been documented by many. Honestly, I don't know what they were thinking as it is very dark and small (by Vegas standards) It' also the only casino in the City Center complex. But, hey, We live here and have any time and any place to do this. As for it's being hard to navigate, if you can walk in a circle and keep going left you have mastered it. Try the MGM Grand if you want complicated. O.K. thats another story.

The Aria is nice... gorgeous building. Fantastic view. High tech amenities. Beautiful and classy rooms.

So why the 2 star review? Well... it's a 4 star building with 3 star treatment, a 2 star buffet and a 1 star nightclub. 

The room was gorgeous - though I think that after the first night, they ""cleaned"" our room but hung our dirty towels on the towel bars and didn't give us replacements. So I'm sharing a room in Vegas with my buddy and we have to play ""who's balls touched this"" on the second night at an upscale hotel?! Can't tell you how rad it is to dry off after a shower with a damp dirty towel that may or may not have been used by your friend and his balls and butt. 

The snack cabinet charges your room even if you so much as touch something or open the door. 

The bed was retarded comfortable, but I think this place had bedbugs or something because I was eaten alive.

Being a guest of the hotel gets you a healthy ""go fuck yourself"" attitude from the bouncers at Haze. 

Every time we tried to talk to someone who worked there to get some sort of service, we were met with anything but 4 or 5 star treatment. I'm easy to please, and I managed to have a good time here in spite of their best efforts to make me miserable. It was bizarre.

Their poker room was lively, but the chips were disgusting. They were so filthy and broken I didn't want to touch them. How much could a new set of chips cost? This is pretty common though. 

The worst buffet I've been to in Vegas. 

This is a beautiful hotel and I would consider staying here again if I didn't have to pay for it. Their casino is a drag and I'm not impressed by the food. Their nightclub is reason enough to avoid this entire hotel.",9,11,6

We wanted to check out the new city center so we booked a suite at the Aria.  Ditto all comments below: confusing layout (they want you to gamble),  slightly confused front desk and housekeeping staff (doesn't ""PRIVACY"" mean don't knock on the door announcing """"housekeeping!!!"""" at nine a.m.????""

Pros:
Love the super high tech rooms, it's like being in Hong Kong.  Not that hard to figure out but lots of switches and LEDs galore.  One warning, the minibar is weight based computer sensed, so if you take something out just to look at it you may be charged. Our suite was amazing.  Huge.  A main sitting area with dining table, large couch, amazing views, and a 50"" flat screen!  The bedroom was a nice size, more amazing views, a super comfortable bed, tons of down pillows and a 32"" flat screen.  Main bathroom, ""to die for"",  and I use that expression with extreme caution because it is so lame and over used. The first chamber is the WC with a high tech toilet seat, so warm and inviting with the options of back OR front bidet cleansing, oscillating or standard stream and air drying.  Americans have needed this for so long! Second chamber is a good size shower full of slippery marble and glass and one of those deceptive LEED shower heads that promise a deluge but deliver a dribble.  Then there is a deep tub with views that go on forever and another flatscreen just in case.  

Room service was tasty (only had breakfast) and very prompt.  Lots of great artwork around the property (Maya Lin, Henry Moore) but it helps to know where to look for it because this is one monstrous building.",1,0,0

The hotel is nice and modernly decorated the way I like.  Architecture is just beautifullll.  All the restaurants here were excellent, except for Cafe Vettro - beautiful decor in there but not so beautiful food :\/  See my other reviews for the restaurants here. 

We stayed for five days in a mountain view room.  I was upset at first that we didn't have a city view, but to be honest, I liked our view better than our other friend's city view.  Room service did a great job at keeping our place clean and arranging my things.  Service in general at this hotel was excellent, in my opinion.  


I do have a few faults to point out.  Some of the rooms are SUPER far away from the elevator, which is the last thing u want when u've spent the day in 5 inch heels.  I felt like our room was super small.  One of the couples in our group had a corner room and it was much bigger.  Bathroom was very nice.  Couldn't hook up my ipod for music so that kinda sucked... but it was great that they had the cable music choice channels so that saved the day!  They never could print my MLife card the entire trip, so that really sucked!! 

Anyways, I would def recommend this hotel to others at least once.  Probably upgrade to a suite though, regular rooms are toooo small.",0,0,0

However, the Aria buffet could use some tweaking.  Be prepared for some mandatory Aria fees such as the fitness center ($35 a day), room refrigerator ($25 a day), and if you're driving into Vegas a daily parking fee of $10. Since the Aria recently started charging for self parking, make sure that you take care of your parking fee before you leave the garage. You may want to also prepare for any delays that may occur upon exiting the garage. I will say that the Aria has impeccable room service and customer service in general.

It did have a great big tub in the bathroom which was perfect to relax in.


Cons: The casino is whack, doesn't shell out much winnings, and it's a bit off the strip so the spot isn't as ""popping"" as other casinos.

The room was quite nice and very high tech.  Like the rest of the hotel, decor is muted and brownish.  Walking in, the curtains open to do a reveal of the view over the strip (Bellagio is a few buildings away) and the other City Center buildings\/pool. Music started playing etc...it was actually very cool. You can customize everything and save your profile so the temperature\/music\/lighting etc will be ready for your next visit.  You can also do fun things like set your wake-up to: warm up to x temperature, gradually turn the lights up, open the curtains and play 80's pop.  Ha!
The bathtub is killer and the shower sucks...they took the water conservation shower-head a bit too far.  Products kind of suck but they'll bring you free hairspray and other extras...i.e. lots of selection.
Bed, minibar, desk, all great, room was quiet with no traffic noise so i think the windows were well sealed and built.  
The hotel is overall a bit boring...very brown and tan, someone said it felt more like the Hong Kong airport which I have never seen. It's nice, but not as cool looking as the Wynn's, Bellagio.  But, it's more relaxing too.  Kind of reminded me of a more grown-up boring Palms and THEHotel.  The lobby and common area lighting is a bit bright and not sexy.  
There were some nice looking shops, a colorful snack store, Union Bar was cool, Gold Lounge was great, City Bar too.  I'd love to try the Michal Mina restaurant...which had a wicked cool cactus garden in the hallway outside.  The casino looked appealing and not too garish or loud, very tasteful.  
The gym was nice, though the selection of cardio equipment annoyed me.  No decent ellipticals for example.  The treadmill was cool though; it had an adjustable fan to cool you off which is great in the dry weirdness of vegas.  Machines were very nice, staff was excellent.  The spa looked great though I only went in to get the fresh fruit and juice. 

Overall, I wasn't blown away but the place is classy and tasteful, probably very appealing to yuppies.  Rooms are new and very nice so if the price is right I'd definitely stay there over Venetian, Bellagio or other aging more trashed hotels.  I'll check out the nightclub Haze when it opens too.
Since we were there celebrating opening night, I received some complimentary desserts in my room.....and the chocolate creation was one of the most outrageously delicious things I have ever tasted!!  They have a really famous pastry chef with a french sounding name, and a fancy chocolate\/candy\/cake store in the casino.  The chocolate was all shaped and dusted in gold, and the white chocolate had silver glitter on it....and it was SO, so, so good that I took most of it home for my husband, which is something I NEVER do.....save leftovers let alone take them on a plane home...it was just that good!!

The food is a one star rating, their king crab was soaked with water (i had to squeeze the access water out of each leg), once you walk into the buffet, it reminds you of being in a high school criteria. 

The next day we went to""Jasmine"" at Bellagio hotel for their seafood\/dim sum  buffet. Excellent food, but pricey, $48 per person. The wait was only 30 minutes rather then the 2 hour wait at the Bellagio buffet. 

Aria's Italian restaurant-Sirio Ristorante. I give this a one and half star rating. I had the Gnocchi, boring but it filled you up.

We had a drink at ""Gold Lounge"", the two cocktail waitresses were dressed like hookers, when they sat down to serve your drinks you can see the color of their pants. They constantly were pulling their dress down because it kept showing their private parts. This is a great place if you're a guy looking for a free peep show. 

I spent the $30 to work out in their gym and sit in the jacuzzi, money well spent! They provided you with lots of water, jucies, fruit and coffee.

When I first walked into Aria, there was a nice scent of perfume in the air. That thankfully canceled the smoking from the gambling area. The decor is pleasantly pleasing to the eye, with modernist art everywhere you go. What I didn't like was the walking distance to your hotel room to the lobby. It must have been 2 miles just to get from the check in area to your hotel room. 

The room itself was ok, the beds were not that comfortable, and the toilet was separated from the shower. But my biggest gripe is the remote control for all the tv, curtains and lighting of the room. The remote is slow and takes awhile for it to response to a simple command such as changing the channel. 

The gambling room is easily walkable, with 21, barracat, and pai gow table closely aligning to each other. I can walk to the 21 table and then walk to the barracat table without walking to the other side of the casino. I must say- there was a lot of high rollers in this club with each player betting a minimum of $500. It seems my $50 is chub change in this casino. But I lost all my money, so who cares.

- It's too dark. I walked in and felt sleepy. Not a good feeling when you want to gamble. 

- Decor is modern--for now. I can easily see it being dated after only a couple of years; dark wood everywhere. I'm not sure what look or theme they were going for exactly: Dark wood and random ventilation duct covers?

- P!ss poor ventilation despite the plethora of what looked like ventilation duct covers lining random column supports and walls. For a new casino, this is inexcusable. Tobacco smoke just stays in the air, choking off the lungs of non-smokers like me. I couldn't breathe without coughing when people at the next table were smoking. I don't have this problem at the other new casino resorts (e.g., Wynn, Encore, Palazzo, Venetian, Bellagio, etc.).

- The casino cashier is tucked away behind a bunch of slot machines and a wall. Talk about inconvenient.

Upon check-in, the person helping me wasn't immediately that I had booked through the LHC website, and I had to remind them about it.  I was told that I indeed do get a late check-out (4pm), and was entitled to $100 resort food and beverage credit.

Fast forward to the day of check-out, it's 2:30pm, and room staff key-in to my room door without knocking first, and I am naked from the waist down, forcing me to uncomfortably run around behind my bed for decency and yell out that I am dressing.

Upon check-in, which was quite late into the night, my boyfriend and I were upgraded to a corner suite with a panoramic view. I have got to say that that was something. The bedroom and bathroom each had half their windows looking out at The Strip while the living room had two sides looking out. The views were just amazing.

In terms of space, well done Aria. The corner suite had 1.5 bathrooms (the master bathroom being almost the size of the bedroom itself), a mini foyer, a large living room with three sofas and a large bedroom. I was also pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the room (wasn't sure what to expect being in Vegas legally for the first time).

The location of the hotel was great too. It is right across a huge shopping center and walking distance to a number of hotels such as Bellagio, Mandarin Oriental, etc. The casino and Aria's buffet are actually some of the nicer ones in comparison to TI, Paris, Monte Carlo and a few others. Aria also houses some delicious restaurants including bar MASA, Jean Georges, Julian Serrano, and Jean Philippe Patisserie (yummy, yummy desserts!). The staff were very friendly as well. On the last day, once knowing that my boyfriend and I had a flight to catch home, the lady who helped us check out gave us front-of-the-line passes to Aria's restaurants in case we had to wait. Little actions like these really make or break a hotel's customer service quality.

In short, I really don't think I have anything negative to say about Aria from my experience! Oh, Aria is also home of Zarkana, a Cirque du Soleil show, and it is definitely one you want to see!

Cons: There are too many to write for a short review. 

Aria is anything but a luxury casino, except the price. The designers of the Aria failed to create truly a luxury casino. They couldn't even build the Harmon Tower right in which they had to implode. For a while they had the heat wave with the sun reflecting off the windows. 

My vision of luxury is beauty, art, and comfort like The Bellagio. Aria has too much concrete and asphalt. The view out of the enormous windows at the breakfast restaurant faces cactuses and valet pick up. Far from the beautiful pool area or gardens you see at other luxury casinos. 

The casino floor is lacking and design elements don't make sense. 

The resort fees are outrageous and now they charge a parking fee of $18\/day. Valet took me 28min to get my car and I had to make my way to a lower level to get there. Automated valet machines are tacky, not classy.

Which means, no twenty dollar tricks, no upgrades, no casino comps...just flat-out booking it myself, albeit through Priceline.  I do love a deal, and I did indeed get a good one.  Won this 5-star for just $85 per night for two nights.  That was just ten dollars a night more than I paid for a 3-star in Boise the night before. Just sayin'.

   LOVES:  Location!  Center strip, convenient  tram to Monte Carlo and Bellagio.  Love being in the shiny new City Center.

   Loved the room!  Having booked via a pre-paid site, I didn't expect suite miracles or incredible views.  What we got was a great 5-star quality 4th floor room.  It was clean and comfy and just plain nice-as-heck.  Certainly nicer than where we live, so we're all about appreciating it!

  QUIET...never heard neighbors...then again, maybe they were all on the higher floors with posh views and suites.  Who knows? We were quite happy with our mere mortal room.  Rest assured that if you are of the higher mortal category,  they offer different elevator bays for those staying on differing floors.  You will be whisked up quickly to your appropriate level.  We were a-ok with ours.

  Here are my reasons for not giving Aria 5-stars...when we checked in we were proudly told about the ""free internet""...We were told how easy it was to access it.  What we weren't told was that they charge a $28 a day resort fee.  I am certainly not a resort-fee virgin, but I have never encountered one before that was more than $15 per day.  Usually the purpose of the fee is to cover internet.  Well, for that kind of money, I would expect it to work like a charm and it did not.  That being said, we weren't exactly hanging around the room bemoaning our lack of internet access.  Of course we were out and about...but it's kinda the principle of the thing, ya know? How about just charging $28 more per night up front?  

  That and I'm not a fan of the casino.  Blackjack...not Bellagio level.  Plus this is the only casino we've EVER been in where a slot machine jammed.  Husband was playing and it totally stuck.  It took forever before we could find help to get it unstuck.  Here we were at 4:00 or so on a Monday afternoon and the guy who helped us indicated that the machine was ""full"".  That they cleared it out in the middle of the night.  Well, by golly that is one machine you don't want to play if it never gives up anything, huh?

   One last minor reason for less than five stars was checking out.  We couldn't get it to work on our tv.  Luckily they weren't too busy at the front desk, but the gal we had checking us out was not very friendly. Left a last not-so-great goodbye.

   All-in-all however, we would go back in a heartbeat.  Where else in this country (world) can you stay in a hotel of this caliber for this kind of money?  sigh, love Vegas!",6,1,2

From this tablet, you can open and close the blinds, adjust the temperature, adjust the lights, control the tv, order food, schedule massages, hair cuts, and more. The bathrooms were sleek and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows feel like they were seriously made out of clouds. 

However, our room was not totally clean when we checked in. There was some sticky gooey stuff on the desk which really grossed me out. Our check-in process was also frustrating because we completed the pre-check in and scheduled our time for 1:30 the day before. The day of check-in we called to confirm that time, and they said, yes our room will be ready at 1:30. When we showed up at 1:45 to check in, our room was not ready. In fact, it was not ready until 3:30. It was okay, because they have a bell hop that delivered the bags to our room for us and they sent us a text alerting us when our room was ready, but I was really frustrated because I wanted to freshen up and rest before heading out on the strip.

My hubby & I are hesitant to stay there because of some bad\/mixed reviews both from Yelpers\/Tripadvisor commentaries.  But after reading more recent reviews, I told my hubby to give it a try since I always try not to be too critical when reviewing new establishments -particularly this large--give them time to get their act together, pull the right staff, iron out kinks at least for 6-12 months.

The registration area was not dark-it's modern - different shades of gray stones, tiles and textures, wood--for this type of decor, I can understand why you do not really need very bright lights--it is part of the whole ambience--maybe that's not for all-hence, some patrons were critical of it...hey..ladies...this type of lighting is actually good for any skin tones--good for your close-ups!

We stayed there 9\/8\/10 & checked out Sunday. We were both pleasantly surprised - we did not experience long waiting to check in, friendly & helpful staff, room was pretty large-and it was just their standard - marble travertine bath floor, deep soaking tub, water pressure good in the shower and it was not hard at all to manipulate the automatic\/remote control (on the walls) for the curtains, lights-it's very intuitive and noted clearly on the wall switches. When we checked in, we also asked if we can have a view & the rep changed our room--we had a corner view right by Monte Carlo\/MGM side--it was very nice especially at night with all the lights.

We also received $200 free play--as soon as we checked in, we went down to the Player's club & obtain our Player cards..and activated our free play--guess what--I went to the dollar machine and I was winning up to $650 & then...I hit the 3 diamonds (showed up in 3 different lines-if all are in the same line..it would have been the bigger jackpot) and won the jackpot of $1200! Attendant came & gave me cash--but I did have to give my SSN--IRS jackpot report for every $1200 you win! But it was a great start...their machines appear to have a better percentage in winning more as compared to other casinos (I guess to get more patrons). Hubby played black jack tables..broke even...and later won $1500 at the Venetian! Need to mention that they also gave us $100 food or beverage credit and a free pass (so you do not line up for two of their restaurants). We never got to use the $100\/food\/beverage but they comped the two breakfast services we had when we checked out--nice!

Friday & Saturday morning, we ordered American breakfast & it arrived in less than 30 minutes! It was decent - nothing too exciting...but at least the service was very good. Our room was cleaned each day and extra towels even if we told the cleaners..we have enough.

They have 2 other buildings under contruction, in progress. But the ones that are totally completed looked very nice - those are for sale - as condos\/loft. I'm sure the prices are great right now because of the drastic downswing in the real estate there and the overall economy. You can tell that Vegas is not doing great right now--not crowded Thursday night, Friday night--unusual compared to past years when day\/night, you can't even walk or drive on the main strip.We always fly and just take the cab instead of walking to other casinos --unless of course it it's right next to where we're staying.

One complaint: The high-end shops called Crystals--Aria should open up from the casino level to get there instead of patrons having to step out --even though it's right next. They need to put more signs that Crystals is the mall--you would not have known. There are 4 or 5 good restaurants inside --but the mall's pretty empty--I hope Aria will advertise this one and like I said, provide an opening via the casino.
The patisserie Jean Philippe was wonderful --almost as good as those in Paris! It's not cheap...but you're in Vegas ..splurge a little!

We will definitely go back to this place again - I'm sure with all the comments, they will hopefully listen and improve in different areas.",1,0,0

At first, I was impressed by the grand casina, lobby, the level of customer service of the staff, the arts pieces around the resort, etc. Oh, what was really amazing is we got a $100 gift card for Crystal by booking the package via Expedia.

I think all of these are kind of expected with all the ridiculous Las Vegas hotels on the stripe. In fact, Vdara was kind of boring comparing to Aria in terms of all these.

Now, it's time for the negative.
-I was very impressed by the centralized computer control room where there's a picture frame by your night stand, connected to the room and supposedly control the lights, TV, music, curtain, temperature of the room. However, it doesn't work well. It has a big delay, so you don't even know if what you are trying to do doesn't work, or it's just slow. -The first day we were here, three of the lights in the room didn't work (floor lamp and the two reading lamp by the bed). 
-The towels feel too thin, I don't know it's just me, but it just doesn't feel normal, it feels thin! enough said.
-We went out the whole day yesterday, coming back last night and found out that the used glasses was not washed! Really?!?!
-There is no safe. Unless it's so safe that it's hiding somewhere in the room that I couldn't find it. I guess if that's the case, it's a good safe! lol..
-So, if we are paying 25 bucks daily for the 'resort fee', I am pretty unhappy about the slow internet speed. They would want to charge even more for faster speed internet, ridiculous. Also, that wonderful resort fee always includes daily newspaper, which you will have to pick up yourself. I am not even going to continue, I just feel like the fee is a  insane, but I guess that's what every hotel is doing on the stripe?
-The room is loud! We are staying at 27th floor and we are almost hear everything going on on the street. The motorcycle, the police cars, etc. Besides that, we can hear the water pipe, people talking\/walking on the hallway, it feels like the wall are almost too thin??
-The room is almost too dark even with all the lights turned on (this is after they fixed the floor lamp and reading lamp) Opening all the curtain helps, but isn't that what's lights are for?

anyway, that's about it, and I think it's a pretty big list given the standard and expectation. I will probably won't come back next time, given that other choices given",0,0,0

Check-in: 
The process was quick and easy except we were blindsided by a refundable deposit we had to make. We are already aware of daily resort fees + tax, but not the deposit. We booked our vacation package through Southwest so that was my fault for not checking Aria's website for additional fees. We were early checking in, but they have a service that holds your luggage for you so we got to explore a little while we waited for our room to be ready!

Room:
The room was beautiful! We didn't get a strip view, but the mountains and casino lights off the strip made up for it. Room service provided us with everything we needed daily. The tablet is a really cool feature to have! It controlled the temperature, lights and window shades. It was supposed to control the TV and music as well, but we never could get that to work. We had a minibar but didn't use it because of the charges we would get. I loved the shower and bathtub being connected to each other. 

Resort:
The hotel's design is absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed the pool area...I believe there are three and a hot tub, but we only used one of the pools. We really liked the tram service and we didn't feel like walking. There was a convention going on so it was a little crowded at times. We ate at the Aria Cafe which was a little pricey, but had great food and great service. The casino part was nice too, but I feel as if we spent more time at other casinos.

The awesome: The rooms are very clean and more spacious than the average hotel room. 2 nice comfortable chairs, king sized bed, sheer and black-out curtains. Everything in the room is controlled by an iPad-type system. You control the curtains, lights, TV, music, room temperature, order room service, you name  it. Very cool.

THE OBVIOUS MISSES: There is no coffee pot in the rooms! I mean come on, even Motel 6 knows you put a coffee pot in the room! The reason they don't is because they have a Starbucks franchise in the lobby. At $5 a cup, you know why they don't have a pot in the room. What stuns me, is the Starbucks line is 40 people deep. (NO JOKE, they have a roped off area to contain the lines from spilling out into the walkway!) It must be like this every day because they have 8-10 employees working behind the counter. If anyone in Aria's management bothered to talk to the guests in that line, they would learn quickly, everyone there was upset there were no coffee makers in the rooms. At least everyone I talked to was pretty unimpressed.

There is a refrigerator in the room but there is no place for personal stuff. It's packed full of $9 beers, $5 candy bars and $4 Coke's.

I understand this is a new hotel but c'mon  people! The check in lines were extremely long when we got there we didn't know what line to get into because they were doing check in and outs in ALL of the lines, which was confusing. 

Our room was available when we got there, luckily we traveled with friends and stayed in there room until ours was ready in which the a guy at the front desk made us feel as we  were special by telling us he will move us to the 54th floor when the room become available for our trouble. I was thinking the 54th floor MUST BE A SUITE!! Well...no. After  3 hrs of walking the strip, got back to the hotel and the room still wasn't ready! The lady stated she had other rooms available. When asked what was different between the rooms on each floor she said, ""Nothing, they're all the same."" So, why lie to us. The view from the room we were given was the back of another building and you barely saw the strip from the window. Waste of time. I could have taken a room that was available earlier than wait on the SAME style of room.

The second thing was the slight dispute of resort credit that was to be placed on the room for logging on there the Expedia website. The room credit was to be 100.00 but was only given 75.00. This was a problem but, I'm thinking why go through all this fighting on my wedding anniversary so, I let it go..No big deal.

The house keeping sucked! The attempt that was made to clean our room was sooo piss poor!! I have been in cheaper hotels and they changed the linen. They pulled the comforter over the unmade bed, threw the pillows back on the bed, didn't sweep, vacuum, or mop. This was totally uncalled for and definitely a mood killer on a anniversary. We had to get housekeeping back up to the room to show them the errors of there ways. The 2nd shift housekeeping supervisor was very apologetic and cleaned the room herself with another housekeeper. She explained that it was her shift that leaves the rooms like this but the first shift supervisor. The hotel even gave us a 100.00 resort credit for the inconvenience.

Right after the 2nd shift supervisor cleaned the room my wife and I thought this was okay until that next morning when I got up to use the washroom in the morning, i step on a piece of glass!! WTF!! The glass was lodged into the heel of my foot and when I pulled it out, there was blood dripping everywhere on the bathroom floor. Why am I shedding blood on my anniversary?!?! I didn't clean up the blood, I immediately called the front desk who got security involved who later found more glass pieces on the floor. There was no apology that could fix the fact that I'm gashed at this point. I haven't been compensated up to this point and was told this would take some time. This put a damper on the weekend here and feel as if I should be refunded my money for this trip. 

Do your research, read ALL the reviews and make your decision on your next trip to Vegas. I know I will!",2,1,0

I travelled with my boyfriend in late July. The hotel lobby smells like sweet vanilla and lavender, not like a typical casino. I requested a room high up and near an elevator- received it with no problem. Check in was fast and easy. 

My favorite part was the ipad-like device next to the bed which controlled the blinds, temperature, tv, and lights. best feature.

Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and nice. The rooms and bathrooms were divine! super comfortable bed and I am soo picky about linens and mattresses. The room was spacious, modern, and clean. Elevators were quick, nice and big. 

Would definitely stay here again. Best hotel on the strip in my opinion. Cosmopolitan hotel was also beautiful but i never went in to any of the rooms.

Bads:
1. Check in took 45 min, front desk person was SLOWWWWWW.....
2. Buffet was so surprisingly bad it was laughable. Lasagna was cafeteria grade...
3. Decor is boring, 50 shades of brown...
4. Bring your flashlight, the rooms are very dark, but on the plus side, it does hide the ugly decor.
5. VERY LITTLE signage.  Spent a lot of time guessing what direction.
6. Pools were remarkably dull, reminded me of a city pool.
7. Gaming area is small and unappealing.
8. Long walk to the valet, bad design
9. Hallways are like caves

Goods:
The technology in the rooms was interesting.
Very comfy beds

If you want to stay at a nice resort we suggest Wynn, Bellagio, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, in other words, anyplace other than Aria.

For the people giving this hotel great reviews, you really need to check out the other Mega resorts, they are SO MUCH BETTER",0,0,0

On the most recent visit, the TV remote was swapped with a generic one so you cannot access any of the on-screen menus with the remote so you have to use the small touch screen by the bed which is terrible.  They ended up giving me a partial credit for this which was nice. 

The mattresses and pillows at Aria are BY FAR the best I have ever had, anywhere.  It is just amazing.

The room layout is excellent - nice closet space, spacious bathrooms, and the whole automation system with the lights, curtains, tv, audio, is great.  

They charge a $25 resort fee per night which includes Wifi, gym, and other services.

The finishes overall are very high-end looking, no complaints.  They did forget to leave me soap and shampoo on my last night but I'll let that go as service has always been great besides that.

The restaurants are great and being next to Crystals you have all the shopping you need.

The Casino is pretty standard and dealers are very friendly. I play craps mostly and they have 12 tables and usually most are $10-15 and not too crowded.

One complaint is the limited breakfast options.  The Jean Philippe bakery is always packed and fairly expensive with limited seating. One tip is you can go to the other side of the Casio (past Deuce next to the Valet) and they have a small coffee shop with some of the same Jean Philippe pastries with hardly no line.

Room rates are pretty good and usually lower than other high-end properties like MGM or Bellagio. The only downside is if you come here for a trade show, there is no monorail to the convention center.",0,0,0

I was really excited about staying at the Aria, being that it's the newest hotel and in the City Center.  I have to say, it is a beautiful building, very cool looking.  They have some really cool art stores as well, that is worth the look.

I'll start with the positives:
Room is awesome!  Average size room, but the coolnest makes up for it.  If you love gadgets and high tech, this is the room for you.  Everything can be controlled from a central remote control.  Air\/Heat, TV, Lights (I mean all lights), Curtains, etc).  Also, they have a console near the TV that has a ton of inputs you could use, usb, vga, so you can plug in all your toys.

Bed, super comfy!!

Bathroom is a good size.

Elevators are really fast too.

Poker room is pretty cool looking (I did no play here though)

Wife went and saw Viva Elvis and said that was pretty good.

Nicely connected to the Monte Carlo.



The bad.....
No face towels in the room?  Only 3 towels?
The lighting fixture fell out of the ceiling in the shower and almost hit me, and when I called to complain about it, they just said oh, sorry.

Buffet, totally sucks (you can read my review on that one).

Casino is really dark, and seemed like low energy there.

Sports book, is small and kinda lame.

I heard the night club was hard to find, and the dance floor very small.

If you plan on leaving the hotel to go on the strip, it's a pain to get out of the hotel and actually on the strip.  You have to go out, up, and down and around.

Location, is just OK, but that's my personal belief.  I think if it were closer to the Bellagio\/Caesars (basically Harrah's properties) it'd be nicer, but that's minor.

So all in all, if you are about the room, then I'd stay here.  If you want to gamble, have closer access to the other casinos, and have better food, then I'd stay somewhere else.

Maybe, I'll try this place again, in 2 years, to see if they worked out all the kinks of a new place, but prob not.",0,0,0

We came to Vegas because we wanted to use our Myvegas rewards. So, considering we saved on some buffets and shows, we decided to try out Aria (one of the more high end hotels on the strip). 

My experience here was kinda meh. When we check in they kinda gave us a slight upgrade because our room wasn't ready. So, instead of a 1 king size bed room, we got a 2 queen size bed room on the third floor. Which was great until we got into our room. Everything was pretty much digital from our drapes to lights to the tv. But towards the end of the night we realize a lot of things didn't even work. Like our floor lamp and desk lamp didn't even turn on. The pull out mirror in the washroom looked pretty gross because there was like some gross stuff in the mirror and the light of that mirror didn't ever turn on. At that point, we were already too tired to care to switch rooms or anything. Not to mention that our room was pretty much close to the end of the hallway. Takes us at least a good min or 2 to walk there from the elevator. Now imagine if we were drunk. 

The good side of this hotel would be that I loved how there was a stand up shower and a tub. There was a nice casino downstairs with plenty of slot machines and tables to gamble. Not saying I did much of that either. But there was a really nice cafe called Jean Philippe patisserie right where the elevators were. They got some awesome crepes there. And this hotel is really close to Vdara making it easy for us to meet up with our friends who stayed there. Another nice thing was we got a 100 dollar gift card to the Crystal shopping mall which was located right next to Aria. That was included in our hotel rental package. Which was nice of them to offer that. 

Overall, I would come back to this hotel if there is a deal. The rooms itself looked no different from the other ones I've been to on the strip it's only nice how the hotel room is located right in the middle of the strip.",1,1,0

To this end, the Aria is a masterpiece. The building is a glass-encased wonder, with the casino and corridors open to the heavens, allowing the gorgeous Nevada sun to light the space. The natural light truly makes a difference compared to the other casinos with their harsher ambiance. The casino smells good! Not sure what they do to combat the smoke, but it is working, and the Aria smells lovely. The building is LEED certified Gold, and the designer went a long way to include unique design elements that open up the space and keep your stay a little bit greener. 

There are over 4,000 rooms in the Aria Resort, so be careful not to lose yourself or your party. Each room has a panoramic floor-to-ceiling window that provides lovely views of the mountains or the Vegas skyline. The remote controls everything from the lights to the curtains, all from the plush comfort of the bed. Ultimate comfort. The bathroom is a tad small, especially for sharing, but overall the rooms are lovely.

With all of its luxury and beauty, you expect to be treated like royalty. Or at least as well as the King's 2nd cousin twice removed. Instead, you might as well be Vegas peasantry, begging at the door of the palace. Several others have also commented that their reservations were not what they requested. We reserved 2 double-queen rooms, non-smoking. We received 2 King rooms, smoking. Apparently a 'reservation is only a request and is never guaranteed.' Well fine, but please do not charge my credit card 2 weeks in advance if you cannot guarantee me my room. And please do not treat my party as if we are making outlandish claims - you made an error, please correct it. They offered us a 3rd king room for only the first night, which was not good enough. They refunded the rooms, and we moved next door to the Monte Carlo. Although the rooms were not as nice, we were treated very well. 

The valet situation at the Aria is a little chaotic, but they valets are very friendly. Thank you to Nicholas for all of your help! The Aria is connected right to City Center, which makes for a great Vegas strip location close to delicious restaurants and shopping. There is a free art museum attached, and a supposedly beautiful pool, Liquid Pool Lounge, only for adults. Unfortunately I did not get to experience either.

I was so wrong. 

The technology in the room is clunky and not user-friendly. I'm a computer geek and the whole design is honestly annoying. I was actually really looking forward to all the features and it was really poorly designed. The rooms were also small. The only good thing I will say about it were the beds were comfortable. 

But ultimately, my real complaint was with the service. I came with my girlfriend and we only ate at restaurants at Aria during our 2 night stay. On the last night, we ate at Julian Serrano inside the casino. I came back to my room and got violently ill with food poisoning. The paramedics had to come to our room and take me to the ER on a stretcher. The doctors confirmed it was food poisoning. In the rush to get to the hospital, my wallet was left in my room. When I came back, our room had been cleaned, and my wallet which had a lot of cash in it was gone. So not only do I get sick from their food, their staff steals my wallet. And then while I'm recovering, they send an investigator to grill me on what happened. At this point, I was so out of it I didn't even realize that people often get large settlements for food poisoning, which is why they were covering their ass. 

When we were checking out, I told them about what happened, and asked if they would at least comp the extra night we had to stay because of what happened. I wasn't asking for much and my roommate who works at a high end hotel in LA said their hotel automatically comps people's stay if they have an experience like that. The manager wouldn't even come over to talk to me, they were completely cold and said you probably have a pre-existing condition and you have to file a report with security.

I went through that whole process, they strung me along for a month saying they would at least cover my medical costs (only $200 since I have insurance) and comp my stay. At the end of it, they said it was too late to reimburse me for my stay because THEY had taken so long. They had done an investigation and denied it was food poisoning. I wasn't even asking for a settlement, just some small token of apology and instead they washed their hands of it. I come to Vegas a lot, I've stayed at the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Hard Rock Hotel, Treasure Island, Monte Carlo, MGM and the Luxor and I can say without a doubt the service, treatment and overall experience at ARIA was the worst I've ever had not only in vegas but anywhere.

However, I had some gripes:

1) CASINO MUSIC. The casino played some sort of short loop of light rock all weekend. Nothing like getting all juiced to go gamble only to find yourself sitting in a dentist chair.

2) IN-ROOM MUSIC. There was no way hook up your iPod unless you bought their expensive iPod cable from the minibar. The music channels available on the entertainment system were just as bad as the music in the casino -- your choices were basically 70s, 80s, 90s, or some channel called ""Love Shack"" which played old school R&B while displaying, I kid you not, pictures of shacks.

3) BATHROOM. When traveling with friends, it's nice to have bathrooms where the toilet is sectioned off (such as at the Palazzo) to help you efficiently use your bathroom time. So we were kind of... pissed when we realized that the toilet was indeed closed off but by a transparent door. I mean we're friends, but not like that. The ventilation was also really bad. Not trying to put any of my girls on blast or anything, just saying.

4) EATING. There didn't seem to be any take-out options for eating except for the Skybox, which was pretty bad, and the Jean Claude Van Damme Patisserie which was good -- but both closed by midnight. So when you came back to the hotel late you were forced to sit down to eat at Cafe Vettro and make awkward conversation about what definitely did not happen that night.

5) HAZE. We decided to stay in-house one night and party at Haze. There were a lot of people who seemed to be having fun there, but it became apparent to us that we didn't quite belong when we saw an entire table of white boys fist pump and scream every lyric to ""Party in the USA.""

I stayed at the Aria for my Bachelorette party from May 16-19, 2013. I found this hotel online, and the pictures and reviews made it my first hotel choice. I choose to stay in a Penthouse city view, with 3 of my party attenders. 

If you reserve a penthouse they have limo pick you up from the airport and drop you off at the for no additional charge. Our limo driver was very friendly! One of my friend's flights were delayed by a few moments, but he called to verify he could wait and was very pleasant. If you stay in the penthouse or sky suites section of the hotel, you get to enter into a VIP entrance. The check in was very speedy and the concierge was very friendly! The hotel also helped get access to the night club Haze. Since we were delayed arriving, they let the promoter know to assist us with entering the club past the cutoff time. 

When I got to the room I could not believe the beautiful view of the city! I could see where Las Vegas ended and the mountains and dessert began. There were sheer curtains and dark curtains in the room, and their are buttons to open and close them and to turn the lights on and off. We had one and half bathrooms which was very convenient for the four people in my room. The full bathroom toilet heated up and was sooo amazing. The shower could be a sauna, and you could sit if you like. The view from the bathroom was amazing as well!

The hotel has an amazing lay out. I wasn't to fond of club Haze but the GOLD LOUNGE was AMAZING and a nice atmosphere if you like little smaller crowds, easy access to the bar, and GREAT DJ. I clubbed at the Gold lounge every night. I didn't gamble, but the casino didn't smell too bad of smoke, and the layout was nice. 


The hotel is like another reviewer said ""SMACK DAB in the center"" of the strip. There is also a CVS less than 5 mins away from the front entrance of the hotel. The pool area and gym was simply amazing! 

Also, my friends accidentally moved a food item off a censor in my room, but we did not eat it. I called the concierge, and the made sure i was not charged for the item. Everyone in the hotel was just so helpful and friendly! My friends thought the hotel rate was a little costly, but after our weekend stay they agreed it was WELL WORTH IT! We went to other hotels and looked around, but nothing compared to the Aria. I would def. recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Vegas looking for a relaxing and good time!",2,0,0

* We booked 2 bedrooms with 2 Queen Beds in each bedroom.  However, since Aria was oversold this weekend, they ran out of bedrooms with 2 queenbeds and we ended up with one bedroom with 2 queenbeds and one bedroom with 1 king bed.

* Our room keys kept on getting deactivated and there was no way to re-activate them unless we went to the front desk with the person who booked the room.   They were deactivated at least 3 times this past weekend!  Everytime we left the room, we would never be sure if we could get back in...

* Everytime I tried calling front desk, it would take at least 3 - 5 minutes before they picked up.

* The air conditioning in the room didn't work very well.  The lowest you could set it was 62 degrees, however, the temperature never went below 68 degrees =\/

On the plus side..

* When requested, the front desk promptly brought us three rollaway beds for no charge.  

* I left my cellphone in the room right after we had checked out.  The cleaning lady a couple doors down was kind of enough to unlock the door for me to let me fetch my cellphone! :)

* The rooms were modern and clean (except one of the girls did mention the windows were dirty..) but a bit small.",1,0,1

Our room was on the 20th floor with a nice view of city center. Everything was clean and worked well (toilet, faucets, tv). The thermostat did make a buzzing sound on and off that conveniently went away when we checked out. It wasn't loud enough to keep me awake or anything. I liked the gym - one swipe of the room card and we were in, all the equipment was nice with personal tv's and complimentary towels, water and fruit.

As a techie for work and also privately I really appreciated the all remote controlled room although the response time was a bit slow at times. I hear some older people have hated it and changed hotels because they couldn't figure out how to get anything to work though. So just a word of caution.

Rooms are very clean and I loved the Japanese style baths where the shower is combined in the same room as the soaking tub but separate where you shower and then soak in a clean bath rather than soaking in dirty bath water like American baths. I've really missed that since moving back from Japan a few years back. They could improve it by having the shower head on a hose so that the shower is easier and you don't splash as much shower water into the soaking tub but that's minor. 

The only real drawback to the room was the really dirty windows. I mean REALLY dirty. My colleague's room's windows apparently weren't dirty though.

They continue the Japanese theme with ""gambanyoku"" stone baths which started becoming popular in Japan in the mid 2000's. Didn't try that or the fitness room out because it costs $30 a day!

Everything else is expensive also with $3 sodas at the convenience store and 25 minute massages that cost $90!

The casino doesn't have a lot of energy and is a bit subdued in mood but I won $100 off of a $200 bank roll in blackjack so was happy.

Living in Los Angeles, Las Vegas has been the great escape that we consider our tempting, gypsy-like next door neighbor Who lures us in from time to time. My fiancé and I go to Las Vegas at least five times a year if not more. We usually celebrate all of our milestones there. We fell in love there, eight years ago, and for us that place is Disneyland for adults. We have so much fun. From the gambling, to the pool parties, walking around, getting lost in the magic of all of it. It's just too much fun. We like to stay at a different resort every time we go in order to have a different experience. At this rate, we've stayed at almost every resort. We spent a lot of time at Aria, gambling and dining - but we've never actually stayed there. We are platinum members with MGM so we got a really great rate for the weekend. We went there initially to celebrate my fiancé's birthday. His parents met us there as well. We had such a great time. The check-in experience was so easy. There was an option to check in online before you arrive. That way, you never had to wait in line to actually speak to a person. There is a kiosk in which you can retrieve your keys. We got up to our room, very long walk but we didn't seem to care. We were just so excited to be there. Our room was great, our room faced the pool so we could see all the excitement and fun that was happening outside. It was the perfect size room for two people. The bathroom is great. It has a tub and the shower and a toilet separate from the vanity. All of the shades and blinds are controlled by a button which is pretty neat. Also, the bed was so incredibly comfortable. No one really spends too much time in the room in Las Vegas, let's be honest so let's move onto other exciting things. We dined at so many places at the Aria and I will do Yelp reviews on all of them. Umbrella answer the dining experiences were amazing. The gambling is so fun. The casino seems nicer, newer, less smoky than the others. Which I really appreciate because the smoke really affects me. The pool parties are fun. There is Liquid, (Yelp review already posted) and also the general area pool area. We spent a lot of time there and it was so much fun. Photos below.

I ended up needing to change rooms and extend my stay, and they bent over backwards trying to make it as painless as possible given that I needed to do it past the normal checkout time.

It's lovely inside and out, and the rooms are very high tech and cool - perhaps a bit TOO high tech, since I couldn't figure out the lighting and TV system even dead sober. Whomever designed the user interface on the room system needs to go back and re-think a few things. All of the controls are ""hidden"" in the alarm clock, which is actually a touch-screen room manager, which they don't tell you when you check in. Once you figure it out, though, it's kinda cool to set your wakeup experience to be softly elevating lights, an automatic opening of the blackout drapes, and soothing music or TV.

I don't know what the beef is about the towels, but maybe they changed softener recently. I didn't notice them one way or the other. Loved the little amenities like robes that were generously sized. I could see this being a romantic spot. The best thing of all? The queen sized mattresses! I switched rooms from king to two queens, and I seriously didn't want to get out of bed the next day.

Subpar customer service. Excessive, sometimes hidden fees. Poor value for the money. It's a beautiful property with comfy beds, but we were terribly disappointed by our experience.

So: we prepaid for a room online for 2 nights through a 3rd-party company. When we arrived, they had no record of our reservation. Ok, mistakes happen, and at that point we didn't know if it was on their end or the 3rd-party company's end. So they booked us as a walk-in for one night (putting a hold on funds) and promised that their wholesale department would reach out to us the next morning to see if they could merge the two reservations or otherwise resolve everything. Meanwhile, they suggested we contact the company we booked through--which, ok, fine, except why couldn't THEY do that? We gave them all the company's contact info\/our confirmation number\/receipt, etc... why give us a job to do when you're at work and we're on vacation? But ok, whatever. This whole check-in process took over 30 minutes and we were tired and eager to drop our stuff off and start enjoying Vegas.

Next morning at 11 we still hadn't heard anything from anyone at Aria. We'd been in touch with the 3rd-party company (which is another mini-saga in itself), and they were reviewing what happened on their end. We tried to call down to the front desk to check on the status of everything--bearing in mind that with the reservations in limbo we may technically have been overstaying our checkout time for the one-night walk-in--but the room phone's speed dials were all empty. No front desk, no concierge, nothing. So I had to call their main customer service line from my cell phone, be on hold for 20-plus minutes just to get connected to the front desk. I didn't realize it would have been faster to walk all the way down there.

At this point I learned there were ""no notes"" on our reservation about the wholesale department, merging reservations, or anything else we'd discussed with the front desk person and shift manager the previous night. I heard the sentence ""there's simply nothing I can do since I don't have that information"" at least three times before the woman on the other line would do me the courtesy of checking with a manager.

Throughout this whole process, we were frequently given the line ""well you should have booked directly through us"" as though this situation were our fault. But their company chooses to wholesale extra rooms to third-party companies, so to act like they're not responsible in any way for fixing the situation is rich. 

At these prices, customer service should be impeccable. Some of the associates were clearly trying to help us, but overall the staff were very unaccommodating and there was certainly no sense of urgency there. We'd essentially paid for the same room twice at this point, but they acted like we were randos in off the street asking for free soaps. At no point did anyone offer to give us anything for our trouble--a discount, free food or drinks, nothing--until we asked ""what are you going to do for us"" multiple times. They finally gave us a food & beverage credit but acted super shitty about it. The manager we spoke to at the front desk our first morning had the nerve to pull some passive-aggressive nonsense like ""I see that you have a certain feeling about this situation, and I have a different feeling about this situation, and I'm sorry you're having those feelings..."" like instead of offering a verbal shrug, can just say ""sorry you've spent half your vacation on the phone and at the front desk?!""

We ended up getting our two nights at Aria, but at a higher price than we originally paid, and only after much stress and haggling. 

We ALSO told the front desk when we were checking out that we wanted to visit the spa before we made the drive back to LA, and they implied that even though we'd checked out, we'd be able to get the guest rate of $50\/person (rather than $100\/person), but when we got to the spa they laughed at us. We checked out literally 15 minutes earlier, haven't left the property, and suddenly your spa facilities cost $50 more? THAT'S A HARD NOPE.

Then, trying to leave the parking lot, our keycards didn't work! They'd assured us at the front desk that we'd be able to get out with them any time before midnight, but at 3pm, they were totally non-functional. The lady in charge basically let us out because she couldn't figure out what was going on and didn't want to deal with it anymore--which was a perfect mirror to how we felt about our time at Aria. 

The real kicker is that my boyfriend has two massive pending charges from them on his account: one for the hold on the room (fine), the other for REASONS NO ONE AT ARIA CAN EXPLAIN.

The room was clean, nice and we had a decent view, no upgrades, and on a low floor. 

The bathrobes were nothing special but glad the rooms had them. There were two luggage racks instead of one like most hotels. This was a huge plus for us.

Hear me out. Because I've never interacted with anyone as block-headed.

I dropped my valet ticket at a restaurant in the CityCenter, and because the restaurant couldn't find the ticket, we tried to call the valet to make sure no one else takes the car. We asked if the attendant could make a note on the car we described (color, make, license, and owner provided) to make sure if someone comes for the car, they'd have to match the car registration to my id. That ways, a random person would not be able to pick up the car, a reasonable safeguard. 

However, the attendant explained that he will not leave a note for us. we would have to come asap and be present with an ID that matches the registration. Unless we do that, anyone that comes with the ticket will be able to pick up the car. Because whomever holds the ticket has rights to the car.

How is that safe for all you customers who valet your cars? ARIA, THINK about this!

Even when I tried to explain that leaving a note to only let the registered car owner pick up the car is the safest guard, and also the same as requesting us to show up with matching IDs, the attendant INSISTED that I could be a fraud, so he won't be able to leave a note. -- HOW could I be a fraud if I'm only letting the 'registered owner' pick up the car?

Please 'like' if you feel this is logical! -- We should let ARIA know so they protect us when we valet and trust them with our cars. 

Tks! Lets use the Power of Yelp to make positive change!",8,0,1

Talk about making a impression, upon arriving at Aria, you roll pass the mandarin oriental only to be greeted by a football field wide cascading water fall facade in the front of the hotel with a miniature Bellagio Esq. fountain spewing neon light colored water 20 feet high in the air. Though not yet complete, City Center is remarkable, the amount of money that was put into this place only begs the question how the FCUK will they ever make there money back.. Anyway enough about that.. The lobby of this hotel is massive, the check in area is easy to find. Though I waited about ten minutes to be attended to (this being a holiday weekend) the staff at this hotel is extremely friendly and much effort was put into properly training this classy motley crew. My room located on the 8th floor(low! c'mon bad enough they only gave me a king when I specifically requested two queens, one to sleep the other to freak on) was extremely nice. Very new and modern, the electric curtains\/shades and the majority of the room were nicely finished. Large bathroom with his and her sinks, the shower was located in a separate directly connected to the bathtub, definitely a unusual set up but perfect to use when you take home that dancer from Spearmint Rhino. Nice flat screen TV that offered a wide array of HD Channels, definitely came in handy when I was hung-over watching the Jets clinch a playoff spot that Sunday. Everything in the room can be turned off\/on right from either the TV remote or the screen located next to the bed. Speaking of which, the bed here was large and comfortable, perfect to slay on. Also my room was quiet during all times of the day, it also provided more than enough closet space to store my few belongings. 

My complaints-No IPod dock, i.e. this must catering to the family only hotel, not the drug snorting 20-30 something crowd I hangout with. Had to play Pandora on my blackberry while getting my freak on in because the music channels offered on TV was absolutely terrible.
The water in the sinks seemed to spray like a waterpik teeth cleaning machine, the shower head was weird and didn't spray properly either.
At the restaurants you will get charged for a refill of diet coke, not cheap but c'mon, flat fountain soda shouldn't be 4 bucks for a little refill action. Prices at the hotel restaurants were expensive. The fitness center at 30 a day is a total rip off unless you use the spa(more about that below). The taxi cab line can get out of control at night and the ventilation on the casino floor makes for one of the smokiest on the strip. 

My compliments- In two nights I managed to slay two dancers while slaying at this hotel. Nice array of bars and high end restaurants downstairs. The fitness center is the sickest I have seen in all of Vegas. Better than most urban gyms. Brand new cardio machines and a wide array of free weights. As for the spa, everyone here gets there own monster locker with sandals and a robe, best sauna & steam room. The shower area was private and large so one is comfortable and not concerned with Lance dropping his face over your shower door.  Stocked with beverages and fruits (make sure to load up a nondescript plastic bag with whatever your hotel room is lacking) along with a lacking of Harvey milks patrolling the locker room also helped. Also the clubs & shopping mall provide a wide selection and nice variety",2,10,0

Shockingly bad - starting with the most miserable valet on earth who would not let us stop the car closer to the hotel entrance so we wouldn't have to cross the giant tarmac wasteland of the driveway with baby in tow, ""because that lane is for taxis"" - mind you, there were zero taxis there at the time- none, in fact there were no other cars anywhere in sight... to the high and mighty supposed hotel manager himself who decided to school us on how to communicate with him, asking us to say ""please""!!?  His problem was this: when we made the reservation back in LA we were told that cribs are available for kids upon request.  Turns out it wasn't a crib at all but a small play pen - completely impractical for sleeping.  A supposed luxury resort did not have a single full sized crib anywhere - so complete misinformation given during the reservation process.  And he was bent out of shape because we were annoyed about this obvious inconvenience.  Idiot.

This was the beginning of a slippery slope where everything basically ended up being one kind of disaster or another.  From the Buffet underestimating demand on Labor Day and keeping people waiting outside in long LOOOOONG queues while there were dozens of vacant tables available inside, presumably without servers, to the fact that we dropped over $2,000 on 2 rooms that were supposed to be adjacent to each other but in fact ended up having another room in between!

One of the bathrooms had plumbing issues and stank to high heavens the entire weekend.  The digital privacy sign was not working for the same room so we had to leave a handwritten note for housekeeping instead.  Apparently they do not provide roll-away beds for queen sized rooms because it's a supposed violation of the fire code- again, not something we were aware of ahead of time... The Aria Café food was really mediocre; service was ridiculously rushed and frazzled.

Basically nothing lived up to the name.  Back in LA, when I expressed our horror to a friend and mentioned how I thought Aria was supposed to be great- she scoffed and said ""ummm yeah, for conferences!!""  So there you have it.   We chose to stay here because of the location and because I swore off our usual hotel, the Monte Carlo, which has pretty much turned into motel 6 in recent years, and is currently under construction.

In the end we got the resort fee taken off for one night for all the inconveniences.  As I have complained endlessly about this - this is basically a bullshit fee hotels have introduced for no reason at all other than to refund it back to you in case of complaints, so hardly doing us a favor.

For how much it cost us, the whole experience was infuriatingly disappointing on every level; the only way I would stay there again is if everything was comped.  And next year I'm heading back to the (hopefully) newly remodeled, and my formerly beloved, Monte Carlo with my tail between my legs!",3,0,0

After years of staying, playing, shopping, and dining there, I'll never comeback and will encourage my family and friends to do the same as well.

After a few years, your typical Vegas-strip hotel starts to look like a Motel-6 with a Cirque du Soleil show, slot machines, and a mall.

When I have to go, I try to stay in a newer place.  Thus, I've stayed in the Aria.  It's only a few years old, still smells nice, and the rooms are still somewhat fresh (you just don't want to think much about what has gone on in there before you ever booked the room).

The pool is large, and they have an adults only pool, which is really just a night-club with loud music, college students, and booze.  

The restaurants are one of the shining points of the Aria.  Bar Masa is fantastic, as is Sirio.  Everything else rates as very good.  

As with all Vegas hotels, the people watching is interesting, and there will be things that you just can't un-see, but overall the crowd is more upscale than say the Hard Rock or The Palms.

Maybe because it's one of the newer ones, but I will admit I like their ambiance. The location is great, it's right by City Center where all the shopping happens.  

The buffet needs improvement but it's not too bad.

Jean Phillipe's restaurant has delicious foods and pastries, but their logistics on how the lines work should be changed, we waited forever for a few croissant sandwiches. 

Their pools are pretty cool, there's the family end and the Liquid Lounge area for the 21+ who wants to party in the sun and drink all day. 

All casinos spray these fragrant air into the room to get people to want to gamble, I'd say I like the fragrance Aria chose, whatever it is. Their busy carpets are also suppose to get people to keep their eyes up on the slot machines to gamble, which didn't work for me. I'm glad to say that Aria's busy carpet isn't as gaudy as some of the other casinos.

The hotel itself is pretty remarkable. Its design, size and everything about it makes for an interesting experience. I have stayed there twice - the first time for the grand opening and now again most recently the first weekend in December 2010 - about a year later. On my last stay I was looking forward to see if there were any visible changes or improvements since my first trip. Unfortunately, there really weren't any. 

For a high tech hotel, the reservation and check-in process seems slow and tedious. I had booked my room through Casino Marketing and upon arrival, the front desk seemed to know little about my reservation. It was supposed to be a comp room - they had $130 per night. I had requested two double beds and was told that it would be requested - but they couldn't guarantee it - up to the front desk. So we got there around noon to check in early to try to ensure that there would be doubles available. They were - but the desk said it was an extra $30 a night and asked if that was OK. I said no, it wasn't because when I made the reservation, nothing was said about a possible charge for two queen beds versus one king. The charge was waived and it worked out - but none of it should have been an issue to begin with. 

After check-in, I also realized that nothing had been said about my two comp buffet meals and my 2 for 1 show tickets. So I had to check with Casino Marketing on that. Those too ended up getting done, but only because I took the time to inquire. 

As for the room - on my first visit it was kind of cool to open the door and have a dark room suddenly brighten up in front of your eyes as the curtains began to open by themselves! Not this time though. In fact, the pitch black room experience at night from the first visit wasn't the same on visit number two - the end of the curtain appeared broken and light came in from the top of the curtain as well. 

The light between the beds never did work - with two bulbs it likely was broken and not burnt out bulbs. One evening, my brother awoke during the middle of the night and while half asleep hit a button on the remote that turned on several lights momentarily, then all turned off except for reading lamps above my bed. Who knows why? Then I tried to turn those off at the master switch - but ended up turning all the lights on at first. Bottom line is that to effectively use the room, it takes quite awhile to acclimate to the technology - longer than it's worth messing with. And there's often no telling that if something doesn't work because the user isn't working the tech right or if certain things are just out of order, period. 

The latch on the sliding door to the bathroom was broken - nothing in the wall to receive it. Kind of unusual for a one-year old hotel. There was no immediate information in the room about Internet access and if there were charges. There is a charge - about $15 a day - which for a technology laden hotel seems kind of hypocritical. Why does a place like this nickel and dime on that? When I was checking out after my last visit, there were probably close to 200 people waiting to check in (seriously). And the line was going nowhere fast - that shouldn't happen at a ""high-tech"" hotel.

I enjoy Aria for its design, location, the fact that a friend works in one of the restaurants and it's casino (though I dislike the ongoing shuffle machines at the black jack tables). I'd gladly stay again at a comp or discounted rate. But if I had to pay the full rack rate, I'd pass. Would rather put the money on the tables and not have to work so hard to figure out the room technology.  I'll stay at another MGM property instead.",0,0,0

They more than made up for it with a comped room in the Aria. First of all you are treated like royalty when you arrive by the Bell staff. Side note, if you do use the hotel bell staff, and I recomended you do because of the size of the property, be prepared to tip often. When you are checking in and checking out your luggage will be touched by 2 different people which means tipping twice for one bag, but like I said it is worth it. On to check in. I recomended mobile check in. You should recieve an email from the hotel the day you arrive offering the chance to check in online. This saves a ton of time as you only have to walk up to a kiosk and scan a QR code on your phone to recieve your room key. Now for the room. I only have one word, Immaculate. Everything from the thermostat, to the window shades, to the TV, and even every single light in the room can be controlled from an iPad like device on the nightstand. Our room had a wonderful view of the South strip and we awoke with a view of the New York, New York Skyline from our bed. A highpoint in the room was the bathroom. There is a large soaking tub located inside the shower, meaning that the shower feels like it is huge since the fourth wall is on the other side of the tub. Really the only issue I had while I was there, and it's really so trivial that I'm not about to change my rating, but one of the last bellmen that we encountered at the valet was rather dismissive and seemed like he couldn't be bothered. I went up to him with my luggage claim ticket and he said I needed to go to the valet stand first. So I went to the valet stand. The lady at the valet stand said, ""Have you given your luggage ticket to the bell desk?"" I said, ""No, he said to see you first."" She said, ""OK, take it back to him now."" So I did and he still didn't want the ticket, he said I needed to wait until my car was pulled around, all the while being very dismissive. I feel like if a guest wants his luggage, you should go get it when he asks for it. We had an appointment to get to and I didn't want to have to wait for my luggage once my car was pulled around. Everyone else waiting for their car already had their luggage. So after 3 or 4 minutes I went back to the bell desk and a different man was happy to help me. As a result he made the $50 that the first guy missed out on.

4 no boiler provide!!!!!!! How come 5 star hotel is no boiler to provide? If I have baby, I have to use boiler! If I feel cold, I have to drink some warm drinks! Why 5 star hotel not provide boiler for guest? Or have to pay extra fee then get the boiler!? 

5. My two friends also have chocolate box on bed in their two rooms!!!! They just booked regular rooms..... Why that day was my birthday, I didn't get anything? Sigh!",0,2,0

Other reasons why I loved my stay here:
+ cleaner air than other hotels\/casinos
+ high-tech rooms (open\/close blinds, control room temperature, lighting etc. using a tablet right from the comfort of your bed. You can also press ""goodnight"" and the entire room will go to sleep LOL)
+ warm and friendly housekeeping service
+ fast elevators organized by floor (omg every tall building needs to have this)
+ Al and Lisa on the casino floor were absolute angels, as were the girls who kept bringing us drinks as we threw money into the slots
+ conveniently located next to the Cosmo (where Marquee and Secret Pizza are) and kitty corner from Planet Hollywood (lots of cheap food options here!)
+ only a $12 uber ride away from the airport 

Wish list items (personal preference):
1. While the bed was comfy, I do wish it were more firm 
2. Wish the shower heads had more pressure
3. I know we visited in the winter months, but it would have been nice if the pools were open after 4 pm
4. The toilet is in its own little private area in the bathroom which was nice for when a group of us was getting ready in the bathroom, but that makes me wonder why the shower area isn't in an opaque area as well...",4,1,0

The lobby is BEAUTIFUL, smells like vanilla, and several times when I've walked in, Oasis started playing. Anyone who knows me knows I have an unhealthy obsession with Oasis, so that alone was magical serendipity and sold me on the place pretty quickly. 

Okay so, the rooms. Let's start with the beds. The wonderful, cloud-like heavenly beds. You can buy all the bedding if you have a few thousand dollars to spare, which I don't, but someday. The lights, curtains, music, etc are all controllable from an iPad-like device next to your bed which is great because like I said, the beds are heaven and you won't want to ever leave it. But if you do have to leave the bed to shower or something, you're rewarded with a beautiful bathroom with a monster huge soaking tub. Ahhh so nice.

I wish I could give an opinion on the restaurants there, but I only ate at one and it was really late at night and I was pretty drunk so I don't remember much but I'm pretty sure it was great.

The pools, and there are 3 or 4 of them, are really nice. There's an adults-only pool club party...thing but it looked full of skinny tan attractive girls, all of which I am not so I stayed away because attractive people intimidate me. So I was happy to lounge by the pool with the rest of the average-looking people.

I'm sure I'm forgetting something but to sum it up, the Aria is beautiful and magical and you should stay there.",1,4,2

I needed a charger at 8:00pm and they said once the clock strikes 9pm they are charging me another $8. Total joke 

Issue #2. I called ahead of time to ask if they had a heavy bag at the gym. They said yes and that they also provided gloves. Pretty awesome right? No. Once I got to the gym they wouldn't let me touch the heavy bag unless I signed up for one of their silly cardio kick boxing classes...naturally this was an additional fee not covered in the resort fee.

Also- mattresses are awesome so it's a good sleep, room is controlled through a remote or light switches, and when they bring your bags up they also bring ice. Winning!

Of course checking in was quite busy, but that's Vegas. The young woman, Angela, that waited on us was very professional and friendly. As a matter of fact, since we had waited so long for her to check us in (we were early), she upgraded us to a larger suite than the one we had reserved, AND gave us a $50 resort credit for food and\/or drink. It was beautiful.

The entire time we stayed there, any of our interactions with the staff were stellar, from the room service to the concierge to the front desk staff.

We loved the size of the Casino. I'm not a fan of the Bellagio and Caesar's because they are WAY too large. The Aria has all the same amenities and I can actually find my husband at the tables if we get separated. 

We had lunch at the tapas place there one day and it was very enjoyable. However, we weren't too thrilled with the Mexican restaurant in the hotel, Javier's. It was VERY noisy as the music being piped in was just a bit too loud. We actually could barely talk to each other over the noise. Honestly while the food was good, it wasn't THAT good.

Todd English P.U.B., which is right next door in the Crystals, is fantastic. So just go there and you can still charge to your room.

From the moment we arrived the bellhop greeted us with sincerity and thanked us for choosing Aria. I barely had time to step out of our SUV service from LAS and already felt an incredible warm welcome. There was a short line at check in that moved quickly. Pam checked us in and oriented us to the property since it is our first stay. She was so polite and sweet. She graciously allowed us to check in early and upgraded our room for free because it was our first time here and she wanted us to have a great experience. Our stay includes 2 free breakfast or lunch buffets per day which we are definitely going use. Our room is gorgeous. The 15th floor with an amazing strip view. Thank you Pam for doing that. I called bellhop to bring our bags up, he was here in maybe 3-4 minutes and asked if we needed anything else or wanted a tour of the room tablet controls. He kindly went and filled our ice bucket as requested. We are definitely going to stay here again and we already booked our stay for Route 91 festival later this year at Aria... I am so glad we did. It's so refreshing to be treated with such great customer service and sincerity. I wish more hotels on the strip were as polite and welcoming to guest.

UPDATE*** Best Buffet I have had in Vegas!!! The line was long but since we have M Life pearl\/gold we were allowed to skip the line! It's a really nice perk of the rewards program! We had the breakfast buffet our first day and lunch the second day. The service and food was excellent each time.

It was true; the concierge was excellent.  My husband forgot his US power adapter for his electric razor.  With one call, the concierge delivered it directly to the room. 

The room itself has all the high tech stuff to seduce you into staying in it way too long to play with all the wonderful toys.  Guys will love it.

Casino:  My party easily dropped... well, way too much money on day one, however some of the dealers were borderline rude.  We headed to the Monte Carlo to continue gambling for the rest of the weekend.  (They were much nicer)  I was told my party would have been assigned a handler at a different casino with the cash we were bleeding out, but apparently Aria is a Dubai owned casino and they give zero F***s.  The pit bosses don't rate you well on tables (go to Mandalay Bay for that), but the drink service on the floor was okay.

Pools:  After several failed attempts to flag down a waitress, I got up to purchase drinks at the bar.  I left my new husband at a poker tournament in the more friendly gambling atmosphere of the Monte Carlo.  Everyone's attention is geared toward the World Cup or the racket in the Day Club.

My 40th birthday celebration, we arrived and were able to check in early. Cons on check in: It is very slow, the signage to the rooms is poor and the vanilla scent is overwhelming.

The Jean Phillipe Patisserie in the lobby was dangerously good. Amazing chocolate croissant, truffles, gelato and sandwiches.

The room (corner suite) was sweet! Floor to ceiling windows, separate bedroom and living room, remote that controls blinds, alarm, lights, Jacuzzi tub overlooking the strip, and they were replacing our comforter as we checked in. That is rare! In room amenity was chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate dipped macaroons.  

I loved the room (2 bathrooms!) but had to leave to go to the spa (poor me). What a treat! The massage was great (Mitch rocked), the facilities are huge. There is a salt room with pulsing music, a hot rock bed area, lots of chilled water and juice, snacks, and every toiletry from toothbrushes and toothpaste to hair spray and brushes. The jacuzzi overlooking the Liquid Lounge was well appointed but I have to question the placement. Thumping bass and bikini clad ladies dancing on a platform are hardly spa material.

Let me start by saying that Aria is beautiful. Really, really beautiful. All that said, this started as a comped MLife trip that I expected to pay resort fees on. No biggie. However, when we first booked we added on early check in\/late checkout for our standard room. Shortly after we received an offer for a ""discounted"" upgrade to a tower suite. 

We were told there was no late check in or check out option available. No problem, we can kill time in the casino or outside the strip driving around.

Everything started going downhill on day 2 when we talked to a Tower Suites Rep to get Cirque Du Soleil Tickets. We asked her to charge my other card and not the one on file. She said that would be fine and when we checked out that option would be given to us. That's a lie. They always charge the card on file and no option will be given to you.

In the morning we went to the buffet and I asked to use my MLife Resort Credit. I was told I had to visit the concierge and my bill would be adjusted at the end for my trip. I stupidly let the woman swipe my MLife card and still gave her cash for the full amount. On my bill she still charged me $13.16 and I was told the $50 resort credit had been applied. Guess she pocketed that money. 

Then on our last night we decided to do last minute shopping and returned very late. Our phone records can verify we called down at approximately 130 am to ask for a possible noon (instead of 11 am) checkout. I was told that we would receive a 3 pm checkout and it was part of our reservation. I immediately asked if there was an additional charge because if so, noon would be fine. I was again assured this would not be the case (another lie... it's almost $100.)

Last, we had a Hudson News bag we carry all of our travel gear (including two battery backups, headphones, etc) by our nightstand the entire trip. We arrived to the airport to find out headphone cases completely empty and missing two sets of $200 Beats Wireless Headphones along with our emergency $100 bills we had in each case as we do not typically carry cash on us.

Now I'm stuck with an almost $900 bill of which half of it is stuff I never authorized or wanted on a different card. And I'm out $600 in my own persona property. 

I couldn't be more disappointed. I've called Aria about issues with the bill and received the run around. I hate to spoil my amazing relationship with MLife over this but this is nuts.

Last thing of note, be sure to write down the name, last name, social security and ID number of every employee you talk to. Otherwise they'll talk down to you like you're lying. You know, because why should you ever trust the staff at the hotel you're staying at? 

I'm not trying to get some kind of handout out of this. Truthfully I'm just furious and disappointed. The parent company of the business I work for has used Aria for their gigantic multi brand conference in the past and you can guarantee I will fight tooth and nail to make sure that never happens again though.

If you come by your own car, you will have to transfer all your luggage by your own quite a long distance to the hotel lobby. When we arrived, there was a 15 minutes queue at the check-in. However, the check-in service was efficient, and so was the express check-out, which you can perform either by an sms message, email our using your TV set. You can leave the room keys in the room, and just leave. Very efficient.

Our room (we booked the cheapest one available) was located in the 22nd floor with a beautiful view over the Strip. The rooms are well preserved, spatious, comfortable and fully automated. The interior design is minimalistic and very pleasant.

There are a lot of dining options within the complex, for different budgets. Perhaps the most problematic is the breakfast, especially if you just wish to eat something light, and a full buffet breakfast is too heavy for you. In this case the room-service breakfast seems to be the best solution.

1st Visit - Read my first Review.
2nd Visit - Better than my first visit 3.5 \/ 5 Stars
3rd Visit - Did not have a higher floor available. Requested in advanced, was offered a 4th Floor Room. Front desk gave me a handicap room at a higher floor and said it was the same as the other rooms minus the tub. It was very misleading, because the bathroom was smaller because it did not have a double sink. I had to change room the next day. --- 3 \/ 5 Stars.

Most Recent Visit - You're probably wondering why I keep coming back. The only reason why I keep coming back is because the Casino is paying for my room and it is the nicest free room I have available to me. 

+Checked in Friday Morning at 12:30 A.M and was still able to get a 52nd Floor Room
+Valet Parking was extremely efficent and friendly. They even opened my girlfriend's door. First time anyone has ever done this!
+Fast Check-ins. The first 2 visits were so slow. Insanely slow, but this time, it was so smooth. Check-ins as fast as Encore.
+Service Staff - Bumping into staff members in previous stays were awkward. All the hallway staff members greeted me & were very sincere.
+Casino hosts were very understanding. Some of my comp hours weren't accounted for (because the stupid Pai Gow pit boss had something against me). She took care of it and gave me some Food & Beverage comp.

The only complaint I have was the Pai Gow pit bosses. They didn't like me very much, I know their names too. My session wasn't compensated correctly. Thanks to a White guy name Matt and the other gentleman named James. James actually fixed part of my play time for me, but not all of it. I knew Matt was out to get me. Seriously FU Matt.

It was a quick trip to Vegas, but I was excited about trying something new for a change. I've stayed at many of the hotels on the strip incl Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, TI, Mirage, Encore, Wynn, but hadn't ventured to the city center hotels. Since a lot has already been said about Aria, I'll just quickly list out some things I remember.

Pros:
- Very new and modern, especially the rooms. They aren't the biggest in size, but they are clean and I like the robes, texture of the bath towels (yes I'm weird), and how there are his and her closets
- Blossom restaurant was the highlight of the weekend. It's a more pricey asian restaurant, but the service, quality of food, and taste were impeccable. I would come back to Aria just to eat here again. Make sure you make reservations early though!
- Fitness room is really nice, clean, and provides free water and towels. It's a bit of a trek to get to, however.
- self parking is available. it's on the opposite side of the lobby\/check-in, so if you have lots of stuff and you don't want to valet, maybe drop off the ppl\/luggage first and then park (FYI - you enter the self park FROM the strip and then it will be on your left).

Cons:
- A little dark overall. The entire casino\/hotel is not very bright and airy, which can feel slightly depressing (at least to me). My favorite hotel is Encore, so if you've been to both, you know why I'm saying this.
- Our room was REALLY far from the elevator. Like almost laughable. I tried to time it once and I think it took 2 minutes to walk to the elevator. This was really annoying. I don't know if this applies to most, few, some rooms but this was bothersome to me, especially in 5 inch heels ;)
- the ""black out"" curtains weren't actually BLACK OUT. NOOOOOOOOO. Nothing worse than waking up after a night out in Vegas to a line of bright daylight peeking through the top of your curtains. 
- the curtains broke during our stay. someone came up about 30 min later to fix it, but it was still annoying. 
- if you receive a resort credit, be prepared to wait to get to actually use it. whenever you use it, they need to call a special person to ""approve"" the credit and when we ate lunch, we had to wait 15 min b\/c the person wasn't picking up the phone. if you're going to give the credit, that's nice and fine, but don't make it inconvenient to use.
- the WORST: LIGHT SWITCHES IN THE ROOM DONT WORK WELL! You have to press the buttons like 5 times to get anything to work and then they don't do what you want, green and blue lights mean something. but it was the most annoying thing i've ever seen. good idea, but horrible execution.",7,6,2

I called in advance and spoke to the wholesale department and they said our reservations were linked; although they couldn't confirm that we would have connecting rooms they would make sure we were on the same floor. 

When we arrived at the hotel we were told that rooms were first come first serve unless we arrived before check in, which one of the girls did. We checked in right at check in time and we were told we couldn't be on the same floors, even though we followed their instructions exactly. For 40 minutes we were sent from person to person until the very rude front desk manager, Leslie, begrudgingly agreed to assist us. 

The girl that had already checked in had to move her belongings but still wait while they cleaned the new room. Then they called to tell us the room was ready and they would send up security with keys. He arrived, but without keys. So then we had to wait again for house keeping. It was nearly 5 pm when we finally got our rooms. 

Although I do appreciate that they were able to accommodate us I expect far superior service for a hotel that charges $375 per night for a room. 

Also, the carpet and bed spreads had stains and there was mold on the shower ceiling. It is an inferior property. When I was much younger we often stayed at the Imperial Palace. It is 10 times better in cleanliness and customer service than the Aria.",2,0,0

Room: The decor is very modern and the rooms were decorated nicely.  Everything was at the control of your fingertips from the lights to the window shades.  However, we uncovered the blankets to find bed crumbs in the sheets.  We had to call housekeeping to get the sheets changed out. Our room faced the strip and during the day I could see into our next door neighbors room and the building right in front of us (I'm not sure the name of it).  You would think they'd have tinted windows.  I wonder who was staring back into our room?!?!

Dining:  They need to up the quality and lower the pricing.  We spent $500+ at BarMasa and had to go out for sandwiches two hours later.  It was funny because we were on the tables playing when the gentleman next to us started complaining about all the restaurants in the hotel. He soon enough got to BarMasa and said that it felt like he was eating in the airport waiting area. He had a point there. I didn't mind the food soo much but the portions were tiny.  My favorite dish was the $68 beef sukiyaki w\/ foie gras which I enjoyed.    We tried both the Cafe and the buffet for for breakfast and dinner.  You're better off at the buffet, it's the same pricing after just ordering one drink and an entree.

Seriously, we had one of the FASTEST check-ins (read: no line on a Friday afternoon) ever. But I can't give this place 5 stars because...

One bedroom suite:
- No balcony
- No pull out sofa
- Cramped living room area
- 2 bathrooms with only ONE shower (but the master bathroom was freakin' gorgeous, and had a pretty big tv positioned next to the tub)
- I hate when technology fails--and Aria's rooms are armed to the teeth with techy stuff. From the light switches, curtains, etc. Too many remote controls...too much partying...short tempers...basically, a bad combo. Our main tv and media hub was broke even after TWO tech guys ""fixed"" the problem.
- Hallways are SUPER RIDICULOUSLY long...it look almost 3 mins of walking from the elevator to the our room.

But the hotel has a bunch of food options, is pretty, has a decent enough club downstairs (Haze, which is good for a night you're not trying to go balls to the walls in Vegas) and doesn't smell or look like grimy Vegas...so me likey but a bit too expensive for the likes of me.",6,6,4

The building is very very big and difficult to get around. It felt a little too secluded from the rest of the strip, even though in theory it's right next to many other places, it takes forever to walk out of the resort to the actual strip. 

I also felt very nickel and dimed during our stay, but maybe this is just Vegas. You cannot use the fridge in your room. If you do put anything inside of it you will be charged $25\/day. There are sensors inside the fridge so if you touch anything inside of it, you will be charged. You also cannot touch any of the snacks on the table because they too have sensors and are insanely overpriced ($30 for chocolate). They do have a note next to the fridge and snacks that indicate this, so thankfully we didn't get swindled. 

There was no coffee pot in the room, so you had to buy extremely overpriced coffee from their restaurants. Honestly, when you pay this much for a room you expect to at least have coffee available in the room and access to the fridge. 

We ordered room service one night and the food was not the best and really over priced. 

The mattress in our room was very soft, so we didn't sleep very well. But if you enjoy softer mattresses you'll be fine.

My friends and I reserved two rooms (both with two queen beds), one for Friday to Monday and the other from Saturday to Monday. 
When I arrived late Friday night at approximately 11:30 pm, the wait lines to check-in were long and people walking away were not pleased-- I would soon find out why. After being in line for 30 minutes, I was then told my reserved room with two beds was no longer available, they've sold out of them for the night. 

When I told the lady at the desk that I was confirmed for a room with two queen beds, I was told very rudely that the reservation agent was incorrect and no such thing took place but that they'd give me a city view and provide a roll away bed free of charge. 

When I ask how this happened, I'm told if you want the rooms with two beds, you need to show up early and check- in, even if you have a confirmation.  I'm also told we'll be placed on their priority list to get the room with two beds on Saturday--which never happened.

Upon check-out, after waiting another 30 minutes,  we were over charged for the room and then charged an extra $30.00\/night for the city view, despite not having asked for it but given it because they didn't have my room! The second room I had reserved on Saturday went off without a hitch, but we were charged an amount that was not quoted when I booked the reservation upon check-out. When I protested, I was told that again, the reservation agent who booked the hotel was wrong and to move on.

I called today and lo and behold, the rate I was quoted on the phone was listed on the reservation which of course is considerably less than what they sent me packing with. 

The hotel overall is actually very pretty, nice and modern. I thought that the rooms were a little small, especially when compared to the suites at the Palazzo. The remote controlled room is pretty cool too but sometimes the touch-screen stuck and it took me forever to change a channel on the tv.  The pool area was nice and the sports bar had really good food for the price.

The hotel is gorgeous and I love the restaurants they had to offer.

The only problem I had was at one of the bars- one of the bartenders was BEYOND rude and condescending. I did something I've NEVER done before and that was to speak with his manager.

The manager apologized for his rudeness and offered a free round of drinks for my friend and me- which I politely declined because that's NOT the reason why I complained.

Other than that minor bad experience, I had a lot of fun here.

Haze is a great club- a bit pricey- even for vegas- (Cmon 18 dollars for a jager shot?) and the pool is an equally fun place to hang out. Both the club and pool play great music.

I didn't think too much about this place and would have given it 3 stars, but after my recent stay at the Cosmo, my appreciation for Aria raised its ratings. 

My initial opinion of this place was that it appears they were trying too hard but fell a little short. There were so many little blemishes on the property that I'd never noticed elsewhere. Such as the hardware on the padded, embroidered walls (which were unique by the way) were screwed on so tight that the indentations were  extremely noticeable. It took away the beauty of the walls. The drawers in the room had really bad scratches, which I thought was strange to see in such a fairly new building. A long, orange power cord was left in the room, in plain sight. These and a few of other little things seem petty, I know. However, they were noticeable enough to grab my attention as I never cared to inspect such things (the wall thing sounds ridiculous but trust me, it'll catch your eyes). 

The one thing that I took for granted until I stayed at the Cosmo was the modern technology. Hallelujah! Everything was controlled via a touchscreen remote control\/pad. I can turn off the lights and blinds at once with ease. 

The decor of the room was decent, I don't recall being blown away, but I wasn't disappointed either. Everything was standard\/expected of a 5-star hotel such as double sinks with granite top, secluded toilet, and stand up shower - with seats!

For me, my over all experience is so lop sided, with much unacceptable disappointment. So here we go folks... I will detail the gory details as we go along. I know many follow my adventures, so you know I have review something on my own experience and nothing more.

The over-all property is magnificent. Blah blah blah, you can read all about the details from the other reviewers.

My suite was nice, but certainly not amazing, not unbelievable, and the infamous OMG...love love...zzzz. No. the 2 bedroom penthouse is ok, well appointed. Anyone can find  more opulent and certainly with better value in Vegas. 

The staff is professional but somewhat under trained pertaining to the restaurants, amenities, even down to how to get from point A to B. Well in advanced I had detailed expectations with the staff. Their lack of personal knowledge, especially with the Aria's sub par restaurants, basically created a stressful crappy experience for myself and my party. 

Their Breakfast restaurant the Aria Cafe was astonishingly bad. When a server states and explains why their coffee is Tepid at best, ""we know the coffee is served improperly and its should be hotter"" well really? How about the foods obviously cooked in advance only to ""die"" on some warming tray, drying out to a brick like substance? How about Chicken served so bland that it was left almost in totality and again the server ignore the obvious? Water Melon Juice which lacks flavor? Why are you serving food like this? 

How about their ""highly suggested"" Buffet which was on the same level as a ""Golden Coral"" hole? Do not eat at the Aria Buffet, its just lousy, ill prepared food with very limited options. How about a the Concierge (a repeated let down) who didn't know how to handle even the most basic question such as does the hotel have Safety Deposit Boxes for use of their guests?

The weakness and the total is with the Concierge Staff. Great professional appearance as long as a guest doesn't ask for their honest suggestions regarding Restaurants etc. Instead of offering opinions based on merit, gee the staff seems to be always in love with ""Aria's in house restaurants."" When asked after numerous lousy culinary experiences, more detailed and pointed questions, the Staff of the Sky Suite Concierge staff states, ""well I haven't eaten there but.."" but what? You suggest a place to eat and you have not eaten there yourselves? 

I for one will try to stay at an alternative in the future, My guests had too many mediocre meals and then worse meals at the ARIA. Strictly on the surface, the ARIA is beautiful, but for the over-all experience, this was a disappointment.

We had to go through multiple levels, walk through the entire casino....there was a lot of walking. We had about a 5-10 minute wait to check-in. Staff was friendly, and since she saw that we had brought our own beverages she sent up a refrigerator for our drinks (there is a mini bar fridge in the room but there's no room for your own things in it, and because it's weighted you can't take their items out unless you plan to pay for them). I believe having a refrigerator sent up is normally charged, but since I had told them when booking my reservation that it was my husband's birthday, she gave it to us complimentary. That was nice.

It was another long walk to our hotel room. The place is huge, so be prepared to walk a lot just to get around the resort. Our room was a king deluxe and almost had the feel of a suite. Lots of space, huge window with decent view (not a strip view, but could still see part of the strip, the pools, mountains, etc). We were on the 22nd floor. It looks cool at night when the pools and other hotels are lit up. The room had chairs, mini bar, nice closet\/dressing area, and I loved the bathroom. The shower had a jacuzzi in it, which was very nice...typical of a large luxury bathroom you'd get in a suite. Not sure if the regular king rooms are like that, but the king deluxe is worth it for the bathroom you get. The hotel feels very new and modern, but doesn't feel super luxurious overall. I wish it had more of a high class feel, since it's not the cheapest hotel on the strip.

We tried happy hour at Sirio, the Italian place in Aria. It was pretty good and had excellent service. I heard the food at Aria was very good and that seemed to be true. Also tried the fitness center, which was nice, and the pool\/hot tub area....too cold to use the pool, but the hot tubs were nice. I was shocked they close at 4pm...they look so nice all lit up in the dark, it would be nice to use them in the evening. We got room service one morning and, though there was a 50 minute wait, it was awesome. They brought in a large round table with full linens, and the breakfast was delicious. It wasn't your typical room service on a tray - they really went all out in that department.

Check-out was quicker than check in, and went smoothly. Everything on our bill was correct, including the correct beverages we had from the mini bar. No issues. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Aria. It was clean, new and modern. The food was good, room service was great, and the location is excellent. My only gripes are that it's so large that you really have to walk around a lot and if you forget something in your room - well, forget it, because it's a trip to go back and get it. I think I may try a different hotel next time I'm in Vegas, but for someone who hasn't been to Aria yet, I'd recommend giving it a try.",3,0,0

     This resort definitely is not kid friendly because my kids were just looking at the buddha statue at the main gate and we had security came over to make sure my kids don't do anything to the statue.  
     The Control 4, room control unit, that controls all the lights, music, tv, curtains, and clock were very frustrated to use.  When we first used it is was fine until we click more than once on some functions.  From there on every function on the control was mal-funtioned.  The music, tv, light, and curtain just turned on and moved at will at 3 a.m. on our first night there.   It was very frustrating !!!!  From there on nothing else worked, all the way to our last night staying there.  We read about other people comments about the room control, we felt their frustration, too.  
     The room mini bar was also annoying because one little touch of the item  will automatic bill to your guest portfolio.  I had to call to have the charge taken off.

During our recent trip we decided to venture beyond Flamingo and stay at a nicer resort for a couple of nights.

Aria's service is top notch.  You are greeted upon checking in, staff is there to ensure check in\/out is quick, efficient and all your questions are answered to your satisfaction.  The casino is nice, a bit dark, but quite nice.  Not as smokey as other casinos - most likely better filters.  Great restaurants and shops around as well!

The room - oh the room! Upon entering the shades automatically are drawn open to reveal a view of the majestic strip. Flashing lights, tall buildings.... heaven!

Lights, tv, curtains - everything is controlled by a computerized control panel next to the bed.  Pretty high tech if you ask me.  Bed is one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on!

Great rooms, great service, everything was first class.  Complimentary Limo rides from\/to the airport was a blast for the kids (included if you are staying at Sky Suites). :)

The only negative during our stay - I booked a poolside cabana for the day ($200) and it would have been perfect except our water cooling spray thing wasn't working.  It took over 3 hrs and multiple requests before it was fixed for the row of cabanas we were in.  Very annoying.  They did take off $100 from our charge, but only after I asked for it.

I'm not a high roller so I had to pay for the rooms and so on, but all in all I was happy with the overall experience for my group (except for the cabana thing noted above).  If you are looking to get a little of that high roller experience without having to spend thousands of dollars per night or lose a crapload of money at the tables :), I would highly recommend the Aria Sky Suites.

I like the patisserie and that my husband found a betting ticket here once that hooked us up with some cash, but other than that, I'm just not a fan.  I've tried to be, but it's dark and it's usually hot, often perfumey and the ceiling is too low - like an old casino.

Zarkana plays here and it is not my favorite show.

It's connected to Crystals which is kind of fun to see... once, but it's so pricey that its not like I can really shop there.

I was not impressed by Five 50, which we visited for our free pizza and beer offer from My Vegas.  Cheap crappy beer does not really entice me to return, so as advertising that offer was a fail.

And, the worst thing.  I always lose when I gamble here.  I know, it's gambling.  We usually lose, right?  But, here I have had the very worst luck EVER.  It's plain brutal.  I just don't really want to go here.

First impression - resort seems nice enough. Room was nice, but annoying. If i wanted the TV on, I'd turn it on. Don't turn it on for me. Same with the curtains. Smart rooms? Just because you can - doesn't mean you should. But hey - maybe some people like that?

Bottom line - the wifi was useless for the conference. Barely even usable in my room. Can't use the fridge without paying for another one. Don't even think about touching any of the minibar items or you'll be charged 12 bucks for that water. The bathroom hardly had any plugs and had a nasty stain on the floor (i'm thinking dead hooker).

The kicker? I had an extra purse, hidden in the closet in my room. In a concealed pocket in this purse, hidden in another bag, inside my closet, was some cash. 2nd day into my stay - went to grab my extra cash. Annnnnnnd it was gone.

Told security. they were nice enough. Said they were going to ""investigate"". they questioned *me* up and down - like I was the one who stole the money. Today I received the ""results"" of their investigation that basically stated I was at fault for leaving money in my room and that the money was ""never turned in to lost and found"" so therefore could not give me my money back. 

Yep. God forbid, I expect some level of security in a hotel room I'm paying for. Not that I *ever* expected to be reimbursed - but to be told it was my fault? Sorry. Completely inappropriate and utterly devoid of any professionalism. There was no ""hey, we're so so sorry. Want us to get your cab fare to the airport? How about a 20% voucher for some food? Maybe half off your next stay with us?"" Not an apology, not an offer of anything to ease the fact that I felt kind of violated. 

If you go? Don't trust a soul. Certainly not housekeeping or security.  If it doesn't fit in their safe (which, by the way, is apparently inside one of the 12 dresser drawers - I looked for one but never found it in any of the normal safe-places in the hundreds of hotels i've stayed in) - then don't bring it.

To sum ARIA up:
-Check in is easy, the lines are long like everywhere else in Vegas, but they handle it very well.
-Rooms are comfortable, clean, and up to date. Very tech friendly. They have USB ports available to charge multiple items at once, and your Fire stick will work on their TVs if you feel the need to bring it.
-Guest room bathrooms are spotless from floor to ceiling. Housekeeping does an excellent job during your stay and comes 2x a day. If you miss the morning, they will be back.
-We walked through every inch of the hotel that was available to us, and everything was impeccable. If you bother to check your in-room tablet, they do leave guests messages occasionally. Ours warned us that they were in the middle of updating\/remodeling parts of the hotel and apologized for how it may look during this time period. I saw a few complaints in other reviews, and this is probably what they saw.
-Security is very prominent and all staff in this hotel is ready to assist you if needed.
-The casino is the busiest we went to throughout the hotels. It is busier than the Bellagio, Vdara, New York New York, and Monte Carlo. It is also cleaner than others and very well taken care of. Do not expect to have a quiet casino night. Cocktail waitresses are always nearby and there is always something open for you to use, as the casino floor is pretty vast.
-All the restaurants we tried were delicious (Lemongrass, Jean Phillipe, Aria Cafe, the Buffet, and room service).
-I would not recommend bringing kids here, but if you absolutely have to stay here and bring them, there is a game room available upstairs, and I believe it charges by the hour. I'm not sure if an adult has to be present or not.
-This hotel is amazing and I think people overlook it because the Bellagio is nearby. From our experience - ARIA has a lot over the Bellagio, especially in activities, decor, and general attitudes. We did not meet one ARIA employee who seemed grumpy or miserable for our entire stay. Every single employee we passed at any given time said hello.
-The walls are thick and the only thing you will hear is the occasional loud drunkie passing your room in the hallway. Even then, it is very muffled.
-ARIA Express Tram is free to use to go to Bellagio, Crystals, or the Monte Carlo.
-If you absolutely have to have a view, call them ahead of time and ask for a strip view. It may cost extra. Our room faced the Cosmopolitan and a few other hotels and it was still beautiful.

The lady at check in said she could upgrade us to a Sky Suite for $60.00 per night more which I accepted. She told me our room would be ready shortly and we will receive a text when it will be ready. 3 hours later I received a text that our room is ready. Keep in mind that regular check in is at 3pm and we didn't get to our room till 4pm was disappointing but we had fun gambling in the mean time. We were only in the room for maybe 30 minutes before the door bell rang and the gentleman at the door told us they forgot to restock the mini fridge and he would like to re stock it. What a wonderful way to spark the mood for my wife's birthday evening... Now I've waited 3 hours for my ""upgraded room"" and they forgot to restock the fridge. I can still look past that!  My wife wanted to go to the gym prior to going to dinner since we had a 7pm reservation at Julian Serrano. I went to shower while she was working out so she could have the restroom after she returned. When I walked into the shower I noticed the tub wasn't cleaned and had paper towels still in it from the maid. I called housekeeping and ask them to come and re clean the tub as I'm sure my wife wanted a bath during our stay. After showering I went to brush my teeth at which point the sink backed up and didn't drain... So I called again told them now my wife who is at the gym is going to be coming back to what is suppose to be a  5 star room with a dirty tub and sink full of dirty water. I was frustrated spoke with a supervisor who apologized and gave me a $50.00 dollar food credit. In my opinion I should have been refunded the who upgrade cost - because lets face it, whats the point of upgrading at this point... We went to dinner and had a great dinner. We came back into the room and we were laying in of the queen beds when we realized the light switched the controlled the reading lights over the bed are wired backwards. Terrific!

I picked the Aria because of its location and the fact that none of us had stayed there before. Overall, we had a nice stay.

Check-in and check-out were really easy; upon arrival on Friday night at 9:30 pm, there was no one in line, so I was able to be helped immediately. A few minutes later and I would have been in a 10 person deep line which is still not that bad by Vegas standards. Check-out can be done from the room, or by dropping keys off at the front desk. The guest room elevators are not a far walk from the front desk and not that hard to find - do make sure to have your room key ready to show to the security near the elevators.

Upon entering the room, be ready for the lights to come on, curtains to open, soft music to play, and for the TV to have your name on it. They are all nice little touches, especially at night when you see the Strip light up as the curtains open. Our room, 14006, was a little hike from the elevators, but by the end of the our stay, it didn't seem that bad. The beds in the room were super comfortable and we melted into them at the end of every night. The bathroom is a good size, complete with double sinks, shower with soaking tub, and a toilet behind a frosted door. The shower was huge which made little things like shaving my legs really easy since I had plenty of room to spread out.

During our stay at the Aria, we had dinner at Julian Serrano (see separate review), partied for a few hours at Haze (see separate review), had drinks at The Deuce Lounge, and of course gambled. The Jean Philippe Patisserie (located right outside the guest elevators) looked amazing, but I resisted temptation and didn't indulge in any sweets.

Be warned that the Aria is huge, so we definitely got turned around a few times. Also the taxi stand is not right outside the doors  near the front desk - you actually need to walk about 180 degrees on the sidewalk to the taxi stand. It was a tad confusing at first and, personally, not the best design. Also there is nothing that really just wowed me about the property while walking around like The Cosmopolitan does. I wasn't blown away by the Aria which is why it only gets 4 stars from me. If I couldn't stay at the Cosmopolitan on a future Vegas trip, Aria would be one of my next choices.",2,1,1

I came back two weeks ago and had reserved a Deluxe City View. The view was great, however the hotel room, not so much.  

Let's see....

Two lamps weren't working - assuming burnt bulbs. 
It took 5 attempts to log onto the wifi for a $24 fee.
The cordless phone didn't work. 
I used the iron to touch up a shirt and rust came out of the steam and stained my shirt. 
The curtains didn't close all the way - and didn't realize till the next morning with the sun came shining in at 6 am.

I then two days later got an email asking me to review the hotel - I gave all the feedback above and received an email from Brooke apologizing and offering me a corner suite upgrade on my next visit.  So... I called last night and the number she gave me is only open M-F 8-5, and if you call other than those hours - speak to the front desk manager. I then called back and asked - spoke to Jonathan - and was informed that's not the usual upgrade and he could offer me a City View Room and nothing more. I read him the note and he said sorry - can't extend the upgrade for your arrival on Monday.

I'm shocked, disappointed, and appalled at the treatment - they made a bad experience worse. I am a CEO and if any of my employees were to handle a customer like this - they'd be in training ASAP to ensure they could do better the next time.

The Aria is so big and have many other customers and high rollers to tend to, I guess they don't care about the single reservation guy.  Well, I put on events for up to 10,000 guests at a time all around the world. They've secured that I'll not be using the Aria for any of my client events moving forward.",15,1,1

I really like the buttons around the bed to open\/close the curtains. Little green lights on each light switch so you know where they are in the middle of darkness.

The bed and pillow is a bit too soft for me but I still got a very good sleep.

The major issue is noise. I stayed on the 20th floor but I can hear car with big muffler or bikes cruising down the strip. My room is next to the housekeeping office and the staff likes to talk with the door open. I wish they can use better materials to sound proof the room.

I ate at the Tetsu Teppanyaki restaurant is the food is excellent. The Jean Philipe Bakery right next to the room-access elevators serves crepes, sandwichs, salads, coffee and everything you need for a quick meal. And the chocolate (though overpriced) is very nice.

I didn't play in the casino since I don't gamble but I feel this hotel has much less people smoking compared to others. $15 min for blackjack or roulette bet seems to be the norm there.",0,0,0

Stunning windows, views.

Cons:
I think they need to iron out the kinks in their booking system because the room that was given to my parents was overbooked, and it just looks bad...you make your trek to hot-ass Vegas wanting to relax in your room the moment you check in, only to find out that someone is already in there?

Our room bathroom was strange because the shower and bath tub were next to each other. The toilet had a door but it's class so you can see pretty much everything. 
 The hotel rates are probably 2nd tier after Cosmo and it's right next to Cosmopolitan which is pretty close to the center of the strip. 
This hotel offers new technology in the rooms such as tablet controlled lights, curtains, tv, and etc. I really did not like the curtain design in the room, the window area offers a good view but it's angled in the right corner and the curtain doesn't close all the way. This really bothered us because we want as little light in the room in the morning as possible but it was too bright in the room to sleep in.

This had been my second time staying at the Aria, both times for work. 

My first impression, during my first stay, was that the property was very clean, the rooms were spacious, I especially loved the shower\/tub combo in the rooms, and the in room technology. 

During the second stay this past July, exactly one year later, I felt as though the property could have used a little TLC. Not quite as clean, just overall needed some updating, renovation etc. The one thing that really stands out in my mind as being unacceptable is the constant sewer, fishy odor that is overwhelming as you walk past the buffet on the promenade, or as you take the escalator up from the casino level to the promenade... The smell is truly disgusting, and I can't imagine why the staff hasn't addressed it. 

Ok, so now onto why exactly I felt compelled to write this review. Having been there for work, I had little down time to gamble, and I do love to gamble!  After redeeming a slot winnings voucher at the ticket redemption ATM, I quickly turned my back for a second after the machine dispensed my cash--realizing seconds later that someone had walked by and stolen the money!  Luckily, a slot host was walking by moments after this happened and I alerted her as to what happened. She quickly called security surveillance who confirmed that two men, behind me, were seen on camera taking the money.... 

From that point, I was passed off to the security team, who had me fill out incident reports, and very matter of factly let me know that the likelihood of recovering my money was not guaranteed, which I had appreciated so I avoided any false hope. 

After about 45 minutes of chatting with security, I returned to my room. 

Nearly 4 hours later at 2:30\/3am my room phone rang, it was security...letting me know they had apprehended the two individuals and recovered my money, they asked if they could deliver it to my room...and so they did!  

I really had no expectations of getting the money back, and really had no faith in the security team.... I was wrong!  I am very thankful that they helped me out and were willing to do that for a hotel guest...so thankful in fact that I ended up giving all that money back....Hahahaha!",2,0,1

As far as I understand, Aria is one of the newer hotels and has a great location on the Vegas Strip. We were within walking distance to most of the major attractions and points of interest. For those unaware, Aria sits slightly back off the strip between The Cosmopolitan and Monte Carlo and is across the street from Planet Hollywood. 

Due to our delayed flight, we were very late checking in (like midnight or later). The check-in was quick and easy and all the staff were friendly. When we walked into the room, I was surprised as to how nice it actually was (not that I expected it to be bad). I wondered if we hadn't been upgraded since our room was larger than expected and had a large glassed in shower and soaking tub. 

The hotel has tons of restaurants, shops and bars to choose from. The casino was huge and had all the games you would expect to see. 

The decor is very artistic with a blend of many different styles but doesn't have a 'theme' as most of the other hotels. It just has a museum of modern art feel to it. Our room also was one of the most technologically advanced rooms I have ever seen. Everything from the lights, TV, air conditioning, and even the curtains are all controlled remotely from an iPad like device. The hotel also seems really well built because I didn't hear a single noise from any of the surrounding neighbors. Also, the bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel room. 

My only complaint really is about the resort fees. They are mentioned only in the fine print and are a great way to screw guests out of an extra $35 a day. Unfortunately, fees like this are becoming so common and lots of places are doing it.",9,0,2

PRO's:
+ GORGEOUS rooms; sleek, modern, super clean
+ Power-activated curtains!  One button will open or close the curtains for you!
+ ""Goodnight"" button turns off ALL the lights in the room with just one push
+ Tub area connected to the shower area so you don't have to worry about overflowing the tub for bubble baths\/soaking!
+ Two sinks in the bathroom!
+ Security guard before entrance to elevators
+ Separate elevators for different sets of floors
+ Tons of good options for food and shopping downstairs (including my fave, Jean Phillipe Patisserie!!!!)
+ Casino hardly smells like smoke

I've also heard the pool and workout facilities are fab, but didn't get the chance to check it out myself :(.

CON's:
- Its location pulls towards the south side of the Strip, aka not super central
- Cost.  Luckily we got the room comped, but it's on the more expensive side for Strip hotels.  Not unjustifiable though!
- Bathroom is pretty small, especially compared to ones I'm used to in Planet Hollywood and Venetian\/Palazzo
- Parking situation.  The driveway into the parking structure\/hotel is super short and like 5 lanes wide, so to change multiple lanes while dodging taxis can be scary.  Also, when you enter the parking structure you have to make a very sharp left turn, else you'll bump a sharp, cornered median.  Luckily it's lit up to warn motorists!

on a Sunday. We were given a free room through the program with Hyatt which was great-signed up. They told us it was a six-star hotel. We parked vallet-per night is expensive. We 
went to our room with our own luggage on the 21st floor facing the parking lot and the front view. The room was not clean, bathtub\/shower was very strange--room was low ceilings and odd that the hall way leading from the elevator to the room was littered with garbage. I noticed this and said something that night to the concierge about the hall and room not being that clean. I woke up the next morning and found that the hall was still night clean-- had the day out of the room with a spa morning- my wife refused to go as being if the room and hallways were dirty-the spa she did not want to take a chance. I called again about all and nothing was done. We went to hear music and a show that night and came back and the hallway was still lettered with garbage from the same day. I called again as we were going to leave that night and night stay at the hotel for the free second night. Beware of free nights--they are not free. We had a terrible time-the dinner at the MASA's fancy bar restaurant--over $220 was good for very little portions (I do not think they will last at this hotel). We actually enjoyed Milos at the Cosmopolitan Hotel within walking distance for lunch (worth the pre-fix lunch). As we checked out the next morning, I complained about the room and hallway again for the fifth time that still was dirty from the Sunday-Tuesday morning checkout.  I would have taken a vacuum myself and done something to clean the hallway. Well, I wrote to the hotel about this eperience-they offered a free upgrade to a suite if I came back on another trip. They cannot get me to step foot inside that hotel ever again-it's run so poorly, no one pays attention to the details, and the hotel and casino are run poorly throughout.

Aria's buffet only saving grace lies in its taste of sweet. I really liked the grand Marnier cream puff. Sugar-free desserts (chocolate gelato, key lime pie) were scarce but good.

There isn't even enough words to describe the HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE I had with your hotel. About 2 weeks ago I went onto your website and booked a hotel room for a ONE NIGHT STAY on June 28-29 2017 for the Deluxe Strip View Queen. When I booked it, I added a 3rd person knowing that it was an ADDITIONAL $30. On top of that I added on a LATE GUARANTEED CHECKOUT for an additional $30. The room was priced for $197.20 and there was an additional ~$40 resort fee that was charged. So upon booking the RESERVATION TOTAL WAS $301.82 and the amount I paid online was $223.59 leaving the estimated balance due upon check in left at $78.23. ACCORDING TO YOUR POLICY YOU GUYS ALLOW CHECK IN AT 3PM AND NO EARLIER. However, I got out of work around 9:00 PM on June 28 in California and did not make it to Vegas Aria Hotel until 3:00 AM on June 29th (WHICH IS 12 HOURS AFTER THE ROOM WAS SUPPOSEDLY ALREADY PREPPED FOR CHECK IN). Before arrival (around 10:00 PM) I called the hotel and spoke with one of the staff asking them if they were able to remove the 3rd additional person from the pricing because they were unable to make it that night. The person to whom I spoke with said of course and that it was not a problem and they will remove the $30 additional charged. So at this point instead of paying ~$300 it should have dropped to ~$270. So after a long and exhausting drive we finally arrived at Aria's Hotel at 3:00 AM. We parked at the self-parking for a $20 fee which was acceptable since every hotel charges now. So we took our luggage and went to the front desk and was welcomingly greeted by GUILLERMO\/GULLIERMO. He reviewed all the charges and at one point I had to stop him because he hasn't dropped the 3rd person fee which slightly frustrated me because I had called in advance to get it all figured out. He spoke with his manager whose name is VICTOR (he works the night shift at the hotel) and Victor agreed to remove the $30 fee and dropped it down to $270 and was able to provide us with a late checkout of 3:00 PM the following day. So at this point I was handed the room key and as my boyfriend and I went up to the 5th floor to our room, we found out that THE CLEANING PEOPLE WERE STILL DOING ROOM SERVICE AND THE ROOM WAS NOT EVEN DONE CLEANING AND HAD ANOTHER 30 MINUTES UNTIL IT WAS DONE. At this point I WAS FURIOUS because I paid $270 for a room that was SUPPOSED TO BE READY BY 3:00 PM BUT NOW IT IS 12 HOURS AFTER CHECK IN AND THE ROOM STILL WASN'T READY!!!! WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON WITH THE HOTEL?! I came back down to Guillermo and he got a hold of Victor again and at this point Victor spoke on the phone with me & apoligize for the inconvenience that had happened however this was THE LAST BEDROOM AVAILABLE IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL (WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!?! YOUR WEBSITE STATES THAT YOU HAVE ~4,000 ROOMS BUT APPARENTLY THERE IS ONLY ONE LEFT?!?!) and that we would have to wait. So in order to make it up to us he said that he would remove the $20 self parking fee, $40 resort fee, $30 late checkout fee and that we would pay the flat rate for the room which was 100% below the price of $200. I agreed with the deal and waited 30 minutes for the room to be ready. I only settled to waiting because he agreed to drop all the additional fees that was added. I WAS NOT GOING TO PAY $270 to have the room for less than 12 HOURS WHEN I BOOKED IT FOR A FULL 24 HOURS!!!!! (I DIDNT MAKE IT THERE UNTIL 3AM BUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE I EVEN GOT THERE) So we went up to the room and everything was great until the next morning when we had to checkout at 2:45 PM and the PRICE READS $197.20 PLUS TAX $26.39 WHICH EQUALS $223.59. SOOOOOOOO AT THIS POINT I WAS LIKE WAIT A MINUTE WHY THE HECK AM I PAYING ABOVE $200 WHEN MANAGER VICTOR DIRECTLY SPOKE WITH ME LAST NIGHT REMOVING ALL THE FEES AND THAT I WOULD ONLY PAY THE RATE FOR THE ROOM. I was extremely upset at this point because I spent an hour at the hotel check in last night and now I have to waste more time figuring this out?!?!?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I then got in line and was able to speak with SPENCER, who tried to help me out and called his manager and checked to see what was going on. However, he was unable to make any changes and was firm that the price was $223.59 and that he was unable to remove any taxes charged. Of course I was not okay with this because VICTOR directly told me he would remove all fees and only charge me the room in and of itself. I demanded to speak with a manager and instead of coming over solve the problem. She approached us with ATTITUDE. HER NAME WAS NATASHA!!!!!! She was very rude and disrespectful. What I don't understand is that it was very obvious that your hotel messed up multiple times ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT THE ROOM WASN'T READY AT 3AM (A FULL 12 HOURS AFTER THE ALLOWED CHECK IN TIME) and yet they refused to remove a small fee.",0,0,0

The Aria was one of my favorite places to stay in Las Vegas, but the quality of customer service has reached such a low, that I don't feel comfortable staying there anymore. 

Have you ever met a really beautiful woman that was rude, demanding and abusive? Then you'll understand the Aria. An absolutely beautiful property run by 20 somethings that sincerely don't care about your satisfaction. I mean they truly don't care and they're not afraid to let you know that they don't care. 

I'm a high-end customer at this hotel opt-ing for for some of the nicer rooms on the property and the VIP services.  But you won't be treated like a VIP here no matter how much you spend. Every single interaction I had with the Aria staff ranged from incompetent to down-right rude. If you complain they will simply ask you if you would like to leave and go somewhere else. Honestly, I'm usually very forgiving when people make mistakes but rudeness like the rudeness found in the Aria staff and management team turns the 5 star resort into a 2 Star Motel 6. 

I suggest staying across the street at the Vdara, and walk over to the Aria if you want to visit the casino or one of their many restaurants. Bring your wallet though, a simple dinner here will run $200 per person, and no.. you won't feel like you got your monies worth. 

In regards to competence...  three calls to the concierge to book dinner reservations before I just went online to book it for myself. I was then called two days later (after I left the resort) and was told there were no more openings available. Lucky I made my own reservation online. 

We were promised VIP check in, but instead were dropped off by the hotel driver at the front door then left to stand in line for 30 minutes. When I complained to the manager on duty about the long wait for ""VIP"" check-in, his response was  ""maybe you should stay somewhere else"". 

There are several other examples of poor service, but I think you get the idea. 

With all of the options in Las Vegas why would you waste time and money where only rudeness and arrogance can be purchased?  There are many other 5 star options in Vegas that offer much better service and a better value. This beautiful property has the managerial maturity of a 18 year old narcissist and the competence of a 18 year old high school drop out. 

Shame on you Aria for ruining such a beautiful place by hiring such an incompetent and arrogant group of employees.   This pretty girl of a property is just too much maintenance for me. I would strongly suggest staying elsewhere.  

Final calculation.. 
Resort - 4 Stars
Restaurant - 3 Stars (due to price)
Service - Negative 2 Stars

Final total 1.5 Stars, but we'll round it up to two stars in hopes that they get their act together.",21,5,8

We're solidly middle class and don't have expensive tastes; this was a splurge to experience a 5-star hotel for the first time. We didn't have an awful time, but it could have (and in my opinion should have) been a lot better.
--
First impressions: We skipped the valet and self-parked in ARIA's garage, and from there it quickly went downhill. Lack of clear signage from the garage to the lobby led us to wander into the casino very confused, with two large suitcases in tow. We wandered through the casino following signs for the lobby - which occasionally pointed us in the wrong direction and through a cluster of slot machines or gambling tables. Finally found the lobby, which was on the opposite end of the casino from the parking garage. Speaking to the customer service rep checking us in, we learned that they were ""overcommitted"" for the night and the Deluxe King City View room I had booked two months prior (and for which my credit card was IMMEDIATELY charged!) was unavailable; we were offered a king without a city view or two queens with a city view instead. After raising a minor fuss and demanding the room we had already PAID FOR, the customer service rep ""talked to"" her supervisor and suddenly a Deluxe King City View was available. Funny how that works. Encountering an attempt at bait-and-switch upon check-in does NOT leave a favorable first impression and hung over the rest of our stay. Great job, ARIA! \/sarcasm 

A few other annoyances further diminished our opinion of the ARIA:
--
ARIA is all about how high-tech it is; maybe it was in 2009, but now it's a gimmick. The drapes automatically opening when you enter the room for the first time is cool, yes, especially when you have the City View you paid for... but the vaunted control system for the room's lights, temperature, drapes etc. is incredibly laggy\/unresponsive and difficult to use as a result. Moreover, the TV and remote also experience major lag, making them frustrating to use. The mini-bar is ""smart,"" which really just means that if you remove an item for longer than sixty seconds you get charged for it. And don't even think about trying to store a beverage you purchased elsewhere in the mini-bar (which is the only refrigerator in the room) - that will incur a daily use fee (not to mention the fact you have to remove an item - and thus get charged for that item - in order to make space). Maybe this is a standard practice at other 5-star hotels, I don't know, but it looked to me like an attempt at nickel-and-diming us for a very, VERY standard feature - the in-room fridge. 
--
As for dining, we tried the breakfast buffet one day and the dinner buffet another; although we found the breakfast buffet to be a relatively good value with a variety of good food on offer, the dinner buffet underwhelmed in quality, variety, and flavor. You're better off pursuing any of the other dining options on Strip for dinner.
-- 
As for positives, the hotel cleaning staff is the only part of the experience that really shined. They were friendly and respectful when we passed them in the hallways, and we always returned to a perfectly clean room - they even folded any clothes they found that had been left out! The cleaning staff are the superstars of ARIA (well, except that one time they threw away our tube of toothpaste... that was not cool). 
-- 
My wife enjoyed her 50-minute massage at the spa and had nothing but good things to say about her experience there, so at least ARIA has that going for it.
-- 
We also enjoyed the Cirque du Soleil show hosted at ARIA, ""Zarkana."" Although being a hotel guest entitled us to a 20% discount on the ticket prices, being an Mlife member (MGM Resorts' loyalty program) granted us a 30% discount, so... even insofar as earning discounts by staying at the hotel are concerned, ARIA is lacking.
--
Overall, I'd recommend any middle class hotel guest looking to have a good time in Vegas avoid the ARIA - they try to nickel-and-dime you, and in our case even tried to switch a longstanding, paid-for room reservation on us. We felt that for the most part we didn't even get to experience a level of service or convenience we're accustomed to from mid-tier business traveler hotel chains like Hampton Inn or Courtyard by Marriott.",2,0,0

We stayed 6 nights, and the best part was the uber comfortable bed we had in our room. Seriously... It was like sleeping on a cloud.
Now onto the nitty gritty... First the resort fees are an extra $25\/day which is normal for Vegas. But upon investigating I discovered that the fee only included pool  and fitness room access, a newspaper, and free WIFI. The pool is closed for the winter, the hot tub closes at 5pm, the fitness center closes at 8pm, you must walk down to the shop and show them your room key every morning for the newspaper, and the WIFI is slow (plus every time you turned the screen off on your mobile device, you had to log in again)
Next on the list is incidental fees... $130\/day is held in your credit card  ($780 for us!!!) I checked into other resorts (Monte Carlo) and other establishments fees run less than $20\/day.
We stayed here with 12 other guests who flew out  for our wedding, so we decided to take everyone to the buffet for our reception dinner. $35\/person + gratuity. The buffet was fantastic... Everything from crab legs, salmon, prime rib, ham, Asian, Italian, and Greek. Basically anything you can think of is available. The only negative is we were told we would be seated in a separate room, and we were seated in the middle of the busy dining area. This made it impossible to have a conversation with my family.
On the day I got married I went to the concierge for 3 items: band aids, a plastic comb & a straight pin. I ended up with 2 safety pins, 1 band aid & was told housekeeping would be up with the comb. 40 minutes later my husband tracked down housekeeping and was told they have no combs.
There is no coffee maker located in our room. Nor was there a mini fridge... But you can rent a mini fridge for a small fee of $25\/day. :( but there are electric open\/close drapes in every room, so I guess that makes up for the fact that you will need to spend $5.88 every morning for a cup of Starbucks coffee in the Aria.
Checkout for my guests was a nightmare... Two separate rooms were told they had used the mini bar or snack tray, which was not the case. $50 a pop to open the mini bar fridge. My personal checkout incurred no additional fees, but took 15 minutes at 5:15 am. This should be a 30 second process.
I gave this hotel 3 stars based solely on their classy decor and delicious food. MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO SAVE YOUR EXTRA CASH FOR A SHOW OR TWO WHILE YOURE IN VEGAS...

Dropping off at valet and checking in at 6pm on Friday night was not a problem. The ONE king bed for 3 guests was. I called up for a rollaway, the front desk said it would be a charge of $35 a night. Really? Because it's free at MONTE CARLO, of all places. I tried putting the two stupid couches together, but it wasn't comfortable. Called the front desk again ready to cough up the $70 for a stupid rollaway and the guy said there would be no charge.  REALLY? We're talking a 5 minute difference here.

The TV didn't work when we got in so we called down to the front desk. We left the room and when we returned, the TV was working, but the desk lamp, which was working when we left, no longer did.  I called housekeeping for toilet paper and... it never came. It wasn't until the next day that I realized we never got it, so I called again. 2 hours later, there was that knock on the door with my toilet paper.  What if I was completely out??

It's really annoying that there is ONE outlet outside of the bathroom, and that ONE outlet is located next to the door. As in, AWAY from the mirror. I had to wait for my roommates to finish showering before I could finish getting ready myself. And the ONE spot that the outlet is located is really dark. So when you're ironing your clothes, you have to take it off the board, walk to the bathroom with it where there's actually LIGHT, and check to make sure you got all the wrinkles out. How annoying is that...? And there's no vanity counter like at The Venetian for doing your hair and makeup. Minus major points there. 

The curtains do not keep the daylight out. My rollaway was a few feet away from the window. Being as hungover as I was, I just wanted to SLEEP. The sunlight shines over and below the curtains, so I had no choice but to get up. There was no point in trying to shut my eyes through it.

Why is the shower head non adjustable? Also, the room we were in - 16262 - was really small. Luckily it was off the elevator, but the other groups in our party were on the 5th floor, and their rooms were FAR from the elevator. Not to mention, I had to take my elevator down to the Casino floor, and get back onto ANOTHER elevator to get to the 5th floor. Can't they have just ONE elevator that stopped at each??

Dinner at The Buffet was $35. Get a player's card so you can get 2 free meals charged to your room. The dinner menu was horrid. The only thing I actually enjoyed was the cheese and meat station.. but how hard is it to cut cheese into squares and fold cold cuts in half? It does include half a Maine lobster and complimentary house chardonnay or house merlot. Trying to get a waitress to order it was a half hour battle. I was done with my meal before my WATER came. Whether that means that the food sucked or the waitress was extremely slow, I'm not sure, but I was really disappointed. The crab legs were tasteless as well as the desserts. The best dessert was the fresh strawberry on the cheese display.

You cannot get into the mall through the hotel even though they are connected. You have to walk outside the hotel and RIGHT NEXT DOOR into the mall, which was a waste of space because it was EMPTY on a Friday night. 

Went to the 24 hour cafe at 4:30 am after clubbing, ordered an omelette, and waited 30 minutes for it.. when the cafe was pretty much dead and abandoned at 4:30 in the morning.

Waited 30-40 minutes for valet at checkout. In 110 degree heat. With no spraying mists like The Mirage and The Venetian have. There was no order to the valet pick up line. People were pushing and shoving to see if their cars were ready. There is ONE bench to sit and wait for your car, and on a Sunday afternoon when everyone is checking out, that's just ridiculous. I mean, I know they're a green hotel and all, but for $10 billion, you can't spring for maybe 5 benches at the valet area?

And I don't like their slot machines. They're too technologically advanced for me. They're mostly touch screen and have a gazillion choices on how many lines to play or whatever. What happened to a good old one payline machine?

The sun reflects off the hotel, so while sitting on a pool lounger, I was treated to a very bright and shiny annoying reflection, that also BURNED. At least they had free water cups and didn't allow smoking or drinking in the actual pool.

The hotel is actually very pretty and modern. I kept commenting on how cute everything was. It just wan't very practical at all. Oh, and they really should have customer service training. Not one single employee that I interacted with smiled at all. Majority of them had an attitude. 

Save your money and go to another hotel. At least the other hotels will ackowledge your concerns and try to correct the mistakes. Even other MGM hotels. But for whatever reason, Aria isn't one of them.

I booked the room through a JetBlue Getaways package that include a flight from Long Beach.  Grand total after discounts came out to $349 for the flight and two nights, plus a $25 per night resort fee.

The hotel is pretty big in comparison to some of the other hotels.  The line for check in was daunting but we got through in about 15-20 minutes.  The rooms themselves are nice and modern.  The lights and curtains are all automated and can be controlled by a control panel next to the bed that also controls the temperature, TV, music and door panel (in case you forgot the ""Do Not Disturb"").  There is also a AV panel to hook up your IPod.  The downside is this panel is the only place to plug in anything since all the plugs in the room are inaccessible.  

We spent a day in the pool, which is pretty standard and nothing special.  There is one bar and five pools.  It wasn't too crowded for a June weekend which is also a plus.  Their pool club is ""Liquid"" which I had heard is overrated.

The casino is on the higher in.  The lowest minimums I saw were $50 for blackjack and $15 for craps.

We tried their two lounges Duece and Bar Moderno which were pretty cool.  Duece is more of a club atmosphere and Moderno is more laid back.  The tapa restaurant, ""Julian Serrano"" was very good.

I'm happy to say that this four-sevenths-of-my-name hotel is pretty awesome. It's still fairly new so my smoke-free lungs aren't begging for air after a ten minute walk through the casino. The beds are nice and soft, yet firm. It's modern, sleek, and polished. 

The cabanas are nice. They come with two lounging floaties for the pool, a stocked mini fridge, a basket of snacks, and two trays of fresh fruit and cheese. Pools are slightly boring, but I love that they're not deep. I like that you don't also hear the blaring music from Liquid like you can at MGM and Wet Republic. 

The Breeze Cafe, located by the pool, offers a 1 pound hotdog. My ex and his brother finished one each. The servers and managers swore up and down that they were the first to ever finish it. Woot. Caffe Vettro sucks and the  glare of the sun is annoying if you eat there when it sets. Jean Philippe's is awesome. I'm still trying to come up with a way to steal those huge chocolate flowers.

Even if you sleep only a few hours you will get some major deep sleeping cycles on these beds.  Just amazing.  The only thing I have a gripe about is I booked 10 rooms or so for a trip and wanted to get the points all on my name and I swear I never got them.  Not cool.  Aside from that I like the casino as its less smokey here and they have a few great restaurants.  Oh and the waterfall in the valet area always makes me smile!  Love it!  Can't wait to go back!,0,0,0

Rooms are clean, modern and hi-tech! The resort offers multiple restaurants so there is something for everybody, and most spots are open to at least midnight. You will indeed pay a premium for anything purchased at this resort, whether it is a bottle of water, a burger or a beer - not that this is anything different from the other higher end resorts on the strip. The staff is all EXTREMELY friendly and attentive, but I recommend if you are interested in gaming you head to one of the other close spots - maybe Monte Carlo?? Aria only offered continuous shuffle blackjack and 90% of the tables open on a Wednesday night were $100 per hand - okay if you are winning, but we had absolutely no luck at the Aria with gaming!

Its part of the ""City Center"" which offers ""over half a million sq. ft. of shopping space."" That's like Disneyland for the ladies! 
   
    The check-in went very smoothly for a Monday morning. I'm assuming it's worse on the weekends but I'll worry about that bridge when I cross it. There's also an attendant at the beginning of the line directing you to the next available check-in window since it can get pretty hectic. 

     We went up to our hotel room and I struggled to open our room door for a sec. I didn't realize I had to wave the key at the door knob. ""Well that's new for me."" Once we opened the door it was dark for a split second and then... WOW the blinds started to open by themselves, then the lights and the TV turned on. I know it's not a big deal but it caught me off guard. I wish I would have caught in on Yelps new video function. It was a different greeting than we're use to. 

    One thing I didn't like about the room is that the huge windows at the end of each individual hotel room offsets from one another so if you stand close to the window you can see part of your neighbors room to the left and your neighbor from the right can see you. It's a very limited view but nonetheless don't stand BUTT NAKED next to the window cause you might be seen hahaha. 

    Lastly, after a long night of walking on the Vegas strip we headed back to our room. We got undressed and laid down on the bed.... OH MY GOODNESS, the freaking bed was soooooooooo comfortable!! I don't know if I just have a lousy mattress but this bed didn't even compare to our Palms Place penthouse suite and the Misses would later agree. 

     I can't believe I got such a nice room on a comp. Next time I'm in Vegas, the Aria will be at the top of my list of my places to stay. Good night now!

I don't even know where to begin; this hotel is the worst fancy ""looking"" hotel I've ever stayed at. Let me start with how careless and rude the front desk is. We booked our room online and specifically chose the City View Room with 2 Queen Beds. We get there to check in and the rude front desk lady tells us that they don't have any rooms with 2 Queens. We told her we reserved and confirmed the room online she said that online reservation is never ""guaranteed""! Does this make sense to you: you go to the website, choose the type of room you want, you ""confirm"", and then you ""PAY"", but your room is not guaranteed!! Since there were 4 of us they said they can give us a regular room (not even city view) with a roller bed. Can someone explain to me how 4 adults (2 couples) can stay in a room with a king bed and a roller bed?! Then they wanted to fix the situation by offering us some drink vouchers! I'm just wondering if they were expecting the ""free drinks"" to put us to sleep (on the floor???). After we asked to speak to the manager, she was able to as she called it ""do us a favor"" and give us ""someone else's ""RESERVED"" room"", and when I asked her to explain what's the whole purpose of reserving and paying online, she raised her voice and said ""ma'am, I fixed the issue and gave you a room"" and simply left us with the initial front desk lady to finish the process! We get to the room that was given to us as a ""favor"" (still not city view - but we didn't complain). It's probably 80 degrees in there (keep in mind this is June in Las Vegas)! I think this room was ""reserved"" for the maintenance people to come fix everything because everything seemed to be broken! The AC barely worked (we had the temperature set to 65 and the room was still like an oven), there was barely any water coming out of the shower head, we had to hug the shower head in order to rinse (don't even mention washing your long hair!!).

The room was impressive upon entering - spacious and posh.  High point: the bed is amazingly comfortable.  The mechanical sliding curtains are great, but you'd think they could figure out a way to have the curtain open all the way so that 3 feet of your view isn't blocked.  Low points: bedside phone wasn't working.  The lighting is terrible - the ""reading"" light (it is labeled as such) is so dim as to cause eye strain if you actually try to read by it.  I called housekeeping to request a sleep mask - not offered.  A 5-star hotel can't provide a sleep mask? OK. 

It was impossible to find a convenient outlet in the room - the only ones provided are inconveniently located at the desk. The shower had almost no water pressure.  I wasn't going to mention the crapy shampoo\/ conditioner but I just read another reviewers comments on this and I completely agree - my hair felt dirtier after using this stuff.  Room service took 15 minutes to answer the phone, and had an hour wait time.  Yes, I realize Saturday night may be the hotel's busiest night, but they should anticipate this and staff accordingly.  The apple pie I ordered was a joke - instead a a nice slice of pie, they delivered this little individual tarlette thing that  was just disappointing.  We also tried The Buffet restaurant in the hotel.  The food was so globally bad (one of the two lobsters they delivered to the table was completely empty - no meat; we overheard the table next to us call the manager over to complain about the same thing; shrimp underseasoned, lamb was like rubber, fish overcooked, corn drenched in butter, prime rib flavorless) that we didn't even bother to talk to the manager about it.

Overall, a very disappointing experience.  This is NOT A FIVE STAR HOTEL.",1,0,0

Tried to check-in early around 2:45p, they said they don't do early check-ins and the computers were down anyway. Fine, so we hang around and come back around 4:30p... Holy crap there are about 200 people in line! Employees ""strongly suggest"" we come back at 8p to skip the line. We ask if there's an Mlife line, they say no. Ooookay... That's weird, since every other MGM property has one, for those handy times you book through Mlife and trouble is we wanted to use our resort credit to take my dad out for a birthday dinner at Sage. Can't do that if I don't have my room...

Anyway, it's now 7p, we go to check the line and there now appear to be even more people waiting in line. We tell the new guy who seems to be manning the lines that the lady who previously helped us told us to come back later, and incredulously he asks why we would ever do that and moreover no employee would ever suggest that -- okay jerk, so the 5 other people with the same story at the bar... we're all liars? He walks away. Awesome customer service buddy! 

So now we say screw it, decide to wait and hope we can get through it in time for bday dinner... 3 hours later we finally get to the front of the line and they don't even have my reservation. She goes off to look for it so we wait even more. Finally, around 11p we make it into our room. Check out's at 11a, so we just paid for 12 hrs. Absurd. 

We're only staying one night here and we've already lost 7+hrs with the room, dinner, and wasted way too much time in line. Oh yeah, come to find out there is an Mlife line after all, and no, not everyone had to wait in the same line. 

But the kicker is they wouldn't extend our resort credit, all the restaurants are now closed, so what... Are we supposed to use it on 20$ room service donuts in the morning? Totally unacceptable damage control by management. It is NOT HARD to give a gift card instead so we can take my pops out to dinner the next day. Can't even take him to lunch.

So, pretty sure I won't be coming back here. Hotel is gorgeous, rooms are gorgeous, I'm sure Sage would've been amazing, but lack of service just killed it for me. I get the computer crashes were not their fault but how they mishandled every thing after it was. Take your money next door to the Cosmo and get actual 5 star treatment.

Hotel:  like most other respectable Vegas hotels, Aria is beautifully furnished. No surprises here. Walking distance from places like Marquee. 

Rooms: I got what I think they call an executive suite. There is a main living room area in the middle, a  bedroom on one side, and a conference room on the other.   As you open the door and step into the room, the curtains automatically open, giving you a view through the 25 or so feet of windows. the main bathroom has a tub in the middle, closets off to one side, sinks on the othe side, and a toilet and large shower partitioned by frosted glass doors towards the rear of the bathroom. 

Casino:  I didn't have much free time to gamble on this trip but the two times I did gamble, I had trouble finding people to play with.

First off was the check in lines, now I am normally accustomed to VIP check in at other hotels in Vegas but since this was my first time here I had to use the LOOOONNNGG check in lines that moved painfully slow. It was not until later in my stay that I realized this is an MGM property and I would have qualified for a VIP check and comp room, room reservations failed to mention they were part of the M Life program. In my opinion this place is just too big, literally took a couple minutes to get to our room after we got off the elevator. Rooms were nice with great contemporary decor. Room was clean on the surface but upon closer inspection there was a large build up of dust on several peices of furniture in the room it was obvious that housekeeping just does a quick once over while dusting. My single biggest complaint is the dark rooms, lighting was worse than terrible. They are taking this ""green"" thing a little too far. I will not stay here again just because of the lighting in the room. About the best thing I can say about the Aria is it probably has the best location on the strip. A few other high points were a few of their restaurants, Javiers and She by Mortons which is located in the Crystals shopping area which is part of Aria.

There was toothpaste on the fixtures, hair in the drawers and a ""substance"" on the comforter on our bed. Worse, we had to call housekeeping and speak to the manager twice before someone was sent up to clean, making us late for dinner. The people in the room next to us got in a fight and we had to call security to intervene because it got out of hand. We returned later to our room to find a foul smell coming from both sinks, disgusting. The lights in our room flickered constantly. The valet was flat out rude to us when my wife said I was coming with the ticket. He yelled ""you don't have a ticket!"". They messed up the billing and overcharged us on checkout failing to apply our credits. The service was simply awful. Ruined our anniversary stay. I am not sure what has happened here.

It smells nice, everything looks so hip and modern, there are plenty of bougey stores and restaurants, and all of the tables and slots look shiny and brand new. I ended up staying here with some friends one weekend and I was pretty impressed.

First, our room was freaking bougey. We didn't have a special suite or anything, but everything just looked really nice. A pretty flat screen tv, a couch, coffee table, a huge king bed, & a bathroom that had an individual tub AND an individual shower. The bougiest part of the room was that most of it was controlled by a touch screen remote, very similar to the Ipad. This remote controlled the TV, the lights in all the different areas of the room, and the curtains. We couldn't even manually close and open the curtains! Now that is the definition of bouge-ness right there.

The hotel staff messed up with our room, as we were supposed to get two full beds rather than one king, but they said there were no more rooms available with two beds. (PS, they lied, some of my other friends checked in later and got a room with 2 beds, wtf?). Luckily, they gave us a roll away cot to sleep on. It was quite possibly the most uncomfortable cotI have ever slept on in my entire life. BUT, my friends complained about how they messed up and we got 50 dollars in resort credit. YAY.

Other irks about the hotel: the location of the parking garage. Yes, I understand, you want people to walk through a bunch of slot machines and tables before they get to the restaurants, shopping, and other activities. But what about those staying at the hotel? I had to lug my luggage across the freaking huge casino to the tower elevators which was freaking far away. They should have designed the hotel differently, but I guess it's too late to change that haha.

Aria still is a beautiful hotel. There are plenty of places to dine and shop, fun nighttime activities, and it just looks and feels beautiful and fancy, from the lobby to the hotel rooms. I would stay again. It's definitely in a nice location on the strip and the hotel itself is stunning.",2,2,1

About 2 years ago, as noted in my earlier review, I had found that the employees weren't too pleasant or friendly. I'm happy to report that, after 3 visits to Aria in this trip alone, they've pulled a total 180 and become my new favorite place to gamble. 

We were fortunate to find $10 craps tables two nights in a row, which is odd considering that Aria usually has some of the highest minimums on the Strip. Both experiences were great, with all of the dealers being friendly, engaging and energetic, while David from Michigan also assisted my friend who was just learning craps for the first time. It was a great experience, and we won a few hundred bucks, which made it even better.

The next day, we returned during the morning hours where usually you run into beginner dealers or the ones who aren't as pleasant - but at the Aria, we found we had just as friendly and entertaining gaming staff at 10am as we did at 10pm the night before. Shout-out to Jamye and her dealer team running craps this morning. Even though we ended up losing what we won the night before, it was still worthwhile to have a fun experience. Much better than the lousy service and experience we had at Monte Carlo while still losing money...then it's just throwing money away at that point, right?

Long story short, Aria has some great dealers and gave us a great craps and roulette experience over the last several days. I haven't tried their blackjack because it's tough to find a shoe game under $50, but since most dealers are transient between games, I'm sure you'll find the same upbeat staff there as well.

For a 5 diamond rated resort I'd say this place is more than affordable, whether you're staying in a room or suite. Maybe it's steep on fight weekends and whatnot but reserve in advance and you should be fine.

There is no aspect of my stay that I do not like, and it smells amazing throughout the resort including in the Crystals shopping center.

My room is always clean and well taken care of. Sometimes the tablet is a little wacky but that's rare and quite honestly for an electronic device to take abuse day in and day out from guests, I'm not mad.

I love to wake up and relax poolside with a fresh juice, and then I head to Aria Cafe for breakfast.

Ive stayed in mostly every hotel in the strip and they were some good ones and some bad ones, but never have I experienced anything as nearly horrible as this hotel. Sure i won a good amount of money in the casino but that doesn't matter, what matters is that i would rather sleep under the vegas strip in the sewers than in the SKY SUITE I got. First, the room phone dis not work, and when i complained they literally said, ""okay"" (they never fixed it) i kept complaining but they really didn't care. I would give them a -100 for hospitality, they treat their guest as if they were enemies for some reason. Also, when i ask them to reserve a show for me they always wait for the last minute to tell me that they couldnt find seats, i dont know why they would lie to a guest because i get tickets for those same shows right at the gate. They also keep giving me the wrong times for the events they plan for me. BUT BY FAR THE WORST THING THEY KEEP DOING IS TELLING ME ""so what"" when i tell them how f***ing (i never curse but Aria got me crazy) horrible their service was.

Not only did it look nice, it smelled completely different than other casinos (that usual cigarette\/cigar smelling casinos). I've never seen a casino look so clean.  I don't know how they kept it smelling fresh, but maybe because it is new. They had a really good ice cream and pastries shop. The coffee was okay, but the pastries are to die for. 
I did notice that for gambling, it was a little expensive compared to some other older hotels. The stores around aria are really nice and modern.  All the workers were friendly and professional.

It's a nice location to get to MGM, NYNY, the Mirage and the Bellagio - the places we always seem to gravitate towards. The bathrooms are nice and big, as is the room itself. His and her closets. The room is totally controlled by a tablet - the TV, the lights, drapes, temperature. Nice, large and powerful shower. You can even book a spa session with the tablet. Turndown service nightly, with chocolates left each night. We had access to the Tower Suites lounge, which makes the extra cost for a suite worth it - light refreshments and non-alcoholic drinks (water, Coke, Sprite, OJ). We never had to buy $4.00 waters on the Strip and even skipped a meal (and saved some $) because of the refreshments, so that offsets the price of getting a suite to get the lounge. 

My one complaint is that I wished they would ban smoking pool-side. I get that you can't ban it in the casino (but it did smell more smoky than I last remembered) but when you have family, it sucks to subject your kids to second-hand smoke even at the pool. I came away with a lot of headaches from the smoke. That's the reason for the loss of a star, in addition to the pool. 

The pool is nothing fancy and not very big. It gets crowded fast and the few chairs that have shade are taken quickly (my only other complaint). They do have 3 hot tubs and who thought I'd want to use a hot tub in Vegas in August, but it actually made you feel cooler when you got out despite the 102 degree temps. There's tram from the Aria to the Bellagio as well which is nice. No matter where you stay on the strip, there's going to be a lot of walking. 

We did the buffet (3p.m. dinner rate) at this hotel and it was very good - pizza, Mexican, Indian food (wish it was not as spicy and have ways to let others spice it up), Chinese, limited sushi, crab legs, peel-and-eat shrimp, carving stations with turkey, ham, beef steamship. The salad bar was very impressive - I had read other places had very little fixings for salad on their buffets so this was the main reason we chose to eat at the Aria's buffet. The salad bar did not disappoint and there were even pre-made wedges and chopped steak salads. Lots of fresh fruit options.  Oh, and dessert selection was impressive. A WHEEL of gelato from pistachio - a personal favorite - to coconut mango and the mainstays. Plus, lots of other types of desserts - nothing to complain about there!  Nice, clean buffet areas and servers did a nice job of removing the plates. Just come hungry and make it your one meal of the day!",1,0,0

We asked for an upgrade and were able to upgrade to a panoramic tower suite for an additional $40 a night. Its worth the upgrade. The room is huge with walls of windows in the living, bedroom and bath areas. The blinds are automated and you have an iPad next to your bed to control the lighting, music and shades- sheer and blackout. It's a swanky room and the views of the strip make me feel like I am a high roller while I sit out and type this review. Oh and there is a heated toilet seat with bidet in the bathroom of the Toto Washlet. I've always been a fan of Japanese style toilets and I have one in my home but it's rare to find one in a hotel in the US. To top it off they use Lather products in the bathroom- and the soap smells so good and the Lather is foamy. I hope to score a sample soap to take home with me. If you stay in a Tower suite you can get complimentary free coffee, sodas and waters. They have scones and muffins in the morning too. The fitness center is top notch with nice equipment and a good selection to work off that hangover. I love the mens shop too with a great selection of Robert Graham shirts. This place is really cool and I would love to stay here again. I don't gamble much and with my $20 I won a $119. A winner in Vegas now that is a first time for me. 
When you stay make sure you have a M Life card and you can accumulate points on hotel stay, gambling, hotel and bar expenses. So even when sipping a cucumber refresher by the pool I am earning M Life points. Also the rates are better direct when you are an M life member. They partner with Southwest and Hyatt so you slip your preferred partner card to them when you check in. They will also match your Hyatt status too.

Saturday was pretty crowded and all of Vegas (not just Aria) seemed to be hopping.  Things thinned out pretty quickly by Sunday, and everything was much lower-key Monday and onward.

HOTEL

Stayed in a standard room with two queen beds.  The room itself is a little on the small side, but balanced by the (relatively) newer furnishings, modern design, and technological bells and whistles--most notably the fact that you can control the lights and curtains of the entire area from either the television (through the remote control) or from a little bedside display.  The beds and pillows were very comfortable and the climate control worked like a charm.  Again, the bathroom seemed a little small by Vegas standards and having the bathtub in the shower stall was slightly disconcerting.

The spa was pretty impressive--breaking off into Men's and Women's spas (complete with lockers, showers, jacuzzis (kept at 70, 90, 100, and 101 degrees), sauna, and steam room.  The separate spas then converged into a common waiting area for the treatment rooms.  The selection of available treatments was also fairly impressive.

One bonus about staying at Aria is that it has easy access to a super high-end mall (Crystals) as well as a tram between Bellagio, Crystals, and Monte Carlo.

My experience with the staff was marred when I checked out of the hotel.  While there are numerous ways to check out--through the television, by phone, and even via text message--I wanted to get an updated copy of my hotel bill.  A couple of hours earlier I had visited the casino host office and got a good part of my hotel bill comped.  When it came time to check out, though, the charges still remained on my folio.  What really turned me off, however, was the rudeness of the hotel desk clerk who all but accused me of trying to cheat the hotel out of its money.  Doesn't she realize that she works in a Las Vegas casino, and it's not that unusual for guests to be comped items off their hotel bill?  In the end, I had no problem just paying the bill as it was because I knew the hosts office would correct it, but for the desk staff to make such a scene is unacceptable.

CASINO

Relatively speaking, Aria is not a very big casino.  I do like the general layout with the lower denomination games close to the front desk, moving up to higher and higher denominations, and ultimately going past the high limit slots and blackjack rooms to the far set-off baccarat room near the lobby to the Sky Suites.  During peak times, blackjack table limits were a little on the high side in my opinion--with $50 minimums for ""Hit Soft 17"" six-deck shoes and $100 minimums for ""Stand on All 17"" six-deck shoes.  There were also $25 and $50 continuous shuffler machine tables (hitting soft 17).  By mid-week and off-peak times, those continuous shufflers dropped to $15 minimums, and it was easy to find $25 minimum table with decent rules.

The craps tables were generally at $15 minimums, topping out at $25 minimums and bottoming out at $10 minimums.  Aria did not seem very video poker friendly:  They had my favorite multiplay machine but, inexplicably, it was missing the Speed\/Turbo button that makes play go faster.  I disliked it so much I ended up going over to Bellagio to play instead.  I did not spend a lot of time in the baccarat room, but the layout seemed rather nice--including little drink tables in between each of the baccarat seats.  Per the trend, Aria has the smaller ""mini-bac-like"" tables with computer screens instead of the the older-style fourteen person tables (which I do miss, but understand the choice).

FOOD

Each of the food options could warrant their own review, but I'll summarize the ones I tried:  

- The food at the Buffet was of average quality (except the Eggs Benedict which were terrible) and below average selection\/variety.  Not sure where this tandoor oven they advertise comes into play.
- Cafe Vettro was serviceable as a late night dining option.  Not sure why they refuse to put a single dish on the menu with both eggs and pancakes on the same plate.  Maybe Denny's has the intellectual property rights over that one.
- Jean Philippe Patisserie had amazing looking desserts that did not taste nearly as good as they looked.
- BARMASA was such a massive disappointment, particularly as Masa at the Time Warner Center NYC is one of my favorite restaurants on the planet.  The space is generally gloomy, and the food was just not impressive overall.
- Sirio was a decent Italian place, though one might expect something better at those prices.

OVERALL

Aria is a pretty solid choice for a Las Vegas resort, but my own preference would be to go for a higher-quality experience at Bellagio.  Where Aria excels vis-a-vis Bellagio is in the modern rooms.  Bellagio seems to have the edge, though, in terms of its casino and its dining options.  Aria probably has a slight edge over Wynn in my book.",4,2,2

We loved all of the restaurants we ate at: Breezes, Bar Masa, and JG steakhouse.  We spent Friday evening in Duce lounge.  It was very fun and the music and cocktails were great!

We spent one day at Liquid - it was very fun and reasonable priced in comparison to other pool lounges.  We have been to a few and this one was very first class.  Great servers, good drinks, goo dmix of music and over all a fun time!  Day well spent!

Plus their poker room sucked and there was almost never any games going.  We decided we'd need to pay out of pocket and get a room and find a new hotel.

BEST DECISION EVER!!!

Where to begin...  The hotel smells like Vanilla when you first walk in.  A bit overwhelming, but a nice change to being welcomed by cigarette smoke.  We got there early and they had no problems allowing us to check in and go to our room early.  They use to no line method when it's not busy.  They do this right.  It's not the free for all you find at other places.  They had a young lady with an iPad standing in front directing people and creating order where there would otherwise be chaos.  The clerks were on top of it.  They look up once they are done with a guest to find the next.  No waiting for acknowledgement that never comes.

The room was very nice and pretty decently sized.  Everything had a control.  Lights\/TV\/Music\/Curtains...  All at the tips of your fingers, either when you walk in, at the end of the short hallway, on the TV, on a bedside remote, or on the wall next to both sides of the bed.  Yes they make everything convenient.  The bed was soft, which I know isn't for everyone.

The bathroom is nice and roomy.  They had a Japanese Soaking Tub next to the shower that I didn't get to use, but I will my next go around.  They have free Wi-Fi though out the hotel casino.  You don't have to be a guest to connect either.  If you are idle for a period of time, you will be timed off their Wi-Fi.  Inconvenient yes, but I understand why they do it, so no problems.  Just reconnect and you are good to go.

Now we did register for the poker rate, so you do have to go to the Poker Room Manager sometime before you check out to have them adjust the rate for you if you want to do video check out.  Unfortunately for us, through some snafu the rate was not adjusted, so we had to check out at the lobby.  When we got to the clerk, it was a quick phone call to the poker room and our rate was adjusted.

Back to the long line.  It was 10:30AM on Sunday, so this is to be expected, but this line moved quick.  They were almost fully staffed so there was a nice flow.  The lady with the iPad was there again, helping the flow and preventing line cutting.  I realized she is here so that people can ask questions and not cut the line or wait in line to ask a clerk.  I'm sure she can make dinner reservations for you, if you asked...  I'll try next time.",0,1,0

Lobby - The most striking feature in my opinion is the display of origami paper cranes hanging from the ceiling. If check-in lines are long, complimentary water is distributed. 

Rooms - Thanks to Pamela at the front desk, I stayed on the 52nd floor and enjoyed a breathtaking view of the Vegas strip!  Rooms are very clean, spacious, and well decorated. Upon entering, the lights automatically came on and the curtains opened. The bathroom has great smelling green tea and citrus products just in case you have forgotten yours. 

Casino - The gaming floor was extremely clean!  I recall smelling very little second-hand smoke. There are lots of table games and slot machines for you to enjoy also. 

Much to my surprise, the casino was adorned with gorgeous flower arrangements. I had the chance to speak with one of the florists, Sandi, who took much pride in her work. She informed me that guests can order fresh arrangements and have them delivered to their room. I will be doing this in the future for sure. 

Dining - I enjoyed the breakfast and dinner buffets. Although tasty, these were pretty much what I had expected. The hotel offers a variety of unique dining options. These range from pocket-friendly to fine dining establishments.

Went with two girlfriends for my birthday weekend bonanza.  We had a double queen room which was on the 3rd floor overlooking the roof of the casino...hmm.  The room was very clean and the curtains opening automatically is cool.  But several lights weren't working and we couldn't figure out how to plug in our iPods for some getting ready to party music.  Also, the channels on the tv take forever to change (we met some guys in a bar and they confirmed this).

If you don't have a cabana or lounge chair Liquid is a disappointment.  

Aria, it looks pretty, but like a girl with too much makeup when you look a little deeper you see a lot of blemishes.",2,1,0

Stay outside.
The whole hotel is convoluted and confusing due to the strange half-circle shape of the building. This includes the restaurants, shops, and hotel hallways and rooms.
The (thankfully free) Self-Park is clear across the entire Casino from the Lobby- you have to push yourself through hordes of trussed-up gamblers, through the Casino, lugging your bags the whole way, just to check in.
The real fun for us started before we even checked in. If you stay at this place, COME WITH A CREDIT CARD. Otherwise they will put a $475 (for a three-day stay) HOLD on your debit card, for 'incidentals' (i.e, the absurdly-priced mini-bar. Seriously, $3.50 for a Snickers bar? GTFO). And this charge stays active on your card for THREE DAYS after you leave the hotel! Totally ridiculous. I have NEVER experienced something so stupid at ANY hotel before, not even at ritzier places in Vegas!
I'm actually shocked at the number of people that say this place is 'less crazy' than other Vegas hotels. And even more shocked when they say its location is 'convenient.' If you want to tour overpriced shops, sure, it's convenient. If you want to actually SEE Vegas? Maybe get to a show or something? Make sure to include AT LEAST half an hour for travel time in all of your plans, if you don't intend to cab everywhere and you don't plan on using the valet. Getting out onto the Strip requires way too much work- the tram takes you to the Bellagio, which you then have to wind through to get outside.
The Aria prides itself on the room 'welcoming' you when you enter your room. This, for us, was a bit lackluster, considering the curtains opened out onto... a rooftop and half-obscured signage. If you are a masochist and decide you must stay here, try to get a room above the 10th floor. Then maybe you'll actually have a view.
The room comes with a touch tablet that controls all the tweakable aspects: television, music, lights (in the bathroom and bed area), curtains, and services. Trying to watch television using either the remote or the tablet was a nightmare, but why bother when you're in Vegas? The music channel options seemed a tad limited, and the options given on the tablet did not match the channels on the television. Their 'relaxation' station was already playing only Christmas music (the absolute opposite of relaxing, imo), the '60s station was a '90s station, etc. The tablet had four raised buttons on the bottom, with no labels. Of course. One controlled the brightness of the tablet screen, and the other three...? Also, if you happen to have long nails, good luck getting the tablet to do ANYTHING you want it to.
I will admit that the bed was very comfortable, and the (very large) tub was located inside the shower stall- an actual nice use of limited space (for once). But this just wasn't worth the incredible headache that comprised the rest of the hotel.",0,0,0

The rooms, service, and all things considered do not compare to other ""upscale"" hotels on the strip. We had a nice room on the 22nd floor with great city view. Yes it is expensive ... but others are as expensive or more so, and worth it. This hotel is NOT worth it, to be frank.

Pros:  1) good location\/convenient mid-strip; 2) relatively new and not quite as smokey\/stinky as some of the older hotels\/casinos; 3) gorgeous facade with a water-fall wall, absolutely stunning and unique.

Cons: 1) poor lighting in the room; had only a few small lights and lamps; was darkish even during the day with all lamps on; 2) our shower had not been cleaned when we checked in (gross hair-balls stuck along the shower wall); 3) bathroom lighting is also poor; make-up\/magnification mirror is useless for additional light; 4) I agree with reviewers below about nickel-and-diming for wi-fi, etc; 5) neither bathroom sink drained, which was gross - both needed serious maintenance; 6) one main light ""strobed"" all 4 days of our stay blinking furiously, and no one bothered to change it (how could the cleaning staff even stand it?!)

Rooms are clean and modern. Enjoyed the room automation with the blinds and lights, though the controls could be more intuitive. 3 of the 4 reading lights over the beds didn't turn on. Plenty of open floor space to stretch out, literally. Room safe next to bed is a good location. Plenty of drawer and closet space at the entrance of the room, in front of the bathroom. Makes sense. 

Nice big tub with separate shower. Nice touch to have frosted glass separate the toilet from the rest of the bathroom. Happy with the included bath wash, shampoo, conditioner, all in addition to bar soap for counter in bathroom. Plenty of towels that didn't seem worn out. 

Watch out for the $28\/day ($25 + $3 tax) resort fee. They say they charge this mandatory fee plus tax because the state of Nevada mandates it. They also say they charge the fee to keep from having to nickel and dime us. Yet, they also charge $30 more per day for 2 queen beds instead of 1 king bed. I've never been charged extra for 2 queens over 1 king. Tried to tell them I didn't use any of the amenities included with resort fee, but still got dinged. 

Long hallways in the room areas feel like they should have people movers built-in or provide Segways, especially if your room is towards the end. Casino areas are typical of Vegas. Smoke in your clothes still comes standard. The dessert place (Jean something) is quite good. The Aria Cafe food is decent and doesn't feel cramped. Aria buffet is standard for Vegas.

From check in using M-life and standing in line for over 30 minutes, to being put in a crappy view room after I paid for a room with strip view - I was just going to write it off and let it go. The front desk manager changed my room and gave me some credit for a meal. So forgive and forget. Right???

Tonight I found that parking as a given at this resort has been changed to $30 per day if you are staying at the resort. This is not the $38 resort fees, this is in addition too. If you are just here for dinner, the first 4 hrs has a $12 fee and 12 hrs is $18. The self park is now $10. To add insult to injury all 11 MGM properties in Vegas are doing the same thing.

I guess the resorts aren't taking enough of my monies. And now the valets and parking lot attendants at these 11 resorts have all become teamsters. I didn't realize this was skilled labor, who knew??? I'm not knocking the valets, just the actions that have caused them to bring in a union. 

So before I even get the first nights stay, between the resort fees and now parking, I'm already in $68. Wow!!!",1,0,0

We would've mentioned it to room service..if we had ever seen her after the first day.

The pool area was very nice and even on this very busy weekend we were able to find lounge chairs and the pool service was great. 

The problem I had was during the checkout process. When I was checking out the lady at the front desk told me I needed to approve all of our room charges. The Aria decided that it would be a good opportunity to try and take advantage of us and charged us an extra $300 for a ""deep cleaning"". I demanded to speak to the manager and was informed that a maid said she ""thought the hallway smelled like cigarettes"".  I was appalled that without evidence or any warning the hotel thought it would be ok to apply this ludicrous charge. I ended up having to waste an extra 40 minutes talking to a manager named ""David"". He had no intentions of trying to help us and was frankly flat out disrespectful.

Our last stay was in a Corner Suite. This room went beyond my expectations. This is a premium room that isn't outrageously priced (and believe me, it can get outrageous at this hotel)! The bed was the most comfortable thing I had every slept in. And the floor to ceiling windows in every room (even the bathroom!) were gorgeous and gave a great view of the strip. I loved the views. The two bathrooms were appreciated, as was the bidet. I know, I like fancy like that. Twice daily housekeeping was a nice touch too.

When I went to dinner 3 hours later, there was still no one from security to give me a working room card key.  After complaining to the front desk, I was offered just a $25 beverage credit.  The credit doesn't even matter, but it's the fact that they didn't even apologize that irritates me.  
 
When I checked out, my room was billed at a higher rate than I expected.  When I asked the front desk, they alleged that it was the rate that we agreed upon when checking in.  After pulling my check-in records, they agreed that the rate billed was higher and simply said it was a computer glitch and could have happened at any MGM Hotel.  When we spoke with the manager, he adjusted the price but basically said ""what else do you want me to do?""  Horrible!

After calling the Lost & Found Department 3 times, and each time being told that someone will check and call me back, no one ever called me back. After finally reaching someone who was able to retrieve my wallet after 2 days, I requested that the item be mailed to me via FedEx Overnight to my work address.  Later, I found out that they not only sent the package with UPS Ground but also mailed it to my home address (where no one will be during the day).

From the exterior, it is pretty obvious that Aria is a new and posh hotel. The interior was a little bit overwhelming for me. I get that it is the Lunar New Year, but I think they may have overdone it a tad bit. I wasn't a fan of the reds, oranges, and dragons. Just.. no.

Our check in time was not too bad, we were assisted immediately. I did not try the $20 trick, but I did ask whether they have anything for a complimentary upgrade. They did, but the alternatives weren't so good.

I signed up for the Porsche design package from the ARIA website. Basically, with that package, we will be granted a complimentary room upgrade to a King Suite with View, $75 dining credit and a porsche design goodie bag worth $100. However, we did not get our complimentary room upgrade as it was ""subject to availability"". I don't understand how that works, aren't hotels supposed to reserve rooms like these for the guests who signed up for a package?

Also, my whole hotel bill came close to $500. My first night was supposed to be $149 before tax, and my second night was supposed to be $179 before tax. Tax is unavoidable so I was fine with it. We also did use up the $75 dining credit at Julian Serrano which was excellent, and had to pay the difference for our lunch. ARIA charged 13% tax on both nights, on top of that, they have something called the Resort Fee of $25. What's ridiculous is they have tax charged on this resort fee.

Wtf is this resort fee anyways? and why is there tax charged to it?

During check out, I was given my receipt. Close to $500. On top of that, I was charged $70 on room service later in the day, which they did not mention during check out and that I did not order. Heart attack. Literally.

Everyone at ARIA asked how our stay was, I only could choke up an awkward smile and said ""could be better.",5,1,1

I stayed at Aria the weekend of May 12-14, 2017 and it was a slow weekend by Vegas standards with no conventions happening. I had paid full retail price ($200+ per weekend night) for a room for 2 nights, and the hotel was beautiful, large place, with good restaurants and interesting pool area.

Now for the not-so-impressive-stuff, and the reason I will not be returning: We waited 20 minutes in a 30-person line for a buffet breakfast, with literally 1\/2 the restaurant tables open. No excuses, but dismissive ""please wait sir"" responses - unacceptable. The drink service at the pool, took 30 minutes to come around after flagging them down, then walking over to them (""please return to your chair sir, I'll be right there""), and then took another 30 minutes to *bring* the drinks. The safe in the room broke (error 90, wouldn't lock back up) - I got a ""please wait in your room sir"" and then waited over an hour for the service guy to come and slap a new door on the safe in 5 minutes. We had two other restaurant experiences where the service was way below what I would expect (slow to initial hello, slow to follow-up order taking, no coffee or water until main was served, and one of the waitresses rolled her eyes when I asked about the side for my order).

The final straw was asking for late checkout: When booking, I asked. Was told, ""please ask the staff when you check in"". When checking in, I asked. Was told, ""please call us after 5am the day of checkout"". I called, was told ""we don't have any available rooms, but we could make an exception for you, for $70"". I was livid. Literally every other hotel chain I have ever visited has the ability to let someone with a late flight check out later in the day without additional cost (11am checkout by policy - I had a midnight flight). It is a simple matter of a changing the cleaning crew schedule so they come back to that room a bit later - they have plenty of other rooms to clean, they work on this all day. But Aria front desk manager Mark insisted that I would pay $70 for the privilege of taking an afternoon shower and leaving my stuff in the room for another 3-4 hours - he was firm and polite, but no warmth, no reason given, no smile, no apology - just stonewalled me like I was a bum off the street and not someone who just poured over $1,000 into his hotel the last 2 days, in room charges, food, drinks, and shopping.

As a business man, I understand the value of sticking to your rules and policies. As a customer, I can't imagine coming back to a place that provided the experience I had at Aria.",5,2,1

We drove in from the Grand Canyon and my GPS brought me to the back of the hotel which also had a valet. Happily there was no wait at  all and the valet was just standing there waiting. It was a short walk across the casino floor to the check-in. The check-in lines were long and moved fairly quickly. It would have been nice to have some kiosks for guests who have visited the hotel beforehand, although not for me because I needed a map! I was surprised by the amount of money they hold on your credit card for each day stayed. I specifically book hotels on a credit card that has a low limit in case my CC number makes its way into somebodys pocket. This unexpected charge nearly put me over my limit and there was no mention of it when booking the room online thru their website. 

The room was fantastic. One of the nicest I have ever stayed in. The technology integration was great, there was basically an A\/V wall for the TV so you could plug anything into it. Bathroom had a tub separate from the shower which was just lovely. The mini-bar was full of fancy items that were set on timers. I wish there was just a little space in there for a bottle of water. The major downfall of the room was the fact that there is no in-room coffee maker. Every morning I would wait on a loooong line at Starbucks for morning coffee and tea.

We dined at Starbucks, the patisserie, Todd English PUB, and the buffet. 

We always found chairs at the pool however Friday we got there early, and it filled up by noon. The one pool that is close to Liquid their day pool club had way too much noise. The music from the club overflowed and mixed with the music from the normal pool which made things very annoying. We prefered the pool nearer the bar. The poolside service was good during the week but on Friday it felt under-staffed, hopefully there are more staff on Saturdays and Sundays.

The gym was really great. Just like any gym it gets packed in the morning. Plenty of machines and kept very tidy with towels, water and sometimes apples. The key here is to grab two bottled waters when you leave for your hotel room. Their free!

The spa was very lovely. Even though it was busy it didn't feel crowded. The co-ed areas were nice and the separate areas were even nicer. The mineral pool could have been a little bigger but it had a good view of the other pools as it sits on a ledge. The sauna and steam room were really big and the hot and cool tubs were a nice touch. My massage was great and the masseuse was very professional in accommodating my requests. 

The bell service helped us out big time. Our flight was a red-eye back to NYC and we had checked out of the hotel 9 hours before that. They checked our bags at the bell service so we could go to the spa. When it was time to get a cab to the airport they retrieved our bags and hailed us a cab. Even better was he let us skip the line of people waiting for cabs at the cab stand and hailed us one right in front. I gave him $5 and wrote the website about their great service.

The Wifi... it     was      slow. Painfully slow. Of course you could pay more money for an upgraded connection. That is some balls. Net Neutrality took a punch to the gut at the Aria. At a 5 star hotel you expect the WiFi to be included and halfway decent. What am I paying the resort fee for?

Overall there are very few flaws, having to go to Starbucks, sound pollution from the club pool, and holding money on your credit card were my biggest peeves. I came here on a personal recommendation, and I would suggest you check it out.",2,0,0

This room is super high tech, and you control everything - the curtains, lights, air, etc. - from your remote. Everything worked perfectly, and they even had an outlet\/jack for all of your gadgets. I was able to play my iPod through the TV...sweet!

The bathroom is probably what won me over though. They have a shower suite (this was just a standard room) with a rain shower and a tub inside the same place. So what did I do? Crank up the hot water and make my own steam room...nothing better to sweat out the Vegas. Also, the shower had a bench and I always give one star for this feature. I love me a shower bench. 

The bed was super soft and comfy...had tons of pillows and sheets over everything, so you know you are laying clean and not on someone's yucky comforter.

The room price was quite reasonable.  About $150 on a night when Encore was charging $225 to give you an idea.  The day before my arrival the hotel sent me an express check in link.  I clicked on it thinking that would be it.  But it wasn't.  I had to enter name, address, phone, credit card etc. I had just done all of this reserve the room, so that was annoying.  After that was done, the web page let me know that I should not go to check in until I get an email letting me know my room is ready.  Uh oh.  Not liking this.  Flight lands, I arrive at the hotel at 3:45, no email.  The check in area is completely empty, but I'm not supposed to go there without my email.  I go to the mobile check in and the helpful lady looks up my reservation.  Nope room is not ready.  So she says I should just go to the checkin area and they'll get me a room, and they did.  End result:  very annoying.

The room is nice.  Smaller than Encore and Venetian with lower ceilings.  The bed was fine, not bad, not great.  My room had a great view of the strip.  But downside: the blinds were not black out shades.  The room became very bright at an early hour even though the drapes were completely closed.  I was wide awake at 7 am.  That sucks.

I ate at the buffet.  It was about $21 for breakfast which is reasonable.  There was no line since I was there early.  The woman handling the intake had me hold up a minute.  The place was almost empty and it was huge, but still I had to stand there a few minutes and wait.  Very weird.  There was a decent selection of food but it was all very mediocre.  I have been to most buffets in LV.  This is toward the bottom for quality.

The casino is nice, clean.  The casino bars appear to be wildly over-priced.  I stopped at one of the lobby bars for a drink.  I ordered Macallan 18.  I am used to paying $25 or $30 a glass for this in San Francisco, where drinks in general are not cheap.  Aria charged about $50 for the drink.  Wow.  

At every turn I could not help but notice that I was in a machine trying very hard to make money but not so hard to please guests.  If price is your primary concern, this might not be a bad choice.  But if you can afford a better hotel, it's money well spent.",2,0,0

The fish dish that was served was bone dry and room temperature  I skipped the rest of breakfast one morning after I bit into a very undercooked pork sausage.

The hotel's attempt at room automation is neat when it works. Lights, curtains and the TV are all controlled by a bedside tablet, but the tablet isn't reliable enough for it to be the only way for you to open and close the curtains.

Overall, though, the biggest disappointment was the staff's attitude. One event server actually mouthed off to a member of our table after being asked for a clean glass.

My husband and I like to escape from Xmas every year, so we stay in Vegas for a few days before the New Year. Its easy to get reservations and we always get good rates as return customers. The check in and check out are difficult so I recommend checking in early and checking out via your tv menu. We had a billing dispute when we left and the concierge informed us that its better to call when we got home because the checkout line was insanely long and it would be hard to resolve there. 

The spa is our favorite amenity and my husband says its the best massage he had ever had. I like the location of the hotel and we use it as a base from which to go to other hotels and shows up and down the strip. The internet worked fine for me once my iPad learned the sign in process and Im looking forward to the starbucks being built there opening this summer. We needed an extension cord and housekeeping was happy to bring us one even in the predawn hours of the night. This has been a great hotel for us as a couple seeking a relaxing Vegas vacation.",2,0,0

They have their own entrance to that mall, is it called City Center? The one where it's too expensive to shop in unless you won the jackpot?

The lines are wayyy to long for a 5 diamond resort. I don't know why they are so long, because the check in process is absolutely routine, and there's nothing special about it. I gave up on the long line at check in, and went straight to the buffet. I mean hello, the brunch clock was ticking. After, I regretted that decision, because I was not checked in to charge brunch to my room to use up some credit I had. Sigh. 

Back at the now shorter line at check in, the front desk agent went through every motion possible and confined to ask me the same questions over and over again  because he did not listen my answer the first time. Like ""is this your first visit?"" Also- my friends had a room too, they just happened to wait in line with us, and the agent keep looking over at them as if we were going to cram them in our room. He even asked if they were with us (our room was a king size bed) and when my friends gave the room number, he had to comment on how high of a floor they were on as if that was a super big deal. Anyway, it was a ""pleasant"" experience, I guess. Just annoying.

We have YET to experience any sort of ""ta-da!"" when we enter our for the first time. I have heard about that from other friends, has yet to happen here. This is my second visit at Aria. The wrong name is always on the display in our room.

We must have pulled into the back valet because we had to walk basically across the entire casino just to get to the front desk area to check-in.  The staff was friendly (yes, even the elevator security guys).  

It was a luxury to have stayed at the Aria after a long evening of partying for 3 days straight in a desert.  

Rooms = clean, sleek, modernized w\/ technology upgrades that other LV hotels don't have.  A touchscreen remote that allows you to be the controller of the lights, shades, TV, music, alarm clock, etc.  On the smaller side, yet still good for four people. 

Beds = soft w\/ fluffy pillows.  I just sank into the bed.  It was so comfy.

Bathroom\/Shower = It is of decent size.  I think I remember there being only 1 sink, yet plenty of counter space. There was a shower & a jet tub - only the shower was used that weekend.  First you walk through the glass shower door then behind that was the tub.  The showers always felt amazing - I didn't want to leave.  I'm pretty sure our room also came with an electronic scale.

Casino = Clean, sometimes a little crowded looking.  Multiple eateries surrounding the exterior.  

Buffet = One of my favorites in LV, but I can also say I haven't had much of a variety.  The first time I ate here, we were offered a 1\/2 lobster tail for their grand opening or something.  

Nightlife = Haze, probably one of the smallest nightclubs ever in LV.  It is below the main level and usually has a small to non-existent line to get in.

Valet = You must go on the bottom level to pick up your vehicle.  Not too bad of a walk considering you would be taking an escalator downstairs.

Pool = There were I believe 3 different pools - I only experienced 1.  It was a nice, hot, sunny afternoon & finding an open spot to sit would have been difficult without the help of one of the hostesses.  The pool had people in it, but it wasn't crowded and nor did the water look murky like other hotel pools might be.  I wanted to order drinks, but it was pretty hard trying to flag down a waitress.  We ended up not ever ordering b\/c no one ever came our way.  Oh well, less money for us to spend anyways... but I did want a drink! :\/

2 or 3 months after my stay, Aria sends a letter in the mail explaining how there had been some bacteria in their water systems that was causing some of their guests to become ill.  This was supposedly fixed by the time we had gotten the notice.  Luckily, no one from my party got sick.

Check in - slow but expected and understandable - 30min

Room gorgeous - tasteful and modern.  The alarm clock, curtains, lights, TV and music were all controlled by an iPad type device beside the bed.  You are supposively able to check out with this pad as well, but the servies were down while we were there so we couldn't try it out.

Housekeeping - poor, Upon check in, was hoping to lay down and rest, however there was a big white starchy stain on the comforter, stain was dead center in plain sight.  Disgusted, called Front desk to remove that and left to play a few games.  Came back, bed was remade but the same stain was still there.  Called again and had it redone.  We went to buy a few beers before returning to the room experience. 
 
Service - poor, there is no bottle opener in the room, so I called to have one brought up.  Great.  Next day, room service removed the bottle opener, not sure why as I clearly had a few more beers on the counter.  Call for a new one.  20min pass, called back and room service said no record of one being requested.  10min later the bottle opener arrives.  40 min later, another knock on the door and a second bottle opener is delivered

In room dining service - poor, I preemptively ordered a fruit platter and chocolate covered strawberries to surprise my parents in another room.  2 weeks before our flight into vegas I called back to confirm that everyone was set up.  I was told there is no record of my order.  So, I reordered.  Upon arrival, there was nothing in my parent's room.  2 hours later the fruit platter and strawberries were delivered, but to MY room.  Went to the concierge to complain but she was not helpful.  Called front desk from my room to have this delivered to my parents room instead, in spite of ruining the surprise.

She belittled us in public and the hotel needs to  retrain its staff on proper customer service. They also need front desk staff that can understand and speak English.

Booked through Expedia together with my flight, so got a pretty good deal for the room. Overall I think the experience was wonderful, and I would go back again. 

We arrived late at night and had to wait in line a bit to check in, but it was ok because the staff was absolutely friendly. We went to our room on the 3rd floor and was very disappointed that our window faced directly at what looks like a parking structure. There was no view whatsoever. 

So we went down to the lobby to see if they could give us a different room. The guy at the reception desk was very polite and friendly, and we were able to get a room on the 9th floor. Spectacular view! A minus point though for the semi-cleaned bathroom. When we entered this new room there was a bunch of towels around the toilet bowl. Someone clearly forgot to take away the towels after cleaning the room. We went down to the desk again, the manager apologized, and we got a $100 F&D credit. We were happy with that, because honestly the room was not dirty at all...it was just a bunch of towels on the floor.

Still on the pricey side, especially with the additional fees from priceline plus the outrageous $20\/night resort fee (hey at least it includes internet), but ultimately I have to say it was all completely worth it for one of the best hotel experiences I've had.  I hadn't been to vegas in 3 years, and a lot changed in that time, including the entire city center.  We generally stay in 5* hotels on the other side of the strip (Wynn, Venetian, Palazoo) but it's amazing how advanced the technology is in these brand new luxury hotels.  Everything in the room is automated -- no more of those door tags, that is all done by pushing a button.  And pretty much evereything else in the room can be controlled by the tv.  I especially loved the way everything activated upon entering the room.

Decor -- the decor in the room isn't anything too snazzy or swanky, but it is modern, appealing and, ultimately, comfortable.  The hotel in the lobby is very nice.

Staff -- front desk and bell hops were all very friendly and accommodating.  

Dining -- I was travelling alone, and I generally don't eat at restaurants alone, so it would've been nice if the hotel had more quick options for meals, beyond Jean Phillippe Patissere (not that I'm complaining about that place, it is amazing and delicious; an absolute must-try).   Also, all the food in the hotel is expensive so I recommend walking to the monte carlo food court for McDonalds, Subway, Rubio's, etc.

Location -- Loved where it was placed, right in the heart of the City Center, next to Crystals, across from Miracle Mile shops.  You can walk to Monte Carlo or tram to Bellagio.

Overall, this would be a go-to hotel for me for business trips.  Not a place I would take my family, since the rooms are average sized (unlike the Venetian\/Palazzo)",0,0,0

The check-in process was a bit lengthy - even though we had MLife preferred check-in, we still stood in line for 30 minutes.  We asked if there were any smoking rooms at all in the hotel, but were advised they did not.  Strange- for such a large hotel in the middle of a smoking casino, they should have a block of rooms set aside for smokers.

The hotel and casino are lovely- very modern and luxurious.  The biggest downfall was the ""technology"" in the room.  The auto black-out and sheer drapes are controlled by a panel on the wall or tv ... however, the boxes holding all of the cords were so obtrusive, hanging out from the side of the curtains that they caused the curtains to gape open.  What a bummer- every morning we had bright sun streaming into our room!  Such a shame for their supposed ""high tech"" amenity.

We also thought the tub in the shower was sort of strange.  And the water pressure from the shower head was terrible ... we barely got a trickle out of the shower!  Took extra long showers just to make sure all of the shampoo was rinsed out.  

The Lift Bar was cool, as was Alibi.  We had lunch (twice!) at Todd English P.U.B. - obviously we really liked it!  The two bartenders who served us at the bar, Chad and Cody, were awesome!  Very attentive and great dudes!

We also ate at BarMASA, and although the food was delicious, the portions were pretty tiny for what you pay.  Best part of our visit- the bartender (believe her name was Cathy??) - she was very attentive and knowledgeable.

And finally, we also ate at the buffet in the morning.  Nice options, but sort of non-memorable.  The all-you-can-drink beverages were a plus!  :)

We've stayed at most of the major hotels in Las Vegas, and frankly we prefer the Wynn on the Strip, or Golden Nugget downtown.

When we arrived, we waited in line for an hour at check in. There were two employees trying to service over 50 guests.
When we got to our room we decided to go to the pool. It was so crowded, there was not ONE seat left AND we found one of the pools was closed, a fact I wasn't informed of when I made the reservation.
We decided to come back later, same situation, no lounges.
Today I had an appt. at the spa. It was under my husbands name for some reason even though I filled out the request.
Finally they found it.
My masseuse was 10 minutes late but my massage went to the original allotted time, so I paid for 50 minutes but received only a 40 minute service. 
We tried the pool again. STILL NO SEATING.
We went to lunch at the Pub where they gave me the wrong entree, and my husband was finished with his food before ever I received my meal.

Be careful of using Uber here.  They relegate drivers to the north entrance and the drivers tell me the employees are very rude to them...taxis control Vegas no doubt.

A few other things:

1.    Order chicken and waffles at Aria cafe...best in the country! The bourbon syrup alone makes an exceptional dish even more phenomenal.
2.    The concierge room for Towers guests is meh. 
3.    Smoke is horribly ventilated in the casino.  I understand smoking is allowed but the Rio has a better ventilation system.
4.    Tip housekeeping..they make crappy wages and do an incredible job.
5.    Public restrooms are immaculately clean.

Apart from serving tainted food, the pool area is super bland and very uninspiring. Then there is ""Liquid"" - a genius name for a pool.

The Aria is borderline hidden, the easiest way to get into the place by pedestrian means is through Crystals, which is confusing enough in of itself. The waterfall and colorful fountain outside were nice enough, but the execution is a total fail. What use is stuff like that if it's hidden?

I walked in, started looking around when my subconscious pretension and snottiness block started going off. It was as if an alarm was going off in my head telling me ""I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE HERE."" Besides, the place looked immense and knowing me I would have easily gotten lost.

Casino\/shopping: The casino was pretty big and there were very little shops and restaurants inside the actual Aria but there are a bunch of stores in the city center right next door.  Oh and the buffet serves the same thing every night and it is seriously lacking in variety. 

Customer Service: The customer service here blows chunks.  Seriously, why provide a number for the front desk that doesn't work? I swear we were on hold for 20 minutes in the room trying to find someone to bring extra towels.  

The price for this hotel relative to a few other luxury hotels on the strip is very fair.  I would stay here again not because this hotel is the best hotel I have stayed in but because I fell in love with the architecture and I feel like a younger crowd tends to stay here.  

I will revise my review for this hotel in about 3 weeks when I visit sin city once more.",4,1,1

The lobby SMELLS good... for real, I don't know what they pump in there, but you don't smell smoke or stale air.  It's noticeable that there's a fragrance in the air... it's subtle enough to not be too much, but just enough to be refreshing. 

Unlike many of the hotels in Vegas the walk from the lobby to the room elevators is pretty short!!!

The rooms are pretty spacious, clean and super smart.  I think a little too smart for my taste.  I enjoyed the room lighting up, the window shades opening and in the TV turning on when we walked into the room, but trying to figure out how to turn some of the things on in the middle of the night was a bit problematic.

The building is modern and clean - looks like a modern airport terminal.  Whether you like modern architecture or not will basically determine if you like this hotel or not.  Room interior is also very modern and clean, with dark wood contrasting with beige color walls and bathroom marble.  The entire room can be controlled by a central touchscreen controller - nice touch although it needs to be more responsive.  Overall room is clean except a part of carpet was dirty - it was hard to see unless it was under sunlight.  Rooms were generally cleaned well, and we have no problem with the service in general.
We also liked the location - it is basically in the middle of the strip, and close to Bellagio, Paris, etc.
The pool was open for a couple of the days during our stay.  It was a nice and large pool, defninitely a plus.
However, during check out, we found 2 major mistakes in our bill.  We were charged a mini-bar item that we did not consume (which they took off), and also for a few hundred dollars of show ticket that we did not attend. The tickets are now ""under review by accounting"" - frankly I don't know how possible they could make such a mistake.

My wife and I showed up around 9am, due to an extra early morning flight. We went to the front desk expecting to have to check our bags with the bell hops but to our surprise we were checked in and got our room keys right away.

One of my favorite things about the hotel is the way the elevators are set up. I believe we were on the 26th floor and we had 4 elevators that only served 5 or 6 floors total so we never had to wait for an elevator and we didnt have to stop at five floors before we got to our floor.

The hotel tower is well designed and seemed surprisingly small. We were all the way at the end of the hallway but it was not a far walk to the elevator.

We had a king room which was pretty spacious. There was a sitting area and work desk and a huge entry. The bathroom was also spacious with an enclosed toilet and an oversized shower and tub. The bed was a little too soft for my liking but was comfortable. 

I loved the automatic shades and how everything could be controlled bedside. The blackout feature is pretty amazing and it does just that, blacks out the whole room. Perfect for sleeping in to recover from the night before.",6,0,2

This was my first stay at the Aria and I can't say enough good things about it. My experience began when we mentioned off hand upon check in that we were on out honeymoon and the next thing we knew, they had upgraded our room to a junior suite (free). Shortly after arriving in the actual room, someone stopped by to drop off complimentary cakes and chocolate covered strawberries with a congratulatory note. They really went out of their way to make our stay special. 

The rooms are also extremely nice. Curtains that open and close by remote, excellent views, and very modern decor. I've seen some people complain about the AC, curtains, and water flow from the faucets. What these people don't seem grasp is that the Aria is one of the most (if not THE most) environmentally conscious resorts on the strip. They have numerous environmental certifications (look it up). These are a result of such room features as curtains that close automatically when you're not there, lights that turn off automatically of you leave them on, low water flow, and AC that adjusts when you are not in the room. I, for one, feel great about staying in a place that feels luxurious but makes every effort to be energy and water efficient. 

The pool is also excellent. It's low key (doesn't have that ""spring break"" vibe), plays some great music throughout the day, isn't terribly crowded, and offers plenty of shade for those looking to stay out of the sun. It was one of the reasons we chose to stay here.

But here is why I'm giving them 1 Star. 

I checked into ARIA, gave them my credit card as I normally do.  And within a day, fraudulent charges started appearing all over Vegas!  I had been traveling for a while but ARIA is the first place I actually used this particular card. 

It is sad and quite a bit troubling that this happened at ARIA.  Since my card wasn't in use prior, and this was the only place it was scanned, the fault lies with ARIA and the people they hire to man their Front Desk. 

This of course puts me in a tricky situation as my card was pre-auth by the front desk and I'm still in Vegas for a few more days. I'm not trusting ARIA with another card, so I have to work around the situation. 

Trust is earned ARIA!! Time to evaluate your internal controls.  Something is awry!!",12,1,1

The downside is that it is a 15-minute walk to get to the strip, and therefore a bit difficult to go exploring. Granted, Aria provides every amenity, however one pays a premium for this. Also, the noise from the air traffic constantly overhead (particularly in the pool area) was a bit distracting.
The staff (as one would expect at a high end resort) were very friendly and accommodating. I arrived at around 12:30 pm and found the line to check-in overly long, although it moved fairly quickly. I was given a room even though it was very early to check in, which I greatly appreciated. The room was absolutely gorgeous, although figuring out the lights\/drapes was a bit more complicated than it needed to be (being operated entirely by buttons & an iPad). Also, the two side table lamps as well as the desk lamps were not working when I entered the room, so I had to call maintenance. They came and promptly repaired the issue, which was good. The food (again, as one would expect at a five-star resort) was excellent, however quite expensive. The way this hotel is configured makes it very difficult to exit onto the strip to find other (less pricy) food options.
The convention space was huge and spread out. A very nice space except the restrooms were inconveniently located at the far end of the convention center, which made it a 20 minute excursion every time one needed to use it, resulting in a loss of time actually attending the convention.
The pool, while very nice, was very shallow, more of a wading pool. They inspected our bags upon entry and wouldn't let us bring in our water bottles, which I found odd. They didn't explain why, I'm assuming so we would be forced to purchase their expensive drinks? Water (in a cup) was provided free of charge, which was good. Also annoying is the fact that the pool area (including the hot tubs) closes promptly at 6 pm. This is far earlier than anywhere else I've ever heard of so I thought it a bit bizarre.",1,0,0

I had three nights at the Aria for a boys trip during the NCAA tournament.  The rooms were fantastic.  We had high-floor Strip-view rooms and the view was overwhelming.  The room itself was fantastic as well, you can control everything from HVAC, curtains, TV, and lighting from an iPad-looking thing on the end table.  All appointments (beds, towels, etc.) were very high quality and very comfortable.  The iron in the room was so nice, I'm ordering one for my own use.

The casino makes you forget all of the smoky, smelly, dingy casinos you've ever been in (and even places like Caesars & MGM are getting like that nowadays).  The air is fragrant and pleasing and everything is incredibly clean.  The stakes at the table games aren't low, but come on, it's the Aria.  The sports book is small but nicely appointed, and the Sky Box club is a great place to watch the tournament while chowing down on great food and craft beer (surprisingly affordable, all things considered).

The restaurant options really couldn't be better.  We ate at Jean Georges and loved every bite of tender, marbled steak (they also made a great Old Fashioned).  The buffet is the best I've ever been to with so many high quality food options and decent champagne for brunch (with unlimited refills as well).",3,0,2

Doesn't get much more impressive than this! All the room is controlled by an iPad sized gadget next to bed. At night you can set the TV, lights and drapes to turn off and close at a particular time. So you can lay down and snuggle in then just drift off to sleep watching TV and the beautiful night lights knowing it will all turn off a few minutes later. Even the 'privacy' and 'clean room' signs are automated. The only negatives I would say are that the minibar is one of those that if you pick up something to look at it for longer than 30 seconds you get charged for it. Really? However, the minibar charge for soda was only $3, so it wasn't all that outrageous (for a big hotel). 
A helpful hint I would recommend is driving into the Aria from Harmon Ave and entering the North Valet parking. They return your car in just minutes (we tipped about $3 for each time we picked up the car). The North Valet is much closer to the room elevators than any other entrance, and the Harmon Ave entrance is far better than trying to access from Las Vegas Ave. Always avoid Las Vegas Ave if you can when driving.",1,0,0

Our bedroom had an amazing view of Cosmo, Planet Hollywood and the strip.  The bed was my god oh so comfortable!  

Our master bath blew my mind.  Decor was beautiful and our jacuzzi bathtub was facing out the walled windows which over looked Vdara, Planet Hollywood, Cosmo and the strip.  It was amazing taking baths during the day\/and nite with all the bright lights shining in.

We were set up with all different sizes of towels galore which made it so convenient.  Even had some extra amenities like mouthwash, razor, shaving cream, nail file, etc...

The venting system works great.  We had a smoking suite but after 15 mins of smoking, the air was almost completely clear of such smell.  

The curtains\/shades\/lights were all controlled from each wall in the rooms, the digital bedside clock or the TV.  Its real fancy, but to be honest - a bit confusing.  I found myself closing things i didn't want to close, turning on things on i didn't want on.. etc.

To a person the staff  was very gracious and engaging.  We are not 'Vegas People' and really felt comfortable here.  The check in and check out experience was painless.  The roses I pre-ordered arrived in our room within one hour of our arrival.  The view of the strip from our room was nothing short of stunning.  This was brought into full effect when we first opened our door to our room.  The curtains automatically opened and the lights came on to create a pretty impressive reveal.  Overall a truly remarkable experience my PRHPF will never forget!

For all this over-the-top indulgence we enjoyed to celebrate an important milestone in our lives came the understanding this was not gonna be cheap.  You need to be aware that all this came at a cost.  For example:  If you want a particular view, this is gonna be an extra fee.  And this fee will be taxed.  Daily.

Not sure why other people talked about how long it takes to get to their room or the strip!! Took us 20 seconds to get to our room from the elevator and 3 minutes to get to the strip. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of poular strip attractions. Loved the atmosphere and the vanilla scent was not that bad. The restaurants are pricey, but it's VEGAS! 

Our entire floor was quiet! Room was perfect and we enjoyed the gadgets used for controlling everything in the room. Towels were ruff, but not see-through like another Yelper mentioned. The pillows were so comfortable; I bought one to take home.

Pool was fantastic! Was not overcrowded and plenty of chairs to lounge.

I wanted something special so I went for a 5-diamond hotel at a good price.  For $950 we received airfare, 5 nights at Aria in a King Deluxe ""Suite"", one free buffet everyday (for each of us) at any MGM Grand Hotel (excluded Bellagio) plus a few other goodies. 

Upon arrival I requested a free upgrade to a City View room and was happily upgraded (a $300-$700 value depending on dates and availability).  There was a $650 security deposit held on my debit card. If this is a problem, don't use a debit card. NOTE: they never charged my account, however; the transaction showed pending and was removed once I checked out. The staff at the Aria tried to remove this hold prior to my checking out (due to the fact that I lost my wallet and had no way to any money) but my bank wouldn't release it. The staff went above and beyond to try to assist me. BTW, my wallet was returned (minus the cash). 

The room is no longer called a suite and that is good. It isn't really a suite. It's a comfortably sized (not big) room with a killer bed. Seriously, the bed, linens and pillows were to die for - a great luxury after a long night on the town. 

Room service is twice a day. There is safe for you to use in your room. I won't go into the technology because everyone writes about it. I'll just say that the room is pimped out. :)

The shower is very nice (but slippery) and crazy HOT!  We soaked our feet in the separate tub (using Epsom salt purchased from the nearby CVS). The first time I just turned on the hot water and filled the tub. Holy hot water! Seriously dangerously hot!  Make sure not to make the same mistake. The bathroom was spacious and clean. 

The minibar was ridiculously priced ($11
for a bottle of water). I locked ours and never touched it. Good thing CVS is right around the corner. 

The casino was nice. Not too smoky for me. The vanilla did a good job of masking the smell and the ventilation system was doing its job. Speaking of the casino, there were some problems with payouts. The computers weren't recognizing the payout tix. This happened twice. The staff worked hard to fix the problem and went around asking if everything was working properly for a couple of days. 

We ate the buffet @ Aria a few times (due to a busy schedule). It was good. Desserts were great! It wasn't as good as Cravings at the Mirage or Bayside Buffet @ Mandalay Bay. To be fair, we only went to the lunch buffet. 

We had no problems with customer service. We weren't treated like royalty (but we aren't royalty). I received better customer service here than at most places I've stayed. 

The hotel is beautiful. The walk to the strip takes a couple of minutes. Then again, getting anywhere in Vegas (just trying to find a place to cross the street) takes longer than usual. CVS is right there and Walgreens is nearby. The bus route is near but you have to buy tickets at Paris.

All-in-all, we had a great stay. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it 4 and a half. It wasn't perfect, but it was awesome.",1,0,1

I am also a member of every player's club on and off the strip so I get the luxury of trying out hotels for free. I stayed at Aria for 3 nights and I spent most of the time ""trying ""  to get service instead of getting it.. Check in - 1 hour, room service - 1.5 hours, getting voice mail - 2 days, fixing lights in the room - 1 day, getting a muffin - 20 min, waiting for drinks - almost an hour. The staff was half asleep and with major attitude problem ( and not in a good way)  The hotel is also heavily technology dependent, so if anything goes wrong in your room or with one of their computers, you are in for a Looooong wait to reset the whole system.  The rooms are gorgeous, spacious and the tub was heaven. The bakery is another thing to die for. Be prepared to work that morning muffin off while you get to your room though. The room's tower has ONE elevator and you have to walk for what seems like a mile to get to a room there. The location of the hotel is priceless though. IT is connected to Monte Carlo hotel and to Bellagio through a free tram. If you want to walk to the MGM or Planet Hollywood, it is a short walk through the strip. I walked it all in heels, so it is a nice checked walk. The buffet at the Aria is pretty good, $43 for TWO during brunch. Good selection. Try a banana cake if you get to the buffet. I will stay at Aria again, but if I have to ever pay for it, I will get to know the manager up close and personal because the service is absolutely horrid for the money people pay. Also, beware of the taxi line. The hotel has too many exits and entrances ( which is great for getting around to other hotels and the Strip), the taxi line is only at one entrance and sometimes when the girl is late , she gets frustrated to find the right entrance for the taxi line. 
There is also a mandatory resort fee of $20 -23. It pays for your newspaper, wi fi and an airline ticket printout. You are also entitled for 2 free drinks per room at their local bars. Be sure to ask for the coupon at the front desk.",2,0,0

Best Sportsbook in Vegas.  The most seats, screens and best place to watch any non-horse games in Vegas.  Unlike other Vegas books, they keep the horse racing to less than 10% of the viewable screens, and they are relegated to a single back wall with ~40 horse specific seats.  On ARIA's opening weekend Sunday with a full slate of NFL games, the book was packed with over 200 people.  Leather high-back benching runs around the outside of the room to allow for lots of seating.  Very comfortable reclined chairs fill the rest of the floor.  The walls are filled with all high-def screens ranging from ~ 60"" on the ""accent"" screens to ~120"" on the main screens.  The main wall holds two separate sections of 4 of the 120"" variety which are in turn each surrounded by 8 of the 60""ers.  An amazing assortment of options, truly no poor seat in the house.  

The only complaint, and not one major enough to deduct from a perfect score, is the betting menu itself is on screens requiring a 40 degree neck strain to see above the ticket windows.  Even for my young body and perfect vision, the offerings were difficult to read.  I'd prefer a few less TV's on one wall and a line menu similar to NYNY or most other books.

Four cocktail waitresses worked the floor offering free drinks (high-end too).  You can order food from the Skybox restaurant next door which is a tad pricey but very tasty bar fare.",3,0,1

Was scheduled for 4 nights, but had to cut the trip short for personal reasons.  The building is truly an architectural marvel.  The spaces that have been created are visually stunning and really conveys a feeling that you are in a modern art museum rather than a hotel\/casino.  That is also the weakness of the property.  

Its a little like one of those houses owned by an architect that is for sale.  You walk in and say wow, but you don't buy it.

First the rooms:  
I had a basic non-view room that I found to be absolutely wonderful.  The bed are the best hotel beds I have ever experienced.  I usually don't sleep well in hotels, I slept like a log in these beds.  The electronics enabled you to set\/control the lights, temperature, music, videos from one panel.  It is a feature that, while fanscinating, ended up taking more time learning how to operate than one would spend just flipping on the lights or pulling a drapery cord.  The sound system in the room was very nice as was the high definition tv.  I like bathrooms and the shower\/tub combination.  I was little disappointed with the room safes.  The small such that my laptop took up just about all the space.  Also there no charging outlets in the safe, like there are in the Palazzo for recharging electronics while they are securely stored.

Gaming:
All I did for gaming was the poker room.  The poker room is very nice sufficient number of tv's, the chairs were very comfortable one could sit there for hours (I did) and without feeling uncomfortable.

Staff:
The staff in every area, gaming, housekeeping, bars, restaurants, front desk were wonderful.  They were personable, attentive and smiling.  I did not have a single negative experience with anyone at the property.

Property Layout:  
This my biggest issue with the property.  I used to rely on taxis in LV, but with the increased cost of cab fares and number of properties I see on a typical trip, I now opt for a rental car.  The property is confusing to navigate off LV Blvd.  If you use the valet, it is pretty straightforward.  If you self-park (so you can get your car exactly when you want it, the parking is at a different entrance.  From the self-park, you have to walk across the entire length of the property to get to the front desk.  Most hotels are designed with a central elevator bank.  Because Aria is laid out lengthwise, you wind up with long walks to get to other areas of the hotel.

Restaurants:
I ate at the buffet and the Skybox in the sports book.  The buffet was very good I had a couple of breakfasts there.  Two complaints, the first was the biscuits and gravy had a sweet taste that I found displeasing, the second was I had some sausage that were not hot.  I pointed out the sausages to my server and she promptly brought me heated sausages.  I had a Caesar salad at the Skybox that was wonderful.  Only complaint regarding the restaurants was the pricing.  $23.95 for a Saturday breakfast buffet (no booze) was on the high end.

On balance, I would stay at this property again, but it will never be my favorite.  The two best features were the beds and the poker room.",0,3,0

Last year when we booked it, Aria and Cosmopolitan were neck and neck with restaurants and youth and awesomeness.  Then we spent Labor Day  weekend here and I saw babies, scrunchies and ""elder"" people here.  
Except, we did find condoms in the pocket of the robes.  Complimentary or quick clean-up job?  We'll never know.

I'm not saying I didn't like it, we had a friggin great time, pool was great, Liquid was great, service was exceptional.  But we've been spoiled.  My friends and I have a traditional Labor Day Girls Weekend and we have stayed at the best of the best (and some of the worst).  Lately M Resort has shown some real promise, The Hotel (at Mandalay) is superior and The Bellagio has The Bank, great gambling and Michelin starred resties.  I wasn't sure what Aria was offering that was greater than.  We were celebrating 10 years and I kind of wish we had gone to The Bellagio and did it up old school.
 We did give them shit about the ""clean-up job"" and they responded professionally and right away.  That made me very happy so Thank you to the hotel services manager.
Not fond of the doors anywhere it is incredibly hard to lug luggage around and the doormen are rather entitled douches.
The free wi-fi is excellent excellent as is the gym! And the touch screen in the rooms that control everything are novel, but the novelty wears off--""uhg!  I don't know how to turn the sound down, I keep closing the curtains!!"" was heard several times.

My initial complaint walking in was the check-in lineup was ridiculous. 9 wickets open on a Wednesday afternoon and I still had to wait at least 20 minutes. However, throughout my 5 day stay I did find all staff I encountered to be polite and friendly. I didn't encounter 1 rude person. The room was nice and spacious in my opinion, I had a great view of the city. There is a multitude of elevators, not once in 5 days did I ever have to stand and wait. 

Our remote controller for the tv was not working due to batteries but was promptly fixed. Javier's restaurant was delicious and although they lost our dinner reservation, they quickly accommodated us on a Friday evening with a table within 5 minutes. The pizza by the slice at Five 50 is extremely convenient and great for late night eats. The buffet was sub par in my opinion but I feel like if you want a great meal, buffet is not the place to go, no matter where you are staying.  I am not a big gambler so I can't really comment on that, however during some minimal slot playing, I was continuously brought rounds of free drinks. 

I highly recommend paying the $30 for access to the spa. My husband and I spent a lovely inexpensive day in the saunas, jacuzzis, shio salt room and hot stone beds. I also had an issue with my eyelash extensions while staying there and the salon quickly fit me in for a last minute appointment to have them removed for my comfort. 

Overall I would recommend this is a nice place to stay. Some friends of ours were upgraded to the sky suites for their anniversary and their room was lovely. They have almost everything on the premises you would need during your entire stay, and the CVS on the corner is very convenient for liquor purchases. Definitely check out the Aria as an option when in Vegas!",2,0,1

1) Driving in - the place looks amazing.  From both the strip and highway views.

2) If you're trying to self-park, it's impossible to find.  It's like guess and check.  For as large as the parking complex is, It takes are really long time to find a spot too.

3) We got to the front desk at 530pm on Friday and was told that our room had yet to be cleaned --- what?!?!  They comped us $30 (two drinks) and told us to go up to the room in an hour.  We went up at 640pm and the maid had JUST ARRIVED!  I sat out in the hall for a 1\/2 hour as I was too exhausted to go all the way back downstairs

4) The rooms are nice, but a far cry from Venetian\/Wynn properties STILL...why arent all hotels becoming all-suites these days?

5) We ate at Lemongrass on Friday night.  Service was horrible.  I think they transferred all the help from Mirage's buffet line!

6) We ventured into Crystals --- place is almost completely empty!  There are like four stores open.  Why even open it?                                                                                                                        

7) The casino floor is really dark and very convoluted.  I was at the pallazzo on Saturday night and thought to myself how much more inviting it was to spend my money there...

8) We ate at BarMasa on Saturday night (I heard that Shaboo is $500pp\/minimum!??!).  Food was OKAY.  Sushi\/sashimi are $8-11 apiece.  Are you kidding me?  The servers were actually apologizing for how overpriced the menu was for what it was.  For two, we had two drinks apiece, a salad, kobe sukiyaki, mushroom fried rice, three rolls and three pieces of sushi...$325 --- hard to understand why this place costs more than, say, Nobu

The casino is beautifully decorated, we reserved a one bedroom aria suite so we had our own private check in and immediately they upgraded us to a one bedroom penthouse! Theres also a private lounge where they have treats and the waitresses will make you special drinks, also the bar included wine at no cost. i have to admit that they didnt have the room ready until two hours after i had checked in but i quickly forgot my frustrations when we walked into that room. The room was much nicer than i had expected, very big and i love the decorating very modern but classy. We had the city view, so i praised aria a thousand times in my mind haha

I read a lot of reviews online saying that the walk to the aria suite lounge was too long, or the walk to the strip from the front of the hotel was a killer, all you people need to stop whining and get in shape or something, seriously the walk is not that bad. Also we used valet parking so we didnt have problem with the parking structure like everybody else. But i don't recommend eating at the buffet, the food was not worth the price. I could tell that the cooks make most of their food without tasting it first, also there isn't great variety to it. The buffet at Luxor was much better, but if you don't want to leave the casino for food,  just try the in room dining, most of the people that stayed with us were calling room service late at night and i had sushi and it was great. My husband had a hamburger and he thought it was good. Theres a lot of other restaraunts in aria too but i only went to the buffet. 

For all you people that are planning to go clubbing, haze seems like a fun club, the lines saturday night were completely nuts maybe because snoop dogg was there that night or its just like that every weekend. We were on the guest list and still waited 40 minutes to get in, luckily we got in free maybe because of the girl guy ratio which usually they prefer more girls.

The hotel room was great, we liked it alot. The room is clean, and then bed was very comfortable, probably because of the fact that it's still new. The view was great too. We had the view facing the west side of the strip on 21st floor. That means we saw Vdara, Rio, Palms etc. The view was very nice at night. We enjoyed it so much. And we also enjoyed the room alot for its hi tech stuff. Upon our first entry, the curtain opened itself, and the music was turned on automatically as a welcome. It was amazing! And there was a control panel next to the bed, the control panel can control every night within the room (including the lights in the bathroom!), the curtains, the TV on\/off and channel selection, music channels, etc. So you pretty much can stay in the bed most of your time and just relax. It's definitely a room for honeymoon, vacation and relaxing. We also like the bathroom as it's clean and the light is good, we can make the light softer and stronger with the control panel. So if you want to have a bubble bath with dim light you can do that. If you want to have stronger light when doing make-up, you can do that too. We just love the room. They also provided robes for use. Very very nice.

It's also convenient to walk around the City Center as we stayed in Aria. We ate at the Jean Philippe Patisseria, Jillian Serrano, Cafe Vettro and the Buffet at Aria. They are all good food and within Aria. Actually I just ordered take-out from Jillian Serrano and Jean Philippe so we can enjoy the room more. For Cafe Vettro, we dine in there as the restaurant was nicely designed. 

The pool is very nicely designed. We enjoyed the pool alot too. The water is well heated, not too cold, not too hot. 

And I don't think the casino floor smell badly like others do in the older hotels. Maybe because it's still new, so it's good that we can enjoy the smell-less casino now when it's still new.

I also like the waterfall and the fountain at the entrance of the hotel. They look very nice and very soothing. You gotta check out the galleries along the walk from Aria to Mandarin Oriental. They are nice and no fee to get in. 

The hotel overall is very beautifully and well designed that we like everything in Aria.

We would stay in Aria again when we go to Vegas in the future, and recommend Aria to others.",0,0,0

They wouldn't help me out so I had to wait until later to wait in line AGAIN with my husband to check in. Don't touch the mini bar whatever you do. We ended up getting charged the $25 fee for swapping out our warm sodas for cold ones because the hotel puts a microchip on all of their products, so they knew we had swapped them.

I felt like I was smoking the entire time I was in there... my lungs were hurting and my throat was dry... my clothes REEKED after we got back and we opened our luggages... they straight up STANK like someone was smoking inside of our luggage.  Another thing to makes matters worse was we got a letter a few weeks later saying that there was legionnare's disease in the pipes during the time of our stay... WHAT??

The hotel needs better maintenance.

It definitely has less smoke compared to other hotels, and as a non smoker,
It was great to get a little bit of fresh air here and there.

I liked how the rooms looked modern as well. They had additional hotel resort fee, but i had a good use of wireless internet and gym facilities, I did not mind. I went in feburary, so we didnt get to use to pool are, but looking out from the gym, it looked awesome as sell. ( Like any other hotels in vegas, they charge couple nox for small bottle of water in room, but once you go to the gym, they hand you free water, apples, bananas,towels,etc- all included in resort fee, so take advantage!)

Personally, What i loved the most about aria was its location, it was near to mgm or cosmopolitan, but also walkable distance to ph, venetian, paris, bellagio,etc. 

In the resort itself, it had tons of gourmet restaurant options to choose from and had a great service. 

We went to the spa on our last day after checkout, and stored the bag. After couple hours, we realized i have left my curling iron in the room, and concierge was more than happy to contact housekeeping and lost and found for us.",2,1,1

Aria is in a  good location on the strip with good hotel amenities. However, even if you have a room, they charge you to use amenities.  for example, you have to pay 40$ per person to use Hot tub (Jacuzzi) and if you are not staying in this hotel you can still use it but it will be 50$ per person. (I should say that it is really relaxing and luxury)
though you are paying for everything when you use it. they also charge around 40$ as resort fee during the check out.  

The reception and casino areas have incredibly high ceilings and it is very modern. 

The food in the hotel is amazing. you should try Five50 Pizza Bar and Burger Lounge. If you join as a member, you will get drinks in the Aria and other MGM properties if you are playing in their casinos. 

The rooms were not really wow - the bed was not comfortable. however, since we got the room with the view, we could see strip view which was nice during in sunrise and evening. I think as it is still a new property, the rooms should be in better condition and look dated.

First time staying at Aria this week.  3 night stay with wife and kids.  Wanted to see what all the fuss was about as this is purportedly one of the nicest hotels in Vegas.  To me, it was not all that.  Have enjoyed far better rooms \/ accommodations elsewhere. 

The casino = nicest in Vegas by far.  Looks different.  Not smokey.  Very high table limits but you know that going in.  Minimum bet on the double deck BJ is $100.

Getting in and out of self park is a nightmare.  Try google mapping what you have to do to drive into this place.  Ridiculous!  You have to enter from the other side of the freeway on Harman.

Parking is paid nowadays, not here to rant about that.  But if you are going to charge for parking you need to make sure there is not a long line of cars waiting.  Aria provides 1 lane in and out and a reversible middle lane they try to adjust as needed.  Not adequate for a property of this size.

I get the idea they are trying to discourage parking.  The self-park garage is a 15 min walk from the room.  You have to walk along side the casino games.  Garage is about as far away from guest elevators as it possibly can be.

Overall it is a fairly nice hotel room as it should be -- this is Aria.  Flat screen TV excellent.  Bed comfortable.

My first impression of room was frustration over not being able to turn on lights.  There are buttons instead of light switches.  So you have to squint in the dark to figure out what each button controls.  Okay, I get that it is high tech, but for me, was irritating.  Also, our bed had wiring so that the button controlled the wrong light (on the other side of the bed).  Even with all lights on the room is very dark.  The automatic curtain was a nice feature.

Bathroom is nice but only has room to hang one towel.  Shower water pressure was good.  

Minibar was a disaster for us.  We opened it and saw it was only half stocked (half empty).  Wife put a yogurt and couple other items in there.   Then it was ""serviced"" by the minibar people without our permission (came into the room).  I guess the yogurt we put in there triggered a red alert.   We were scolded in a handrwitten note for leaving items in the minibar.  Of course the bill had massive charges for minibar even though we didn't take anything out of it (not even temporarily, not even moved one inch).  When I called to complain they reversed those charges but insisted on charging us a minibar ""service fee"" of $25.  That was to have someone come stock the minibar properly, which they did not do before we arrived.   If they respond to this, it will say that fine print of whatever you sign upon check-in tells you you can't put anything in the minibar, which I'm sure is correct.

Another deal killer, the Wifi is slow.  Most of the time my laptop said ""limited"" when I was logged in.

First impression on the room (regular room no suite) was dam its small for a regular room other hotels offer larger space for there regular rooms for the same price.  Also, the automatic blinds didnt work we had to have somebody come up and take a look at it and that took over an hr.  Room was HOT we turned it down to 65 still was warm u have to turn it down to like 61 there is no medium point.  Bed was soft i give them that.

For the pool it was nothing special u have to pay and arm and a leg to go into Liquid lounge to have fun, but liquid is small.  Nothing special and the vibe outside in the regular pool was for like OLD grandma and grandpas.  Some music would of been nice.  Waitresses were average looking nothing special.  Nothing about the pool had a WOW factor.

The floor lighting is dark both durin day and night on the floor.  No special bar that had a WOW factor to it on the floor.  Dealers and pit bosses were not fun.  Not enough baccarat tables.  Only hot waitress i saw was blonde russian lady WOW that was the only WOW factor i had at aria.  

Club Haze was ok again no WOW factor to the club it was too big for the amount of ppl were there wasnt too packed.  Girl talent was average.  The pics i saw on the website after i came back i said to myself ""where were these girls cause their hot and i didnt see them there!"" ahaha.  We went on a sat night so maybe wrong night?

The view of the strip is amazing from their delux rooms and although you may think high tech gadgets isn't something you really need in your room, it proved to be very convenient at times.  You can control everything from thermostat Changes to room service from your tv.  The curtains open up for you as you arrive to the room and the curtains and all the room lights (including the bathroom) go off with one simple flip of a single switch.  Also many great restaurants to choose from (sage was amazing), and there was always a healthy line for the pastry restaurant.  There was a ton of people at the pools but because there's so much space it was never crowded.  Never made it into Liquid but the other hotel pools were great.  The drinks at the pool bar were a hefty $16 bucks a pop but that's par for the course at most pools in Vegas.  Casino smelt like vanilla which made for a pleasant time gambling.

Waited in room another 15+ minutes for keys to be delivered as promised. Of course they couldn't get that right either, because only 2 arrived.

Room was nice enought to make me forget about my 2 hour hell-acious check-in process though.

Pools are not designed for kids. The three shallow egg-shaped pools had the boys yawning & asking to go to the Monte Carlo again. 

Buffet is a good value comparable to what we saw and paid elsewhere. The gourmet dinner comes with 1\/2 lobster.

To suggest that the MGM folks might've outdone themselves with this one may be an understatement depending on who you're asking, but one cannot ignore the lush and contemporary flavor that the Aria brings to the city.

The only property within the CityCenter umbrella with a casino is Aria. The floor is not as impressive as other nearby resorts, but is certainly no slouch with a decent array of machine and table games. Some folks may enjoy the sports book with its abundant sea of TVs and spacious seating area. Kudos to the casino marketing folks for keeping the promotions constant and a nod goes to the stellar staff of dealers and cocktail wait staff for keeping things classy.

I haven't had a chance to stay in the Aria admittedly, but I am fairly familiar with their rooms, all of which are comfy, stylish, and gorgeous. The regular rooms should fare just fine for most patrons, try to score midweek room rates if you can since they're crazy pricey on the weekends (the high suites are no joke anytime during the week). Also located within the casino is a massive 3 story convention center, a major treat for those of us coming to Sin City on business. That itself is an amazing spot of the resort.

If there is an attraction that makes the Aria worth checking out, it's the pool area. Not the Cirque du Soleil show (Elvis?) or sigh worthy nightlife, the pool deck is massive, containing a series of mini pools as well as one public pool. Unlike its CC cousin Vdara, there shouldn't be any building caused sunburns. (See here: http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/travel\/article-1316444\/Las-Vegas-death-ray-hotel-leaves-guests-badly-burnt.html) 

On a food front, the Aria has a wide selection of distinctive eateries. The obligatory casino buffet (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-buffet-at-aria-las-vegas-2#query:Aria%20Restaurants dubbed ""The Buffet at Aria"") is predictably boring and pricey, while the Aria Cafe (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/aria-caf%C3%A9-las-vegas) is downright no bueno. For being one of the only dedicated Thai restaurants on the strip, Lemongrass (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/lemongrass-las-vegas) isn't terrible but barMASA (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/barmasa-las-vegas) is. If there were only two establishments worth mentioning, let it be the tapas friendly Julian Serrano (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/julian-serrano-las-vegas) and Sage (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/sage-las-vegas-2), which is not only best restaurant but easily one of the finest on the Strip.

Like any good casino property, Aria does a solid job of keeping itself afloat with what it has. Whether or not it was worth the billion + to put together is debatable, but if the City Center is a must visit on your Vegas check list, then the Aria should be the first and last stop.",4,2,3

Being that as it may, I was impressed with the architecture driving in to Aria.  You do have to stay on the left hand side as you enter and it is a bit awkward once you go into the parking garage so follow the signs.

Setting and layout depicts a futuristic\/contemporary faucade.  Behind all this is typical Vegas.  You have shopping nearby at Crystals, though there are high end stores that are out of reach for the average joe.

There is convenient transportation from Aria to the adjacent hotels and Crystals using the monorail.  Even getting to Bellagio is not a far stretch.

There is also a Convention Center here.  Convention Center staff was friendly as they help guest during the event, whether it is with the food or helping those trying to get directions around Aria.  There are Flat Panel LCDs in front of the Convention Center rooms for the event schedules.  They definitely provide top notch service.

Layout within Aria is a bit confusing.  In the center of the hotel is the casino.  You can easily get disoriented and get confused which way it is to the parking garage.

There is a decent choice of restaurants as well as a buffet.  Our stay at Aria was business and much of the pleasure was not spent eating at the various restaurants.  The only one we frequently went to was Jean Philippe for the pastries and crepes.

The room we stayed at had a king sized bed.  We asked for a roll away bed for the kids and they provided that in a timely manner.  The kids had fun playing with the controls.  Lights, blinds, and TV can be all turned off via a control center.  From dimming the lights or just adjusting the blinds, all can be done with touch screen.  Kinda cool until you press the wrong button while your wife is watching TV and everything turns off.  So get familiar with the settings so you do not get yelled at.

The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of the 5 star is because of the casino and the smoking.  7 years ago, I might have given this hotel a 5 star rating, and I understand that this is Vegas, but when you have kids priorities change.",1,1,2

First of all, ARIA is a lot of fun to stay in, as the casino is huge and the rooms are too.  The bathroom is big, luxurious, and reminds me of the bathroom I had living in a mansion in Shanghai, China a few years ago.  The room is very technologically advanced and everything can be controlled from your TV.   Also the room service is very complete and provides you everything you need, whether it is enough bath towels, tissues, bed sheets, pillows, body lotion, shampoo, you name it!

The pool is very big, and Haze nightclub and Gold Lounge are great at night.  I wasn't a huge fan of Haze, but Gold Lounge has a fantastic open bar from 10-12 on certain nights for just $20.  You can't beat that in Vegas!  Speaking of which, the mini bar prices are reasonable and very complete in its inventory. The location of the hotel was very convenient as well.  Finally, I was impressed by the amount of security at the resort and felt safe.

The only two things I didn't like about ARIA is that there involved a lot of walking from the garages to the rooms to checkout, etc.. However the hotel does a good job of making checkout very convenient (by text, email, or in person).  Also, this may be just from my experience, but the casino here is very unlucky.  I have lost all the money I bet and sometimes even felt the roulette tables were rigged.  I mean, what are the odds of 3 0's in a row then 9 reds in a row?  Apparently likely enough to happen when I bet half of my life savings on black.",0,0,0

The bedding area is seriously small with not eating space, they have to roll in a table for room service.  The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have stayed in on the strip.  That said...seriously we were just NO impressed with the rooms.  We also did not care for the casino, dark and smoky.  I did look like they had some pretty good machines but we played somewhere else.  Also room lighting was really dark and everything remote controlled which didn't work all that great.

But not as much as you, you see
But I still love technology
Always and forever

When I walked into my Aria abode and was greeted by automatically opening curtains and mood music, I knew I would have to start my review with a tribute to Kip. I don't even love technology that much, but electric curtains get me every time, especially if they open in a grandiose manner upon me entering the room. 

Aria was stop 2 on our staycation circuit. We were invited guests thanks to my husband's Asian last name and affinity for table games. Seriously, this combo is the holy grail to casinos. However, we had checked, and if you were a MGM Players' Club member rooms were $99\/night! Well worth it.

Based on my prior casino floor visits, I would have given Aria 3 stars at best because I thought it was dark, and I didn't really appreciate the design scheme. However, I think they have added some additional lighting. I still think the casino floor is a tad ugly, but it is new. The impressive public art collection makes up for some of the bad materials. For example, I really don't like the tile floors. But, I am not a gambler, so I care more about the room.

I love the room! Of course, it helps that everything is super new. My only complaint is that the water pressure does not compare to some other properties, but they have a nice tub in shower layout which lets you fill up the tub to overflowing, as it pours out into the shower! Love it! And, the technology is impressive. There is a magical touch screen remote that controls everything from the TV to the curtains to the thermostat. The room decor is modern, and I liked it. The view is great. You definitely feel as if you have escaped to a retreat in the sky.

I also love the pool area. There were at least 3 large pools and 3 huge hot tubs. When we were there, we basically had an entire hot tub and pool to ourselves! I am sure that might not be the case during summer time highs, but even so, I think they have done a great job with the cement ponds. Simple, but ample liquid square footage.

The cafes are not so bueno, so I would suggest going next door to Bellagio for your quick bites.

We love to stay at the Encore and or The Wynn.  Those hotels are the top of the top for sure. 
We like to play Pai Gow but the Encore only has ONE Pai Gow table and its frustrating because you cannot always get a seat. 
We happened upon the Aria casino last time we were in Vegas.  They have an entire Pit of Pai Gow tables. 
This time we decided to stay at the Aria hotel.   Here are my pros and cons on this particular property. 
Because Its new, the casino is clean and you cannot smell the smoke at all!   The ventilation system is amazing!  There are LOTS of tables and slot machines to choose from. 
The Dealers are nice and very fun to play with.
There are a lot of different restaurants and cafe's in this hotel.  You can get just about anything. 
They have a new ""players"" card system that gives you points on EVERYTHING!  So be sure to give it to the dealers, use it in the slot machines and show it to every restaurant and shop you go too, so that the points will add up. And as the points add up you can even use them for shopping in the high end shops.   As your points add up you will get a different colored card to show that you are basically a High roller, VIP, etc.  
You can use those points for the room, food anything. 
The rooms were nice, a bit smaller than we are used too from Palazzo and Encore but still nice.  And the BED OH MY!  It was so wonderful! 
We had a great view of the strip and it was fun to just sit and watch the lights at nite while having a late nite cocktail. 
This hotel is pretty much in the heart of the strip, so you can get to any other hotel, show, restaurant, shopping, etc. easily. 
There is a tram that will take you back and forth to Bellagio if you want and to the shopping complex. 
They shopping there is called ""Crystals"" and it is only high end, Prada, Gucci, etc. 
The rooms were a reasonable rate and the casino was hopping ALL the time.  Fun!  

A few things that were cons... they do not give you enough or the proper linens.  Not enough towels, not a mat for the floor outside the shower.. I thought that was odd. 
They do not replace the toilet paper, you have to ask for that, or at least we did. 
They do not have a tea or coffee service in the room so that you can make yourself a cup of tea before you leave the room or while you are getting ready. 
The room is small, not a lot of room to walk around or even have friends up to the room if you wanted.  
Because we are used to staying at the other end of the strip that is quieter, I found this hotel to be really noisy both inside and out. 

BUT all in all, we had a goof time.   We will be staying here again for sure. 

Now go have fun!! 
Next time we will def. upgrade to a suite.",2,0,0

I am usually not a fan of Vegas, I came because my friend wanted to visit and I thought.. why not? So, off we trekked from Colorado and we set out to enjoy ourselves kid free. Moms vacation! Anyway, I LOVED the room we stayed in. We opted out of an upgrade for the strip view and I'm glad I brought my sound machine. You really can't drown out motorcycles. Other than that, the room was awesome. I loved the high tech controls (I'm not sure if all hotels come with that now?) and I loved the design. Our favorite thing about this hotel was the lift bar. They had live music and a great place to sit for people watching. Our last night there, we had a phenomenal bartender (he was from New York, Fred?) but the service on the floor was awful. The waitress wouldn't even make eye contact with us. Too bad, there are probably some great tips that she's missing out on out there.  The breakfast buffet was pretty good. They could have more selection but you definitely can't beat bottomless mimosas (extra, of course). I was disappointed with Expedia. We booked a package and it stated that we had breakfast buffet included with every day we were there.. but then when we checked in, we were informed that it was only a $100 credit. So basically, two and half meals? Not the hotels fault, but we weren't expecting that extra cost. The pools looked nice but we were unable to enjoy them like we had hoped. The spa was AMAZING! I had a relaxing message and a red carpet facial. SO worth the splurge. Our check in process was flawless and when we were printing our boarding passes the night before, we had a great helper at the front. I wish I could remember his name. He was funny and helpful. We took and uber to and from the hotel with absolutely no issues and the staff all seemed great (except the waitstaff, they just seemed like they didn't want to be there and weren't super friendly.

After some recommendations we were convinced this would be a great choice for a friends bachelorette party since we were all on a tight budget and the rates were great at $119 per night. 

Upon arrival, the checkout lines are very long and super unorganized. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. 
We asked for connecting rooms and I must say this was the best\/worst part of the trip. 

One room had MANY problems but the biggest was a a putred smell in the toilette\/bathroom area. This problem was attempted to be cleaned but nothing would help. The room itself was very small for a Vegas hotel room, the lighting was confusing and would turn off during showers, and the TV would freeze every minute. 

The other room was just as small, had TV problems but no smell in the bathroom. 

We were so frustrated with the problem in one room as 8 girls had to use one bathroom for most of the trip, we tried to call several times for an engineer to come up but realized that most of the staff just doesnt have enough training. Every person on the phone had a different answer to the same question and one example being ""Do you have an in house Dr?"" One person says no, the other yes. This is a basic safety question. 

Since we were all set up for the bachelorette, on the last day a manager offered to move us to another room but we would have to seperate the group which wouldnt work for us. 

In the end, we told them the entire story, all our frustrations and they comped us the total charge for the one room that had issues. The manager was very professional and we appreciated the comp. 

I can tell you that I will not be staying at the Aria again as I also didnt really like being away from everything, no affordable options to eat anything in the hotel, weird scent throughout, small pools and in general, it needs to have more of the Vegas flare in terms of service. Maybe in a year or two it will work out these kinks and I might try it again.",12,3,5

the room was allllllll the way at the end of the building. literally one other room separating mine from being part of the outline of the building on the blueprint. that walk from the elevator sucked balls especially when drunk.

my room was amazing- tons of space, power shades\/blackout curtain, Aria tablet to control everything in the room. I had no complaints bc i only needed the room for the 3 S's (shit, shower, sleep) but the table lamp wasnt functional and the controls for the bedside lamps were reversed. not a big deal since they served their purpose but confusing when trying to control it.

also what was a tad annoying was the power curtains made the most horrible noise when riding its rail to open or close. a little WD-40 goes a long way.

That was the kind of experience that I thought I'd have my first time in Vegas. Crazy parties, waking up with wild animals in my room, and falling asleep on the roof. Imagine my disappointment when I realized that the Aria wasn't going to provide me with that experience. Don't get me wrong, the Aria is a gorgeous hotel that smells very delightful, it's just not the type of hotel that I was expecting. We stayed here for our wedding with about 30 of our friends and family. They all LOVED everything about the Aria, but then again they're all older and have been to Vegas before so they knew what to expect.

Pros:
-The freaking gelato. I loved the little cafe upstairs. Somewhat affordable and great food including breakfast, lunch and my fave: gelato.
-Aroma -- A few other hotels we walked through reeked of smoke. I never smelled smoke once inside of the Aria.
-Location - lots to do within walking distance, including a CVS to get cheap liquor and food. Also, there's a tram that runs between Aria, Vdara and Bellagio, so we frequented that to escape the heat.
-I have mad love for the buffet. We went there once for dinner and for brunch the morning after our wedding. The staff was great and the food was delicious.
-Absolutely gorgeous hotel.
-Digital roulette! Maybe this should be a con though as my husband was a perpetual loser.

Cons:
-Check-in was sooooo slow. Disclaimer, I'm not that patient though, so take that with a grain of salt.
-Price of food. Wow, really? I know it's a resort and I know it's Vegas, but we really didn't eat inside of the hotel except for once at Julian Serrano and the buffet. We walked over to NY-NY (see my review on Greenberg's Deli) and the Monte Carlo for cheaper options.
-We couldn't get coffee in the wee hours of the morning! We woke up early the day we were leaving and it was before the breakfast spots opened. The waitresses on the gaming floor told us they didn't have coffee to serve us, but we could have liquor if we wanted. Yeah, um.  No thanks, I drank for a week straight.

I really wanted to give the hotel 3.5 stars but opted for 4 since that wasn't an option. I think that you can't go wrong if you book the Aria, but to satisfy my taste we would probably stay at the Hard Rock next time.

Also, after reading a lot of reviews talking about the resort fee, this is actually common knowledge and I found it on every website that I visited. Most hotels on the strip charge them, with the exception of Paris and Planet Hollywood (maybe a few others too.) I agree, you think you're getting a great deal, but then you dock on another $140 in resort fees alone, it's not that great anymore.",3,2,0

We checked out over the phone, so we avoided the lines there too! And I even called casino marketing to get my comp over the phone. The hotel is beautifully designed. The rooms are comfortable and the technology is awesome. Our room was on the 36th floor and had a great view of the mountains. I liked that the elevators were attended. The hotel has a great location on the strip and aot of other hotels, casinos and restaurants were within walking distance. There is also a tram that will go to other City Centre or MGM properties.

Casino - I give the casino 4 stars. Definitely a place to be seen. They have 12 crap tables which were all busy on a Saturday night. The blackjacks games were ok and I was able to find a good table here and there, but there were some times when the tables looked very depressing.

The room accomodations were plush. Probably a top 3 comfortable bed (Shangri La in Manila and the W in Seattle top my list), automatic EVERYTHING... lights, TV, curtains, that are controled through an iPad like clock.

My only gripe is that there is no priority to getting into Haze despite being a guest. I know most Vegas hotels will give you at least a separate line or priority entrance since you are a patron... pretty lame that they don't do this, especially considering that Haze is just ok in my book but at least worth checking out.

First of all, we had to change rooms 4 times. Yes- 4 times. Some of the low-lights: paint splattered on the floor, carpet that was SOAKING wet for unknown reasons, windows so dirty we could not see out and one bed didn't have a comforter. All of that didn't really raise my frustration level, but during one moves we called down and they told us that they had updated our card keys and to go to our new room. The keys didn't work and when we asked for help from a hotel worker, they called down and the front desk said they were sending someone to help us. No one showed up and after 40 minutes, we went back down to the front desk.

The worst part about our stay was that in our final room we did not have hot water in our shower. This was not fixed until Saturday evening. 

The hotel gave us lots of resort credit and we got a break on our bill. The front desk was very helpful and the hotel staff was great, the hotel was just not ready to open. Beyond the difficulties we experiences our room, the hotel was fine. it's not mind blowing, but it's a very nice hotel. The gaming area is dark and feels small- but is actually quite large. The Aria shops area (Crystals?) was pretty weak. It's too upscale for 99% of consumers- I don't understand the appeal of it. 

Food: Excellent tapas from Julian Surrano. Easily the best I've ever had. Also tried the ice cream place on the promenade floor-ok, not great. We also hit the buffet- pretty decent food and lots to choose from. Lots of different proteins from prime rib, lamb, duck, oysters, snow crab, shrimp, sushi. Everything was good, clean and held at the right temperature. The food was good for a buffet, but I wouldn't rate is as highly as Bellagio's. 

Also- don't waste your time on the tram. It goes no where and you'll spend more time getting to\/from the tram then you would of if you walked. 

Lastly, while Aria is on the strip, its location is set back quite a bit from the street. Walking out of the hotel to anywhere is a trek- which is saying a lot considering walking anywhere on the strip isn't a quick walk. 

I probably will not stay at Aria again. It's just not the hotel for me- not to say it's not new, flashy and interesting- it is. It's just not all that inviting to me.",3,1,0

We made reservations months in advance and arrived to check in around 9 PM Friday, September 1. Our flight had been delayed and we were eager to check in, get some food and gamble. Well, that didn't go as smoothly as we had hoped. We arrived to the check-in desk and Daniel was in charge of helping us, he let us know that we we're not in the room that we originally booked. He told us our new room was ""exactly the same except there is no tub"" and ""the shower has a rail in it"", oh and! There's more! ""There aren't 2 counters in the bathroom, just one"". So in reality it was nothing like the room we had originally booked and we told him that is not what we wanted. Instead of being accommodating to us he explained that next time we should arrive as early (closest to check in time) as possible to ensure that we get a ""good room"". Knowing he was full of it we asked him to please check if there was another room available for us and he said unfortunately there was not because they were all booked. We then asked if we could pay more and upgrade to a better room. To which he again replied with ""we are all booked"". We stood there in shock and silence not really knowing what to do. He almost reluctantly offered us a $50 credit for food and beverage and he, most definitely, reluctantly offered to ""make note and call"" us the next morning to let us know if ""someone checked out"" and then we could have a room change. We head up to the room and realize that we have a handicap room, there is no counter space, there was a bench and railings in the shower. A very awkward layout for us. We waited for a call Saturday morning which of course we never received so before heading to the pool I decide to call the front desk and let them know our situation. The wonderful lady that helped me was able to switch us to another room! She told us to head down to our new room and she would transfer the keys so we could immediately get settled. Disappointment strikes again, The cards don't work with our new room and the only help we had was from the cleaning staff who called the security guard to help us get into our room. Once in our room we are told that we have to go downstairs to receive new room cards, downstairs we go and another 30 minutes of waiting until someone could finally help us. All in all we spent over an hour waiting around for something that should have been fixed the night we checked in. I am truly disappointed in the service that we received at aria this visit. Daniel was incredibly unhelpful and unwilling to help us.

The only negative that I have is that I think the buffet has gone down hill just slightly since were were there last.

However, the customer service dragged their score done.  Arrived at Saturday, 9\/11 around noon to check in.  It was a little early but the front desk assured us (4 couples with 4 rooms) that while the rooms were ready yet, they were being cleaned.  It wouldn't take more than 2 hours to be done.  All sounded fair since we were early.  Walked around in Crystal and only 1 friend got the call letting her know that her room was ready.  That was 1:30 pm.  We all went to front desk to pick up the key  with her and check on the status of the rest of the rooms.  At this point only 2 out 4 rooms were ready.  We went and chilled in the 2 rooms while waiting for the rest to be done.  

An hour went by and we called front desk to check the status only to be put on hold for 20 minute before being told that they were trying to connect with housekeeping for the status and will call us.  Another10 or 15 went by, and I got impatient.  I went outside and found a housekeeping staff and told her I needed to know if my room which was right next door was ready.  She opened the door to check and sure enough it was a mess.  Housekeeping hadn't got to it yet, and it was 3 pm.  The lady began working on it immediately. 

I went back to my friend's room next door and got a call from front desk saying housekeeping is working on my room.  Duh... I knew that.  I was the one who dragged housekeeping over to clean the room.   40 minutes later, I sent my husband to front desk to complain, and he called to tell me that he got our room key and it was finally ready.  Right after I spoke to him, front desk called to ask me if they should send my key up to my friend's room.  Duh... My husband already go the keys.  Again, that was almost 4 pm!!!  We got there at noon.  

What is wrong with Aria customer service?  1) No communication between front desk and housekeeping; 2) not prioritizing to clean the rooms that guests already tried to check in to.  My conclusion is that MGM group is trying to save a few bucks by not hiring enough cleaning staff and training front desk staff properly.  

I don't think we'll be staying at Aria any time soon until they get their act together and up the customer service standards.

The pools are decent size and they're perfect pools for just lounging. They length of the pool is pretty good also, so if you wake up early enough you can do your morning swimming exercise (if that's your morning routine). 

we also checked out a lounge in aria, Gold Lounge. And as an Aria Guest, we got to go into the lounge for free. Just go to the concierge and they'll take care of you.

They will charge your credit card. Showers were cleaner-modern and with shampoo, conditioner, bar soap and lotion courtesy of the hotel. 

They have restaurants in the casino. One of the best dessert places there. I also made a reservation the Javier's(Mexican Authentic restaurant). It was a little bit on the pricier side BUT well worth it! Their margaritas was THE BOMB! 

My stay was great. I hated to leave but the fun ends there. I did not give a five star due to the rooms that was reserved with the online check-in was not ready in time. Which made it so misleading.

This hotel is spectacular and super new!  

The rooms are spacious and inviting and we loved the shower\/tub and privacy door for the toilet.  The master remote (used to control everything: blinds, TV, lights, thermostat, alarm, radio) is a cool gadget but sometimes not practical...couldn't use easily fine tune my desires quickly enough (ie. turn on all lights but leave the curtains closed...etc)

The staff is helpful and friendly - only dined at Jean Philippe Patisserie on the very last day (DELICIOUS pastries) the staff there was just OK.  

Location: is kinda crappy - on the strip its a pretty central location - pretty smack down in the middle really - the closest Deuce\/Gold bus stop is at Paris about a 5 min walk away...but the only thing is the actual hotel is located behind the Crystals shopping center which means its quite the trek to get out onto the strip.

The  customer service overall is excellent. Checking in can be a process but it seems like they are trying with alternative options. The rooms are all nicely done and the beds are very comfortable. Bar Masa hands down is a favorite. The servers are excellent and knowledgeable as is  Julian Serrano's  both fantastic dining options ! Javiers is also good  for something low key. The only thing that was disappointing was there is no in room coffee maker. Something so little and simple really adds a lot to the experience especially because you don't always want to have to get dressed to  trek across the hotel for a cup of coffee when you wake up. My only other complaint is the breakfast at the café and room service. Its terrible. I only ordered bacon and eggs to which the bacon was barley cooked and the hash browns are served in round doughy mounds of mush which they try to brown on the outside. I think that is the hardest meal to screw up but it's defiantly something that needs much improvement. Perhaps try  a Potato's O'Brien or Classic style hash browns.,0,0,0

- Shuttle drop off location: Not a fan.  Basement garage.  A little confusing trying to go from there to the hotel lobby.  Had to go up 2 sets of escalators and through the entire hotel\/casino to get to the check in.  However, they did station a staff member there to answer your questions and to give you directions.  Still an inconvenience nonetheless.  

- $20 per day resort fee.  (Though it does come with 2 complimentary drinks-wells, beer, or house wine at one of 5 bars inside the Aria).  Still not a fan.

The Good:

- Quick and easy check-in.  Service was decent.  

- Absolutely loved the room, especially if you're technology savvy.  Really enjoyed being able to control EVERYTHING in the room with the touch of a button - tv, music, curtains, temperature, lighting, etc.  I had so much fun playing with the touch-pad remote controller, including setting the alarm so that it would open the curtains and play music at the time I designated.

- Sleeping on the bed was like sleeping on a cloud.  Very comfortable, soft, and fluffy.  Could lie there all day.  

- Overall modern and posh feel.  Loved Loved Loved.  The entire hotel\/casino smelled like cotton candy.  Loved Loved Loved.

- Jean Philippe Patisserie right by the guest elevators.  Gotta give two thumbs up for that!  The pastries were delicious.  

The Tips:

- Save yourself some money and place one name under the room.  I believe it's an extra $30 a night for each additional person in the room.  I'd rather take that $30 and spend it on food or slots.

- Take advantage of the internet kiosks nearby the Bells service desk to do the early check-in for your flight and even print out your boarding pass!

- There are 3 sets of elevators, each set designated for specific floors.  READ the signs!  :)",0,0,0

First off, the presentation is genius.  The Aria, Vdara, Mandarin Oriental and City Centre (not a hotel, but a shopping center) are all situated right next to each other, so you can explore or stay close to home.

Second, the staff are skilled and ever-ready to help.  I had no problems checking in or out, and the spa staff welcomed me like an old friend.

Third, the spaaaaahhhhh...$30 to enter, which is a bit steep compared to similarly-situated hotels, but the amenities are second-to-none.  They have a salt room which improves your circulation, ""hot stone beds"" which you lie on to soothe tired muscles, the usual steam rooms, whirlpool and cold plunge, not to mention the aquatherapy pool that overlooks the city outside.

I went to ""high tea"" at the Mandarin Oriental, which was worth it, even for the $40 price tag (high tea normally runs no more than $24).  Plus, there was a huge group of frat guys there, so I figured the hotel must be doing something right if it's luring people like that in to sip tea.

I'll admit that somehow I thought I was booking a suite at the Encore and not at the Aria (completely separate ends of the strip, different owners, different vibe, different everything), so while I was initially disappointed over my mix up, I quickly became excited after my arrival. My boyfriend and I always book at the Cosmopolitan (next door to the Aria) but we couldn't get in that weekend so I played around on Expedia to find good deals on an awesome suite...which I did at the Aria - the corner suite.

At 1,100 square feet, there was an entrance hall, a guest bathroom, a dining area, a living room, a ginormous master bathroom and bedroom. Did I mention the windows were floor to ceiling? It was pretty sweet, especially with all the high tech toys involved (I am a bit worried that all houses are going to be controlled by one remote like this though, which does not bode well for me considering I kept asking Bryan how to use the remote). And the best part? The suite was just a fraction more than a suite half the size at the Cosmo - and a bit nicer. 

Aside from the suite, the staff was really helpful. I arrived early and since my room wasn't ready, I decided to sit at the bar and play video blackjack (but more importantly drink for free). I chatted with the bartender for awhile and he gave me the good champagne, like the really good stuff. Granted, I was playing high bets, but I still appreciated the gesture. 

My only complaint was that they don't have enough restaurants that are opened before lunch (and even the lunch options are scarce). We only had one place at the Aria to eat breakfast but it was so crowded that we went to other casinos to eat every day. 

I don't know if the Aria will be our new go-to place, but I would definitely love to stay here again, especially in that suite.",8,2,7

From the valet service to walking into the hotel, I was very happy. I hadn't been here in over a year and didn't know where I was supposed to meet my friend.

I was standing in the lobby, probably looking confused as a nice hotel manager walked up to me and asked if he could help me find where I was going? Yes! Thank you, he walked me over to 'Javiers' (Mexican restaurant, damn I forgot to check in). Such a nice gesture.

Ok, so I forgot to check into 'Javier's', but I will elaborate!  HELLO can I say AMAZING! First off the decor is so sexy and decadent. They have rope ceiling ART over the bar area, yes rope! Its quite erotic and dark, I like!
The food was so delicious, I might have a food orgasm.
We ordered(waitress suggestion) the trio of ceviche , with octopus, white fish and tuna. WHAT? LOVE! And an order of the large scallops, another WHAT! YES!!!!
Oh ...and the 4 different salsas and fresh tortilla chips as a compliment to the table. Outstanding service and food.
We also had a split of champagne for fun! Why not, its Monday lunchtime LOL

Its quite pricey, I didn't look at the bill as my friend was treating, but I know it wasn't cheap. Check the menu before going as I have no clue as to the prices. Worth every penny.

Leaving Aria at their valet was easy and didn't take long at all.

It is important to note that while there was a very sweet gift of boxed chocolates and a note from customer service wishing us a great stay waiting for us in the room when we got there, I did not feel that the entire stay was geared towards ""making up for the last.""

The room was kinda small, the 2 beds took up most of the room. Very modern contemporary & spotless design and layout, but surprisingly their attempt at making everything remote-controlled in the room is truly an utter disaster.
I mean it's a cool a idea to have one master control to close\/open curtains, turn lights on\/off, turn the tv on\/off, scratch ur ass, etc etc - but when the master control has problems loading and doesn't work, it gets pretty annoying!
When we got back one night, we couldn't close the curtains before going to sleep. Yes, we had to call room service & they sent engineers to take care of the problem. Not cool at all.
Their beds are super comfy & it felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.

I thought the pool was ok. Not fabulous (like MGM) but not terrible (like NYNY). We spent one afternoon at Liquid, which was much cooler than expected. I would highly recommend it for anyone age 21-30 with a hot body. :) The restaurants were fine. The location was great; despite some other reviews, the hotel is very convenient to the strip and it's a very short walk to Las Vegas Blvd. 

The main thing preventing a 5-star review was the housekeeping -- we were there for 3 nights and our room was never cleaned. Not once. We left our room around 9 am each day, and returned at about 3 pm for a nap. During the time we were away, we had the ""service"" light on... but our room was never cleaned. On the first day, we got a call from the front desk asking if we'd like housekeeping, and we said no (we were already back from the pool and about to nap).

2. Casino doesn't reek of smoke. (Say no to drugs!)
3. Wi-Fi works fairly well throughout casino and room. And more than one device can be on it at same time, unlike some other casinos.
3. Super-friendly housekeeping staff. Don't forget to tip them daily, people!
4. Jean Philippe Patisserie on main level for a quick and delicious snack. Open till midnight for those late-night cravings. (The prosciutto panini and nutella crepe were yummm.)
5. Everything in room is automated so you can control blinds\/lights, etc with the remote.
6. Comfiest beds in Vegas (next to Encore). Zzzzzzz...
7. Delicious CARROT and WATERMELON juice can be ordered from the gaming floor!

9. Check-out is easy as you can do it through TV, text or email. (They email you on day of checkout with a link to review bill. I found this to be the easiet way to check out.)
10. Did I already say I won some CASH MONEY on my most recent stay?! LOL

1. Check-in line can be very long during peak times (unless you have a gold or better Mlife card which allows you priority check-in...thank baby Jesus I made Gold on my most recent stay!).
2. Rooms can be a very far walk from elevator. Not cute if you're wearing 6-in Louboutins unless you think Mariah looked graceful in her ""#Beautiful"" video.
3. $28(!!!) per day resort fee (though as of this year, Harrahs chain hotels, Venetian and Cosmo now charge one as well...BOO!)

Tips: 
1. There's a Starbucks on the Promenade floor if you need your caffeine fix. 
2. The gym has free bottles of water so it's a good place to grab some if you're low. 
3. The buffet kinda sucks so avoid it if you can.
4. Ask for a room near elevator or be prepared to walk 5 miles to get to your room.
5. Join Mlife if you haven't already as points accumulate quickly. Every dollar spent on rooms, food, spa, etc at MGM properties earns points! $1 = 25 points.",4,2,1

Pool is not going to be like Wynn or mandalay or others that have more space or are more open...

Only serious complaint, which is a big one, is that the bed is ultra soft, pillows suck, and the electric curtains, a supposedly very nice and upscale feature, is completely  ruined by the fact that the morning light significantly sips thru the top!!!

Does not allow smoking in the hotel or the poker room, but it does in the casino, this made for a much cleaner feel and smell to the hotel. The poker room chairs are incredibly comfortable, lol, this can also be a bad thing ;) Great food, though spendy, isn't everything in Vegas?! A tablet controls everything in your room, which is awesome, especially being able to turn off lights from bed! I say I wouldn't suggest for kids, but I just wouldn't bring children to Vegas myself, nothing particular to Aria. 

The pools and hot tubs are very nice and open year round, though the hours get limited in late fall, winter and early spring. The service is stellar, great maid service, front desk, and just in general, very friendly and helpful. Great location on the strip, in the thick of it all. Irritating that the refrigerators don't allow personal items and charge you if you move the items in the refrigerators. Really gorgeous and spacious bathroom. Incredibly comfortable bed with great linens and toiletries. Will definitely be coming back here, I have stayed at a few other places on the strip and none compares to this hotel.",1,0,0

I ended up driving in circles and having to exit and try again at another entrance. Thanks for the lack of signs and making it seem like I had to valet my car Aria. Once you finally find the self parking area the entrance requires you to make a left hand turn after you enter a tunnel. Usually not too big of a deal,but they ignorantly added some tall design elements that block your view of on coming traffic. Way to think outside the box. Then once in the parking lot they obviously screwed up and only had parking spaces for half the space on each floor. In other words in designated parking space had a parking spot in-between (full sized) that you could not park in. Result? Can't find a spot and once you do there is a long walk to the elevator awaiting you. No wonder the construction company is in litigation with them. 

Once off the elevator a ugly smelly concrete cheap wood walk way welcomes you towards the actual entrance to Aria. Absolutely the worse by far first impression of any casino I have ever been in. It is so obvious these people have no common sense or clue about design and function. Reminds me of how MGM also messed up that casino design when it opened. Yes I was there. 

So, it just seems poorly designed with mundane features. They obviously didn't hire an innovative architect or simply ignored them. It reminds me of something designed in the late 50's or 60's without any charm. If this is the choice they should have done it all out everywhere including the staff instead of thinking the frame would somehow sustain the guts. Really sad, I can't tell you how many times I rewrote that last paragraph to be less negative.

Anyway, once inside to the casino it is kind of like an downtown office building atrium. ""Yawn"" boring, seen it and has been old for a decade. The casino floor is a casino. Nothing special no great design same old. Plus you get the added benefit of the seemingly tightest machines in Vegas. Don't bother, move on. You have a better chance or at least the illusion of winning somewhere else. 

No excuses, this place is not special in any way.",3,4,2

The hotel is a newer one with a very contemporary design influence. That is actually one of the reasons I wanted to stay here. It is a very large hotel! It would take us a good 10 minutes to get to our room from the lobby. The rooms were nice, and the bathroom was the best part of the room. It was large, updated, with a separate room for the toilet and also separate tub and shower. One nice feature of the room was the room was controlled by a tablet. That was very nice when you finally got to bed and didn't want to deal with shutting the curtains, turning off the TV, or lights - it was all done with one push of a button on the tablet. We had a strip view which was nice, but not great. Aria is located on the strip,but sits back a bit. Therefore, when you have a strip view you can't truly see the whole strip. The Cosmopolitan blocks the left view and then the Mirage on the right. As to be expected all the the restaurants in the hotel were pricey, but had good food. My two favorites were Javier's (Mexican) and Five50 Pizza Bar. The casino was on the smaller side in comparison to others, but we guessed it was because they didn't get as much traffic sitting back off the strip.  Aside from the view, the one letdown was the ventilation system in Aria. You would think with being a newer hotel they would have a ventilation system that pulls out the smoke better. When you walked in you instantly could smell the strong odor of smoke. While in other hotels you clearly could tell they had a great ventilation system and also some sort of air freshener - I mean not everyone loves the smell of smoke!

First I requested a room block of about 10 rooms. We had about 15 people total coming to celebrate with us. I didn't request rooms on the same floor which I will say is my fault.  However I thought they would be on the same floor at least.  We were all scattered throughout the hotel.  Why request a room block if they don't at least put you on the same floor?  The rooms were ok, but no water or coffee in the room.  Which is odd for a hotel in Vegas.  As the primary guest we were told in an email we would have a strip view.  That was a joke, we did see other hotels on the strip but not a strip view was what we were given.
What prompted me to write this review was the service we had that pool.  We reserved a cabana weeks in advance $600 for the day.  When we arrived our cabana I meet the person that would be helping us that day.   As the day passed he got ruder and less helpful.  Not sure if they need to have more people help or what.  One of us asked for a recommendation on a beer, his reply was ""he didn't know our taste buds"", he checked on us a few times when we were able to flag him down.  At the end of the day when were we given our bill he was cold and didn't thank us for coming or asked if we had a good time.  We were nice and didn't ask for anything beyond a few drinks and food orders.  For $600 fee, and over $400 spent in food\/ drink with an 18% gratuity we were expecting a little kinder and better service.  (also you are not allowed to bring your own food or beverages.  The food list is limited and prepackages no substitutes for allergies\/food restrictions).
Lastly a smaller group of us ate at Jean George and again we had a less than friendly waiter.  It was a few things that all added up and I think we all decided to not stay at the Aria again next time we visit Vegas.",0,0,0

So I expected staff would be a bit on edge, but not to the degree of hostility we received. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we were treated AWFULLY by staff. Just to site a couple examples, the bell hop actually asked us, "" Oh my god, all of you need your bags up?""  At the buffet, the waitress asked my friend who was ordering a second drink, ""Really? You need another drink?"" At the cafe in the morning, the check came out faster than the food. At the buffet, the meat was so purple and bloody on my friend's plate the joke was there might still be fur on it... the food at that buffet may have explained why we all had stomach issues later. When using the gym facility they closed 10 minutes early with lights being turned off 15 minutes early.  These examples were just a few of my personal favorites, which doesn't even include all the additional random room charges taxed on to our stay. With that being said, the room was very nice so the Aria does have that going for it, but I will never recommend this hotel to anyone I know (as i am sure my group won't either). I have never been treated so badly at a hotel, especially considering the money it costs to stay at a nice hotel on the strip, but there are so many other hotels which treat guests like people instead of prisoners so next time I will be spending my money at a different Vegas hotel on the strip (Wynn\/Encore is awesome) and that is my recommendation to anyone else who reads this review.

The moment I walked through the doors of the Aria, any fears that I had of being back in Sin City were assuaged.  A blast of sweet vanilla scented air enveloped me as I walked in--the first clue that this is not going to be your typical Vegas experience.  The lobby is sleek and it felt like I was walking into the lobby of a W Hotel.  No ridiculous lines to check in or batches of bridal shower bimbos.  The experience is upscale from the start.  From a smooth and easy check in, I went to the concierge, who immediately booked a table for me at Sage (fantastic!), then off I went to the 54th floor.  YES, the 54th floor baby! Free upgrade at check in--THAT was nice.

The moment I opened the door to the room, the lights came on and the curtains drew back automatically.  The lighting, heat, and entertainment area all controlled by a device that sort of looks like an iPad.  THe room design was nice and with floor to ceiling glass I was able to look down onto the strip from a bird's eye view.  IMPRESSIVE.  The room was nicely appointed and the bedding is the stuff of dreams.  The bathroom had a cool set up and was perfect.

The Aria is so different from the rest because the feel throughout is upscale and sophisticated.  Unlike some of the allegedly upscale dinosaurs on the strip, the Aria has a hip and almost European feel to it--perhaps largely due to the amazing patisserie and gelato bar on the casino floor.  Yes, there is a casino obviously, this is Vegas right, but you NEVER get overwhelmed by it.  For the life of me, I don't even remember hearing a single ""ding-ding-ding!""  Clearly, the designers of the Aria were astute enough to make the gaming experience discreet.

The suite had two bedrooms each with its own humongous bathroom (and his and her sinks), living room, bar, powder room, and breakfast table.  Did I mention that the view is spectacular? 

The cleaning lady did a great job with our rooms.  I must say we were pretty messy and careless but after she paid our room a visit, it was spotless.  They provided extra amenities such as shampoo, lotion, slippers, soap without us even having to ask.  She even went out of her way to gather all the jewelry in one area and placed them on a kleenex so it wouldn't get scratched.  What amazed me was that she rolled up my iPhone charger cord as well.  Subtle things like that make a huge difference.  

Do you ever dread going to the restroom in the middle of a cold night? Have no fear! The heated toilet seat\/bidet is here! On top of that, there is also a steamed shower so it's all nice and toasty when you walk in.  Heaven.   

No need for long lines when you check in\/out.  Those who reserve suites have their own counter.  

Jean Philippe is also here (the other is in the Bellagio), which has awesome sandwiches, pastries, chocolates, desserts.  Heaven. 

Also, since Aria is one of the newer hotels, it doesn't smell like smoke as much as the others.  In fact, it smells like vanilla.  Heaven.

Since I was there for a couple's vow renewal, I got to check out the wedding chapel, the bride's room, Gold Lounge, and Haze.  I must say it was pretty damn amazing.  Haze was OK though.  I was expecting something more spectacular since I was in Vegas but was disappointed.

ARIA has the ""personality"" and image to attract guests. I say that because the crowd here is definitely catered to a younger crowd. The hotel and casino is very classy, but in a modern\/contemporary sense. You'll see it in the design and architecture, as well as the furnishings and amenities. The hotel itself is large, and I literally got lost while trying to find my way back towards Crystals. 

I'm surprised someone said the casino is small, because that is definitely not the case. The game floor is huge, with game tables pretty much occupying all areas near the walkways, while everything else either has its own area or is thrown in with other games. What I like most about the casino here is that there are cafes, restaurants, and bars inside it. Most of the casinos I've played at on The Strip have them separated, so this is a convenient setup. Lastly, I wasn't a fan of the lack of ATM\/cash breaker machines. One of the machines near the last row of slot machines went out of order while I was here, and the line was ridiculous.

The Aria is apart of the new ""City Center"" and has a very modern feel. My room was clean and with the times of technology. Everything in your room can be controlled via a remote and your TV. The lights, the curtains, the central air system and so forth. It's a very neat feature which makes you feel richer than you are. 

I have been to several resorts and casinos now in Vegas and this was certainly more pricey than than the norm; you could tell it was recently built. When it cost 30 dollars to go eat at the breakfast buffet, I think you have a problem on your hands. While the found throughout was good, the service did not always hold up. I'll go into more detail there once I start reviewing the individual restaurants within. 

My final gripe comes with the vanilla smelled perfume they constantly spray throughout the hotel. At first it smells nice, but then you quickly begin to feel ill. They are mimicking the Venetian Resort which I can't stand to stay at due to this one feature. At the Venetian it is over powering and the Aria is soon to follow.

Overall the place is nice and modern. It's in a central location which is nice if you like to walk and check out other areas of Vegas. As I said before, I've been to Vegas several times now and this resort didn't have that ""wow"" factor for me. That said, I would not discourage staying here. Overall I was pleased.",3,0,0

I'm willing to stay here again, but given the plethora of other choices available around town and my all time favorite Encore dishing out sick rates, I don't know if another stay at Aria is in order anytime soon.

Anyways...

I understand that I came to this place on opening weekend and that I'd be their guinea pig. I drove my car into the valet early in the afternoon and the car attendants were still figuring out how to organize everybody. I sat in there for about 10 minutes before I was tended to, ""It's okay - opening weekend, opening weekend"" I kept telling myself. I dropped my car off and heard the valet about to stall out in my Porsche 997 Turbo (and by Porsche I mean dinky little Acura). 

It was a nice day and I marveled at the sight of the monstrosity of a hotel and casino in front of me. Streams of water shot up and collided in the sky and burst with colour and the sun bounced off the glass of the building. This can't be too bad I said to myself. I walked in to the lobby of Aria and I just tried to soak in everything. This place is grand. Grand on a scale of holy shit. Gorgeous ultra modern interior with a lot of browns, blues and glass. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be in Aria during an earthquake.

The receptionist was very friendly, she explained to me that things were still being worked out and things may or may not work. Got it pretty young thing at the front desk.

I navigated through the casino and was taken back by how dim the place was. For a place that prides itself on allowing a lot of natural light in their casino for an experience you'll never forget - it just felt like half the lights were on. After making a loop around the slot machines (cause I got lost), I made my way to the elevator. I made my way to the 53rd floor and put my keycard to the sensor and voila...

The very first person to stay in this room. How do I know? They forgot to take the plastic off half the things in the room. The toilet still had tape on it, the shower head had protective film, scale had the battery tab still in and a mess of other things. But you know, I expected it and took it for what it is. I opened up the windows, which looked very dirty and saw the back of Vdara and I-15. Lovely.

The standard room itself is pretty small. The furnishings had the same dark tones as the rest of the hotel but the technology was state of the art. The Control 4 system literally controls everything in the room. From lighting, TV, music, and shades. The bed was comfortable and I slept like a rock and woke up the next morning to promptly vomit in the brand new toilet. So overall, nice room but nothing that wows you.

Overall this place could have had so much more potential. I was very excited for City Center to open and expected a new wave of awesomeness but it just left me underwhelmed. There's nothing here that stands out as unique. Gone away are the themed resorts and this place tries way too hard to be a Wynn resort of which it clearly falls flat on its face.

As stated before, I don't know if I'll stay here again, but I'm not ruling it out.

Tip: Know your way out of this place. When I was drunk I thought it was a good idea to go pick up my car from TI's valet but I ended up running circles around the casino and losing a few hundred bucks on craps. Well played Aria, well played.",3,0,0

No complaints about the customer service since out check in was quick. The entrance to the place was kind of hard to find at first. Heard a lot about the hotel ""being off the strip"" but that wasn't the case at all! It's a fairly quick walk to Cosmo, just cut through the Crystal shopping center and you'll beat the heat. 

The casino was clean and did not smell like cigarette smoke which is a huge problem I have with other casinos. A lot of selections of food to choose from but not all of it was great. We did manage to eat at Aria buffet during our stay also. The saving grace was the abundant amounts of king crab legs up for grabs. 

Room wise was standard to most Las Vegas rooms. Aria standard room which we stayed in was a little bigger than the rest. Windows were nice and clean and the room was fairly technology savvvy. By the time we checked out I still couldn't figure out the control pad.

The hotel is super modern and high tech as everyone else states, but that's about it.  I definitely did not feel like I was in a 5 star hotel because I didn't experience luxury.  Our view was nice, and we were upgraded to a nice view where we could partially see the Bellagio fountains, but the room and decorations were just okay.

The check in line was long, but our front desk person was great.  Very friendly service goes a long way when you have had a long travel day from the east coast.  The more you tip, the better service you get.

I didn't particularly like gambling in this casino because I didn't want to go broke.  The table minimums and slot machines were kind of ridiculous per game...so we walked to some of the lower ended casinos most of  the time.

I would stay at this hotel again if I could get another discounted rate.  Paying $28 in resort fees per day (on top of the daily rate) can add up especially if you don't use the hotel's amenities during your stay.

This problem affected many other lights in the suite.

The bathroom and bedrooms are really nice with plenty of room. Theres a device on the side of the bed that allows you to control everything without leaving bed. The beds at this hotel was the most comfortable bed I've stayed at in all Vegas. I ended up buying two pillows to take home since it was soooo perfect. The hotel is also within walking distance to the Cosmopolitan, Vdara, and Bellagio which is nice if you plan on skipping out on driving during your stay. The hotel lobby and main floor had this musky vanilla scent that was overwhelming and gave all of us all a headache.

Their 24 hour restaurant is horrible and overpriced. I mean, incredibly overpriced with only a few options. I could have eaten better food at a Denny's.

You get a little electronic controller that lets you control everything in the room: the TV, the radio, the lights, the blinds, everything.  You can use any combination as your alarm clock, and I really enjoyed that.  First, I had the outer blinds open, letting in some light.  Five minutes later, the sheer blinds opened and I had a view of the other hotels on the strip.  Then, some music to get me going.  Awesome!

The bed was so insanely comfortable, even that didn't make me want to get up.

The bathroom was nice and well-lit.  Everything was spotless, of course.  Even the closets were gorgeous and my clothes even felt spoiled.

Room was spacious with a foyer,  1\/2 bath, sitting area (w\/flat screen & desk), king bedroom, and bathroom. The sitting room had a butler's pantry with mini-bar and separate fridge that had an ice maker in it - had never seen that feature before in a mini-fridge and it was a great addition. Bedroom was average sized (not huge, but spacious enough that we weren't tripping over each other). The bed was the best I've ever slept in. In fact, we're considering purchasing one from the Aria ""at home"" site. The only thing lacking was closet space.

The standard rooms have a big armoire area when you first enter, but that is not replicated in the suites. Instead we had a smaller closet and a dresser. The dresser had a mirror hung over it, which was a bit of a waste of space since you have two mirrors in the main bath, one in the  1\/2 bath, and a full mirror over the butler's pantry. Would suggest that they replace the dresser\/mirror combo with a full-sized standing armoire. The bathroom was fabulous. Two vanities with lots of storage (including a drawer). A free-standing whirlpool tub and glassed in shower w\/rainshower head. I thought it was a steam shower at first due to the glass and in-shower bench, but it isn't. The toilet probably cost more than my first car --- had a control panel on the wall with heated seat, various ""washing"" options, and a dryer. As most other reviews have noted, the whole room is controlled via a control panel. 

The spa was incredible. It's $30\/day to use the workout facilities and spa area. Kind of steep, but they waive the fee if you get a spa treatment. You can also purchase 3 days for $80 and it's good for use for up to 1 year. I didn't get any treatments, but I did use the gym and the spa. You are provided a locker with a digital lock, robe, and flip flops (standard for any good spa). There's a steam room, sauna, large hot tub, smaller hot tub, and cold plunge pool in the gender-specific locker rooms. The outdoor deck adjoining both locker rooms has a hydrotherapy pool that overlooks their Liquid pool --- this was my favorite part of the spa. In the co-ed area there is the shio salt room and ganbanyoku beds. I really didn't get the point of the salt room. You just sit in there on these vibrating chairs and absorb the air. The ganbanyoku beds are basically hot marble slabs that you lay on. They were surprisingly comfortable and very relaxing. The locker rooms also have an extensive collection of sodas, teas, coffee, water, and fruit selection (included in cost). They are also equipped lotions, razors, combs, toothbrushes, hair gels, hair dryers, etc so that you don't have to bring anything with you. 

The casino is not huge, but it's not small either. Blackjack and craps start at $10 during the day. Most lower-limit BJ is dealt via auto-dealer (boo). Poker room never looked very busy. Drink service is good at the tables, just so-so at slots. Ate at the café (Vettro) for one meal. It was pricey, but decent quality. It was also about 2am and the entertainment provided via the people-watching was worth the price of the meal alone. Also ate at the Wolfgang Puck Brassiere in Crystals (adjoining Aria). Very good and not unreasonably priced. Checking in wasn't too terrible and we were able to get into a room around 1pm. The only big issue that I had with Aria was the check out process. I just don't understand how such a technologically advanced resort doesn't offer expedited checkout via the TV. We had to actually go downstairs and stand in line to checkout. I don't get it....even Holiday Inn Express offers TV checkout. Weird. Overally, a great place. It's less than a 5 minute walk to the strip - probably even faster than navigating through MGM. We've stayed at multiple resorts in Vegas (MGM, Monte Carlo, Palazzo, Mirage, TheHotel at MBay, etc) and I doubt that we will ever stay anyplace but Aria again.

Having previously stayed at the MGM Grand, The Luxor, The Mirage and - now - the Aria.  It's kind of cool, all these hotels are at different price levels, different parts of the strip, etc.  

My clear favorite is still the Mirage.  

Aria is a beautiful hotel.  Rooms are modern and clean.  The staff were courteous and welcoming.  Concierge was extremely helpful.  Overall, what holds this hotel back is that it's a little tucked back from the strip.  The shortest way to come direct off strip walk was through Crystals and our friends had a difficult time driving in to pick us up when we did drive.  It got a little tiresome to do this.  Also, a little hike to the monorail.   Additionally, I find the Aria's coolness a little cold.  The promenade feels too large, with nothing filling it except marble, some fountains, etc.  A lot of expanse with not much going on.  

The Buffet was a definite highlight.  A very good buffet here with crab legs, mussels, shrimp, ceviche, Asian \/ Indian \/ Mediterranean flair if you so choose.  Lots of different foods.  

Here's where the Mirage wins, sheer size.  I'm not sure if the Mirage rooms are larger, but the basic suite felt much larger.  It felt at least a couple hundred feet larger.  The towels at the Aria are also pretty poor quality.  I'm not one to really harp on towels, but these were so rough, I wish I had brought my own.  

In future visits, I'll go the Mirage before the Aria, hands down.  But compared to other hotels in Vegas, it is a decent choice.  Most people won't be let down here.  I just had higher expectations than the Mirage --- which did not come to fruition.",1,0,0

Anyway. 

Our late flight and need for a meal deposited us in Aria's lobby in the wee hours of the morning. We do not have a bedtime when we are in Vegas, but were ready to have a shower and relax. There was not a line to check in, as it was late, but our hang-up began right away. 

My husband and I do not like to use credit cards and work primarily in cash. We had called two weeks ahead of time to confirm that we would be able to make our amenities deposit in cash. First I called and then my husband called a few days later to make sure we received the same answer, which we did. 

Apparently something was lost in translation between the reservationists and front desk staff. No sooner than we gave our name and our reservation was brought up were we asked for our credit card. Tired but patient, I explained what we were told over the phone. And was denied my request by the front desk woman. 

Patience gone, cue welling anger.

*Blink.* ""I need to speak with your manager."" 

Fortunately, the manager, David, was not far away. He approached us and introduced himself and began explaining the same information that the front desk woman was hitting us with. I took a deep cleansing breath and explained, in great detail, what my husband and I were told, on two separate occasions, over the phone. David granted our request. 

I was grateful that the situation was rectified quickly, but annoyed as hell that it occurred at all. Especially the moment we checked in, after doing our research and being told that this would not be a problem. While I was speaking to the desk staff, my husband noticed that a man near us was having it out with another desk staff member. He had been grossly overcharged and was being given the run-around. Well, this is promising. 

We did not want this to ruin our good time and since it was behind us, we headed to our room. I do appreciate the fact that at each entrance to the hotel from the casino, there is a staffed podium where you have to present your key to be allowed through to the hotel elevators. Some may find this to be a pain in the butt and even my husband ended up without access when he forgot his key (fortunately I was upstairs in the room,) but it is a good safety measure. 

For a standard king room, we were NOT disappointed. Our annoyance was washed away when we began exploring the classy and tech-friendly features of our room! Our favorites were the iPad-esque universal ""room remote"" on one of the nightstands, the multiple outlets on the base of the bedside lamp and the electronic window shades and curtains. When lying in bed, all we had to do was reach our hand up, push one of the buttons on the wall and could turn off the lights in the room or open and close the shades\/curtains. 

Our view was of the hotel pools and some of the strip, so we were pleased with that.  The pools were a disappointment. Too many people drinking too much beer and not enough bathroom breaks. The water was murky by the end of the day....

At check-in, we were given a $75 resort credit, which we used for breakfast. I must say, the restaurants in the hotel were...okay. They were by no means bad, but everything began to taste the same.

One day, I may be willing to stay at Aria again. Maybe. But there are many other places to try. Aside from aesthetics, there really was not much to write home about here.",0,1,0

During check in it was a bit of a hassle. There were reservations for 2 deluxe queen sized beds but upon check in, front desk informed me that they were all sold out of those rooms and that I would get a single deluxe bed with a rollout bed? Tf?! What's the point of making a reservation when all the rooms are occupied? That's the reason why I've deducted a star. 

But somehow the concierge was working on something and 10 minutes later a room opened up. I was like okaayyyyy, all of a sudden. I mean this hotel prolly has hundreds maybe even thousands of rooms and you almost didn't have the room I reserved available?

Anyway other than that the rooms were great! As you walk in the curtains automatically open showing you the great view outside the Aria. Nice touch! Mos def a snap chat moment! LOL

There were double closets, 4 robes, and 4 slippers! The only thing was there wasn't much lighting in front of the main mirror.
Beds were comfortable. Bathroom was nice and clean. Now the lighting in the bathroom is on point! Perfect for Selfies! There was a shower, tub, separate toilet, and two sinks. There's a mini bar that charges and snacks if you're too lazy to go down to the shops. Overall room was great!

Room service was awesome and sweet. They really add a nice touch because when I had all my make up stuff scattered everywhere, they organized it for me and placed a paper may underneath it. I gave them a nice tip! We even got complimentary chocolates.

This resort has many dif restaurants to try from and they just opened a new nightclub Jewel. 

I came for The Gatheting for Paul Mitchell. Their convention center is HUGE!

They also have a yummy gelato place you must try!

Overall my stay here was fantastic! Didn't have to leave the resort. Almost everything you need is there!",0,0,0

- a massive wood and stone bathroom with stand alone tub, double sinks               and a 4x5 shower (no steam, however)
- delicious and quick full-service room service breakfast (portions are huge) 
- tv's everywhere

The only good point: We got one of the corner suites and it was lovely. Curtains are push  bottom.  Bathrobes in the room.  Bathtub has it's own self-cleaning thing which is nifty.  Internet works better than many hotels on the strip. The view is fun. Very quiet at all hours. 

Lots of bad points: The self parking area is miles from the hotel lobby. You have to walk up and down, ride escalators and elevators plus drag your luggage through the casino. Not at all an easy or enjoyable trek. When you check in, they tell you about the easier route. This is done to force guests to go by every business in the place hoping you will stop and spend money. 

The tv remote is klunky and slow to respond.  Annoying to try to watch anything. 

The hotel is constantly trying to hustle you. At the bar, in the gym and in the casino. People are creepy sweet and friendly but you know it's a racket. If you sit at the bar and play on the machine, they
 give you a big line about joining their stupid 'Mlife' rewards program. Just comp my drink if I play on your machine and leave me alone!

If you pickup anything in the minibar and don't return it immediately, you are charged for the item-and charged a lot! We looked at a few things and ended up with a $ 45.00 'Refreshment Fee'. The whole setup is on a weight thing so it tells the hotel you used something when you didn't. Can not imagine how many people get stuck with these fees because they they don't  catch it on the bill. I had to go to the front desk to get it removed. What a pain!

I could go on and on. There were so many things I disliked about this hotel.

Tower Suite Pros: 
Fully stocked mini bar in addition to an empty small fridge with ice maker. 
Best lighting in the bathroom. Seriously. I have never taken so many selfies in my entire life as i did in our bathroom.
Spacious. 
Beautiful.

Cons: 
I'm being nit picky here but man, the telephones are frigging loud. I thought the world was ending when we got a call. 
The remotes. Everything is by remote control in these rooms. And at times it got wonky. My husband turned off the tv in the bathroom with the remote and for some reason the jets in the tub turned on. These are all super minor things probably not even worth mentioning.

The amenities are awesomely ridiculous, i.e. heated toilet seat, tablets that control everything from the TV to lights, turndown service in the evening, etc. And the front desk \/ concierge staff were excellent. Especially Kali, at the Tower Suites concierge desk. She tried her best to deal with and fix all the problems we had during our stay. That being said, the morning housekeepers consistently did a horrible job cleaning our room. Plus we had to call down daily just to get towels that should have been replaced already. One of our TVs didn't work for the majority of our week long stay. It took them that long to figure out the problem, and replace it, just in time for us to check out. We were also charged $10 a day for parking, but of course the machines never accepted our room key to enter and leave the garage the entire week. Needless to say, all the bells and whistles we had in our sweet, were nice to have. But for this hotel to slack on the basics, make me wish we had just gone back to the Mirage.

Check-in was long and they were having complications with their system. There's nothing worse than a long check-in when you are ready to go see your room and have some fun. 

Getting to the room it was nice, but the first think I noticed was a flickering light bulb when you first walk in. I let house keeping know and she said she would send someone right away. I said that's fine let themselves in.(we were going to the pool)

The next thing usually besides checking the bathroom is checking out your view. It wasn't a bad view, the window was just sooo freaking dirty. I don't even know how it could be so dirty as if someone poured something liquid out of a window. So that was aggravating.

 We shortly decided To go to the pool where they tried to charge my guy friend 20 bucks! I don't know if we went to the wrong pool or whAt, but we told them we had a room key and they still said guys are 20 girls are free.
We didn't pay, we just walked right in. Why would we pay? We are staying there!

Later on we go back to the room and the light is STILL flickering. What the heck!? It's been hours! And it's one of the lights that is connected to a couple more, so if that one is off the hallway is very dark. So no light. 

I noticed the phone in the bathroom was dusty, so I started looking around the room and everything was freaking dusty! The nightstand was the most dusty I could write in it. And then, the lamp shade was stained. On BOTH sides. It was disgusting!!!!! I don't even know, I don't even want to know. 

So I called concierge and I was pretty mad, they said they could send someone up to clean it right away and someone to change the light bulb. Thy told me they could not comp my stay or give me a new room because they were ""booked"". By this time it was later in the evening and I wanted to go out. So I sated forget it I just want 3 free buffets. So we got them and it was delicious! I do love me some buffet. A few days later I noticed they charged me for the freaking buffets. So I called and if course I wanted my money back blah blah. And finally today I received it back. I even wanted to stay an extra night in Vegas, but all they could do was charge me a room for $80. I was like uh no. Not here. 
I specifically made a yelp so I can share my experience here. It's my first review and I will never, ever stay at aria again. Too many issues and even more AFTER I left.  

Oh yeah and there was glass on the floor when I went to the buffet. Someone could have definitely ""slipped and fell"". 

You would think for being a newer hotel it would be a little more clean, but it was actually pretty beat up. Even the elevator buttons are all dinged up. I'm sure people have had great times here. I've seen such good reviews about Aria, but my time was not the best for me.",4,1,0

We arrived at the Aria hotel pretty late, around 10pm. They lady who checked us in was so nice and gave us a room at the very top floor. The view was awesome. 

We recently stayed at the Wynn in late March so our bars have been set very high after our last visit to Vegas. This hotel has always been on my list of places that I want to stay at and I have to say that I would definitely stay here again! Although the room wasn't as luxurious, it still had many of the features that I appreciated about the room we had at the Wynn. The drapes opened and closed with a press of a button. They provide a tablet at the side of the bed that allows for all drape and lighting functions throughout the room. Through this tablet you can also order room service and much more. 

The bed was very comfortable and the room was just the right size. The bathroom is always what I look at first when booking a room because being a girl who needs good lighting for applying makeup and likes to take fancy, long showers and squeeze in a nice bath, it is very VERY important!!! My boyfriend also says ""if the bathroom isn't better than the one I have at home, then it doesn't feel like a real vacation"". TRUE. 

Enough about the room.... The hotel itself is freaking amazing! I love to just walk through the casino and the lobby because it's decorated so differently than other fancy hotels. The location of this hotel is perfect. Right in the middle of all the good stuff. 
Also, during our last visit to Vegas, we came to see the show here at the Aria called Zarkana. This show is no longer there but it was so amazing. I heard they are replacing it with a new show. I will look forward to seeing the new show here because the seating was set up very nicely. I don't think any seat there would have a bad view. 

The only thing I didn't like was that we chose to go with the self park option rather than to valet, and they charged us $10. It's not a ridiculous amount, I have definitely experienced worse. I just think it is unnecessary for a 5 star hotel to charge their guests for parking. Go ahead and charge people who aren't paying an arm and a leg for a room there. That's understandable. But don't charge your guests a self parking fee for each night! 

Unfortunately, we only got to be in Vegas for a few hours because I had to be back home for work on Saturday evening. Didn't get a chance to check out the pool or any of the restaurants or bars.

This resulted in us having to get their staff to dismantle these features for us, but they were happy to do so. I like the large number of food and beverage options on site (especially Starbucks!). We also took advantage of the two ""free"" buffet meals that were included with our stay. The selection was abundant and delicious! One of the best parts of this hotel is that it's close-by to a lot of things going on, which makes it a very convenient place to stay. Its also very close to the McCarron Airport.

Cool fountains out front.  Rooms very very comfortable with amazing views.  I didn't find any of the automated things (curtains, lights, tv) confusing, as some other posters have.  As with all plush hotels, you can't use the mini 'fridge because it's completely full of honor bar snacks (if you could call it an ""honor bar"" when it's actually booby-trapped to bill your room when you remove a snack--even if you put it right back).  Great bathroom, lighting, beds.  Everything is brand new and squeaky clean.  I'm not a big casino person, but the casino seemed kind of dead.

We came to Vegas for our anniversary and booked our room for three nights back in November. They have several VIP and weekend packages, and we opted for the $100 buy-back option. You can spend $100 on any outlet to charge to your room and can get compensated for it. Pretty good deal, I might say. All in all, I was pretty impressed by Aria. 

The Lobby\/Front Desk area was decorated in fall-themed motif and gives it a welcoming experience. It's pretty spacious and not too cluttered unlike in some other hotels. My only negative comment is the provided seatings weren't too comfortable. They could be museum-piece seatings, but not too friendly on the tush. There is a huge waterfall element designed outside the building that has a calming and relaxing effect. 

Security were stationed in every Elevator Landing so that is a plus in my book. I hate the smell of cigarette smoke, but walking thru their casino was pretty bearable even with plenty of smokers sucking on their cancer sticks was on every table. It wasn't fresh air by all means, but the ventilation unit did its job. 

They have several bars, restaurants, a buffet, clubs and a Jean Phillipe Chocolatier. You can also catch a Cirque Du Soleil show called Zarakana. Concierge and Front Desk were friendly and efficient. Didn't have to deal with Valet since they have a self-park option. (I don't like dealing with Valets since dings and dents always magically appear out of nowhere every time I deal with them) Luckily, I found a parking spot on the 2nd floor near the exit leading to the bridge. The parking stalls are pretty spacious and they have several floors that could easily fit thousands of cars. 

The room - What can I say?

First their key cards are the latest generation and integration of a microchips key access card that doesn't require you to insert the card into a slot. Just wave the card in front of the door handle unit and voila. 

As soon as you open the door, the mood lights and music turn on simultaneously and the curtain automatically opens to give you a wonderful view of the strip. It's pretty breathtaking and gets you in the mood for some bump-n-grind if you're thinking with your other head. 

Subliminal? Nah...these guys know what they're doing for sure. 

You can also control the lighting, TV, music, curtain, temperature and almost everything else inside the room with a touch of a button or with the remote control. Everything is fully integrated and we even have free Wi-Fi in the room. The shower head in the bathroom is effin enormous and spacious and the even the bathtub. The toilet is located on the side and you can do your business in private. I also love the texture of their towels.

Just got back from staying 2 nights at Aria.  They are slowly working out the kinks.  Check-in wasn't a problem.  Upon entering the room, the technology showcases itself which is pretty fun.. but hey...you dont really stay in the room too much when you're in vegas right?

There were some problems with the room.  The entry way lights did not turn off due to a faulty switch which took two phone calls and basically a day to fix.  Also it didn't seem like there was a in house safe in the usual places.  So either I didn't look hard enough\/needs to be clearly labeled somewhere.

Housekeeping - S-L-O-W.  The staff is very friendly and accomodating, however it takes them awhile to get your room cleaned.  It took them until 3pm to get the room made up. 

As far as gaming goes it is very nice, very new.  The pit bosses are really friendly and I won money so I'm not going to complain :)  But I do agree about cell service.  IT SUCKS!  For a technological marvel you would think they would invest in some micro cell sites or something!

Food - 

Cafe Vettro - ugh...i'l save that for another review...bottom line overpriced

The Buffet - serviceable...it looks like\/feels like the old Clifton's Cafeteria

Overall - it is a good experience since I came in knowing there were going to be some issues.   Would I come stay here again - yes.  Would it be my top choice - maybe....location is good, but there's also Bellagio & Caesar's and if I truely want to have the best experience the Wynn....  So hopefully the bugs will be worked out.

Tip - if you're staying at the hotel and using valet, make sure you call ahead to pull your car.  A valuable timesaver!",0,0,0

The whole place gives a kind of a German Golden Age of Cinema vibe for some reason (and not in a good way).  Think of Fritz Lang's Metropolis.  It is designed to come off as decadent and elegant, but comes off as a bit contrived and gaudy.

Went to Vegas a couple of weeks ago. Stayed at the Aria for a 2-day seiminar.  

Positives: Staff was helpful whenever I asked questions.  And the architecture was really a nice to look at.  Some really nice artwork and fountains in and around the buildings.  Great music playing all the time in the background.  Even into the night there was background upbeat sounds.  Great location at City Center.  Nice use of technology with the sleep button near the bed that turned off all the lights and closed the curtains all with one button.

Negatives: Room looked nice at first, but:  in the shower stall, one of the overhead lamps was a bit down from the ceiling (looked loose) and had what looked like a drop of water ready to fall on its edge.  The ""drop"" was there the whole time I stayed, so I don't know if it was actually fluid or some sort of silicone sealant.  (I was too grossed out to touch it.) (kept looking at it when I took a shower to make sure it didn't drop on me)  The vanity mirror didn't work. (wouldn't light up).  One of the bathroom towels even had a hole in it.  (can we say - need for quality checks)
There were no obvious instructions for the room climate controls and I had to experiment with the touchpad to see what was what.  Room was stuffy when I got there and the room fans didn't seem to move the air enough till I was ready to check out two days later.  And the bed:  Not a fan for certain.  My personal preference is a slightly firm mattress.  The bed in the room was SO fluffy I couldn't sleep.  Even the pillows had no firmness.  It felt like I was being smothered all night.  I almost slept on the floor.  After two days of poor sleep, I probably should have done so.  For people who like sleeping in a cloud, this type of bedding might be heaven.  Just not for me.  The room lighting was another peeve of mine.  I like to read a bit before sleeping.  And just my luck, the room lighting was so dim, I had to turn on all the lights (bed lamps, reading lamps, hallway lamps, and desk lamp) just to have adequate reading light.  

Being that the Aria is located on a property that includes its own high-end shopping mall (Fendi, Bulgari, etc) and was not quite up to that standard, I was a bit underimpressed.  I don't know if I would stay there again.... probably not since there are so many other options available in that area.",1,0,0

We've stayed there twice in the 2 BR suites and they usually come with a dining room and extra living room space.  We just also stayed at the MGM Skylofts and for the money I think the MGM lofts might be a better value (if you can use that word for these kinds of accommodations).  

Similar in theme to the normal rooms here, the suites have very modern looks and are made of high quality furnishings.  The sky loft sections are nice since they have a separate check in area to beat the crowds, limo ride to\/from the airport, and a lounge you can go to anytime you need a drink, cookie, cheese snack or to just get away from the crowds on the casino floor.  

If you can spare the $ it's a nice way to enjoy a trip to LV.  Your card will also double as a line pass at the aria buffet.  BTW the aria buffet is a little pricy, but has really great food.  It's annoying that you have to pay to be seated together if you are a group bigger than 4.

We also rented the cabana here and it's not a bad deal at around $400-600 depending on the day.  It's a nice change of pace if you feel like relaxing by the pool versus gambling all day.  You'll need to call to reserve ahead of time and then they confirm availability the morning of.  The cabanas are more solid structures with misters, TV, sofa, and sink\/fridge with some sodas and a cheese plate.",0,0,0

Seems like this hotel has joined the long list of other resorts that have thrown away customer service, simple common sense AND appreciation for their paying customers customers. I was there for EDC Weekend (June 8-11) and, I have to agree with my fellow yelpers there, that the check-in fiasco has left a bitter taste even a week after the trip. The first thing you expect to do when arriving at your vacation destination is check-in, drop off your luggage, and relax! All of this could not be done because our arrival was met with a 2.5 hour long line of disgruntled travelers standing static and clueless to a computer system failure. I understand that technical issues happen and they can be beyond the control of any employees. But I ask, where was the foresight in attempting a massive computer system overhaul prior to one of the busiest weekend of the season?? Being an EDC sponsored hotel with and incoming of +300,000 guests to Vegas, a Manny Pacquiao Fight, Stanley Cup Finals, and NBA Playoffs? Aria did little, and by little I mean nothing, to compensate for the wait, computer meltdown, and inconvenience other than putting out some stanchions  to make it feel like a ride and handing out bottles of water. We aren't thirsty we are tired from a 4 hour drive or a plane trip. We got things to do and nowhere on a person's weekend plans should it include standing in line for hours with little information on the status of the situation.

We were 10 minutes away from booking a room at the Paris down the way that boasted no lines and a rapid check-in as we were on a tight schedule when FINALLY they opened the check-in counters and started the process. We were near the front luckily and got through surprisingly fast from that point on. I'll give the hotel that, their staff handled it like an all-hands-on-deck black friday sale. By the end of the trip our promises of compensation seemed to be unfamiliar to the front desk upon check out. After ten minutes back and forth we got the resort fees removed from our room and oddly enough our total still came out higher than what we allegedly booked for through ARIA and EDC's ""Great Deal"". At the end of the day this was Aria's second chance to impress me. It was my return visit there. And even the first time, on a friday night, mid January, with no line at all, it took us a 45 minutes to check-in after the front desk couldn't find our reservation...

This hotel looks great, something straight out of the future and it's a real testament to modern architecture. It's luxurious to the pinnacle of definition all the way down to the perfume adorned air to the auto curtains that slide open upon entering your room. But aside from all the aesthetic oooh's and aaah's this place soils itself when it comes down to the brass tax and the fundamental functions of any good business, that is of course, customer service. For the amount of money you spend here, it would behoove you to spend it at some place just as nice and with service that far surpasses this place. Cosmo, Venitian, or Encore are fine choices.",3,0,0

I did notice this time the room had a skunk smell. I think it was the pipes or previous guest smoking something? haha..  I didn't get a chance to tell the front desk since I was here for work and was barely in my room but it wasn't overpowering but noticeable. I still like the room though since it feels really clean and modern.

I won about $1,400 from the penny slots so it definitely made me a fan of Aria. My favorite games to play here are blackjack and slots. I don't think craps is that good here since I've never won much but for blackjack and slots I'm up. Maybe it's just the vibe of this place?

The rooms are nice and very modern and hi tech, nice big shower and tub and central location on the strip. I was surprised when we checked in that there was a new daily $22 resort fee.  it included access to the gym, WiFi, and 2 complimentary drinks. I wanted to use the gym when we stayed there before but it was $30 a day to get in since it was in the spa area, which I also thought was excessive.  But, i didn't even end up using the gym this time.  The WiFi sucked and I ended up using 3G on my iPhone anyway. And who needs free drink passes at a casino? They included free boarding pass printout at the concierge desk as a perk, but that was free last time. I can't complain about the staff since i hardly interacted with them.  Checkin was fine. The line at the concierge was long.  It took until 4:30pm for our room to be serviced.  

We ate at the breakfast buffet, which was great and pretty reasonable at $15. Everything from eggs benedict, made to order omelettes, sausages, congee and kimchi and pastires. We went before and learned that if you go around 10:30, you'll probably still be there when they change over for lunch  :) Had a late lunch at Julian serrano and prices there was reasonable too.  No ceviche on the lunch menu, but the gazpacho was best thing we ordered. The stuffed peppers were also very good. Tuna and raspberry bites weren't that great--overpowered by the raspberry.  We also went to the happy hour at American Fish. $5 is a great deal, but the selections were so so.  2 Oysters and 2 pieces of yellowtail sashimi were not bad but pretty hard to mess up. Lobster corndogs and fish and chips pretty uninspired.  The aioli and tartar sauces were the best parts.

Their many pools are AMAZING and generally not overly busy.

The buffet is also pretty damn solid as is their 24\/7 Aria Cafe.

+I was in Vegas during memorial day weekend. On Monday, I claimed myvegas pts and got a comp room at Aria. :) Unfortunately I couldn't bribe the front desk girl (Jolene) to upgrade my room by slipping money along with my credit card (The room is free but I have to pay for the resort fee). However, she noticed that it was my birthday weekend so she sent me a birthday freebie to my room and I received Aria's rice krispie dessert gift box set. Yay thanks Jolene!
+Jolene was also nice enough to offer late 1PM check out for free of charge. I can't thank her enough for her kindness, thanks Jolene if you ever read this post!
+Aria itself is such a nice, pretty hotel. I loved that my room was so high tech and beautifully. The remote control is available to use for the TV, lights, and blinds. The TV has an AUX connector to play your music, which is perfect if you're pre-gaming in your room before a night out.
+I usually don't care for hotel amenities but I really liked the ones at Aria! The amenities included one-time use make-up remover that was made with citrus & green tea, which smelled good! 
+Aria also has deep, spacious bath tub. Perfect opportunity to use lush bath bomb and have a nice bath to pamper yourself. :)
+Aria also shows Zarkana, which is one of cirque du soleil acts. If you're tired of the clubbing scene, I suggest going to Zarkana for change of scenery and a date night with your significant other.

-The only down side about Aria during my stay was that the sink and the toilet was pretty dirty. I'm assuming the house keeping forgot to clean the bathroom, which is pretty gross. The toilet bowl had stains and the sink had cigarette ash or some sort of dirt on it. Eep.
-Aria's casino didn't offer low minimum for black jack so I was sad I couldn't gamble here too much. My friends and I gambled elsewhere.

The main reason is the bed - a semi-firm mattress but incredibly soft pillows. We've been able to sleep soundly all three nights. Rooms were quiet, and amenities were all modern.  Lights, AC, drapes TV - all controlled by touchpad!  Showers were great too -good water pressure and most important, clean!

The Promenade has numerous stores, a SB, a good business center, Zarkana theater, and some really good restaurants like Bardot which serves breakfast and brunch!  

Speaking of restaurants and places to eat, we like the JP on the casino floor the best - service seems quicker and the crepes fresher. (Both Exotic and Apple Sensation FTW!)

Luckily, we got a good deal on a hotel room, so the price was really reasonable considering we went during the busy summer months (for 3 nights, we paid around $350). This also included a $75 dollar credit to use at Cafe Vettro -- their 24 hour restaurant that serves up breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day. I highly recommend the Philly Cheesesteak or the Omelet. 

But back to City Center, it is an architecturally stimulating set of buildings, but it is very confusing, and there seems to be a lot of wasted space. The casino at Aria is relatively small compared to the other higher-end casinos. It is also one chocolate-brown fest. This color theme runs rampant throughout Aria, even in the rooms. Speaking of, they are designed really nicely, and every side of the building seems to have a decent view. We were facing the south, unfortunately. I feel stuck in time when all I can see is Monte Carlo and the Polo Towers, but whatevs. The accommodations were really great, although they were a little small for 4 people (ie no where to place all of our luggage comfortably, and only one chair, and no table). Would be perfect for 2. The bathroom is really nice, and even has a tub inside of the shower. First thing that came to mind was ""I wonder how many people have had an orgy in here."" The best things about the rooms, however, were the bed and pillows. SO COMFORTABLE. Better than anything I've ever slept on. 

As for Crystals, their shopping area, it feels completely abandoned. There was no one there, it seemed. It is also such a horrible design. It felt way too simple. And it isn't really accessible. It felt like you weren't even in Aria when you got to Crystals. The beehive looking restaurant in there looked pretty cool though. 

Overall though, it was a good experience. My main criteria for Vegas hotels is location, and that is one of the main reasons why I enjoyed Aria. Easy access to Bellagio and Paris, or Planet Hollywood and Monte Carlo (Although I can't stand the look of MC, I only went there for the virtual blackjack tables. Not video blackjack. It's a real table with virtual dealers. I won so much money on this type of game, and I love it because I can bet $5 minimums :) Having just graduated college, I was able to get the best of both worlds: Aria living, and Monte Carlo gambling!

Customer service was wonderful. Front desk, housekeeping, security and the employees in various shops were all warm and welcoming. Check in was quick and our room was ready right away, we even had a great view of the Strip!

We arrived at Aria on a saturday at 11am. We were expecting a long check in line, but were pleasantly surprised that each check in line had only 3-4 people ahead of us. We chose a line and waited. 15 minutes went by and we did not move up one place. The front desk attendant was flipping thru an employee manual trying to help the same couple that was in the front of the line when we arrived. TERRIBLE! I moved to a different line. Another 45 minutes later, we finally got keys. We were so excited to get into the room at this point. We opened the door and i noticed a hair dryer sitting out. I said "" oh thats wierd"". Thats when i noticed PEOPLE IN THE BED! The hotel had given us room keys to another persons ROOM! this has never happened to me in my entire life, much less in vegas. When we went downstairs to complain ( still in shock), the manager did not apologize to us and actually said to me"" its fine"". I told her this was NOT fine, so she gave us a $50 dining credit.  

other notable things:
1) If you have an iphone or ATT you will not get service in the entire hotel. 
2) casino and sportsbook is very small. We chose to watch the game in our room instead of the casino because there was nowhere to sit. 
3) Visually, the hotel is UGLY. Everything from the carpet to the uniforms they make the attendants wear is really dark and drab.
4) rooms are SMALL. MGM grand had bigger rooms. 
5) the 'black out shades"" that are standard in all vegas hotel rooms do not work here. We were awoken at 8 am by light coming in thru the edges of the shades. Not cool, aria!  
6) the ""mall"" has approx. 2 stores open. unless you're in the market for a thousand dollar LV bag or Tiffany's jewelry just skip this mall. 
7) we ate at ate 3 restaurants in the hotel. they were all terrible ( service and food). Really surprising since 2 of the reasons i love vegas is because there is always amazing food and service. 

The 2nd thing that happened was after a long night out in vegas we came back to our room and the TV had been left on. We tried to turn it off, but the remote wouldnt work. there were no buttons on the tv to manually turn it off. We called the front desk 10 times before someone answered. Apparently they weren't answering because there was a ""drug issue"" in the hotel ( that is exactly what the front desk agent told us...awesome!)  They told us that the engineer would need to come up to change the batteries. 2 hours later, we got some new batteries in our remote. The engineer told us he's been replacing batteries about 30 times a day since the hotel opened. Why would a brand new hotel have old batteries in their remote?  At this point we just want to go to sleep.

The next morning instead of enjoying our last few hours in the hotel before check out we just decide to leave. We go to check out and there were 4 bogus charges on our hotel bill ( mini bar mostly). this was strange to us because houskeeping didnt even come while we were there! Luckily they removed those charges...... 

All in all this hotel is terrible. it was a terrible decision for the owners to open this hotel without properly training their staff. Everything seems to be done half assed. I have absolutely zero desire to ever give this hotel another shot. With the amazing other hotels in vegas at similar price ranges ( palazzo, venetian, caesars, etc...) aria would be my LAST choice hotel.",5,0,0

The rooms are pretty nice.  I was impressed when on opening the door the window blinds automatically opened up and the TV turned itself on.  That was pretty snazzy.

What I didn't like was that when I checked into the room they basically hit you with a bunch of bullshit fees and warnings.  Like a bunch of hotels in Vegas they hit you with a 'resort' fee of $25\/day.  For this fee you get wireless in your room and to use the gym.  Please don't bullshit me Aria, just put the stupid fee in the price of the room.

The other thing that I really loved when I was checking in was the 3 minute long warning that I got about the mini bar.  Apparently everything in the mini bar is weighted and the bar itself has a built in scale.  I was warned that as soon as a mini bar item was picked up the room would be charged.  So pick up a bottle of water and you just bought it.  Pretty classic.

I was also warned that if you put something into the mini bar to store it you get charged a $50 per day 'storage' charge.  The receptionist added that the bar itself isn't cold enough to preserve anything and that people will put yogurt in there but the yogurt goes bad because the bar isn't cold enough so the mini bar should not be used to keep things cold BUT if it was used they would charge $50 per day for storage.  She added that if cold storage was needed they could rent me a refrigerator for $25 per day.  These guys have really got the art of bullshit charges down to a science - but that is expected as it is Vegas!  I am really impressed by how much thought went into the whole mini bar system - they have more computer power running the mini bars than went into the rockets that went TO THE MOON!

I probably wouldn't stay here again just because of all of the stupid fees that they try and hit you with but given that The Aria is owned by the MGM and they own about half of the strip, I expect most of the MGM properties are about the same.",5,4,0

Entering the hotel trying to find our ""private"" entry we were soo lost and it turned out to be all the way at the other end, I was kind of disappointed but I guess we were suppose to enter at the other end. When we checked in, the front desk girl was being very kind and nice, and she said since the room we booked was all full she was going to upgrade us to a 2 bedroom penthouse city view. SWEET!! (or maybe because i told her there was 3 birthday that night) haha but anywho. The room was beau-TI-ful!!! The view was to night DIE FOR!!! OMG it was just breathe taking, but the room was a lot smaller then I thought it would be. They put to much stuff in there that takes up a lot of room.

But my most favorite room of all time is the bathroom and the bar!! throughout the stay was good. If we had a problem the people came quick, but I had two problem. One was I had the privacy light on and the house keeper still came in and cleaned up our place. I guess it was cool though I wish they hadn't not knowing what they'll take because we did have a lot of stuff in there. so therefore I was not happy with that. but I did appreciated that they had cleaned up our mess. second was the high technology they had for EVERY SINGLE THING!!! I was so confused with using that master panel thingy whatever its called. Within pressing one button can turn off everything or turn on everything. I hated it due to the fact that from one room you can control the other too. But over all the room was beautiful. But I don't think I would ever spend another $1500 on a room like that. and I do thank Aria for giving up a free upgrade to a penthouse!!! :) I think the room we booked would of been a lot smaller..",0,0,0

It does smell like vanilla when you enter Aria. :) The casino is dimly lit with dark walls & subdued carpeting.  In contrast, the hotel lobby & front desk is cheerful & bright with its very high glass ceilings.  

The check-in line was very long but moved quickly with assistance from a line coordinator who politely pointed to the next available clerk so the wait was minimal.  I suspect the air-conditioning was not working properly that day because it was very warm in the lobby. To compensate we were offered a bottle of water.  Nice touch. The check-in clerk was welcoming & helpful.  He identified on a hotel map where to get coffee in the morning.  Aria, does not provide in-room coffee service.  What they do provide is a tempting array of expensive snacks & stocked mini-bar.  Do not touch anything if you don't want to be charged.  

Their ""Deluxe Room"" has the usual appointments such as shampoo, conditioner, soup, hair dryer, iron & ironing board.  Other reviewers have mentioned Aria's scratchy towels.  Yes, they're rough, but very thick & super absorbent.   I loved the shower & deep soaking tub layout.
My disappointment in the room was the lack of the highly anticipated ""automated welcome to your room experience"".  I received pitch-black darkness.  There was no welcoming music, no automatic opening of the drapes, & no auto-lighting of the lamps!  I fumbled in the dark to turn on the lights, some of which had been manually turned off so the remote controls did not work. 

After figuring it all out, we reset all the lights, drapes & music ourselves.   If you are technically challenged... do not stay at the Aria.  Also, our remote control batteries died so we were not able to do much with it.  This was especially frustrating because we were not able to view our online bill.  We asked for replacements, but no one ever came so we had to visit the front desk to check out, which by-the-way was also offline.  However, the desk clerks were helpful & made the best out of a frustrating situation.  An email listing our expenses was sent later that evening as promised.

Yes, they have floor to ceiling windows, but the views are obscured by the uncomfortable armless chairs in the room.  If you are sitting on them, your back is to the window.  I'm not sure what those chairs are for.  TV watching is pointless from their position because the TV is facing the bed.  It's illogical.  The bed was sumptuous!  I love the soft sheets & large pillows. 
The elevators are centrally located, so if you don't like looong walks to your room, ask for a room near the elevator.  

As I noted earlier there's no coffee in the rooms...
I went to The Roasted Bean; splendid service & the coffee delightful.  Lines form quickly at this spot in the a.m. so I walked the short distance from the guest elevator to Jean Philippe, a sugar lover's haven for those like to indulge in exquisite pastries along with a morning cup.  The lines are longer for the pastries, crepes & sweets, but if you just want coffee & maybe a pre-packaged madeleine, there's a separate area for lattes, cappuccino & the like.  The staff at Jean Philippe seemed a bit bored; they did their job well, but were not overtly friendly. No smiles at all.

I ate once at their 24 hour place Cafe Vetro.  Their coffee is also superb & they leave a full carafe at your table. That's about it for service.  The rest of our breakfast was a disappointment. Waited a long time to place an order & the arrival of 1 bowl of oatmeal & a veggie omelet took 25 minutes! 
Our next attempt to eat at Café Vetro was a fail.  It was late night, but after checking the abbreviated late-night menu, we left without ordering.  In all fairness I'm a vegetarian-- Las Vegas hotels are not vegetarian friendly.  They could at least offer a veggie wrap or something.    

Overall we would give Aria another chance.  It's a nice place.

Hotel Location: 5 stars! Ideally located on the strip.
Maid Service: 5 stars! Organized our personal items! Nice touch.  Always a warm greeting in the halls.

Hotel Lobby: 4.5 stars. It was warm, but they offered us water & the wait was short. 
Jean Phillipe: 4.5 stars.  Superb lattes, can't get enough of their gelato, but need more smiles from the staff.
Self Parking: 4 stars. Bridge to hotel & casino is on the second floor.  Be careful switching lanes at the entrance to City Center, it's tricky.
Casino: 4 stars.  Card dealers are friendly but a cold reception from the craps table staff.  Many fun slots! Try ""The Hangover"".
Deluxe Room: 3.5 stars.  Water pressure was a mere trickle in the sink & slightly more in the shower.  Uncomfortable chairs.  Technical failure. 
Café Vetro: 2 stars. Slow service, no vegetarian options.
Maintenance: 0 stars. They never came to replace our remote control batteries.",2,0,1

However, they posted two security personnel at the enter gate, not the main entrance to tell everyone who turned into the parking garage they are no accepting parking for the event.

Literally everyone we ran into was obviously there to make sure we had a good time, and they did a great job.

We booked a block of rooms for my son's 21st Birthday celebration. The whole family showed, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.  Amanda was super helpful with the pre-planning and answering the few questions I had afterwards.  Jill Esqueja checked us all in, and followed up with us after what she considered an unpardonable blunder someone else made.  She contacted me right away to find out what happened, and then more than made it right.  She was on it and I really appreciated it. I probably would not have complained at all, but her follow up made me feel special and that she really cared about us.  Jill is awesome. Whoever hired her is a very smart person.

The Bardot Brasserie was wonderful for breakfast. The coffee, pastries, and fresh bread with salted butter were to die for. Shannon took good care of us, always with a big beautiful smile. Ask for Shannon if you eat there. You'll see what I mean. Linda was our server in the buffet. We are a pretty fun group, if I do say so myself, and Linda just joined right in on the fun.  She was friendly, laughing, and attentive.  Sergio, who brought our breakfast to the room one morning, was equally great. He went back and forth a couple of times to get things we needed.  Even the doorman at the elevator welcomed me back after I went downstairs for coffee.   

I'm so stuck on the service, I almost forgot to mention a couple of important things. The beds are amazing. I usually don't sleep well in hotels. I slept wonderfully. Everything about this hotel screamed comfort, luxury, and service. I felt incredibly pampered the entire time we were there. It was great.

I can't say enough good things about our experience at the Aria.  Service is everything, and a lot can be forgiven if the service is excellent. And the service was excellent.

My TSA security line was shorter than Aria's check-in line. 

We finally walk to our room which took another 15 minutes. Our room was like a mile from the elevator. Poorly designed. I open the door and at first glance, it's a nice contemporary room. I turn on the light to the bathroom and there is a huge wad of hair on the floor. Closer inspection revealed hair in the sinks and shower. Disgusting! But, we're exhausted after a day of delayed flights and an absurd check-in experience. I figured I'd deal with this in the morning.

I wake up the next morning and just so happen to pull the bed sheets all the way back. There are blood stains on the sheets at the foot of the bed! I'm thoroughly disgusted! 

Our room was next to the pool and a club because from 12PM to well into the wee hours of the morning all I hear is the thumping bass of loud music. I literally had to wear headphones and cover my head with a pillow to silence the bass.

This place deserves five star, in any aspect, compared to any other hotels\/resorts\/casinos in LV, in any regard. 
Restaurants are the best, floor service is sharp and responsive, atmosphere is elegant and modern, guests and visitors have plenty to enjoy. 

However, some often cited complaints I can respond to.

1. cell phone reception
Verizon and Sprint worked so fine. But iPhone, not sure. andy you were not alone.
http:\/\/mobile.venturebeat.com\/2010\/01\/08\/att-ces\/

Did Aria cause this? You can answer that one yourself.

2. Resembles Airport
Good observation I think. My guess is that this place had 'international guest' in mind when built plus 'futuristic' design. If you ever go to Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul or London, such building is soooo common.
In US, there's been few built recently, for many reasons. (Economy, terror, etc)

3. Service not there
Yup, this one I kind of agree. I am going back again soon and will check out. Any new hotel has some glitches but lets see

4. Too sharp and edgy
I guess this is also somewhat true, but I thought Wynn is like that too.
If you have family, go to TI or Mirage. If you are couple then go to Bellagio or Venetian. Otherwise, MGM and ARIA is where you need to be.

at full price, this might be closer to 4 stars, but there are always specials to be found.  at the price, i wouldn't hesitate a full 5.  just don't expect the level of service as you might have somewhere that's costs 5 times as much.  you have to weigh value into your ranking.

This property is amazing and you should at least walk through, if you get the chance.  The room prices are reasonable; we paid $149\/night on weeknights and $189\/night on the weekends.  They have deals with Southwest Airlines that saved us a bunch of money.  5 days and 4 nights cost $535\/person with direct, non-stop (albeit red-eye) flights.

In typical Vegas style, they've got like 12 restaurants & bars, an ultra high-end mall that I could never afford to shop in, a killer pool, and the best location on the strip.  You really can get just about anything you want to eat on the property, but it ain't cheap.  $18 will get you a buffalo\/blue cheese burger at the PUB and another $9-12 buys a pint of some fairly hard-to-find brews.  The main restaurant, Caffe Vettro, served great breakfast and lunch, that wasn't terribly overpriced.  While there were a lot of people present, this was clearly a step above places like MGM Grand and Treasure Island.  The riff-raff has definitely been kept out of this resort; you won't find anyone puking in the elevators or getting into fights at the craps tables.  The only problem with this (to me) is that the minimum bets at blackjack and craps tend to be at least $15\/hand, which is a little high.  There's something for everyone, but I'd leave the kids at home if you plan on staying here.

The rooms are totally automated, which is really cool; everything is controlled through the TV, a separate touchscreen remote and wall switches.  It takes a minute to get used to and it's problematic.  EX: The Connectivity Panel, which is how you link into the room, has very specific plugs for iPhones and iPads, that can only be purchased from Aria...for like $32.  The USB plugs wouldn't let us access either of our devices and when we had them bring us a DVD player, it took the IT guys an hour and they still couldn't make it work.

Nearby, you've got CVS and a liquor store, so you don't have to pay $8\/ea for beer.  The staff was very accommodating and brought up a refrigerator, no questions asked.  We took our own drinks to the pool and we have friends who actually brought a drink into one of the restaurants (cringe).  New York New York is next door and the MGM is across the street.  Hooters Casino is within walking distance, if you just NEED a $3 game of blackjack.  Fremont street is a $25 cab ride away, which was annoying.

I stayed here for a week recently, and found some things to like about it-  the austere modern design is well done, the beds are comfy, and the staff aside from housekeeping was extremely helpful .

However, there's some things that weren't as pleasing- the restaurants are somewhat overpriced for what they're serving, the casino is laid out like a warehouse with a bunch of tables crammed together, and the pool is just OK. Nothing wrong with the pool itself, it is just hard to access and doesn't improve on what I've seen at budget hotels off the strip. The bathroom was mostly functional, as long as you don't mind being on display while you're using the toilet or the oddly shaped tub.

And then there's the things I hated, like the five minute slog from the elevator to my room, the housekeeping staff, and the water. We left a decent tip the first day, and the staff thanked us by cleaning out our personal care items like the shampoo we brought without even leaving replacements. The untreated Colorado River water that comes out of the tap tastes like used mouthwash and is slightly harder than saturated baking soda water. I not only got sick to my stomach drinking the water, the mineral content makes it nearly impossible to completely rinse soap off your skin or out of your hair.

Handy tip: Grab a few quarts of bottled water from the nearby CVS pharmacy, which is also a good fall-back in case the cleaning staff decides to trash all your personal items.",1,0,0

The rooms are nicely laid out, they have ceiling to floor windows along one side of the room over looking the Las Vegas strip.  The bathroom consists of 3 little rooms,  1 for the toilet, 1 for the standup shower which also has a garden next to it, and then the open area where the sinks are.

The cool factor comes in play when you first approach your room.  All you have to do is stand outside your room and hold your key to a round disk on the door and the door will unlock.  Once you enter your room, you will be astonished with all the automation that has been put in place.  From a central remote control, you can control all the lights in the room, open and close the curtains, set the alarm clock, watch tv, listen to music, adjust the thermostat, and even set the indicators outside your room to notify the staff that you want privacy or you need to have your room serviced.  

For the technology challenged, this room can be very intimidating, but with a little practice, it is easy to master.  With a touch of a button I can set the room to sleep mode where all the lights are turned off, the curtains are closed, and the tv is turned off.

I ended up deducting a star because they are not very friendly to new customers when it comes to finding your way around.  When i got off the shuttle, i had to take an elevator up to the casino level, and then wander around the casino until I finally found a check-in desk.  At first I didn't even know what hotel the checking was for as there were no signs indicating anything.  The other thing I didn't like was being charged a daily resort fee of about $25 that gave me access to the spa, fitness center, a daily newspaper, 2 free cocktails, and Internet access in my room and in the casino area.  When i was at the Thai restaurant in the lobby of this casino, I was getting a great signal on my phone, but I was unable to receive any data.

Having a major sweet tooth, I melted at the fact that the patisserie was right next to the guest elevators, +1 star already. Finding our room was a bit puzzling. The hallways kept breaking into multiples and there were so many numbers. Why must they put the floor number as well? The room was great though, along with a spacious bathroom. I don't like the fact that everything is glass. If you're staying with family, it's time consuming to have to wait for one another to get ready. The shower head flow was great though. I'm a bit of a stickler for that considering I have long, long, hair and slow water will take forever to clean my hair! Additionally, I did not fancy the ""universal remote"" as much as everyone else probably did\/does. I like that we can set an alarm for the curtain to open as well as for the tv to turn on to a set channel. I believe the curtains woke me up rather than the tv, so maybe I should up the volume. I was a bit disappointed by the mini-fridge. I couldn't put anything (the sweets I bought downstairs) in there! The switches in the room were a bit confusing as well (you can't tell which switch is for what) but I did like the privacy\/service buttons as opposed to little door hangers. 

One of the days, we ordered room service. Why is it listed as ""Wonton Noodle Soup"" if there is no noodles in it? So broth, a shit load of vegetables and about two wontons? Not worth the, I believe, $22? We also ordered french toast which was extremely good; however, the soup, very disappointing... -1 star. 

Downstairs, after all the children have gone asleep, was lively. The blackjack tables were almost always full... bummer. But hey, I'm not a big gambler. But, I did enjoy the complimentary drink vouchers we were given for staying at Aria. I also like the fact that it was connected to the CityCenter.

we have been waiting for five hours (literally have been here since 8.30 am) and still haven't been given a room. we are an hour out from regular check-in time, yet paid $50 extra to get into a room early... called the front desk for an update and homegirl was short and rude... piss poor customer service for a high end resort.

there are no plugs in the lobby area and if you manage to find one adjacent to the casino, they will not let you sit with whatever you are charging.

the hotel policies are pretty appalling... an aria checked bag ticket is not enough to get you into the pool if you've already checked out. if you were like me and weren't registered on the hotel room, they will not let you in, even if they've seen you every day, even if you give them your room number and the person you were staying with and all of their contact information. 

every single night we were there we had a problem with the key cards. one night, we got locked out for forty minutes at 3.40 am before being able to get into our room. 

breakfast at aria cafe is... .... . a cappuccino was served to me at actually around 350 degrees, probably, well over appropriate serving temperature. they gave me white toast without asking me what i wanted to sub wheat for after they ran out of it. once they came back with the sourdough i asked them to sub instead of the white, it wasn't even any type of toasted (i waited 15-20 minutes just for the toast to come out after the rest of my food). a half an avocado will cost you a sharp $5. an unseasoned egg scramble with the rest of this awful breakfast was $33. 


two bartenders, whose names i unfortunately do not remember considering the fucking tragedy this trip was, really did cheer me up by just being the nicest and most genuine people i met on my trip here, so there is that. their management, on the other hand, did not seem to care that either of them had not gotten their lunch breaks.

I had heard great things so I really was looking forward to staying there for my birthday. We went the night of April 10th, and it was MADNESS. When we got there they told us that we could not get a room with Two Queen Beds, as we had reserved. They said they were sold out and only had one room with a single King Bed. Mind you, we checked in around 4:00 so it is not like we got there very late. The single King Bed was unacceptable since we had four people staying in the room. That is why we PURPOSEFULLY had reserved two beds that we could all share. They told us that when you reserve a room it is just a 'preference' for the number and types of beds you want and that they can only give you what they have. A preference?? What if I was staying with someone I really didn't want to share a bed with? When I reserve something specific I expect to receive it.

Then when we asked for things like extra towels and a blowdryer they old us ""We will put in a request"". And two hours later they would knock on the door with the item (only after calling two additional times to check up on the status). It shouldn't take two hours to receive something as simple as towels or a blowdryer. And they shouldn't have to 'put in a request', they should just bring it.

They gave us a $50 Player's card since my friend had stayed there before, but that was a scam as well. Turns out, if you use it at a machine and don't finish using all $50 at one sitting, that when you take it out of the machine it all goes away. My friend used one dollar of it and won $30, so he took it out of the machine to let us use it and the $50 credit was wiped off. He couldn't even put it into another machine.  They didn't tell us that when they gave it to us...

Overall, I think the Aria is new so it doesn't have its act together yet. I think they have NO idea how to handle a sold out hotel yet. I would maybe ONLY try it in the middle of the week, but NOT on a weekend. I've had WAY better customer service at other 5 star hotels. Not worth the money!

I have watched the city center complex being built for years and had been really looking forward to staying at one of the hotels within it.  I toured the casino, the futuristic high end mall, and Chihuly gallery back in January when it opened.  I like the modern art work (specifically the Moore sculpture).  The design is very cool.  The design reminds me of a kind  of ultra luxury hotel that you would find in Japan or somewhere in Asia.  I have not been to Dubai but I imagine the design to be similar to something from there too. 

 I loved the design of the room and the chic vibe from the casino et cetera and would like to give this hotel a higher rating.  I can't however since the customer service here falls far short of what it should be for a place like this and the price that we paid to stay here on a Friday night.  Our experience at check-in and check-out was poor.  They tried to pawn a cheaper undesirable 'smoking optional' room on us after we had reserved a very expensive premium non smoking room months in advance.  We specified what our check-in time would be at that time and were told since we were arriving late in the day (not late for our check in time) that they only had 'crappy' smoking rooms with no view left and that they could give us a 50 dollar credit if we agreed to stay in one of those.  We refused.  Magically after she went to talk to her supervisor there were plenty of rooms available like we paid for on a high floor with a premium view.  A fifty dollar credit would have done nothing to alleviate our financial commitment since we paid several hundred dollars for this room and reserved it months in advance.  One wonders if trying to push inferior rooms on people at time of check-in isn't standard practice here.  We really didn't appreciate it.  They really need to step up their customer service here if they want to compete with other hotels on the strip.  I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you can get a very good deal on a week night.  With the level of customer service here, it just isn't worth paying full price.  I hope they work out the kinks soon.  Maybe it is simply that they are new.

My favorite part of the room is the ""Good Night"" button, in which the curtains shut, the TV and lights turn off. No need to explain why that invention is useful. I have to say that these beds are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in alongside Bellagio. 

Jean Philippe's chocolates are sold here too! It's not as crowded as Bellagio because I don't think the word is out yet that it's here too. Works for me though because I didn't have to wait in long lines behind browsers. His desserts always amaze me because they are rich, but light at the same time. Perfection.

I love the clothing shop here too. It's affordable and trendy at the same time. I went a little overboard on the shopping this time, but it's not often I like a clothing store that much. It really is my style. All of it.

This is the place for me when I come to Vegas unless my friend can get us rooms in Bellagio. I am officially spoiled for good. If Aria or Bellagio isn't possible, then no Vegas for me.",1,0,0

The conference rooms were nice and the temperature was just right.  The lunches they served were very good, although I did opt out of one lunch, but that was to try the buffet on the premises.  The service for the breaks during the conference were also great. They had sodas, teas, and even brought out an ice cream freezer.

My room was clean and spacious. The design of the room was very appealing to the eyes, and the power\/AV plugins by the TV was great.  Room was cleaned twice a day as advertised.

Even though I was here on business, I did spend some time (OK, a lot of time) on the casino floor and at the Sports book. The casino floor was nice and I enjoyed myself at the tables and slots.  Most of my time was spent at the sports book, which was amazing. I was here during March Madness so the place would get busy, but I mostly watched hockey games and I really enjoyed the chairs. Plus, having the sports book by a great pizza\/beer place was a major bonus.

Last time we were in Vegas (childless and with slightly more disposable income), we stayed at the MGM Grand (also good). But Aria is the newest kid on the block and has done an amazing job of putting itself out there. Cause when you're the new kid, that's what you gotta do. 

It's a super-modern hotel\/resort\/spa with every possible amenity. We were even given a reference to a fabulous hotel babysitting service which, although incredibly expensive, was also awesome and is reviewed separately on my profile. 

When I say Aria had it all, I mean it. Really modern furnishings, remote-controlled curtains, a mini-fridge stocked to the gills (look, don't touch), boxes of little exotic chocolates next to your bed, fabulous terrycloth robes and slippers, awesome toiletries, a ridic bathroom facility with a massive stand-up shower which shares the same space as a massive whirlpool tub, a stacked gym facility (like a real gym), like 50 outdoor pools, a decadent spa and no shortage of places to eat, drink, gamble and shop. 

To top it all off, we paid $80 (!!!) for the room for a night. I guess it's a massive hotel and so they are able to offer really affordable rates much of the time. So great. Definitely will stay here again. 

The only thing to be warned about is that they have a bit of a ""fine print"" resort fee, applicable on each booking, in the amount of $25 per room, per night. It's said to cover towels, etc. when you're at the pool....I dunno....seems like a way to make an extra $25 to me. Or just include it in the rate. 

But otherwise, totally awesome. Best of Vegas so far. AND the Aria Buffet should not be missed. I've never seen anything like it in my 30 years of buffet-ing. Just wear your buffet pants, if you know what I'm sayin',",0,3,0

Aria is a modern hotel with really awesome conveniences that one would expect at this price point. I believe they were charging $450 the night we stayed. When the wifey and I walked in we were greeted with a spacious room, modern decor, a mandigo sized bed and views of the strip that were gnar. Everything in the place was  controlled by a tablet  that allowed you to open and close the blackout curtains, dim the lights. Very convenient. Very pimp. Very Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

I called to fix the problem they assured me they would refund the over charged amount. They did do that but now I do not have access to $1851 in my account because it takes 5 business days to get a refund.

They handled the problem fast once I noticed but they offered me no compensation at all which is crazy. The way I look at it is the bank doesn't let me take money for free especially with out asking so why should they get to take free money from me.

Part of City Center, the hotel's decor fits with the concept of the entire complex - a modern, high end sort theme.  One of the newer hotels on the strip, the amenities and creature comforts are plentiful.  Each room is fitted with a centralized touch pad by the bed which controls nearly everything in the room - the lights, A\/C, TV, and the shades.  The views from the rooms that face the strip are gorgeous, and I was actually really impressed by their closets and bathroom.  Weird I know.  BTW, the in-room wi-fi should be included as part of the resort fee.

The hotel itself includes several bars (one with pretty good happy hour prices!), a club, a dessert\/bakery\/chocolate\/ice cream eatery, to-go food and coffee counters, their buffet, several restaurants, and some retail shops as well (the Crystals mall is right outside the lobby too).  The casino feels cleaner than most by comparison, and I really liked that the air didn't feel thick of cigarette smoke.  Some people might not like the vanilla-ish air freshener smell, but you get used to it quick and it beats the alternative.  I can't describe how nice it is to go back to your room after gambling without carrying the smell of smoke on your clothes.  All of the workers that I interacted with were friendly and nice...especially a couple of the girls working the concierge desk.  So very helpful!  Outside of a doorman who seemed to be having a bad morning, the service certainly made the stay that much better.  

However, being a pricier hotel does have a slight drawback...if you're a gambler at least.  The table minimums for a lot of the games seemed to average higher than what you can find at other hotels on the strip (most were a $25 minimum).  If you aren't a gambler though, it's not going to affect you much.  Still, after the first time I stayed at Aria (with my own room to boot!), I ended up coming back during my most recent trip a few months ago.

The good: the crowd here is relatively subdued compared to Cosmo. There is usually room at the tables. The rooms are inexpensive for what you get.

The bad: rooms are just ok - they are definitely a step down from Cosmo, but still nice. Pool is crowded and a little spring breakish. Food options are good, but not compared to other places on the strip. Rooms were not cleaned very well each day.

Rooms - Pretty nice rooms with good sized bathrooms, two sinks and an oversized tub\/shower. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of closet space. At first the touchscreen controls were pretty cool and I was impressed with this new and wondrous technology in hotel design. By the time I left I got angry just looking at the touchscreen. The screen seemed to have low sensitivity and I had to mash the screen over and over again just to turn the lights on\/off and to change channels on the TV (normal remote didn't work). Also, try hitting the ""goodnight button"" plunging the room into darkness and then trying to figure out how to turn on the lights again. 

The worst part was the smell. It was bad enough that I cut my stay short.  I was in a non-smoking room, but it had a very strong stale cigarette smell that I never got used to, like sleeping in the casino. This combined with the death march that was walking from the self-parking, to the front desk, to the room multiple times made it an irritating stay. I must have walked 3-5 miles a day without leaving the hotel. Also, watch out for the mini-bar charges. I had a 30 dollar charge on my invoice at check-in and I didn't so much as open the mini bar the whole time. 

On the plus side, I thought all the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The facilities were all nice and clean, hence the three stars, but for the price I would probably go with one of the better hotels nearby.",0,0,0

Ok, so it was a freaking Tuesday this time, and a Monday the first time. The review for Aria is best put in bullet form.

PROS:

12pm Checkout is one of the latest available. They'll give you up to 2pm if late checkout is available.
NO STUPID RESORT FEE.
Modern rooms - incredible technology including one button on and off.
Automatic curtains and amazing views, especially strip side.
Central location, though somewhat away from the strip.
Tons of beautiful artwork, even the rooms are decorated differently.
Hard to find safe in a cool place
Very nice bathroom, with a large shower
Beds are soft, pillows are absolutely amazing
Robes to wear in room are surprisingly comfortable
Cool keycard system can scan keys in wallet (YMMV)
Rooms are larger than average
Great alarm clock - can program it to open curtains, turn on lights\/tv etc.
Casino is very modern - some people say its dark, but it looks clean
One of the best price\/amenities values available

CONS:

Check-in\/out line system is bad and pretty slow
TV system lags terribly
Long walks if your room is very far, but definitely NOT 15 minutes of walking. Few minutes max. Not atypical of Vegas, but a bit longer than Venetian.
Bathroom doors often fail to lock
See-thru door for toilet a little awkward
Scale in room makes me sad :P

NOTES: My customer service experience has been absolutely excellent. They allowed me to room-switch for a lower rate at 6pm, and have taken care of my problems with my bill on several occasions. However, during a busy summer weekend, they ran out of two-queen-rooms and it was quite a hassle for me and my friends and we spent nearly an hour trying to get a room, and they were able to get us two (out of three that we wanted). It wasn't that unreasonable - somewhat typical Vegas.

In comparison to the Venetian, it was definitely on-par for me, if not a bit more mainstream. The Venetian rooms are much larger with a nice dining area, but are arguably needlessly so (and are generally quite a bit more expensive too). However, I felt both hotels were a luxurious experience. Also, NO STUPID RESORT FEES. You really pay what you expect to (there is tax though).",0,0,0

Our first time to Vegas doesn't help us in comparing the ARIA with other casino\/hotels but we're confident it's the nicest place we've ever stayed.  The room was super cool.  Everything could be operated by the IPAD type of alarm clock.  I was surprised at how spacious it was.  It didn't feel cramped.  The vanilla smell of the casino was really refreshing.  Much better than smelling the cigarette smoke.  I read a marketing team worked on the scent of the casino for quite some time (that's crazy!).

Anyway, we really enjoyed ourselves.  We fell in love the crepe place.  They were amahzing!  At $12 a pop I still felt like we were taking advantage of them...they were that good.

I docking one star because I didn't feel like the staff was as friendly as they could have been.  With over 4K rooms I know it's hard to go over and beyond for everyone but sometimes a simple smile is nice.

I stayed here last weekend, and my over all expectations of this place are just ok.

Not once did I get my room cleaned, or even after i asked for extra towels or sheets did they bring these items in a timely manner. 

On my itinerary, I was offered free buffet vouchers, not once did the hotel receptionist offer those vouchers to me (which i'm ok with but it's the whole principle).

They did a great job with the restrooms and because their technology from the hotel room smart key to the remote-controlled room lights, bathroom lights, curtains, and TV are chic, classy, almost James Bondish, and fun. 

Their restaurant offerings include Lemongrass, Sage, Julian Serrano, Blossom, and Masa, and possibly others. Lemongrass and Blossom are pretty secluded, just past the high-rollers' room. Julian Serrano's restaurant was pretty good. 

Their casino has at least four bars. There's a sky bar, a casino lounge, a sports' bar, and a sit-down bar. From my experience, cocktail waitresses take a while to bring me my watered-down hot chocolate, so nothing new there. The whip cream and hotness do make the first impression, but the taste just isn't there. Le sigh...

Jean Philippe Patisserie is also here. The other one is in the Bellagio with their impressive Guinness World Record's biggest chocolate fountain. The one here at Aria has many cute and impressive decorations that do inspire you with some creativity. 

The casino decor in general is quite impressive, but the brown colors and all the vectoring make for a cuckoo's nest and will have you feeling a bit lost, except for the fact that Aria is less circular than Planet Hollywood and Circus Circus, making you able to navigate and actually understand which side of Aria you are on. There is also a tram available to take you to Crystals shopping center, almost like a museum for expensive name-brands anybody with a sane mind and not enough money to blow would buy elsewhere, but it is Vegas, so some people get a windfall and there you go. The tram can also connect you to Monte Carlo if you stay on long enough. It's nice. You get a view of Aria's pretty waterfall that changes colors because of its lighting, and there's also a very nice semicircular rock wall with gorgeous cascades.

Second, I have a huge problem paying $18 day to valet park my car when I am staying at the hotel. On top of paying a resort fee? That is ludicrous!!!! I did tip the guys, but I won't the next time I go to Vegas. You guys can go ahead and take the $18 a day you are charging and give that as their tip. Speaking of valet parking. Please have the attendants explain to us that you'll need to keep the first ticket the entire stay. They did not tell me that. When I went to The Mandalay Bay Hotel I was charged for parking.

Our first time was in a Corner Suite and the second was in a Deluxe King room. Both rooms had amazing views. The Corner Suite was definitely our favorite though. Every luxurious detail was taken care of. We stayed for our wedding anniversary, two years in a row because we enjoyed it so much. Room service brought us chocolate covered strawberries and candies for our anniversary. If you're celebrating a special occasion, mention it when you book. They'll treat you well. We also got a very high floor which was wonderful. Housekeeping always comes in twice a day, unless you specify you want no disturbing of the peace. When I need something, I always call and they deliver it straight away. Fresh towels, wash cloths, more pillows, etc. Done. The beds are extremely comfortable. On one occasion, I spent most of the day in my bed because I ate a large brunch at Aria Buffet (which is also amazing by the way) and I couldn't actually move afterwards - food coma. My bed seemed like the perfect place to spend the day while the husband went on his Gold and Silver Pawn Shop VIP tour to meet the dudes.

We get to check into the Preferred Guests queue because we arrived in a limousine on both occasions. Very willing to spend the extra cash on a limo and only have to stand in line with 2 or 3 other guests instead of 495.

The line at Luxor took us 3 hours to traverse. Could have had a few drinks, dinner and a go at the slots in the meantime. So thank you Aria, for making me feel truly special and treating me like a queen! I'm a M Life member too so I get extra special perks. I like to be able to check into my Vegas hotel within 30 minutes and crack open that bottle I brought with me. Or better yet, finish the bottle of Champagne that Presidential Limo gives us while soaking in my oversized whirlpool spa tub enjoying the bubbles and thinking of my night of fine dining that is sure to follow.

My room had a fantastic view.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Because I was on assignment I had to be in Vegas for five days.  

Honestly, coming back to this hotel was the highlight to an absolute ""assignment from hell.""  Whenever I didn't have time to go out to eat I could count on in-room dining to provide great food -- unlike the bland tapas restaurant, of course.

Thought about getting a massage but read the yelp reviews of the spa.  Why do hotels think they should charge $150 for 50 minutes of massage?  They're so stupid.

Don't park in the normal valet, though.  You park on one side yet have to walk all the way to the other side to pick up your car.  Rather, park at North Valet!  Way way way better.

One of the things I love about this place is that it's decorated tastefully instead of how the Cosmopolitan looks like Beverly Hills puked all over the place.

Its location is a definite plus. Super close to the Cosmopolitan for food\/nightlife and the CityCenter is right there for food\/shopping.

Eleven women stayed at The Aria while competing for Brad Womack's love. Based on what I saw, it looked very impressive. So when booking for our Vegas trip, I just had to check it out for myself!

Our flight arrives a little after 8. We take an airport shuttle to our hotel and are skeptical that our room is ready. Bunny and I decide to check in anyway. Right off the bat, we notice that the staff is extremely friendly, greeting us with a smile and asking if we need assistance.

The concierge informs us that there might not be any available rooms and it could take up to 2 hours to clean one. After doing some research, she does however find a smoking room. At first I am not too sure about it, but she mentions that an ozone machine that could be put inside the room if it gets too smoky. Rather than wait around, we decide to take it. She spends a lot of time going through the different facilities and restaurants within the Aria. We are given a map. During our stay, the fitness center, pool, internet access and two drinks are complimentary.

While heading to the room, we notice that the elevators are split between different floors. Bunny and I look for the elevator designated to our floors. However we are unable to find the room number. I think to myself, ""Wait a minute, am I missing something?"" I start to wonder if maybe the numbers are transposed. After searching for quite some time, a housekeeper notices and asks if we need help, Then she tells us we are in the wrong tower! 

Eventually we find the room and are not disappointed with our king deluxe sky suite. It is amazing with a great view of the city. There is a tub and shower and a separate room for the toilet. Perhaps a fan may help in the area. Curtains can be closed with a switch. When turning on or off the lights, there are different categories, such as reading, lamp and goodnight. Almost everything can be done with a remote control on the T.V. In the closet, there are two bathrobes and slippers.

There is plenty of security at the hotel. When heading up the elevators to get to your room, you had to show your room key. In order to use the fitness center or pool, the room key had to be presented as well. A bottle of water and a towel is presented to you as soon as you show your guest key at the front desk . There is a good variety of workout equipment and machines. The pools are clean and there are a lot of lifeguards on duty. 

The rooms are not only cleaned in the mornings. It would be to up mutiple times a day! Sometimes after leaving for a few short hours, I would notice fresh towels, new sheets and a fixed bed. We were very pleased with the service and liked that we were being taken care of.

During our three days, we were treated like celebrities. We would be greeting with, ""Good Morning,"" have our doors open for us, and be provided with great customer service.

Aria's location is excellent, next to Crystal shopping and the Cosmopolitan restaurant scene.  It also has several top-knotch restaurants of its own such as Masa and Julian Serrano.

I usually prefer a firm bed but was pleasantly surprised by the softness! It was like sleeping on a cloud! 

There were several restaurants at the Aria but we only ate at one and it was mediocre and over priced. I can't remember the name of it (downstairs near lobby, green glass pillars at entrance).  I was served cold eggs and cold hash browns! Then our server ran our credit card for the wrong bill. She was quite unfriendly. I think she hated her job.

It was our first visit to Aria and we had very high expectations based on all the excellent Yelp reviews.  At first we were not overly impressed and were very critical of the place. The approach to the hotel from the airport with our rental car was easy. Straight down LV Blvd and a left at City Center.  
CHECK-IN: There are several car lanes leading directly to the front. We  pulled up to the Valet drop off area.  No one helped to pull the suitcases out of the truck. We dragged our bags to the Valet area on the left... still no one around.  We asked where the registration desk\/lobby was... it was on the other side.  Again, no one from hotel staff around... no offers of assistance. We dragged our bags to the lobby where a bell hop finally took our bags. Check in at 8pm was relatively quick and easy. The entire outdoor front to the hotel is wide open, uncongested and very classy... water, glass, etc.
LOBBY:  Not huge at all. Nice but nothing special.  Was surprised to see the casino almost pushing itself into the lobby.  Almost right in your face. Had expected a classy hotel to put some distance btwn the lobby and the casino. Nope... right in your face.  Didn't realize how many people still smoke... my God, were all the smokers in the world in the Aria lobby that night? The vanilla scent helps but did not entirely mask the stall smell of smoke. Long lines for check-in... slow.  However, once it was your turn, the staff were helpful.
THE ROOM: We had the Deluxe room with a city view.  Well appointed but nothing really special.  To be honest, had expected something a little bigger. Bed and pillows VERY comfortable. Open door and walk in, the curtains open automatically revealing a wonderful view of night time Vegas. However, the TV comes on and was blasting music.  Took me my first 10 min in the room to figure out  just how to turn off the music using the keypad.  No hooks in the shower for robe or towel. Had a towel rack on inside of shower door, but it you took a shower, your towel would get soaked.  Sink had no drain stopper... so when I shaved, I could not fill the sink up with water. Had to leave the water running... guess there must not be a water problem in LV?
WIFI:  Free in entire hotel complex. But a very weak WIFI.  IPhones could pick up WIFI in room but was very very SLOW.  Only place WIFI seemed to work was in the lobby.  Fortunately, we brought our laptop which worked fine in WIFI in the room. 
GYM:  Great....!  But closes at 8pm so forget about a late night PT.
POOLS: Great. But doesn't  open until 9am... so forget about an early morning swim.
BUFFET BREAKFAST:  Tons of food... think I gained a few pounds during our week long stay.  Western and Asian foods... no complaints here.  However, had to order coffee and juice from waitress.  Not real fast... Would get my food first and start eating. Amost done with breakfast before the coffee and juice would arrive. You get my drift.
COST OF BUFFET BREAKFAST: My hotel reservation was booked on a promotion that adversied complimentary buffet breakfast (max of $40). I thought my wife and I were entitled to a complimentary bfast each morning during our stay. Wrong... only the first day. So I was surprised to see breakfast charges on my bill for every day.  Perhaps I misunderstood... I have stayed at plenty of 4 and 5 star hotels in Asia and the buffet breakfast ALWAYS comes free for the length of the stay. Not here. Anyhow, my bad for not asking directly if it was for every day. I received a $50 credit when I complained.
CHECK OUT:  Easy... arranged with bell desk to have bags picked up at a certain time. Called down in advance to Valet to have the car waiting. Bell desk picks up bags and delivers them to Valet pickup area. A bell hop waits with the bags and puts em in the car when you depart.  
OVERALL:  We were critical at first but came to like this place after visiting Venetian, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Bellagio, etc. Each hotel has something to offer and each is different in their own way. Other than the lobby, Aria is open and uncongested. Valet is away from main lobby and uncongested. It is clean and modern and has a Air Conditioned waiting room too.  I would stay here again and would not feel guilty about letting the water run in the sink without a stopper.",0,0,0

These people have no clue what they are talking about. Aria is fantastic in every possible way. Trust me, I've stayed in many hotels in Vegas from the low-end (Golden Gate) to high-end (Encore) and Aria is perfect.

The beds are huge and comfortable, and I had no problem figuring out the console to control the lighting and curtains. I really appreciated being able to fix them at a whim. Frosted glass bathroom is a tad weird, but I never share bathrooms with guys (and I wasn't with guys both times I've stayed here) so that wasn't a big deal for me. 

Where Aria really shines is in its restaurants and bars: Deuce Lounge, Jean-George, Julian Serano & City Bar all had fantastic bartenders with loads of food and beverage experience. If you want to know what's up with this town, you ask a bartender -- they have seen it all. I also really loved the sandwiches at Jean Phillipe Patisserie and the 24 hour cafe ain't too bad (here's a hint: keep your order very, very simple). 

Yes, there is a resort fee, yes the smell of vanilla is overwhelming, and yes, it is not done in the same over the top gaudy 80s casino style that people want to cling to. But hey -- times are changing. Things can't stay the same forever. Let go of that old stuff and get with the new.",0,0,0

I went to the Aria last weekend with my fiancee, sister and brother-in-law with the purpose of seeing a Cirque du Soleil show. We saw Zarkana at the Aria's theater, and it was a great venue. Love the atmosphere with a newer, high-tech classy vibe. 

We played some video black jack at this casino, as the tables started at $15.00 per hand, at least during the day\/time we were at the casino. I'm not a big roller and I typically stay away from anything over $10.00 per hand, but that's just my preference. Anyways, we received great bar service while we were playing the video black jack machine. 

After the show, we went to their desert store, ""Jean Phillipe"" for some Gelato and it was absolutely amazing. In fact, their mint chocolate chip Gelato is the sole purpose for me getting on here to write this review. I will be staying at the Aria sometime in the future with the sole purpose of eating a lot of Gelato.

I stayed there once last year & got a smoking charge to my room.  I didn't smoke in my room.  I didn't vape in my room.  I can say it was the worst room I've ever had there - it didn't smell good at all when we got there & I'm sure it's one of the old smoking rooms.  The view was right over the casino roof - so ugly.  Anyway, the only thing I can think that may have caused this is that we phoned down to ask for more TP in the room & for cleaning- we had only been left 1\/2 a roll & by day two we were out.  We went down to the pool to hang out while they cleaned, but unfortunately, it was summer & it was PACKED.  You couldn't find a spot to squeeze in the pool anywhere - way too many bodies.  So, we headed back in the casino to try to waste some time gambling while we waited for the room to be serviced.  I had a cigarette at the bar down there.  We then proceeded back up only to find that they still hadn't cleaned the room.  The guy comes then - we tell them nevermind on the cleaning, but that we need some toilet paper.  He comes into the room - & as I had just come up from having a smoke in the casino, I'm guessing he smelled it on me?  At any rate, we were charged their fee for that despite not having done anything in the room.  I called to protest this only to be told that ""the housekeeping management had confirmed this and I would have to take it up with my credit card company"".  
I'm not sure how the housekeeping staff confirmed this... but I did take it up with my credit card.  They removed the fee almost immediately at that point.
So, I still decide to give them another chance when a good deal came along in my emails... I book a trip, but we had other plans come up.  I call to cancel the reservation about two months prior to the date & don't think much of it after that.  The day before the trip was to be, I get an email about my upcoming stay at the Aria.  I immediately call to fix the situation.  I have to talk to the ""VIP"" desk as my reservation is through them.  They ask me who I spoke with - I told them I didn't know the woman's name, but it was definitely someone at the ""VIP"" desk.  The man tells me that since it's within 72 hours, there would be a charge.  I explain that I canceled the room months before.  He tells me - as if he's doing me a favor - that he will not charge me, but that in the future I should get the person's name & request a confirmation be sent.  He tells me that I handled it wrong - not an apology for his staff not handling it incorrectly & the inconvenience that put on me!  RIDICULOUSLY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!   
So, although I've had many great stays there & lots of memories & affection for the place - I cannot stay there again.  Jerks. Do they not realize there's a lot of other places to stay in town?",0,0,0

For around $360 we get 2 nights and 2 show tickets.   When checking in, I did the $20 tip for an upgrade and the receptionist told me we were automatically upgraded to a corner suite.

Suite was incredible probably the nicest room we've stayed in @ Vegas.

Great controls of lighting, temperature, and bathroom facilities.  Views of cosmo galore.  We could hear when there were ambulances and sadly I heard a lot of them.  Resort fees $25 plus a resort fee tax of $3 per day got you free wifi, newspaper hanging on your door in the morning.  Didn't check out the fitness room or the pool bc it was cold.

Aria really shines in all the restaurants inside and the proximity to crystals which also had other restaurants and shops.  Go to the pastries shop next to the guest elevator.  My wife got the do Che leche crepe good stuff.

Negatives: buffet I heard was not very good so had to go to another place for it.  The self parking garage is too far from the guest elevators.  Wouldnt hurt to make carrying your luggage to your room easier. Lastly lots of smoke, could get better ventilation.

Overall, very nice stay that we will finitely remember.  It being a central location and trams to bellasio and ease to walk to Caesars etc... Make this place a slam dunk for people who want to be in the middle of it all.",2,0,0

On one hand, we stayed in a 2-bedroom penthouse room, and enjoyed all of the amenities that come with the room.  Unfortunately, on the other hand, there were several things that made the stay less than perfect.

First off, if you can, stay in the sky suites.  We were picked up right on time in the airport by a chauffeur, who whisked us to the hotel in a limo.  Arrived in their private entrance (a gate had to be opened), and check-in was a breeze.  There is a sky suites lounge, that offers free breakfast pastries and juices in the morning, free bottled water and sodas at all hours, chocolate covered cherries, cheeses, figs, and crackers in the afternoons, and best of all, free booze.  Grey Goose, Johnny Walker, Cuervo, and the like.

The room was absolutely amazing.  All the complaints about not getting the requested room are kind of annoying - they are very clear about not guaranteeing the specific type of room...it's like beign pissed off about not getting the car in the picture when you rent a car.  And a complimentary rollaway bed is something they don't have to do.  

Anyways, the room was great, but there were two flaws that were ultimately not corrected.  One side of the room was blazing hot.  There were two sets of technicians that came in, and each time, fixed the problem - but sure enough, a few hours later, the problem would come back again.  Finally, an engineer admitted to us that the hotel didn't have the capability to properly cool all of the rooms - instead, they hope that people won't turn the AC down all the way.  Uhh, we are in the desert, right?

Next, some of the control screens were not working.  Yes, I know what you're thinking, you're just an idiot who couldn't work it.  Not true.  I work for an IT firm, own lots of tech-y geek-y things, and they just didn't work.  In fact, when we first got in, they were programmed to control a totally different room at first!  I'm sure the people who were in that room had no idea what was going on, with music being turned on and off, and the blinds randomly opening and closing.

Other than that though, everything else was great.  The casino, though a bit dark, served its purpose.  I for one, enjoy the slight vanilla smell in the lobbies, as it masks the smokey smell that I detest.  The food was priced as all Vegas places are on the strip - that is, overpriced, but the food was good.  The sports book has some of the best TVs I've seen, all in crystal clear HD, and gigantic.  

So, summing things up, if fundamental things like room controls and air conditioning had been solved, this would have been a perfect stay.  Ultimately, I'm not sure I would stay again, as these things need to be right the first time around.  But, there can be good value in their suites especially if you're splitting with others, so give it a shot - you might have a different experience than we did.",1,0,1

The first thing you notice here is just the size of the city center. I mean it's HUGE. At check-in, the person said the 2 queen bedroom that I had been guaranteed wasn't available, but they were willing to give me $100 off for the room. I tried to make a deal about getting the room and trying to get tickets for Tiesto at their Haze club, so the person called the manager over. I was ready to walk out and get my deposit back, but the manager fixed the problem, saying that maid service had not updated the rooms. So, I got the room, but didn't get the tickets to haze (whole other story there in my haze review). 
Have you ever had a problem getting into a hotel room because you didn't slide the key in properly? Here, you don't slide the key into a slot, but touch it to a sensor on the door. I thought this was freaken awesome. But when I got into the room, the first thing I noticed was the cigarette smell. Damn me for not asking for a non smoking room. But the room itself, while small, was technologically the most superb thing I had ever been in. I mean, everything was controlled from their remote keypad - lights, tv, curtains, etc. Technology doesn't make the most basic things easy though. The regular tv remote didn't even work. So I had to use that touch pad which gave a delay for changing channels.
The bathroom had two sinks and, my fave, two sets of toiletries, saving me a call to made service to request some extra stuff, which I normally have to do at other hotels. The shower head sucked though. I have a better shower head at home, and when I'm paying $500+ a night, they better have a better shower head than what I'm used to. 
After clubbing at Haze, I decided to do a little late night\/early morning black jack. The casino is small compared to other vegas casinos, but they have a lot of choices for table games, and special sections for high rollers like any other top casino. They also had a great sized poker room. I was lucky to get an awesome blackjack dealer who was more than willing to teach newbies how to gamble. You don't get this at the other big casinos.
As a guy in vegas, I couldn't help but ogle at the hotness of the cocktail waitresses, especially since it was the late night\/early morning shift where there aren't as many gamblers. When I went to gamble later in the afternoon, the waitresses weren't as good looking. No idea how that is relevant, but again, I am a guy in vegas.
When I woke up in the early afternoon, it was time for checkout. So I tried to express checkout from the tv, and the stupid control thing wouldn't let me do so. Major fail on the technology part of the hotel. So I had to wait 45 mins before someone from the front desk could check me out over the phone, but didn't have a hard time doing so once the call was picked up, and the bill was emailed to me. 
What does one do in vegas on new years? Bet on the rose bowl. The sports book is small compared to other casinos, especially mandalay bay or caesars, but it got the job done. One of their big screens had a huge black spot, so that made it hard to watch the game. And their feed had a major delay, as I could hear people from the bar near the book scream after a major play happened before we did. 
The overall service was good, but not to the standard vegas level that I'm used to. For example, when I called the front desk inquiring whether their business center was open, the person on the other line said it was. When I walked over to the center, it was closed. I shouldn't have made the walk if the desk people were on point with their jobs. 
As for my feel of the people here, it was spot on of my theory of how people change because of being in vegas. Being born and raised in LA, you notice who the true Angelenos are and who are the transplants - most transplants think and act like they're better than those surrounding them, while true Angelenos (not those born and raised in LA suburbs, so if you're from Orange County, you're not a true Angeleno) are more relaxed, sort of a been there done that attitude (which may seem douchey to others, but it's an LA thing). In Vegas, it's like LA transplants on HGH. The vibe I got from the guests I encountered in the elevators was beyond anything I had ever received from my previous visits in Vegas. I'm not sure if because it was NYE, or cause Aria is new, or something else, but that's just how I felt, which can really hurt the overall feel for the hotel. And I'm not the biggest fan of hotels that cater to large groups of people who stay in the small rooms next to me. I understand a group of 10 trying to save money, but at least get 2 or 3 rooms to share. If you can't afford to stay in a nice hotel, don't do it. Fair paying customers don't want to hear your fighting or debauchery.

Rooms: 4.5 stars-  the rooms are big, clean, and nice bathrooms. Cozy and the views aren't bad. It was also the ""little things"" that added up to me loving the room, comfortable bed, plenty of tv channels, housekeeping always refilling our shampoos etc. Only little downfall is the rooms are a little boring, paying more for this hotel I was expecting more of a wow factor.

Hotel experience: 4.5 stars. Clean!!! Being in vegas some hotels are downright gross, clearly not the Aria. Beautiful hotel inside and out. Everyone is professional and helpful. Also worth mentioning the little perks- Valet was free when we went as long as you were staying there, as you can guess this saved us lots of money!!! Also be on the lookout for deals; when we stayed you earned a $50 dining credit towards each day, pretty awesome if you ask me.

Areas for improvement: I like a good drink when I'm in Vegas and sadly the bars in here disappointed. The few bar lounges were pretty dull. Also the drinks cost an arm and a leg & weren't even good. Would definitely skip these $15 a drink for a better bar on the strip. Same with their aria cafe\/restaurant- beautiful beyond belief but expensive crappy food; see that review for more details.

check in process :: we were in a GIANT line wrapping around twice in front of the super long counter.  Apparently we arrived at the exact same time as a whole group of bankers in for a convention, lucky us!  Crazy that it only took 15 min to get thru it - I gotta give them big props for that.  They also had a woman coming thru with brochures and maps of the resort and answering any questions.  We received complimentary bottles of water while waiting as well.

Sadly our room was not ready - we were about an hour early than normal check-in time.  They checked us in and had us check bags with valet so we could grab lunch.

service :: we had a good experience with most all of the staff with exception of the business center.  What hotel doesn't  have a few free computers for use?  Valet brought bags to the room quickly and offered to answer questions about the room - showing how to use the remote and etc.  

location :: excellent - we actually walked to quite a lot of the surrounding hotels\/casinos.  The city center has everything you would need - I'm sure that's what they want - to keep you in one place so you won't go somewhere else to spend your money.

casino :: I cannot comment on the gambling\/gaming since I did not partake, but the place is beautiful and smells great.  The smell is a bit much at first, but you totally get used to it and it really does help to mask the cigarette smoke.  When walking thru other casinos I found myself thinking about how that smell really does work at the Aria.  I might have even bought the room diffuser if it wasn't so ridiculously priced. 

dining :: excellent.  Anything you would need right there.  You can see my other reviews for Jean Georges Steakhouse, Sage, Julian Serrano and Jean Philippe Patisserie.  Best service we had was at Cafe Vettro for breakfast - had the most amazing server.  She was fabulous!  And did you know that place can seat over 800 people?  WOW!

the rooms :: modern, clean, spacious and super tech savvy.  I loved how the room greeted me upon entering.  The bed was super comfortable and the views were spectacular.  Two comfy robes, a soaker tub and shower combo like I've never seen before.  The shower could have had a little better pressure, but that's minor.  

A giant pet peeve of mine is the lack of an outlet on the nightstand - who doesn't want to have their phone plugged in by the bed?  The only outlet II could find was on the desk clear across the room!  A couple of other negatives - the bathroom just did not seem clean to me (lots of fingerprints) and knowing that this place is not all that old, the rooms are showing wear - soft wood or something, but lots of nicks and scratches.  

sportsbook :: meh.  Seating was not comfortable and the viewing distance to the big screens was too close!!  No wait staff till 5PM either - huh?? 

I think that about covers it ... overall a very good experience.  Oh and free parking if you have your own car!!",1,1,1

I read most of the reviews on yelp, and noticed that people mostly complained about the service here. Give these guys a break, they are a NEW hotel. They are still working out the kinks and stuff. But I had an amazing time here. This place is huge! I didn't even leave the hotel (something very rare for me when in Vegas), because there was so much to do here.

FOOD: 
You MUST eat at ""The Buffet"". It's around $35 for dinner (average for Vegas buffets). They have LOBSTER!! The lobster tails were amazing with butter or lemon. They also have Kind Crab legs, and pot roast just to name a few. Their Nutella Cake and Creme Brulee were excellent....I ate two servings of each! Their dessert section had pretty sugar art pieces similar to things you would see on The Food Network. I would go back to Aria just to eat their buffet...seriously the BEST buffet on the strip. 

Cafe Vettro is opened 24 hours, a great place to stop by after clubbing. I love the setting and design of this restaurant. The walls were made out of rocks in glass cases. Kinda hard to explain, but very beautiful and unique. The food here is nothing spectacular, but this restaurant is a nice place to hang out after the clubbing. 

ROOMS:
I love the technology in the rooms. You just need to press a button by the door to have your room serviced or private. Just a press of a button ""Room Off"", would turn off the television and every light in your room. Very convenient for lazy drunk people like me. The room is decorated with a modern and sleek design. The mini-fridge is packed with snacks, water and small alcohol bottles. The bathroom is a little small if you're compared to the Wynn's. But his and hers sinks are always a plus. The bathroom plug is hidden behind the tissue box (took me awhile to find it). The bathroom lighting is white, great for girls doing makeup in. The doors in the shower and toilet is made out of glass. I know the glass door for the toilet went along with the whole theme and design of the room, but I don' think its convenient if my girlfriends and I were to stay here. You can see everything through the ""frosted"" glass door, if you're in the bathroom just washing your face or something. Another thing I didn't like about the room was the outside window was not cleaned! I couldn't enjoy the Vegas strip view from my room because the outside window had dirt all over! 

SERVICE:
Check-in was fast and friendly. They have express check-out too, you just call to check out and leave your keys in the room. The servers at all of the restaurants were extremely friendly and welcoming. One thing I hated about the service was how long it always took for them to answer the phone! I would literally wait 10-15 minutes before someone would answer. This annoyed me, but its a new hotel and I'm sure they'll get more workers soon. 

CASINO:
They have $15 Blackjack on Saturday night! 

THE CLUB
The only have one club here called ""Haze"". Its a small club compared to other Vegas clubs. The design of the club reminds me of a smaller version of Tao. There were girls with big boobs in sexy clothes standing in a glass case near the entrance. (Yay for Vegas!) But the dance floor was small, similar to the dance floor at LAX. I wouldn't go to the club again, it wasn't very impressive for a club in Vegas.

PROS:
Great food and Shopping
Free Valet parking
Nice and technology advanced rooms
Big casino, nice poker room
**Amazing BUFFET**
Friendly service
Yay for $15 Blackjack on Saturday night!

CONS:
Dirty outside window, couldn't enjoy the view
Took a long time for them to answer service calls",4,0,1

Check-in:
I had booked a Deluxe King Room months in advance given how incredible of a price we were offered from MLife (for Valentine's Week). We checked-in at about 7 p.m. with a very friendly gentlemen at the front desk. I was hoping to upgrade to one of their Suites and was happy to pay whatever the difference was - unfortunately the hotel Suites were completely booked (no ones fault). 

Room:
Even for a basic room, it did not disappoint. Good technology in the room (the TV is a bit finicky when using the tablet, but still works fine), decent size, very clean and nicely appointed. The view is a bit weak as we were staring at the roof of the lobby overhang, but still, it's a basic room so can't expect too much.

The room cleaning was INCREDIBLY fast and consistent - best we have experienced in Vegas (MAKE SURE TO TIP YOUR ROOM ATTENDANTS!). 

Casino:
I should note that neither my wife nor I are huge table-players. She LOVES slots, as do I, and also do video poker regularly. We found the casino to be oddly setup - as I said above, this is a preference statement. But, we did find the drink service to be much slower than in other MGM properties, I think this is because of the sheer LENGTH of the casino. In casinos like the Mirage, it's fairly ""square"" - so that the wait staff are all quite close to the centre bar to get drinks. Here, they have to walk quite a long way, and can easily miss you.

Restaurants and Bars:
Great selection to chose from, and something for everyone. Great bars, with top-notch drinks.

Location:
Great location that's very close to the Cosmo and Monte Carlo. We prefer further North towards Mirage, but it's still a great spot.

Check-out:
Again, very polite and friendly - and they held our bags for us as our flight wasn't until 4 p.m.

I'm honestly not sure if, for the price, we like this resort above Mirage or Mandalay Bay (although it's WAY more conveniently located than MB), but it's definitely the nicest MGM Property overall in our opinion.

The chocolate brown theme made it seem even darker, too, although I do love chocolate brown.  Bf said that the rooms at the Palazzo are nicer, so I'd love to check that out next time.

We'd go back, though.  Everything was really nice.  I just wasn't as ""wow'ed"" as I thought I'd be for what the room cost.",0,0,0

They even delivered a dessert since it was a birthday getaway.  They have really dropped prices - stayed for $70 a night and they comped all my meals there - based on play.  The buffet is a good deal with all you can drink wine and lobster included.  The pool area was disappointing with no waitresses even stopping by.  Overall - I prefer the wynn or even palazzo - but for under 70 - it was a steal for a 5 star room.,2,0,2

We were able to get a King deluxe room with a nice Strip view. The room was immaculate. Everything (from the TV, lights, temperature, etc) is all controlled from a tablet in the room. Pretty fancy, eh? What's even hilarious is there is a ""Romance"" option on the tablet, where it dims the lights, closes the blinds, and some smooth Jazz music will automatically play from the TV. LOL.

The bathroom is pretty spacious. Glass door shower with a soaking tub inside. The toilet has its own separate room from the sink\/vanity area. So you're able to get your privacy that way. I'm really liking it.

The concierge is friendly too. Check-out is easy as you can do it from your phone. Parking overnight though is $10. You can use your hotel room card to swipe for parking if you visit other casinos under the MGM Resorts management.

I would definitely come here again. A great place for relaxation and good sleep when you're in Vegas!",12,9,13

Will review Bellagio based on past experiences, since Aria was the first time not staying at Bellagio...... Aria is (mostly) first class Its new, modern luxury (but sometimes just doesn't make the grade), great finishes.

The Room::::::::: Corner Suite - views, comfort and tech - loved it.  There is a box with connections for a variety of gadgets to connect to (your phone, digital camera, computer) to see images on the flat screen TV monitor. (need to bring your cables !). 

The Room ... The Odd::::::::::The bed has a mattress that Aria proudly promotes as custom made for them, and for sale from Aria ( hmmm, not many resorts promote this.....but okie dokie). Hmmmm well, it is a ""pillow top"" mattress (I think the main part is layers of foam) anyhooooo, unless you love extremely soft mattresses (some folk do), like you just sink right in and it creates a cocoon around you. Since I am not a worm, and don't have aspirations to be a butterfly ... this was not good. Call down to the front desk and hear the pitch as to why this is a great mattress, and then sympathetic words when asking them if they have a room with a firmer mattress (answer NO !) Something like ""sorry but all our rooms are fitted with the same mattress that was custom developed for Aria"". I don't appreciate being summarily dismissed, sooooo, I call ""house keeping"" and again politely explain that the mattress is too soft. They explain ""we hear that a lot and we can bring a mattress board to make it firmer"". Having never heard of this device, I was curious. Well it turned out to be a ply-wood board that they insert under the mattress, which helped mildly. I was destined to be wrapped in a cocoon. 

Service The Odd::::: (like hours for house keeping to respond to a simple request)... like I would like more shampoo.

Valet parking::::: suite dwellers move to the front of the response time - excellent. Complementary for all !

Food::::avoid: the buffet (disclosure ... not a fan of ""all you can eat"" joints and stayed away from buuuufaaay's for quite a while) The credit per night we were told would be applied to the room was only for food or gift shop, and w\/o any desirable items in the shop and limited time based on the recent disclosure of the ""credit"" , went for the buuufaaay) for $30+ per person, not a good choice. Sorry to say even for free, it was not worth sitting down, and sampling the bad food. 

Odd: :::::there is a $20 "" resort fee"" per room which includes using the pool (tooo cold to use in December), hot-tub (too many fat people from Nebraska), and wifi (very erratic).  While becoming more common, I still wonder why  a resort fee ?  Wifi is erratic (must re-register with the ARIA site again and again, bumping you off after a little while). The staff reported that due to the ""free"" aspect of wifi, many more people are logging on and over loading their ""system"". Huh ? The wifi: 1. it aint free - Aria told me I am paying for it 2. bandwidth & servers are cheap - get a clue ARIA.  

Odd continued:::::::: For some reason the room service carts are left in the hallway for a long time ( 8 hours or more) After an esteemed guest finishes they push them out of the room. I can understand why, THEY STINK ! Not that I am nosy (pun not intended), but who stays in a suite and orders bbq chicken wings ? Saw 3 of them outside the suites, house keeping (at least 3 people) making their rounds to survey which rooms they were going to service, all ignoring the carts.

Odd continued:::::: Returning after a dinner @ Mon Ami Gabi, there was a strong stench outside the main entrance, like S H I T., like ""what is that smell ?""   Next day the stench remained. Figured out that they had dumped manure into the large planters. I could be wrong, but I would think there are less odorous compounds that can help their plants. 

Odd continued:::::: Picking up my car from the truly responsive valet, I hand the car jockey $ 3 folded in the appropriate tip manner. He proceeds to unfold them and count. Now come on, times are tough I know, but don't count your George Washington's in front of me. I thought $3 was a good tip for driving my great car 100 feet. 

I am not a whiner or complainer or candlestick maker, but the odd things kept adding up.  I chalked it up to the newness of the hotel (although I think it is a year since they opened), but  after many $ BILLIONS to create City Center, it can be true that the ""devil is in the details"". I can speculate that someone is not paying attention....to those details. Perhaps they can not face the devil or to busy taking a nap. 

Having stayed at many true 5* hotels around the world (not a bragger) Aria is a 3 or 4 star rendition...and maybe that is what they want to be. The effort and cost to get to 5 stars, may not be in their cards (pun intended)",6,1,1

Wish it had a fridge and microwave, but I love the double sinks and bathtub. However, this years visit (10\/28\/16 - 11\/4\/16) I had so many issues that I don't think I will ever stay again. I booked my room for Thursday check in because my flight was coming in at 8am on Friday and did not want to wait until 3pm to get a room. I also told the employee that when i booked it on the phone. When I reached the airport, I saw an email from Aria instructing me how to check in online. I proceeded but the website said it couldn't find my reservation so, I called the hotel. The operator confirmed that my 2 rooms were ready and when I get to the hotel, just go to the mobile check in machine to get my keys. However when I got there, the mobile check in machine was closed and when I spoke to the front desk they said my reservation was cancelled. I explained to her that I confirmed my reservation that morning so after a long while speaking to her manager, they said the operator I spoke to was new and probably cancelled it on accident. Luckily they still had 2 rooms, however they were 2 queen bed rooms when I actually booked a king bed room. I didn't care as long as I had a room because I just got off a 5 hour flight and needed rest. She was nice enough to not charge us for the first night so maybe the hassle was worth it. Then, when I got to the room and laid on the bed, I was so disappointed! I go there specifically for their extra comfy beds but it was hard as a rock! I'm not sure if they just changed their beds or only the king beds are comfy, but it was NOT the same!! When we left the hotel a few hours later, we tried to exit the hotel using the room key like the front desk instructed me to but it said ""no data found"" on ALL 4 keys we had so the parking attendant had to page me out. When I arrived back to the hotel I went to the front desk to fix my keys but they says they'll just give me a separate parking card. After a pretty long wait, she came back with 1 card. I told her we had 2 cars so she went back to grab one more. I would think these things should be within reach, but she took a LONG time especially for fixing their own mistakes and when she came back with the card, there was no ""sorry"" or ""thanks for waiting"". I was fed up at this point with the service for the price we paid to stay at this ""resort"". I began to explain my frustration and she quickly responded with, ""I can give you a $100 food credit per room"". I felt like she didn't care and was just pushing us off with this response but there was nothing else I could do so back to our room we went. We stayed here for 6 nights and left the hotel a couple times a day. The parking card did NOT work 80% of the time. The parking attendant seemed to have to manually page almost every car in and out, every time. What's the point? And yes, you have to pay $10 a day for parking! Then when it was time for check out, I tried the mobile check out but, to no surprise, it couldn't find our reservation so I had to call the front desk AGAIN. But, when she went over my bill, they actually noted the $100 credit when I was sure at that point that they would have no record of it. Although their rooms are still nice, their service isn't always the best. I would stay here again if it was under $100\/night. Other than that, the price isn't worth it and the resort fees aren't worth the amenities.",0,0,0

On our arrival, we immediately notice that the Casino's air filtration was not as good as the Wynn or Bellagio.  When we arrived in our room, the TV had a rolling message that the cable was disconnected, I called the front desk and they informed me that the TV service had gone down the day before and they were working on it(this was on Thursday and we left on Sunday and it was never fixed).  Several of the lights in the room didn't work as well.  

I'm giving it 2 stars, one for the mattress which was very comfortable and the second for the brunch we had at Bardot Brasserie, which again was amazing.  

We've stayed at several hotels on the strip, and the Aria did not live up to the billing.  There were more little signs that this hotel was lacking in upkeep.  So my suggestion is that if you can stay here at a discounted rate, you can find enough good to enjoy. If you are paying regular price, you are going to be sorely disappointed.",3,0,0

In this case it was other buildings and rooftop.

If your interested in a good pool, this is NOT the hotel for you.

I am a huge fan of sleek, modern design with the use of natural materials (wood, metal, stone, glass) - to me, it's comfortable and inviting, just like Aria.  The service was amazing from the front desk to the janitorial staff.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.

We had a deluxe city view room that was nice and spacious with a wonderfully large bathroom.  The all-in-one remote control was neat but also slow and cumbersome.  I wonder how long it will be before that technology will require an update?  We loved all of the ports for our phone chargers and how you can play your iPod through the TV speakers.  Thoughtful touches such as those, as well as the light dimmers, ample closet and drawer space, and the comfy bed, made our stay very enjoyable.

The air filtration system throughout the hotel is spectacular!  Go stand in any other casino and you can tell the difference.  Is the scent vanilla, cinnamon or lavender?  Who cares, it's fresh air at all times!

We spent quite a bit of time in the pool area, which is top notch.  There are 3 big pools with loads of chairs and umbrellas and lots of nice landscaping.  There are also several attentive waitresses walking around and a bar for your drinking pleasure.  Other than the constant barrage of pop music that you can't seem to escape in Vegas, it was tons of fun in the sun.

Now - if I could make a suggestion:  free drinking water other than just on the casino floor.  If this luxury resort would really like to stand out and go above and beyond to make its guests very happy and comfortable, how about a few drinking fountains interspersed throughout the premises like its many decorative fountains?  I'm sure that would not bring in as much money as the current $4.50 per bottle of Dasini, but I imagine this LEED Gold certified building could make good use of some kind of water filtration system as cool as the air filtration.  Yes, I know there is tap water in my room, but it tasted kinda funky to me.  Thank goodness CVS Pharmacy is right next door!

Can't wait to go back for more of Bar Moderno's Bramble Berries and Jean-Philippe's gelato!  Thanks for a wonderful time, Aria.",2,1,1

This casino and hotel is one of the hottest on the Strip, and perfectly centered so you can walk easily between the north and south ends' hotels. 

Not surprisingly, the guest service was outstanding - from check-in, through dining and casino services, to the pool, and even when I had to call security to report a domestic happening at 4am. All the while, the hotel staff handled everything with ease and with smiles. 

One night, I ate at the buffet which was great (but not the best that I've had on the Strip). The meal was $44 per person, but you could get bottomless adult beverages for just another $13 - so it was a pretty good deal for CityCenter. There were king crab legs and just about anything else you could want to eat - a real international buffet! Tacos, dim sum, sushi, pizza, potroast, hummus, fried rice, etc... all in one meal. :) 

The other night at Aria, I dined at Lemongrass - an upscale Thai-fusion experience that took about 3 hours from start to finish. We had cucumber salad, chicken satay, fried prawn rolls, pad thai, cashew chicken, and the most delicious coconut ice cream in the world. I finished this meal with a ridiculously-good drink that combined Ketel with fresh watermelon juice and squeezed baby limes. Loved it.

The pool was an interesting experience - mostly lined with overly-loving couples and 20-somethings who can't quite handle their alcohol. Note - none of these pools were kid-friendly. The lifeguards seemed to be embarrassed and were forced to be sort of ""adult babysitters"". But the setting was very elegant, and we still managed to have a good time out there. 

The Aria is connected to Crystals which houses just about every high-end retailer you can imagine. Prada. Gucci. Tiffany. etc. Not quite my usual fashion style - but it's fun to have a look. 

Do note that the high-class hotel brings Starbucks' that are about $6 a coffee and Dasani water that's $3.25 a bottle. Those quick stops are on the Promenade level on the way to the pool... and are sometimes really a necessity!

Housekeeping would put the dirty glasses back like they cleaned them.  Next day, they left the dirty room service eaten food and cart in the room.  the 3rd day, left the ironing board and iron out.   If they will fail to do such obvious housekeeping, how often is the bedding and bathrooms cleaned?  Gross. 
Bar Service at all the bars was very disappointing.  Rude, difficult to get their attention.  For example, I was playing on one of the video poker machines and they still charged me $15 for a well drink.   
Floor Service worse.  As an example, I was playing $10 hands of video poker for 30 minutes in the morning and was dying for a coffee.  Never once did a wait staff drop by and I was constantly looking for one.  I just finally got up and stopped gambling to go to coffee shop.  I actually completely stopped gambling at Aria after that experience.  
Their comps weren't very good either for how much I gambled with mlife.  All around very disappointing and a weird crowd that I don't know who they are trying to cater to (we were there during some lame convention that was going on at the same time, so maybe those people were the weird ones staying there).

I wish I could live in you.

Nice and new, where the smoke from the casino hasn't even penetrated into the rooms.

You promote me to be the laziest I can be with your remote next to the bed that controls everything from the music, lighting, temperature control and even privacy sign!

The fact that your bathtub is behind the same glass door as the shower makes you that much better for some odd reason.

Your dark, sexy colors and your amazing pillow top bed that only the super wealthy can afford.  One day, I will have you, one day.

I actually preferred the standard room over the suite because the layout was more open.  The only thing I liked in the suite more was the fact that there were amazing views from the bathtub.

Even the slot machines in the casino are nice and new with touch screens and I swear they have a Dolby surround sound system!  JK",1,1,0

Service: The hotel staff are all very friendly and accommodating to your needs.  The concierge is super friendly and can help you look up times and book tickets for shows.  We forgot to print out our tickets and they were able to do it for us.  Tip: Remember to put on the ""privacy"" light on and call for cleaning service.. otherwise they will be there bright and early while you are still catching up on some much needed beauty rest. 

Food: They have a bunch of different options for food, which are all usually open late. 
Jean Philippe Patisserie is super yummy that serves all kinds of food including their popular desserts (crepes, gelato, chocolate, macaroons, and lots of other delicious sweet delicacies).  

Lemongrass-Asian fusion, that serves dimsum during lunch!! Food tastes okay, but a bit overpriced (as most places are in Vegas). 

Five50Pizza is pretty yummy- about $6 per slice.  It's thin crust pizza with lots of yummy cheeses and other topics. Just make sure to check that it's not burnt before you chose a slice!  


Each time I've stayed here, it has been fully booked and our room was a bit far from the elevator.  Next time I will definitely make sure that I ask for a room that's not (what feels like miles in my heels) from the elevators.

Overall highly recommended hotel and will definitely stay here again next time! :)",0,0,0

If you want to secure a seat, make sure you get there early because it fills up fast. Only flaw was that the pools were very shallow. The Aria, Wynn, Mandalay Bay, and Rio are our go to places to stay when in Vegas but unfortunately we can't always stay at The Aria due to budget constraints. The only knock on this place is their crappy buffet. We had a $100 food voucher and decided to go there for dinner. Had we actually had to pay for that buffet, I would have been a one ticked off Asian.

We had some really high expectations for this place because of all the hype! We were majorly let down. Now to begin: 
When we first arrived my friends parents(who were paying for the trip) asked the front desk to change our room from a two night stay to a 3 night and they acted like he was asking them to like close down the whole hotel! I understand if someone else had already reserved our room for the day after we were scheduled to leave, but they totally didn't have to be so rude to him especially when we were trying to give them money. Whatever they let us do it.
THEN the AC is one of the rooms broke and it took them FOREVER to come fix it. When they finally did they sprayed some gross smelling stuff in the vent and it stank up the whole room, the hallway and even the elevator. It was sooo bad. We expected them to offer letting us get a new room but nope not even an apology for the wretched smell. They just sprayed some other stuff to mask it. Whatever we let it go...
THEN we were doing our hair in our room getting ready to go out and our power blows out! We called the front desk to report it and they tell us they'll send someone to fix it...30 minutes later a guy comes up to our room with a new blow dryer...WTF?! Luckily the power came back on Its own so we didn't bother saying anything..and LASTLY, we were  walking to our room in the morning coming back from the pool and I happen to glance in a room that they're doing maid service in and I see the housekeeper pick up a Cosmo from the desk, plop on the bed, and start reading it! OK although this last thing didn't happen go us, it was still super unprofessional...

They gave a Starbucks right in the hotel and the pastry shop by the elevators was amazing.

The cleanest and most comfortable hotel that I have ever been to and this is coming from a freak who brings a bed in a bag when traveling or sleeps in a hoodie all weekend so that her body doesn't have to touch the bed in a 4.5 star hotel! I love their inside jacuzzi and their remote that controls everything in the room.

As soon as you walk into this hotel, you will notice their vanilla scent! It seems SOOOO GOOD. Another cool thing about their scent is that it changes as you walk throughout the hotel!
Pool is clean and very relaxing!

The only cons that I found here was that there were no restaurants that offered a quick bite: all the restaurants here were upscale, sit down restaurants and I personally don't feel the need to eat fancy three times a day! Though it is a fancy hotel, they should offer other options for their customers. I know that I could easily go across the street to Planet Hollywood etc, but the point of a Resort & Casino is to make their hotel the only place you would need stay & spend your money.

Besides that I loved everything else about this hotel. I didn't minus any stars because it's hard to find a great clean hotel and for such a cheap rate of $100 a night plus $75 resort credit for the promo that I had. The free buffet wasn't bad either!

I went into the Aria on a weekday early morning and played some Hold'em and Omaha for a few hours before deciding to go play som Pai Gow poker instead. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt with Oakley sunglasses. As I approached the Pai Gow gaming section there were tons of open tables maybe five or six and there was only one player playing at one of the tables. I picked an empty table, sat down and immediately was put through the wringer by the dealer and floor person who interrogated me like the gestapo. I put $300 on the table and they asked for my ID. I'm 38 and have been going to casinos since I was 23 I have never been asked for my ID. Moreover, I worked in variety of casinos in Los Angeles for over 10 years and I never saw them ask for ID from their patrons except in situations where the client's age was genuinely in question. I pulled out my ID then the dealer and floor person took forever staring at the ID and comparing it to me and made a few comments about the picture and how it doesn't look like me. Then they asked me to take off my sunglasses. I took off my shades then they gave me my ID back and proceeded to give me chips. I put my sunglasses back on. I was betting $50 per hand with $15 on the bonus. I won my first hand and the dealer said ""Ok, you won you should go now."" The floor lady behind her said ""Ya, people rarely win my advice is you take your winnings and go."" I laughed and continued to play. I won a few more hands including a bonus win and I toked the dealer $5 despite the abrasive behavior hoping to ""break the ice."" The dealer was happy and finally smiled and became nicer. The floor lady walked away. A few hands later a new dealer came in and immediately told me to take off my sunglasses. I asked her why and they said ""You can't play here with sunglasses on."" Again, in all my years of being around casinos including working in casinos for over 10 years I have never seen casino staff force players to take their sunglasses off. I was maybe 40 yards from the Aria poker room where practically everyone wears sunglasses and no one had said a thing while I was in there and yet now I have to take them off. Additionally, I had been playing at about seven or eight different casinos for two days prior to going to the Aria and never once was asked for my ID or told to take off my sunglasses. I told the dealer that the last dealer didn't say anything about my sunglasses and she said well we have rules over here they should have enforced them and the dealer motioned for the floor person who came over and now suddenly tells me that I have to take off my sunglasses. At this point I was ready to get out of there because of the cold shoulder treatment I had been receiving but I was winning and I had been having a bad streak playing at a multitude of other casino's so I opted to stay. I continued to play and the floor person stood by the table chatting with me and telling me in every which way possible how tough it is to win at Pai Gow and that I should take my winnings and go while I can. I've probably seen more Pai Gow hands played than both the floor lady and the dealer combined so to have them give me a lecture on the game of Pai Gow seemed a bit pretentious and disrespectful. I finally lost a hand and the floor lady chimed in ""See I told you."" This really pissed me off. It's tough enough to win at casinos but to have a person who works at the casino heckling you when you lose is too much. I grabbed my chips and left. I will never step foot in the Aria again. I don't know what kind of clientele they are looking for but it certainly isn't me.",1,0,0

The only things I didn't care for was the fact that we couldn't use the darn refrigerator without a charge, the pool closed at 4pm daily and there was an asshole guy in valet who tried to make us go all the way across the hotel to catch uber. Not across the street. He literally wanted us to walk through the hotel and wait on the other side. In Vegas uber can only pick up at certain locations. At this hotel, there were 2 locations. The location we were standing is where we'd been picked up and dropped off the whole wk. I called the driver to see where she was and she was on the same side we were about to leave from. I could hear him over the phone telling her to go somewhere else. Why the hell would you do that if you know we're standing here and just told you we were waiting on her?

I found the hotel of my dreams the last time I stayed in Vegas. The Signature. It's quiet, room service at 1:30am is prompt and delicious and you can fit more clowns in the giant two person jacuzzi tub than in a VW beetle. 

But this time we jumped on a deal to stay 3 nights at the Aria. One of the strips newest babies and supposedly a high tech wonder.

We drove up from Phoenix after work and didn't check in until after 11 at night, and the highest up we could get was the 4th floor. Yay. Paid extra for the Deluxe City View and got a deluxe view of the valet drop-off overhang.

Entrance to the room was nice, lights came on, curtains opened and soft music from the TV. That's about where the niceties stopped. 100lbs of covers on a to tall, to soft bed. It all ended up on the floor. 

The next morning I found out several bulbs were out in the room. One in the shower, one in the weird frosted toilet area and the close up mirror. BTW what idiot decided to put a mirror next to the light switches. You either shut off the lights with your shoulder and you cant raise your right elbow.

The TV was horrible. The syncing between the audio and video was off, so any TV watching was akin to an old style dubbed karate movie. The touch pad also required a fair amount of pressure to function. For a place that touts it's high-techness, this is an uber fail.

The worst part is their TSA like card checker at the base of the guest elevators. Regardless of the time of day or how full your hands are with hot coffee from the cafe (or maybe because of it), you may be chosen at random to drop it all and show your room key to the over eager prison guard wanna be. If I wanted to go through a security checkpoint every time I came back, I'd be sleeping at the airport. Of course advising the person that you will no longer be staying there because of this, only earns you a healthy look of contempt.

There was nothing there worth visiting. The architecture of the casino only increases the noise levels. Other than the Lemongrass restaurant (which is hidden and unadvertised on the directional signs) and the Radiance jewelry store - very interesting watches and the staff are happy to talk regardless of your apparent income bracket - are both interesting if you happen to be there.

First and last time we'll stay there. The stay was so disturbing and uncomfortable came very close to packing my things up and move over to the Signature.",5,0,0

My husband had to present at a conference and wanted me to come with him. The resort is very beautiful and we had a very lovely view from our suite on the 33rd floor. 

The resort got my name incorrect on the account despite my husband put it on the reservation. My name is Kimberly and they listed me as Kira(?) not even close. This did cause a problem when I tried to charge my breakfast to the room the day my husband had to go to conference early. Luckily I had my Military ID that listed him as my husband because I had not brought a purse with me (no charge cards).

The room has all of these high tech toys, that just never worked right. I wouldn't want them in my room but they came with the suite. If you give me a toy and it doesn't work you just lost points. 

Our TV located in bathroom did not work for the three days we were there despite turning it in every morning as ""not working at all"" to the front desk! Do I need a TV in bathroom? Not really but you have it in there so it should work, am I right?

The volume on the living room TV did not work when we got there and they sent a nice maintenance guy up to look at it. The cable had broken off in some black box thingy that provided the sound. He said it happens all the time but he could put the sound back to the TV and they could replace the cable the following day. If a problem can be described as ""it happens all the time"" then you have a system failure and the problem should be addressed as such. Different cable, different sound box, educate the cleaning staff, or whatever makes the ""all the time"" stop! The cable might have been replaced but the sound continued to come out of the TV and was at a good level of sound - this was great because after that the sound could not be adjusted with the TV remote anymore. Now this is becoming a bang head here moment. 

The light switches at our bedside tables were reversed. I control my reading lamp and my husband' s table lamp. I turned this in as a problem the first day but it was never fixed and I had other things to do than sort out their mechanical mess ups. 

It is essential when travel to have a coffee pot in our room. We wake usually very early as we live on the east coast and wit the time difference- we can be up at 6am no problem. They call my husband back and said they have no coffee pots??? really? A resort your size and the price we are paying per night for our room and no coffee pots! Someone should go shopping for a few Keurig coffee pots and have them for guests who ask for them!! That would be a very small investment which would quickly provide a great ROI both in good will and giving the customer (remember us) what we want -coffee if we wake up at 6am. My husband woke at 6:30 our first morning and went to the Skyview suites' lounge and was told he could go out to Starbucks or another coffee place. My husband had his robe and slippers on??!! Who trains these people?! Did he look like he was dressed forgoing out in the main area of the hotel. It was bad enough you were making him come down 33 floors for a cup of coffee.

The casino area was pro-ported to be a special area that even if someone was smoking the indoor air quality would be just fine. I am allergic to cigarette smoke - it was most unpleasant and cigars are always the worse. They should confine all cigars to a cigar smoking area, don't let them just walk around with them. 

Housekeeping did a wonderful job - everything was spotless. The turn down service was excellent. The furnishing were nice. The bed was very fluffy and the pillows were comfortable. The view was breath taking. The water and apples were nice in the Skyview Suite lounge. I don't drink soda and they had no limes for the Sparkling water. 

Maybe I am just getting spoiled in my old age but I have stay in as nice or nicer suites for a lot less money. I want coffee when I want it! And in my room, not 33 floors below me. I do not like cigarette or cigar smoke period.

They escort you to your room -this is a frequent comment that people are impressed by. They need to get out more often, most places we stay do this. I am turned off by people who have to try to impress you. 

I wouldn't stay here again and I won't be back to Vegas. For the Aria our room number was 33022 so maybe you can get the problems with the TV and bedroom lights fixed before you put anyone else in there.",3,1,1

We got to the lounge right at 6 PM. when the fights started and there was only one other couple sitting at the bar. I thought our bartender would be nice and chat it up with us, as this is what I've experienced every other time in Vegas. She only engaged when asking if we needed another beer. The rest of the time she and the servers were gossiping the entire time, another bartender was crying, and the management (a bunch of bald guys in suits) did nothing. They were worse! Drinking and taking shots while working. So unprofessional and impersonal. Later in the evening I saw two servers high-fiving each other when she said her table's bill was over $1000.

There were complimentary chocolates on the night stand though, they were really yummy.

I returned and told the North Valet and told them John said to park it in front, which they did.  When I came back again the next day, I didn't ask for the same treatment.

Then, later in my stay, as I was walking from the shower to my room, I sliced the bottom of my foot open on a carpet staple\/nail that was loose.  Hurts like hell.   Since I had already officially ""checked out"" online early that morning, they wouldn't do anything about that.   For all of this, in a 48 hour stay, after talking with the management for a day and a half, they finally offered me a $100 credit on anything inside the hotel.  $100 does not buy 1 show ticket, or 1 spa treatment.  I still had to spend more money there.   I could not use $100 on food, since I was at a work conference. Some BS if you ask me.  I will not return to the Aria, would not recommend it, and will not stay there next year, if the conference is there again.",1,0,0

I returned a few days ago from a 12-day Vegas trip, the last half of which was spent experienced the first week of ""Aria"". 

While I found the property visually stimulating, the rooms well designed and comfortable, and the casino fun at times, the inconsistency of service was a real dealbreaker.  

It wasn't so much the understandable technical foibles of a newly unveiled hotel, but more the lack of basic attention to detail on the part of the staff.

Some of the annyoing blunders:

#1  Early check-in quoted upon reservation was not honored.
#2  Entire plumbing of sink had to be replaced in room, it was draining directly onto the floor.
#3  While in my room another guest assigned the same room walked in on me.
#4  While in my room a housekeeping supervisor walked in on me.
#5  While in my room a minibar attendant walked in on me.
#6  While all but one of these people were in my room, the room ""rebooted"" causing all lights to go off and shades to close, leaving it completely dark.  I was not groped.  I won't say if I groped anyone.
#7  I was locked out of my room for 90 minutes due to a lock malfunction, even security could not get in.
#8  I was locked out of my room again for 60 minutes for the same reason.
#9  When I decided to upgrade to the sky suites I was assigned a room that did not exist causing me to shlep my bags up and down the hallway to the point of sweat running down my neck.  This one is classic.  Not sure why certain room number didn't exist but they don't.  How could they assing one?  Another mystery?
#10  upon seeking ice I found my floors ice machine did not work
#11  upon checking other floors I found their ice machines did not work.
#12  upon ordering ice from room service I was delivered 2 empty buckets.
#13  upon ordering room service food I was delivered an incorrect order with missing items\/accompaniments with two additional empty buckets.
#14  I somehow ended up with two more empty ice bucket in the middle of the night for a total of 7 ice buckets.
#15  The room service guy could not turn on my ice machine in my bar fridge.
#16  In the morning when I called for room service tray pickup and ice again I waited over 2 hrs 15min and the dude showed up empty handed.  Not even a tray or cart to remove the dishes.....HUH?
#17  I asked the housekeeping supervisor not to clean my room at all the given day because I had numerous personal glassware items out for a scotch tasting party which I didn't want getting ""bussed"".
#18  despite my request a housekeeper was in my room upon my return for the party.
#19  I woke up freezing in the middle of the night as the housekeeper doing turndown had taken and not replaced my comforter.  I stumbled in late and passed out and assumed I'd kicked the blanket to the floor, when I finally had the energy\/awareness to look for it I realized I was sleeping with a thin sheet, no comforter in the whole room!
#20  When I called for a comfortor no one came until the random housekeeper coming to clean my room.  I asked her for a comforter and a guy brought me a scragly rag that didn't match the set and was NO WHERE NEAR as nice as the comforter I had originally.
#21  While playing $75\/hand blackjack I was told i would not be comped cigarettes, but not only did I need to pay for them, I needed to pay in 8 single $1 bills due to the cocktail waitress needing to buy them from a machine.
#22  At the buffet I got one drink right when I sat down and sat 20 min with an empty diet coke.
#23  At the Cafe my waiter went on break and I waited forever for my check, the food also sucked.
#24  Another time I ordered room service the food was very cold.  I'm not picky, lukewarm is fine.  It was cold.
#25  When I checked in it took forever, the lady had never ""done"" something involved with my checkin.
#26  When I toured the spa they told me only daily passes were available, yet I later found out 3-day passes were available.  Every time I checked in, just using gym and wet areas, it took forever.
#27  When I hit a hand-pay jackpot on a machine it took forever to get paid, and then I didn't even get cash, I got a TITO I had to take to the cage.  I ended up getting to meet about 6 supervisors while they figured it out though.


Ok so I ended up just saying eff it and checking out a day early for the so called 5-Star Sky Suites Luxury section of the Aria Hotel.  I have a more detailed version of the escapades on a live trip report as they happened, with pics and video:

The ""resort fee"" is a JOKE!  When you check in and they hand you the 2 free drink tickets, just turn them down,  those disguised as a $20\/day fee you accept by accepting those coupons...which we didn't even use.  The pool was closed, so really the resort fee was just a massive way of stealing an extra $20\/day.  The worst part  of that was we booked over $600 in Spa treatments the second day we were there, therefore the resort fee should have been waived for that day per their ""spa description"".  Apparently that isn't the case. It isn't about the money so to speak, it is about little ""surprise charges"" that they nickel and dime you with.

Second, we were on the hotel's VIP list  for the night club there Pure.  We were told we would bypass the line, and have wonderful treatment.  After we waited for some snooty guy to finally allow us to bypass the line (after a good 20 minutes), we realized the club was not the ""happening"" place the hotel described it as.  I would recommend heading next door to The Cosmopolitan's Marquee or Heading over to Encore's XS. Aria night life is just not up to par.

On to happier memories... the Spa is divine!  My husband and I enjoy couples massages several times a year, and this was by far, the BEST spa experience I have ever had.  Other than it being extremely overpriced, the service was impeccable. The co-ed heated pool outside was an added bonus since we rarely get to enjoy amenities together other than the actual massage.  The women's facilities could not have been improved upon.  The eucalyptus steam room was by far the most relaxing 10 minutes I have had to myself in months.  All in all, I would return JUST for the spa. 5 stars all the way!

I would definitely stay at the Aria again, but would be a little more cautious about accepting free drink coupons.  I'd also like to return when the pool is actually open.  The adult pool looked very promising!",4,0,0

Let's start off by saying that I gamble a lot there and because of that, have high expectations. My most recent trip last weekend was by far the worst experience I've had at Aria and in Vegas in general.

I usually go to Vegas with friends, but this time I took my whole family for my sisters birthday and since I usually get free rooms and comps, decides to plan the entire trip. 

When I first pulled into the hotel, I was greeted by the rudest valet I've ever encountered, and then he proceeded to walk to the car behind me with my parents in it and was even ruder to them. I've never seen my dad so angry as he's normally a very calm guy. Then I walk into the hotel where it takes at least 30 minutes to get checked in because they had a brand new employee checking us in the priority m life line (this should be much quicker than normal). 

I brushed both of those situations off as that wasn't that big of a deal. I get into my room with my girlfriend and not only did it reeks of smoke, but the room was dirty and not turned down! How does that even happen? Then I go into the bathroom and there is Marijuana sitting on the counter. Most of you may say ""lucky you"" but I am sorry that I don't smoke!! I think it's completely disgusting that the hotel could allow new guests to go into a room without making sure the room was clean and the drugs were removed first. Is that too much to ask? 

The best part, I call and request to speak to a manager. I got ""Leonard"" who was the assistant from desk manager. Not only was Leonard rude, unhelpful, and condescending but all he did was moved me to another room! He didn't comp the room, or even offer me a discount. He also said he would get us out of the room quickly and we waited for ONE HOUR to go to the next room. After driving for 5 hours, we spent the first 2 hours of our trip waiting around in a disgusting room, not able to order room service or do anything as we had to wait for them to move us. No apology, no discount, I am shocked. I have literally received an upgrade to a bungalow suite at other resorts for FAR LESS then drugs being in my room upon check in! How is that even possible? 

Then, we move into our new room and finally get settled in. We go downstairs to eat and when we come back up, the keys don't work! I had to go back down to the lobby, wait in line for 20 minutes, and then get new keys. The manager has the audacity to tell me it was my fault for putting the room key near my phone or in my wallet. Wow! Who would ever keep a room key in their wallet or pocket? I must be an idiot right? 

Then, if things couldn't get worse, I booked a limo for my family and had them take us to dinner and remember, this is still my sisters actual birthday. The limo was an Aria limo, and you would think for all the inconveniences it would be free, but NO! $100 for a 4 minute drive to drop us off two hotels next door. Before I tell you what happens next, remember it's 110 degrees outside. We get into the limo and it literally feels like we are in a sauna. It was so hot that we rolled the windows down to cool off. I asked the driver to turn the air conditioning on and he said it's broken! By the time we got out of the limo, we were all sweating bullets and miserable. We were all dressed up for a fancy dinner and stuck in that sweat box for 15 minuets. I then called the concierge at aria to complain and they said they would look into it and call me back. NOBODY EVER CALLED ME AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME THE MONEY BACK! I would have rather walked to the dinner. 

Now you may think the trip was a disaster, and it was. But, to make matters worse, the dealers are always rude, but I always overlook this because I am there to gamble and don't need to talk to the dealers but it's unfortunate they can't be nicer when there job is to interact with people and make them feel better as they lose their money. 

Finally, my awesome VIP host Chris Deright. The guy who tells me playing $750 per hand on average for 4-6 hours wasn't enough for more then comping dinner and a few small chargers. Any other hotel would have comped my rooms, show tickets, and much more but he said because the last time I went I didn't play enough that I didn't deserve a dollar more in comps, even though I've been loyal to Aria, always played there, lost a TON of money over the last few years, it still wasn't enough to give me more after the horrible service and treatment the entire trip. 

I know for sure my family will never stay at Aria again, and I know I won't. Thanks Aria for the worst trip of my life",5,1,0

In building this they managed to suck out all the feel of Las Vegas. If I want a big city feel I'll just go to the casinos in my home town. It's very bland with a lot of open wasted space shopping mall with high dollar shops all empty no people in them buying anything. MGM has put their future hopes on this property but it's a flop in my opinion. I go to Vegas to get away from what they tried to achieve I can't see me going there again any time soon.

Everything in the room is automatic and controlled by a master touch pad. Kind of obnoxious because there are delays or misalignment with the pad sometimes where you think you're pressing one thing but something else goes, or the volume or channels get stuck and won't change. It was pretty annoying. 

Ok here's the real reason I came to review the hotel though: for a big, fancy, expensive resort, you'd think the front desk would answer your phone calls. I called 3 times and in total I spent 22 minutes waiting on hold before hanging up. No one ever answered any of my attempts. My brother in law said he had the exact same experience. None of us ever made a successful call to the front desk the whole stay. Pretty pathetic, if you ask me. Oh and it was at all different times of day. Not just during checkout hours or something where it would be more understandable. 

Room service was really fast and the menu is reasonable. Pizza was good and really big. 

The beds are comfortable.

Oh! And this part was really stupid I think. The mini fridge is FULL of mini bar stuff. There is absolutely no space left for anything you may need to put in the fridge. My sister in law had to remove an expensive bottle of wine to make space for her baby's formula. Kind of lame. Oh and forget about bringing home leftovers or doing any reheating- no microwave in the room and again, no room for anything else in the fridge. Oh and the whole thing has scales under the minibar stuff so it charges if you remove something for more than 30 seconds. So you can't even take things out to make space and put them back later. 

Overall, this hotel has a lot of nice features in theory but not in practice. And for God's sake, get more front desk staff!!",2,0,0

Kimberly H's review is definitely what my experience was. My family and I don't go to Vegas to gamble, so the ambiance, the proportions, the lofty airy feelings, the architecture are definitely in a class way beyond any other major Vegas resort out there so far. In particular - it looks extremely lavish - but not gaudy (like every other ""luxury"" resort here - Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian, etc).

Check-in was a bit hectic since no apparent lines were delineated. However Helen was very nice and asked us if our room numbers were okay (they were not, and she politely changed our room numbers), and when I saw that my discount on the room rate had not been applied - she pulled a manager, Tiffany, who was immediately able to hear out our request and change the room rate per what I only had a verbal confirmation of back in October.

A few small kinks needed to be worked out - but never having to wait behind a crowd for your elevator and not getting overwhelmed with running across the hotel to this tower or that tower to get to your hotel room was wonderful.  Parking was easy and simple - and it was nice not needing to stare at a huge parking structure for once as entrances were underground and were front and center to the entrance (my only qualm is that there isn't any sort of access to self-park from the Harmon side - you have to enter from the strip to self-park... or do the valet).

The room - is so technologically advanced, and was awesome to stay in. Even our ""bad view"" was of Vdara and Harmon Ave and the Palms and the mountain-side of Vegas, not some interior of a building and a bunch of ventilations machinery. I should have brought my HDMI cables and hooked up my peripherals to the flatscreen on the wall. Everything went extremely smoothly in terms of our stay.

Overall - regardless of the cheap cheap rate for the few nights we stayed, this was a wonderful experience and one of the best I have had in Vegas (disclaimer being that we usually just stay in standard guest rooms).",4,0,2

Aria so far is up there as far as worst for customer service. Rooms clean and the curtains open electronically but besides that, worst service ever.
Got here, gym was closed, I asked them to find me one that was open and they more or less told me to find it myself.
Went to the gym Friday, the greeter there was a jerk and just stared at you rather than greating you. It felt like the employees were beaten or scolded by bad bosses.
Then came back to our room to smell like cigarettes, not a good experience",4,6,1

This go round, we stayed at Aria for three nights and I must say that it is as excellent as I remembered.  Where do I begin?

The rooms are...  Oh my gosh - if you do not get a good night of rest in this bed - you are truly missing out on something OR perhaps you're out all night partying\/gambling.  The beds are the best part of my stay. They are cozy and the rooms are well ventilated and spacious.  The automated curtains and lighting are also super fun and the block out shades help with sleeping.   I also love the bathroom layout.. the shower and tub.. genius! I always bring extra cleaner - scrub the tub down - and then relax for a nice bubble bath. 

Second thing you must do while staying at Aria -- order room service! You may think that Vegas is all about the nightlife... but trust me, order the Belgian waffle and a side order of the chicken tenders for a lovely take on the chicken + waffle craze. Enjoy it while in your pajamas and it beats anything happening on The Strip. ;)

The customer service is always top-notch - the staff is always friendly, knowledgeable and courteous.  I look forward to our next visit.

Pros:

1) good choice of food and restaurants. Lemongrass stole the show. 
2) the rooms are nice and automation does add to the charm.
3) the overall customer service experience was good. The staff was well read and was easy to talk to. Check in staff was very friendly and welcoming. Danielo, tsigie, Linda, Gina, Greg and many more names I can't recall at this point were fantastic dealers. 
4) Aria express. Very clutch. 
5) love their casino. Playing here was more fun than anywhere else. 

Cons:

1) fifty 50 pizza bar. 6 of us are here last night and 2 of us including me have already thrown up multiple times. We ordered a meat pizza, a veg pizza and some wings that would rather be fed to the sink. 

2) some of their dealers really need to learn how to behave with customers. One guy called Daniel at the blackjack switch tables got upset with me when I bet after watching a few hands and he did not deal me in, and I respectfully let him know I wanted to play as well. Luckily his boss frank was a good guy but daniel's attitude only got worse there on.

My family and I had numerous issues with our room and went downstairs to talk to a manager. I specifically asked for a front desk manager when I arrived at the registration desk. The young lady named Kim went and exchanged a few words with a manager that I later found out was named Mark Salomon. The manager refused to talk to us. 4 separate times I requested to speak with him, and all 4 times he stated he was either ""busy"" or ""would look into it and get back to me"". I would think a resort that prides itself as having first class customer service would go out of their way to speak to a concerned guest, but that was not the case.  He made it seem as if he was too important to talk to me, and that me and my family were a waste of his time. I even had another manager come to me and ask what was wrong. He stated that Mr. Salomon should not have done that, and was completely in the wrong.  I cannot believe the egos that come with being a manager at the Aria.

We came right after we got engaged and we appreciated the chocolates in our room. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious, the décor is modern (skews a little Asian, which I like), I love the automated curtains. The bathroom doesn't give much privacy (frosted glass you can see through for the toilet), so maybe not ideal for a mixed group, but fine for a couple.

Location is good, with easy tram access to the Bellagio. We always valet and have never had a problem with that - though I guess the hotels are starting to charge for that when it used to be free? That really sucks, especially since the rooms can get pricey on the weekends, but my understanding is that Aria is not unique in that change. We like the mobile check-in and check-out to avoid the wait. The only hassle we've ever had at check-in after coming multiple times is that one time they forgot to release a hold on my bf's credit card so that it got declined the next day.

We've only eaten at a couple of the restaurants, but we really like Javier's and Julian Serrano. Also appreciate having a Pressed Juicery on property. I think Aria is smaller than many other casinos, and even though there are fewer shops, I really appreciate that it doesn't get crazy and crowded and you can't get lost.

Venetian is nice if you're rooming with a ton of people but I think Aria and Vdara are super swanky for a couple or just one or two friends. 

My favorite part....as I'm sure everyone's most favorite part are the electric opening curtains!! Seems like such a small detail but makes a hugeeee impact on my experience! As soon as you walk into the room, you are greated with turned on lights and an automated opening curtain! If you have a nice view of the strip its even more amazing!

I would say as a casino, its pretty small comparative to the others but it's so close to cosmo, and a short walk over the bridge to the planet hollywood. If you love to shop it's literally right downstairs to the Crystal mall.

Thanks to my high-rolling mother, I snagged a Tower Suite on the 9th floor (pictures to follow shortly, as I took them with my real camera instead of my phone to do the room and view justice).

CHECK-IN:  maybe it's the ""new"" thing, but the lobby features a mobile check-in station that didn't ever appear to have anyone using it.  It seems as most people chose to do it the old-fashioned way and wait in the mile-long line at the front desk.  For the high-rollers and higher-tiered MLife members, there is a special, secluded Tower Suites lounge that provides you with a convenient, no-line check-in process.  There are numerous comfortable chairs and couches, tables, and a refreshment bar with soda, water, juice, coffee, and pastries.  For those of us travelers who literally step off the airplane and go straight to the hotel, there is an actual powder room (no toilet) that has a sink, various toiletries (mouth wash, lotion, face towels) available to freshen up.

LAYOUT:  as with most casinos for me, it takes me a minute or two to gain my bearings of the casino.  The signs in the Aria are actually pretty helpful.  I was able to find the elevators in a timely manner and, thankfully as an added security measure, there is an employee in front of the elevators checking to make sure people who pass have a room key.

ROOM:  my review won't due it justice.  Mind you, I only experienced a suite.  The suite featured 1.5 baths, the full bath including a spacious shower with sitting area, private toilet with warmed seat and bedet, two sinks, a vanity mirror, large closet, Jacuzzi, telephone, and television.  They stock your bathroom with the necessary toiletries and then-some:  shampoo\/conditioner, oatmeal soap, dental kits, Gilette shaving gel, razor, lotion, bathrobes, and slippers.  There is an ""office"" area with desk, chair, and various ports for your electronics. But the absolute BEST part of the room?? The two tablets they provide you with that control everything, and I do mean everything,  you could think of from the lighting to the drapes, the TVs, music, temperature, room service, and whether or not you need maid service.

RESTAURANTS: I'm going to use separate reviews for the eating establishments.


Overall, a very nice hotel and casino. The customer service could use a little overhaul in comparison to other casinos, but I would definitely recommend this one:-)

Check In: The check in line was long but they kept it moving very quickly. The woman was really nice and pointed out what we needed to know.

Room: Ah-mah-sing. I can't rave enough about the bed. Seriously. Try it. Lay down and I dare you to try to get up and do your activities. It's that addicting. And the pillows are to die for! I believe Aria has an order form if you want to buy the mattress\/pillows. I still dream of the bed. 

Aria is very high tech, they have a dash board that controls everything from the TV to the blinds. While that's nice, I'm used to turning on a switch, thank you very much. It comes to borderline creepy when they have your name lightened up across the dashboard but I digress. 

The bathrooms are killer: We had a shower\/tub combo and another area for the toilet. Not sure why there was a phone in there, but hey, sometimes you gotta order something when you're on the can. Water pressure is just the right amount, my friend tried the tub which was great as well. Tons of towels to use, shampoo, conditioner, etc. Loved the bathrobes!!

Housekeeping: Usually I don't review housekeeping unless they do something so outrageously stupid, which they didn't. They came at the right time, did their thing and left. I did notice that when I left my items haphazardly on the floor, they were lined up and neatly stacked when I got back. Don't know if I liked that or creeped out. 

Casino Floor: You lose $$ on any casino on the strip. The floor is spacious enough so you don't feel you're suffocating. Waitresses are sparse and you have to tackle them to get a drink. Games are pretty much the same.

Decor: When you first walk into Aria, you're taken away by the design. I feel in love with the butterflies in the check in\/out area.  

Dining: We didn't use much of the dining except for the cafe which was delicious! All kinds of pastries, coffees that you can imagine.

We got upset asked for manager person helping us disappeared saying she was going to talk to her boss and didnt come back to the counter until it was 4:30. Horrible all of them are young and in my opinion have no customer service skills. They even argued with us and tried to say that they weren't at fault!

From the valet to housekeeping to the front desk...everyone was polite, professional and couldn't have been more helpful. The Aria does an amazing job of training the staff and running this operation.

The decor and atmosphere are modern but warm and inviting. I liked having to show my room key to enter the elevators. This is the kind of security everyone needs.

Pre-check-in was a breeze. I checked in on-line hours before arriving and got a return email with my room number. After leaving my car with the valet, I went straight to the pre-check-in counter and within minutes, had my key and was on my way. No waiting in line to check-in.

The Aria has I think 27 restaurants. Some of them the best in Las Vegas so no need to look elsewhere for good food.

The room was nice. Could have been a little cleaner. Mainly just a dirty carpet and a pube in the tub. Nothing a vacuum and a rinse couldn't take care of.
Technology was cool. Push buttons to operate everything. A remote iPad device for controlling everything from the lights to the T.V. if you don't feel like getting out of bed. Push a button and the curtains open and close, lights go on and off. Pretty cool.
One problem...the buttons on my side of the bed operated the night stand light and reading light on my wife's side of the bed and hers operated mine. Just gotta switch the plugs or something. Another problem was the safe wasn't working. A maintenance man came and fixed it but it slowed us up a bit.

Now about the safe. We were here on business and needed a large safe. The Aria has laptop size room safes. That is if you can find it. I looked everywhere in that room and could not find the safe. I called the front desk and they told me where it was at. Most hotels that have safes have a small iPad size in the closet. At the Aria the safe is located.....oh, I don't want to spoil the fun. You'll have to find it. Don't give up...it is there.",0,0,0

Hotel: This review is based on a regular room with two beds (not the Sky Suites this time). There wasn't really anything particularly remarkable about the room itself. I found the bathroom to be more notable.

Tub: The bathtub is in the same ""area"" as the shower within a glass enclosure, but remains separate from the shower. It's not a combo bathtub\/shower by any means.

Shower: My second biggest complaint about this room is the weak water pressure coming from the shower head (my companions noted it as well).

Bathroom door: My biggest complaint is regarding the sliding bathroom door which has a gap between the wall (even when fully locked) that allows all sounds to be heard. How embarrassing!

Toilet: Yes it's enclosed in frosted glass, but that's what the door is for. :\/

I had a mishap during my travels to Las Vegas that caused me to stay in a cheaper hotel that was the sister property of Aria. I was able to check in under 30 minutes and the staff was very pleasant. I met the kind of worker her name is Ariel. We talked about everything from food to travel to the hotel experience etc and it was just pleasant to speak to somebody that was down to earth and not snobbish. I must say that the buffet was ok but not great the food was very very heavy depending on what you put on your plate you either got a really flavorful entree or item or you got something very bland. For the price I was expecting something more out of the buffet. It didn't help that in the Asian cuisine I saw one of the chefs take a spoon and did a taste test of the food he just sat out. He didn't dip it again but it was the fact that I saw him taking it right before he said the entree out on the buffet.  I wasn't too fond of walking through the casino after I had a shower only to come out and slightly smell like smoke. It was annoying to go through the promenade and the hotel rooms having to show your key card when some of the staff pick and choose who they ask. I felt very insulted and annoyed. The hotel played some awesome music throughout the hallways elevators in lobby. Enjoyed the ambience of the hotel. When I walk inside the room there was music playing and the curtains opened up to a city view of Vegas automatically I felt relaxed and enjoyed the breathtaking view. The bathroom was very nice with a deep tub. The downside, I wasn't able to take a nice relaxing bath because of lime erosion  that was at the bottom of the tub from a leaky faucet. I notified the staff and they offered to switch rooms which I decline only because I can take a shower and I'm just as content with doing that and I honestly was too tired to even one up and moving to another location but was offered a credit on the account. The minibar was stocked.. with highly over priced items. I would highly suggest going to the store and picking up some items in renting a fridge for $25 a day. The beverages and the snacks that were inside the mini bar were warm not cold.  I noticed that feeds backboard of the desk had a tear as if somebody accidentally kicked it. My room was clean the bed was comfortable for the most part however the mattress was a bit too soft for my liking. The liquid pool is a joke. We were offered complimentary admission to this pool only to find out that the only way you can sit at a table or at the poolside cabanas is if you either pay for VIP or you have to order a certain dollar amount in food and or drinks. it would have been really nice if the staff had mentioned it before I went in they weren't smiling and they weren't very pleasant.   overall my experience wasn't bad at all I would definitely stay here again.

Comparing this hotel to other properties and Cosmo, here are my observations:

ARIA: Disappointed by the pool\/lounge furniture.  Plastic.  Water quality was pretty disguesting.  I had just stayed at Caesar's Palace a few days prior and hands-down, Caesar's has a nicer pool area (ambience, and comfortability in their outdoor furniture).  At ARIA, loved the single touch panels that controled the lights, blinds, TV, etc.  The amenities were modern and new.  I was pleased that although it's within the City Center complex, it was relatively quiet and you're out of the hustle and bustle that you'd find at Cosmo.  Obviously, it's not convenient to other ""attractions"" on the strip, but if you plan on staying at the property for some R&R this would be it!",0,0,2

-Rooms are big. Yes this is a NYC-dweller talking but they are spacious. I love the floor to ceiling windows with panoramic views.

Everything in the room is automated with a tablet or push of a button. Even for a tech-savvy person like myself, it wasn't the easiest but I got the hang of it after a day.

-The cleaning staff is fantastic. Nothing is over-looked. If you don't want your toiletries re-arranged, zip them up. but everything is cleaned, dusted, and you are left with chocolates!

-The pool party club Liquid is sort of small but a happening scene if that's what you want. If you don't, have no fear. Multiple pools, towels and many chairs. And the music doesn't pour into the non-party pools so you can relax.

-Gym is open from 5:30 am - 8 pm.Towels, bottles of waters, apples are complimentary. Lots of machines. Great gym.

-I can't speak much to gambling and food but the casino looked big, not smoke-filled (they use a vanilla-like scent to really battle this) and there are multiple food options along the $-scale.


TIP: If you want to buy snacks or alcohol for your room - CVS and Walgreens are in front of Aria on the Strip. Just a short walk to save some $.


My only downside is a sporadic level of service. Well and outrageous lines at check in and the concierge. Sometimes you were treated as a valued guest like you would expect, others you were treated like this was a low-level hotel where you were bothering them or even outright rude. I'd stay there again - but the minute someone treats me like that, I'm going directly to management.",2,0,0

You can't see the person using the toilet, perhaps their shadow at most.

There were usb ports and electrical outlets by the desk. The hi-speed internet was also relatively fast. There was also a touchscreen that controlled various electronics in the room, but I am unsure of its specific functions since I left it untouched.

Architecturally stunning when viewed from the street and when you enter the lobby. The first thing to greet you is the Japanese vanilla they disperse to ward off the smoke coming from the casino. 

I noticed the casino was hoppin on our way to the elevator. The happy hoots from the craps table, bells & buzzers from the many slot machines. The lobby bar was busy with plenty of plush seating. But what was missing? Oh yeah, the nasty smell of cigarettes! It seems the casino's incense thingy works. 

The rooms are absolutely beautiful. Modern, chic in the favorite chocolate tone most places seem to love. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in and the pillows were a down mix, heavy on the down. The bathroom was a bit small but I loved the shower w\/the bathtub. Very similar to a Japanese ""ofuro"", a small room with a separate area for the shower with a large soaking tub. All lighting and curtains are either touchpad or t.v. controlled. It's fun to program the curtains to open, lights and t.v. to turn on as a wake up call. It's also fun to turn off the lights in the bathroom when someone else is using it. Or just lay in the bed and power everything off & on just because you can. 

We had breakfast at Cafe Vettro, which is located off of the lobby. I highly recommend the house-smoked salmon & bagel. The salmon was perfectly smoked, thinly sliced and beautifully arranged. And amazingly delicious w\/a buttery texture. I will advise ordering extra cream cheese as they only put a small dollop on the plate. The coffee at the Roasted Bean is a must, forgo the stuff you make yourself in the room. Throw on a pair of sweats, t-shirt and flip flops and make your way downstairs. Bring it back to the room and enjoy while you get ready to start your day.

As soon as we exited our shuttle, the bell person offered to hold our bags if we couldn't check in immediately.

But we stood in line and we were able to check in early (Score!!). In regards to the incidental deposit we were able to void charging privileges and have our deposit at $200 for the stay instead of the $130\/day deposit. Check in took between 5-10 minutes and we were on our way. 

There is someone checking for room keys before you can get to the elevators. And every 7 floor, I believe, had a separate bank of elevators (6 elevators), so wait time was very minimal. The hallways are pretty long and we were towards the end of hallway but nothing unmanageable.

Satisfaction with this hotel seems to be directly related to the room rate. Had I paid $79 a night, I would honestly feel differently about the quality of my stay. What a disappointment our stay turned out to be! 
First the good stuff. As everyone mentions the rooms are stylish, high tech and we had an amazing view. The view was great -- if not exactly as depicted online. All the high tech stuff worked, which I was grateful for after reading other reviews, but by then I was too tired to mess with all the gadgets. We were able to hook up the iPod and listen to music. I liked that we could hook up our iPods to the sound system and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. The bathroom was nice. I imagine the SkySuites are fabulous. 
I wish I had better things to say about our stay. When we arrived around 10 pm on a Friday night there were long lines to check in. It goes very slowly. Some people were already drinking in line. I imagine at 9 am or whatever strange hour other people check in, that doesn't happen. Or on a Wednesday if there's not a convention in town or the hotel's occupancy is at 20 percent. If you arrive when there are no lines, it will go faster. 
They must get lots of complaints, so I wouldn't like the desk clerk's job either. It shows in their attitudes. The guest ahead of me had an issue that took 45 minutes to resolve. They could have taken him aside to deal with his complaint? I (and the guests behind me) would have appreciated it. There was no organization; some lines moved faster and unfortunately I was in one that did not. An officious looking woman in uniform finally came over and shyly told us to not congregate but to make sure we were in line. Thanks. Now the issue required several trips to a non-smiling manager, lots of shaking his head. Again, I would've appreciated it if the manager would have come over, dealt with the guy and made the line move faster! Very quickly I was becoming unimpressed with the Aria. 

Apparently, rooms with two queen beds are limited in number. If one King bed presents a problem stay elsewhere. If one King was what you reserved, you'll be content. When I finally made it to the desk clerk, I got a half hearted greeting, and when I asked what that was all about (as in you are aware I've been waiting now 45 minutes for him to finish) she quickly replied ""sorry he wanted to change his room."" I understood why. I had made my reservation months prior online and she tells me that they are booked and can't give me the Deluxe room I reserved and paid for but one on a much lower ""smoking optional"" floor. What does smoking optional really mean anyway? It means it's a smoking floor. Come on folks, that's insulting enough. Of course if you're a smoker, it's not an issue. Shame shame shame. 
She'd take $50 off the room rate. Not just no but come on you must be kidding no. I could have and would have stayed at the Palazzo, the Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood or any other hotel on the Strip for that price or less. It's pretty obvious what I'll do next time. So discussions with another ""manager."" Instead of two beds we can get a ""deluxe room"" with a King. I had wasted already an hour of what was a brief visit to Las Vegas. 
The staff did nothing to make up for all the inconvenience and changes. I asked for a late check out and was told no. Okay I can't really complain about that. But then housekeeping knocked on our door at 9 am. Yes it was my fault I did not set the ""privacy"" switch! I can't blame the hotel staff for not knocking because either the room was vacant or we didn't want to be disturbed. I don't know who wants housekeeping in Las Vegas at 9 am! It reminded me of a terrible Holiday Inn in Texas where the leather-faced manager tried to force us out of our room before check-out time! 



Check out was efficient since not a lot of people were checking out and I got a robot-like ""sorry"" when I said our stay was disappointing. When I heard that they get a lot of complaints and unhappy guests it was easy to see why.",3,1,0

My husband and I viewed some of the other hotels while touring the strip, and the Aria was by far the cleanest and nicest smelling (it doesn't have years of cigarette smoke build-up yet).  

We were upgraded to a room on the 51st floor with a view of the mountains -- a very pretty view, even if it wasn't the strip.  We were able to see some gorgeous sunsets.  We could hardly get out of the bed.  It was incredible.  We want to save up and buy one!

The technology was a bit sluggish, which was odd, given the newness of this hotel (but that actually might speak to the speed of technology development).  I wanted the bedside tablet to be iPad equivalent, and it wasn't in the slightest.  The best part of the technology was the curtains opening for you as you entered the room.  The rest of it I could have done without.  It's rather simple to turn on a light switch or close a curtain.

The mini-bar was frightening.  I'd rather it be more in the corner of the room.  We kept getting paranoid that we'd accidentally tip over one of the Fiji waters and be charged $20 for it.

Since it was my birthday, the Aria gave me little amazing chocolates on the house, which I thought was a nice touch.  (Coming to Vegas on your birthday brings a lot of nice free perks, actually.)

The bathroom was nice, but the shower pressure was too weak for our liking.  I also wish the garden tub had been a bit larger (I'm almost 6"", my husband over 6"", so it was cramped).

The housekeeping staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  They gave us lots of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion, which all smelled amazing.  I was also a huge fan of the make-up remover cloths.

We didn't gamble, so we can't speak to the looseness of the games, but we saw lots of people lose lots of money.

There was a live band in the Lift Bar that was very good.  I don't know if it's common for the hotel to have live bands, but this was a huge plus for us.

(Do not go to Haze, the night club.  That was a 1-star experience.)

The Aria has a nice, youthful vibe, but it also caters to older and middle-aged couples.  I didn't see very many kids (which we actually enjoyed).  It feels very fresh, very modern, and very down-to-earth at the same time (not richy-snobbish).  Well, except for some of the waiters in the Aria Cafe.  They were a bit richy-snobbish.",2,0,0

Gorgeous property - the calmer cousin of Wynn-Encore, located in City Center. Lobby is spacious, sun-lit with a wonderfully airy feel. While Cosmo is ultra-sleek, and Encore is opulent, Aria has a clean, modern feel. 

ROOM
Had a cityview king suite room on the 21st floor - not really a view as this was overlooking the main lobby drive. The room was smaller than anticipated, partially due to poor layout. The sitting area by the window felt like it was immediately up against the bedroom area, which was narrowly separated from  the desk area. The desk was located next to the overly large minibar, while the other side of the desk had dead space. 

Didn't really care for the overly dark tones of the room (super-dark chocolate). 
Minimal room decor - emphasis was the dark wood tones and simple modernity.

Bathroom had Decolav fixtures, Kohler sink, Toto lav and was modestly sized. Room is pretty hi-tech with a central console that controls room lighting, curtains, TV\/radio. Top pick for room technology remains Cosmopolitan, however, for sleekness and ease of use.

DINING
Several of the restaurants feature a prix-fixe menu (5-7pm), which is an interesting option. Prefer restaurants at Wynn-Encore vs. Aria however.

SERVICE
Front desk was very professional and pleasant. Helped book a roll-out bed and upgraded us to a higher floor. Business Center was very accommodating and professional.

POOL
Aria pools are calm and spacious - there are 3 pools besides LIQUID pool lounge. Found it quite pleasant.

LOCATION
Aria is connected to Crystals, which has a bridge to the Cosmo. City Center is convenient to navigate and you can easily just spend time within this area. Crossing to the other side of the Strip can be challenging however, as there is essentially only one sky bridge.",1,0,0

There were certain things I liked about the hotel and other things that slightly turned me off....

PROS:
-Location, location, location!!! Located in the middle of the strip
-Part of City Center, one of the newer 'sites' in Vegas with buildings, attractions, and amenities to admire
-As you walk into the lobby a sight whiff of vanilla greets you as well as a rather expansive lobby and waiting area 
-The casino is modern, dark, with purple plush scattered about
-room service is tasty
-well decorated, plush comfy beds
-the cabanas and the service you receive when you get a cabana is awesome: pool food was delicious; our drinks were strong; & our cabana boy was extremely attentive.  

CONS:
-the hotel room hallways are like a mouse maze due to the 'odd' shape of the building
-their standard room is relatively small compared to other hotels I've stayed at
-you control everything (lighting, curtains, etc) from a handheld device; sounds cool in theory, but in reality especially if you're stumbling back to the room at 3am a bit tipsy, trying to remember how to turn on the lights is a pain in the ass 
-an electrical port for the iphone is apparently installed in the rooms, but for whatever reason the standard iphone\/ipod cord didn't work in Aria's ""iphone port."" We called downstairs to ask about it and was told a provided cord that would fit into the port was available, for purchase &#$!!
-bathroom is nice but have an odd set up: facuets are one hot and one cold (our particular room had issues with the water temperature); no place to hang towels\/wet clothes except for the shower door; and the tub is in the shower

We chose the Aria because we decided that was the hotel that had the wedding venue we wanted. (Fireside Lounge is gorgeous) the room that my wife and I stayed on was beautiful and on the 51st floor. Clean room and an awesome view! My wife's parents on the other hand has to be moved 3 times before they got into a room. The next day were suppose to have a limo pick us up and go get our marriage license. After sitting outside for 15 minutes I went and spoke to someone at the concierge desk. He looked my name up and realized nothing was set up. We were told this was set up,weeks ago. Next the hotel gave us a name of a company to get the wedding dress dry cleaned. We dropped off the dress Tuesday afternoon and were told it would be delivered to our room Thursday by 5pm. Thursday night we called and they had no idea where the dress was. Not a good night when your future wife doesn't know where her dress is! Friday morning they called and said they have the dress and were going to keep it in the basement until Saturday. We thought that was fine since the dress is big and we really didn't want to hang it up in the room. We get to our room Friday night around 11 and her wedding dress is laying on the bed. The hanger they brought it up in must have snapped because it was on the ground. So we had a wedding dress with no hanger. Ended up we had to lay the dress on the floor. Saturday was great. I couldn't ask for the wedding day to be much better. My one complaint is that they rented out a room so the women could get ready. When asked if there was a room the guys could use we were told, "" the guys can can all just change in one of your rooms."" Not very convenient. Sunday we had breakfast in bed. Aria Cafe is delicious and a must if you stay at the Aria. When we left we made sure to hit the switch for service since we didn't want the food to sit out all day. When we came back at 9 pm that night our breakfast was still sitting there. The room smelled like old food. We did receive a $350 drink credit but we could only use it for our room. We obviously didn't charge the room that much because we didn't receive it until later on. We asked if we could use the credit for my wife's sisters room since they charged their room. Nope so we couldn't even use close to the full credit. The Aria is a very nice hotel. Just too many bad things happened in a 6 day stay. With rooms, the wedding, and everything else at the Aria it was around $15,000 spent. Just didn't feel treated that way. 2 stars because the wedding day was pretty perfect.",1,0,0

There was a touch of difficulty at check-in as I was given the key card envelope with no key into my room. I didn't realize this until all the way up by my room. I tried twice to call the front desk & was on hold each time over 10 mins to no avail. I trekked back down & security was wonderful to verify my identity, which I appreciated for security purposes, & then let me into my room. I will say the entire stay, security was on top of it & always kind. Kudos to that division. The room is wonderful with an iPad device that controls all aspects, from curtains, lighting, temp, tv & room service. The view was divine, with floor to ceiling windows out towards the city center. The room was mostly clean, with a few straggler hairs on the bathroom floor. Most might not even notice but I'm just insanely picky. The rain shower head was refreshing & bottles of product in bathroom were of high quality in case you actually want to use. Room service was so-so in that the food took quite some time to arrive, about 45 mins for a simple pizza. We ordered two bottles of water & only received one, but upon checkout saw that we were actually charged for both. This can seem like nothing, but be advised that every little thing is an expense at this location. Water is about $7 & you pay extra for the fitness room and pool. Speaking of the pool--tremendous! There were many chairs around the nice sized pool, with light music in the background. Nothing was blaring or uncomfortable. The wait staff around the pool was quick, but again, be warned that even for a simple frozen (small) drink, you'll pay around $40 after leaving a couple of dollars for tip. Javier's restaurant is highly advertised with clever marketing around city center & it is all it's cracked up to be! The wait on a week night was about an hour for two of us, but the atmosphere was dimly lit & relaxing. The food was good, and you'll pay for that. Overall the stay was beautiful. I dislike the casino on the bottom floor which seems chintzy in a high-end establishment, yet I realize it is Las Vegas after all. I have called out pricing to be realistic, but hope one might just avoid this resort all together if on a tight budget as I can promise you that you will spend much in excess of the basic room price.

One of these does not belong.  Can you guess?

If you guessed Trump, you're somewhat right since they don't have a casino.
But if you guessed Aria... DING DING DING DING DING, you're correct!  Too bad I can't give you your prize ;)

Don't get me wrong.  Aria is a decent hotel... but I just don't get a good vibe while staying there, you know?  And I'm all about good vibes.  Like Rob P. and Marne S. said already, the place looks like an airport terminal.  And that's before you even check out Cafe Vetra, their 24-hour restaurant.  The cafe looks like LAX with random weird glass tunnels in various sizes placed around the floor -- what a waste of space.  But alas, this review is not of the cafe, but the hotel.

It's definitely not a luxurious hotel... and I definitely don't feel safe walking around in the casino at night.  Why?  Because I have never encountered as many pervs as I did while staying here.  I am not 21, yet men were approaching me in several interesting ways.  One meowed at me, one tried to grab at me while walking by me, and another asked if I like to ""party hard"" at Aria's 24-hour convenience store.  I told him I was underage and he quickly stuttered that he was joking and ran off to pay for his drink.  I understand this is not the hotel's fault... but I definitely do not get treated like this by others at Wynn, Trump, or Caesar's.  Just sayin'.

To be honest, it's like a MGM or Mirage in disguise... more spruced up if you will, with the modern architecture and advanced technology.

Everything is also more complicated than it has to be.  Parking, getting to the hotel, navigating through the casino to get to the guest rooms, finding your actual room since there are several corridors, and it continues on in the room.  Everything is remote controlled - sheer & black out curtains, lights, television, bathroom lights, alarm clock, temperature, and so on.  It was cool at first but if English isn't your first language, you might get a little confused.  Sometimes it's just easier to do things manually, you know?

The guest room size is very small compared to Wynn, THEhotel, and Trump.  Bathroom was of average size... with a great shower since it was connected to the tub.  However, the water was weak.  The beds were comfy and the morning call which automatically turned on the tv to the channel of your choice and opened the curtains came in handy -- though never actually woke us up.

Here's a lots if why I like this hotel compared to alllll the other hotel one can choose when visiting Las Vegas. 

1. Very nice elegant and modern architecture. Our room was very nice and decorated to perfection. Our view was priceless and the best part of it was that it was about 220 a night. Our stay was during middle of December. 

2. The location. It's centralized within the strip and it's a easy walk to the surrounding hotels, shops and  restaurants. There is also a tram that one can take to get around. We just walked everywhere because it was  so convenient. 

3. The restaurants. Specifically the Buffett. I used to think that Wynn had the best Buffett. But that is until I tried Aria buffet. I believe it was about $40 for dinner or $45 for dinner per person. But not was it worth every penny. The variety of food was endless and the quality was unbeatable.

When we arrived to our room on a non-smoking floor, our room REEKED of smoke. We called the front desk - they said they'd send an ""air purifier"" up to the room - but we'd have to leave for 2-3 hours. Fine with us, because we were on our way to the pool to spend $18 A PIECE on margaritas.

When we returned over 3 hours later, we were locked out of our room (even the maid couldn't get in) and we could still hear the purifier running. When we finally tracked someone down to open the room, we were blasted with the scent of stale smoke... yes, it was actually worse when we walked back in.

Upon calling the front desk, the man we talked to couldn't have cared less that we were having trouble with our room. He ended up switching our room to another - after we had already unpacked all of our clothes. He assured us our key cards would work.

When we got to our new room (carrying all of our hanging clothes, 2 suitcases, etc.)... the key cards didn't work. We stood in the hallway for 15 minutes waiting for another employee to open the door.

The room was a deluxe room with a strip view. The view was great but wow for being a newer hotel the decor is straight out of 1992. 

The beds... so uncomfortable. My mattress sank on one side and the bedding was more motel quality. Worst part.... DIRTY SHEETS. I don't know. Stains that were certainly questionable. 

Bathroom... again stained and yellowing towels. Electric outlet kept shutting off every 10 seconds making drying your hair impossible and the sink water pressure and temperature... no good. It took much too long to warm up enough which is just a sad waste of water. 

Housekeeping came knocking at our door at 9 am and asked us what time we were checking out. Really? Isn't there a set checkout time? Not to mention a privacy light. 

Anyway I would not recommend this hotel.",1,0,0

Positives: Bell Services. We had to store our bags before check in and after check out before our flight. They were incredibly courteous and professional.

Price: They offer military discount which is a nice gesture.

Location: right in the city center. 

Nice shower. Rain shower head. 

Cons: 

Very small casino.

Nothing special. As first time visitors, we wanted to be wowed by our casino. If you want opulence and ""Vegas"" this isn't it. Go to Bellagio, Caesars, NYNY, etc. 

We had a lousy room location (4th floor)-not a nice view. If you book here, request a room above the 7th floor. 

Our room wasn't the cleanest. They sent someone up right away to assist, but it wasn't a good first impression.

Well, although is was a small thing it got more infuriating

The maid did not leave a room service menu, so since we wanted 
breakfast (or at least coffee as no coffee maker is in the room) we called to ask for a menu to be sent up. No apology no concern. 
It was about 11:00 o'clock at that time, one half hour later still no
menu- called again no apology! At 12 we turned on the privacy feature and went to bed!
15 minutes later the phone rings the woman said ""We are trying to deliver items requested but you have the privacy light on. ""
I sarcastically told her I appreciated her respecting our desire for privacy but I think it was lost on her. I also told her we had given up waiting for it as it was over a hour since our original request.

we come back to the hotel at about 4:30 the room has not been cleaned.

I wrote a review of the sports book at the time as my wife and I were really upset. Just a few days ago a friend of the Server from the sports book decided to reach out and insult me. I have never had a business like the Aria resort to such harassment over an honest review of an experience.

My boyfriend and I heard such good things from friends and fellow co-workers about this place that we had to try it out. It was his first time in vegas and my second time and boy, was it ever a nice place to stay! Check in was super easy for us. We waited in line for maybe 5 minutes before they took us on..This might have been because it was late at night as we were catching the red eye coming in. The front desk staff were so friendly and accommodating to our requests..we asked if there were any upgrades available and he stated that Aria had overbooked but if we called the next day they would try and see if there was another room to upgrade to. We decided not to because our room was FANTASTIC!

We loved the electronic tablet that welcomed us and the greeting was very neat. The tablet was great to control the temperature of the room, music, tv, blinds (our favorite part was the goodnight button next to your head that turns everything off). The bathroom was very nice with the glass shower and tub beside it. Our room was very spacious-be careful of the minibar though..if you take anything off the minibar or out for more than 30 seconds, they will charge you-fyi! Our room had a great view of the pool and other areas of vegas!!

The pool is gorgeous with 4 pools, one that is the adults only dance party pool called Liquid which has cabanas and chairs for rent. There are 2 small hot tubs\/whirl pools but it was so hot, i couldn't imagine seeing anyone sitting there. The pool area does get busy but there are so many chairs around that you are bound to find a spot. To get to the pool you have to bring your room key and its on the Promenade Floor.

There are a few restaurants in Aria-we only tried Jean Philippe Pattiserrie which was very yummy! We basically had breakfast there every morning (probably not the smartest thing since it cost us about $25 for 2 sandwiches) but boy were they yummy! We had the breakfast buffet at Aria which was about $15, not too shabby, they had a bit of variety.

Their casino area just didn't do it for me..Don't get me wrong, its a nice place, but there are many other vegas hotels that just give you that 'viva las vegas' feel and aria just didn't make the cut in terms of the casino..this is why i'm only giving aria a 4..actually i'd give them a 4.5..Go play the price is right game-its a lot of fun when you can get  the showcase showdown or play the games such as hole in one. Also! there are cocktail waitresses that come quite a bit so be sure to get your free drinks before you head on out! =)

Overall, Aria was an amazing place to stay..the housekeeping staff always greeted us wherever we were and everyone seemed so friendly to help us out or even chat with us.

Requested 2 Queens for 3 girls...was informed that they booked those rooms already and nothing is guaranteed - so we can have a King bed + a ""complimentary"" rollaway.  WHATEVER!

She also said she'd call us on Saturday to possibly move us to a 2Q room.  No call to let us know one way or the other.  FAIL!

Arrived @ the room on the 3rd floor.  Entered - no lights - nothing automatic.  My two friends desperately tried to turn on the lights...one was fiddling w\/ the master control by the front door.  Other was fiddling w\/ the master control by the beds.  Lights flickered on & off for 10 minutes.  I finally yelled, ""I HAVE TO PEEEEEEE!  Don't touch the LIGHTS DEBORAH!"" and I got to pee.  Yay?

The next day we went to the outdoor pool area - smart layout - made (3) pools + (1) kiddie pool...more space for lounge chairs so easy to find spots.  Stupid floor was so slick that I slipped right in front of my chair & smashed my left elbow - big bruise.  FAIL!

Came back & grabbed salad & trio sandwich pack from downstairs Jean Philippe.  Uh the cheese sandwich I ate caused me to throw up 5 times over the course of the afternoon & evening.  I didn't get to do ANYTHING thanks to a stupid rotten cheese sandwich.  Do NOT eat at Jean Philippe even if it looks great 'cos you'll get SICK!  FAIL!

I just returned from a 6 day stay in Vegas with my boyfriend and I have to relay my experience. First of all, we received a call from the hotel 2 days before we were to leave for vacation informing us of a mistake where our confirmation email was sent to another guest. Because of corporate policy, they were obligated to let us know even though none of our credit card or very personal info was leaked. Because of this, we were upgraded to a corner panoramic suite. Why thank you! 

Upon arrival we were greeted by Nancy, the manager who was kind enough to hook us up with 2 buffet comps along with vip passes to the clubs in the hotel (even though we are not club goers in the least I thought it was nice). Our room was amazing!! We were on the 25th floor of a suite that was entirely encased in windows. It really was panoramic. I won't go into complete detail about the room because you can view the suite yourself on youtube. What I will go into detail about is the free stuff (hey I'm a jewess, we love our free stuff). In the bathroom I was surprised to find a disposable razor (I had forgotten mine and my honey was getting annoyed with me using his so this was awesome), shaving cream, a dental kit consisting of the most adorable mini tube of colgate I've ever seen (you better believe I took an extra from the maid's cart), bath salts (whaaaaat?) and the typical shampoo and conditioner. The coolest feature of the room is the electronic setup. I felt like a bond girl every time I pressed a button and the curtains opened to display the most killer view of the strip and then pressed another to flip on a great jazz station to fill the room with mood music. The last thing I will say about the room is the bed. Oh the bed!! If there was a way to get it on the plane, I think I would've bought it. It was like sleeping on a cloud. I thought we had the most comfortable bed at home until I stayed at the Aria. I kept asking if we could remodel our condo to be a replica of the room. 

Now about the restaurants. Unfortunately we were only able to experience the buffet and Julian Serrano so I'll talk about those. The first night we ventured a little late so we were a little limited on choices but thank god Julian Serrano was still open. Very creative menu, which I was hoping to experience in Vegas.  We started with the Pan Manchego, which was basically a fancy schmancy bruschetta only with delicious aged cheese. So good! Small but worth it. Then we tried the the spanish meatballs in the most delicious tomato sauce. Lastly he got the egg ravioli. I""m not really an egg yolk person but my boyfriend was in heaven. The next night we decided to use our buffet vouchers. I am for sure a buffet person so I will hold this experience near and dear to my heart. Now I won't go as far as to compare this to Wicked Spoon or Bellagio or Wynn because I didn't go to those (I did to Buffet of Buffets though, but thats a whole other review). We went around 4 so there was no line at all.The quality was great! Normally even at the nicest buffets I'm a bit wary of the meat items. Not here. The tandoori oven with the naan made right in front of me was one of my favorite parts. They had the typical carving stations, asian stations, italian ect. Pretty standard but much higher quality. The desserts are what I really have to talk about though. Chef Jean Philippe designed the desserts and they are killer!! I am still dreaming of the creme brulee which was the perfect texture with a glassy layer of crystallized sugar. I'm very picky about my creme brulee. They also had bananas foster. Like REAL bananas foster, not just bananas sitting in caramel. I had 2 helpings of that on top of gelato. Overall great dining experiences. 

Lastly the pool. We were given free passes to the Liquid pool lounge so we decided to check it out. We basically walked in, listened to the music (fist pumping douche music), saw that we were the fattest people there and left after we were informed of a $50 food and drink minimum. All our passes got us was in the door. Oh well, we really weren't interested in hanging there anyway.  Their main pools are very nice. Not alot of children running around which was a major plus. Nothing amazing like the Mandalay but pretty.

Some tables were a little dusty, but overall it was clean. Our first room had someone's medication in the fridge and I called to make sure the room was cleaned and they said the bar wasn't checked, so they switched us to another room. Easy to do since they just change it on the room key so you don't need to go down to the lobby! Pretty high tech with the remote to control curtains too. In a great location, has the Crystal Shops right next door which takes you to Cosmo also. 

Shower was open and spacious. Love bigger showers, hate when you pay for a nice room and the shower is tiny. There's a nice big tub too but they don't have any bubbles so bring you're own if you want a little bubble bath (= Beds are comfortable. The only thing I didn't like about the regular room was no fridge space. They have a fridge filled with all of their good for purchase, and if you move it they automatically charge you. Where do I put my leftover food!? 

Also stayed in a 1 bedroom corner suite and the main bathroom was amazing. The tub faced the view. So spacious and homey. The suite had an extra fridge to put your own stuff in so I didn't have to worry about where to put extra food or drinks. Wish they could just do this is every room. 

Pools are nice (4 stars): Gets pretty crowded, and the pool bar can get packed at times also. When I came here a couple years ago I had the best passion fruit mojito, but the bartender said they couldn't make it this time, wth! Got the margarita instead, which was good still, but not as good as that passion fruit mojito. Really expensive drinks!

Service (5 stars)
Great, no problems.

Room Service (2 stars)

Many of my colleagues had arrived the evening before but I came in on a Sunday and discovered check in wasn't for 5 more hours (3pm) and they would take my number and text me when they had a room ready...or, I could pay an additional $30 and have the room ready now. 

I was exhausted and agreed to the additional $30 so I could get a little rest and also a change of clothing before my first meeting at 2pm. 

I was impressed by the technology but the tablet that controls the room sometimes required me to cancel some advertisement three times before I could get into the controls. The television remote didn't work unless held a special way so the tablet was nice. 

Most troubling was that even though I paid the $30 I immediately noticed a large stain on the comforter which appeared to be semen. I called housekeeping and they were quick to come and inspect then send someone with fresh linens. So this cut into my rest time. Shortly thereafter a knock at the door was a man who wanted to restock the minibar I didn't have an issue with the restocking but when it turned into him inspecting the seal of every bottle in the fridge it only further served to cut into my rest time I had paid for. I tried my best to ignore him and close my eyes but it was loud and his inspection was just so thorough it was kind of distracting me. 

Everything at the mini bar was so expensive I walked to the cvs I on the corner to get the same water they had at 1\/4 the price. I suppose it's just like that in Vegas and water is more valuable than the chips on the table downstairs. 

Overall, with the comforter removed and the minibar guy gone, I guess I got $20 worth of my $30 for the early check in.  Placing a price tag on everything when you're there for a week seems like a poor business model. I was disappointed they didn't offer a shoe shine kit as many Marriott properties I stay at do and the vanity kit was sparse. Mostly makeup remover and a shower cap but the q tips were appreciated. 

I would have liked to stay on a higher floor but if I didn't get too close to the window I didn't see the air conditioners or roof tops below and could enjoy the mountain view when I woke up. 

The staff was friendly and the shower was interesting incorporating a bathtub in the same enclosure. Just too many stains on the chairs and the one on the bed was glaring at me. The bed actually had an impression on it where it looked as though someone had been laying there and left a wet spot. Really gross but it is a hotel I suppose. I never sleep with the comforters or bed blankets anyway, sheets only for me so I just wanted that and the other things you can't bleach out of the way.  Not a bad place to stay but I've stayed at almost all of the properties in Vegas and this is not my favorite. The Wynn still has my vote.",4,2,0

Long story short, this whole 'star-rating' they give these hotels is surely corrupted. Someone is getting bribed somewhere because this is NOT a 5 star hotel. 

You'll deal with the usual-oh that room you booked is gone but we have one a little different but it's not on a high floor or if you want you can stay at this lower one tonight and we will switch you over tomorrow-WHO wants that kind of hassle?! It's called a vacation folks. I don't want to do jack unless it involves sipping on drinks by the pool. Not to mention, since I work in the travel industry, I'm constantly moving-the last thing I want to do is move hotel rooms during my stay. 

Also, you'll get better valet service just about everywhere else-the people here don't even open the door for you or offer to help you with your bags.....very odd. 

Oh but here's the real downfall....the AIR-CONDITIONER SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE!!!! We stayed in two different rooms during our stay so we know it's just their AC system. I couldn't sleep the first two nights. The third night I complained and they gave me a humidifier and said they'd be charging per night for it-WHAT THE HECK MAN?! Your AC sucks and that's not MY problem. Not to mention they gave me the exact same humidifier I have at home-$20 from Target. And you want to charge me $50+ a night for it?! Clearly you're insane. Aria leverages the 5 star title to charge you up the bum but they don't deliver that kind of rating. 5 stars to them means you can charge $20 for a mini Fiji water. 
Bring a humidifier TRUST me. It's that bad. I've never had to use one in any hotel room I've ever stayed at and I've stayed at alllllllllll kinds of hotels all over the world.

I will never be staying here again. And all of that^ is just the major stuff. 
 
The bathrooms aren't properly ventilated and the faucet is SO loud-it'll wake your roomie up. But ehhhhhhhhhhhhh. I'd be willing to over look it.....but not that AC and lack of 5 star service.

There wasn't alot of energy, nobody seemed to be having any fun, I don't think anyone was winning anything in the casino.  Everybody must have been on Xanax or some kind of antiaxiety medication.

We walked to the ""Players Club"" and asked for information regarding one of their shows.  The woman with the butterfly tatoo on her neck was completely rude, snooty, rolled her eyes at us and sent us upstairs to the box office.  She should not be in the hospitality industry.

Even though we are really dedicated to our favorite Vegas hotels (Wynn and Palazzo) we were just looking for something cheap for one night. As we selected a 80$ room we were so shocked and happy to see it was the Aria! We both have been very skeptical of the new City Center in Vegas, often making fun of the office building style and hideous logos that look like something I created in Adobe Illustrator 101, but still we were excited.

First impression was strange, the roundabout style of the road leading in was very confusing. Once we finally pulled in to the valet we were rudely instructed that we were in the ""wrong"" valet. Upon check in we were upgraded to a Sky Suite, score!

Once we arrived in our room I was shocked by how small it was. If this was a suite I would be scared to see what a regular room looks like! The amenities the room offered were amazing. Beyond the usual shampoo and hand soap there was hair spray, chap-stick and a toothbrush and toothpaste! As a girl, I really appreciate those things. The whole room (lights, curtains, air conditioning) is controlled from a little touch-pad. Unfortunately, ours seemed to be broken as we could never quite figure out how to draw our shades and more than once we turned on a ""nature-scape"" mood setting complete with chirping birds. 

The style of the hotel is very unique and unlike any I have seen in Vegas. Void of the usual chandeliers, gold trimming and European styling the Aria is very whimsical and in the words of my friend ""Tim Burton-esque"". We grabbed a drink at the Bar Moderno late one night at was very pleased. My caramelized pineapple sidecar was scrumptious and the sticky & sweet was finger-lickin-good.

As of December 2009, it seems, at least one casino is committed to bringing that metaphor to pungent nostril-stinging life. 

Enter MGM's brand new Aria Casino, squat in the middle of the Vegas Strip,  the newest something-billion-dollar casino in this prettied up turd of a town, and the place where--make no mistake--fecal matter matters.

The name itself (pronounced AH-rhee-uh, one might presume) may well bring to mind the lilt of a feminine voice across an open-air Italian café, or otherwise earnest operatic strains. But be very clear, the strains you hear in your mind's ear are of a different sort altogether. Once you digest the fact that ""Aria"" is phonetically the second half of the word ""diarrhea,"" you are ready for a tour of this lower-intestine-meets-porcelain excretory wonderland more appropriately pronounced as ""uh-RHEE-uh.""

Upon parking in the bowels of the garage, proceed to level NUMBER TWO. Let yourself be unceremoniously squeezed down the winding narrow corridor toward the casino floor. Along the way, take a gander out of one of the picture windows on your right. Below you is the valet entrance in all its grandeur. Notice the white and crystal cantilevered U-shape roof structure high above. Your eyes do not deceive you, it does, in fact, resemble a giant toilet seat. Now look under the lid at the marvelous sheet-fountain rimming nearly the entire diameter of the high-walled "" bowl"" of the valet entrance. Let's not mince words; it is as if cars and guests are being flushed down a giant crapper, complete with that classic Northern Hemisphere counterclockwise drain-circling action. The final touch? A frothy yellow fountain at the center of this rectal roundabout.

As you continue down the escalator, notice the sculptures in the lobby. The only way these Works of Arse can be described is ""chrome-covered dribbly shit, stood on end."" Nevertheless people stand around and gawk. Don't do it. Tighten your muscles of resolve and push on.

On the casino floor, the first stop is a coffee shop. If you are a naturalist, big game hunter or hiker who has ever made ""that face"" while scraping the bottom of your boot with a stick, you will note that the walls of the coffee shop are covered in giant deer turds. The logo for this java joint is an oblong oval with a single curl of steam rising above it. Need I say more?

Now turn your attention to the casino floor as it stretches out before you like a vast sea of sewage. Let it clog your senses. From the soaked carpets to the splattered walls it is brown on brown on brown. This, my friends, is the entire palette of poo.  A quivering colon of colors.  Magnus dumpus. A full pantload. The rectum spectrum. Dark brown, light brown, deep brown. Wet Leather Mudslide. Trouser Chili Cookoff. Skidmark of the Covenant--these being the names of the various and individual shades of brown being hurled at your eyes like so much dung from the an enraged monkey at the city zoo. Sewer Loaf. Ripe Diaper. Hot Hershey Trickle. Swamp Snake Brown. Beef Leak Brown. Snooki Brown. Downtown Freddy Brown, What-Can-Brown-Do-For-You-Brown . It's on the drapes, the dealer uniforms, everywhere. The craps tables have never been more appropriately named. We are drowning in a steaming pot of gold at the end of the brown rainbow. Liquid Oak. Oompa Loompa. Bread Yogurt. Cleveland Steamer. Dysentery Schiavo. 

You are getting claustrophobic. It's hard to breathe. Do you feel more like Tim Robbins escaping through that sewer pipe in Shawshank Redemption or Ewan McGregor in that rat-a-tat-tat Trainspotting bathroom? Guaranteed it's one or the other. I'd bank it. That's the safest bet in this casino.

Signs in the casino point you to the Elvis Theater. Elvis died on the toilet.

Above the gaming tables hang large brown varnished beams of wood, arranged side by side, but cresting and falling as if held aloft on the waves an imaginary ocean. I call them ""floaters."" I think you will agree. Out of the ceiling next to the floaters descend large tangles of silver bristles like steel wool or some other commode-cleaning implement. Too little, too late.

More signs point you in the direction of other rooms and venues in the casino. Sage is among them, the kind of scent you might spray in your bathroom after laying cable.

By now your head is spinning. You need a drink. Turn to the bar. Oh god, no. Massive chrome-covered logs rise out of the ground complete with gnarled tree bark Like a redwood forest of excrement. Are there any other bars down this outhouse hole? The haze of cigarette smoke is looking more and more like steam to you. Yes, it does appear that there is indeed one more bar on the far side of the casino. You make your escape to what you think might be the one place you will be safe from the onslaught of dung. You couldn't be more wrong.

The name of that bar? ""The Deuce.",35,90,30

I walked in . . . and it was like Hangover in that place.  I didn't want to leave the room.  However still had some irrititating electric problems which a place like this just shouldn't have.

Also, it is just a bit further from the strip than I would have liked.  I mean seriously, from the room to the strip is a good 15 minutes . . . but the view was still great at night.

The Good:

You definitely turn a few heads when you announce you are at the Aria in a Suite lol.

Vegas provides innumerable hotel options. What makes Aria stand out is that it's really a much more high-end hotel than the pricing would suggest.  It opened during the recession, and it's had to keep it's prices at a reasonable level to draw clientele, but the quality of the rooms, the restaurants, and the general decor make it closer to one of the high-end modern hotels in Vegas than the dated also-rans.

Lovely restaurants, bars, bakeries, etc. It's attached to the Monte Carlo, Vdara and Bellagio via tram, and much construction is still going on in the area. The hike from self parking to your elevator is... ugh. This hotel can be summed up in one word... inefficient. 

Made a reservation that confirmed our CityCenter view. Our corner suite faced the 15 freeway. Hmph. 

The first thing you notice when you walk in the room is the FILTHY WINDOWS. I'm surprised more Yelpers haven't complained about this! Terrible. 

One remote will handle your lighting, thermostat, TV, curtains, etc.
You would think this would be a cool, fun idea. It ISN'T. 

Our remote DID NOT WORK. I pushed the Privacy button. It changed on its own to SERVICE ROOM. !!! I sat in the living room couch nowhere near any remote, and the curtains just CLOSED. When I changed the thermostat to 75\/heat, it changed to 69\/cold. 

Could it be a ghost? Maybe, but I'm going to blame the faulty electrical system in this place. 

We got moved to another room. Same problems with the remote. Turned off the bed lights and there went the TV and the curtains. I did not WANT the curtains or TV shut off!  

Both suites have these nice closets. In the bathroom. WHY IS THIS?? If someone is in the bathroom and you want to get your suitcase, you've got to wait. Ridiculous. The spa tub is great for one person. Two people, too small. Good luck with trash cans. One per suite. And no sink at the bar (but a mini-bar AND a refrigerator with an ice machine was kind of cool). 

Customer service? Every single person who worked for or in that hotel was lovely, even though I've seen complaints here from Yelpers. They really did try to take care of us and upgraded our suite as quickly as one became available. 

The best part of Aria? THE BEDS. The beds are heaven. I like The Hotel and Wynn much better than this hotel. But Aria has them both beat BY FAR on the beds. If you value the bed you sleep on in a hotel, you may want to just overlook all the technical stuff for a great night's sleep at Aria. Heaven. Really. 

It was an OK stay. You can find better for your hard earned money elsewhere. But did I mention the bed?",6,2,3

Me and a group of friends come to Vegas once a year for the past 7 years and love it. We usually prefer to stay at other MGM resorts like MGM Grand or Mandalay Bay. We figured this year we would try out Aria since it's the newest of the casinos.

I'll start off with the casino it's self is a very beautiful casino right smack in the center of the strip, which is a good thing. The bakery downstairs is great and the buffet is excellent. The rooms are very nice..... Comfortable beds, everything was remote controlled (lights,shades,etc). The bathroom was the best part, a gorgeous tub and nice glass stand up shower in their as well. The front desk was friendly but after you check in it's like no one wants to help anymore. Kind of like you paid we got our money and that's it.

I'm no high roller but I am pretty big gambler and gamble for hours on end. Their table limit standards and rating system is absolute bullshit. I sat down pretty much all morning playing a game called ""crazy4poker"" gave the floor my card at $60 dollars a hand ($15 min with 4 betting spots) and sometimes more if I was winning. Not only did I play but I tipped the dealers pretty well off, at least a couple hundred in my sitting ( I am a dealer in florida myself). My friends got interested in playing but had no idea how to play so we asked if they could lower table standards because other than myself not a single person was playing. The floor very unfriendly said no and looked at me like I was an asshole for even asking, they didn't even give a reason or discuss the topic ( I've been to hundreds of casinos and usually they will bargain or make an exception if it's slow) basically the customer service was horrible. This went on for every game in Aria and majority of the minimum table limits were $25 (at night $50-100)which is ridiculous.  I couldn't even gamble in the hotel I was staying at for 5 days because it was too expensive. You design the hotel for people who love to travel in Vegas, gamble, have fun and stay in a nice hotel. But instead limit it to how much money do you have in your wallet that's how we will treat you. 
I usually get comped for food, show tickets and sometime free play but not aria they want you average $160 a bet for them to even consider it,that is absurd. Me and my friends had fun elsewhere gambling the trip (Monte Carlo,MGM,planethollywood,etc) places like those that are fun and enjoy their customers and want everyone to be happy. I went to those places so often this trip that dealers were remembering us and some floor supervisors as well. We tipped them good, drank and enjoyed ourselves. Rather than Arias casino staff looked at everyone like they were lower class unless you were a high roller. We also got comped buffets at the other places.

There was 22 of us that came on this trip and we all stayed at Aria. Not one person was pleased with the gaming floor or hospitality. We felt we made the right decision choosing aria but by the time we left we felt the right one would be that we never stay or gamble here again. This was the biggest disappointment hotel ever to me in the history of visiting Vegas.

So if the people reading this take reviews seriously believe me when I say, take other options and stay elsewhere. I would of liked to have given my opinion and honesty to management about all this but in the end we all know they don't give a shit.


P.s the pool was a huge disappointment.... It should belong in a motel 6.",2,0,0

I checked in Saturday November 11 and checked out Wednesday November 15 to accompany my wife on a business trip. The room (30th floor) and hotel was nice enough but every morning when I awoke I had what I can only assume were insect bites ( I assume bedbugs) on my arms, legs and later my buttocks. On the morning of my checkout I went down early to inform them of the issue. After speaking to the desk clerk a manager came out to address the issue. I offered to show her the bites (there are a lot) and she told me I'd have to go back to my room and wait for security to fill out a report. I honestly felt like I was being stonewalled for informing them of a potential issue that made me and could potentially make other guests very uncomfortable. After waiting almost an hour a guard finally found his way to my room. I was asked to show ID (they photographed it and a few of my arms & legs but none of the buttocks which is the worst area of bites) which I'd assume they already know who I am as I've been checked in almost 5 days. At this point I felt like I was being interrogated by said guard. After all of this they had me wrote my own report regarding the incident and told me they'd look into it and contact me if they found any issues. I really felt they wasted my time as this ""report"" could've been handled in the lobby, the interrogation was absolutely unnecessary and rude. I really don't need to be contacted on any findings as I can't imagine ever returning, but I would suggest they contact the Orkin man and replace the bed.

Compared to the Palazzo, the Aria was a complete disappointment. I actually never wanted to stay here but my boyfriend insisted so I agreed to a night of it. I'm semi-glad I agreed because he never wants to come back here. Glad he got that out of his system. 

I'd have to say Aria's problem was that they tried too hard. They wanted to be trendy and innovative but I'd have to say that was the cause of their demise because it failed.

Hotel Layout: I'd have to say idiots designed this hotel. The floor layout looked like an X (a V and an upside down V connected). There is only one elevator at the center and about 50-100 rooms on each arm. Ice is only located on one side of each V and there is no way to get to the other side except to walk all the way back to the elevators. My boyfriend and I happened to get the second to last room and it was literally a 15 minute walk back and forth from the elevator. 

Room: Seeing as how we stayed in Palazzo and all the rooms are suites, this room literally seemed like I was staying in a box. I haven't stayed in any of the other 3+ star hotels with normal hotel rooms so I don't know the space compares to those. 

Bathroom: They tried to be innovative and trendy by putting this glossy looking door to the toilet up but you could see through it! They might as well not have had the door because in order to have your privacy, you had to close the actual bathroom doors and then the toilet door. 
-Tub: Small, my boyfriend could barely fit in there by himself. And also very strange! They had the shower and tub behind the same door. I'm guessing it was their solution to saving space because otherwise the bathroom was pretty tiny. 

Bedroom: Instead of light switches, you have buttons. But i'd have to say I'd rather use light switches because they're at least responsive. The buttons didn't always turn on the lights. It was almost like a casino game. Sometimes you'd get lucky and they'd turn on, sometimes they wouldn't. But the goodnight button that turns off all the lights always worked!
-Bed: My boyfriend preferred Aria's bed to Palazzo's because it was softer. I agree but I like tougher beds so I preffed Palazzo. One annoying thing about Aria's bed though was how they made it. The covers went underneath the pillows. They give you like 6 pillows and if you're sitting on the bed, you have to get up, throw the pillows on the floor, in order to untuck the covers and get underneath. 

Television: I liked how their television had a guide. Palazzo's didn't and it was kind of annoying have to search through every single channel (especially since I don't know what the channel numbers in Las Vegas correspond to). 

Safe: Small, all I could fit in the safe was a laptop and a sunglass case. They put it inside a drawer so it's really shallow and small. 

Cool Things:
Door Lock: You flash your card in front of the door look to open it. No need to insert. 
TV: You can turn on the lights, air conditioning, music all through the tv!",4,3,3

i got comped a 3 night stay here, with the option to upgrade to a corner suite for an additional $50 a night. i checked in the first night -- no suites to upgrade to, so they gave me a normal room. the next night, i swung by the front desk around 930pm to see if they had a suite i could upgrade to, and lo and behold, they did. the front desk lady asked me to grab all my stuff out of the room and move to the suite.

after i went upstairs and roused my friend who was sleeping, someone opened the door 10 minutes in and yelled at us, ""why are you in my room?"". it looked like the front desk checked this guy into the room we hadn't even vacated yet.

we grabbed our stuff as quickly as we could and went a few floors down to the suite.

the hallway smelled like weed.

i saw a plastic fork, a cellophane wrapper, and sunflower seeds sitting in the hallway.

i walk into the room (which is nice, i guess -- +1 for toto washlet equipped toilets) and i find a half-eaten french fry on the ground in the bathroom. a few minutes later, i find the notepad next to the phone had been scribbled on, and there was a bag of trash in one of the cubbies in the desk.

after taking a shower the next morning, i find a towel that had bloodstains in it. while the towel had been washed, there were still stains. FML

the hotel was able to offer me a $50 food and beverage credit and removed one $50\/night charge, but it took me a while, waiting on hold. i got placed on hold a few times throughout my stay. what a shitty experience -- i'm never going there again.

also, who designed the main valet pickup? you gotta walk all the way through the entire freaking casino or through the traffic rotunda to pick up your car. ridiculously inconvenient if you're carrying your own luggage and checking out.

on the bright side, the valet attendants were great and didn't try stuffing my slammed, modified car into the parking garage and the hotel wifi was RIDICULOUSLY fast (22mbits down 15mbits up -- faster than my home internets)

I especially enjoyed the daily turnover service. Yes!!! They were also kind enough to rearrange my toiletries beautifully, instead of leaving them in the jumbled mess that I had left them with.

The only problem I had was sleeping. The fan kept on waking me up, and there was no way to turn it off. But that was only the first night, and I wasn't quite drunk enough to sleep well. The next few nights were perfectly fine.

1) We spoke with a manager there so they were informed how things were handled in hopes that others don't go through what we did.

2) They removed 2 of our 3 days of resort fees. One might have thought they would do all 3, but we didn't want to argue or be difficult and so we just said thanks and tried to go enjoy the rest of our stay.

3) Upon checkout, we got charged a $25 fee for putting leftovers in the minifridge. The woman who checked us out removed a drink that was triggered from our bill, but she refused to remove the charge for putting something in the fridge, though it was an honest mistake and we didn't see any signage about fridge use. She basically said, hey there was a sign (though she couldn't tell me where in the room it was, just that it was there), and that it was our fault for not seeing it.

4) I've never complained about the service at a hotel before, but the way everything was handled made us feel like we didn't matter and even when they were attempting to be accommodating, it's clear they still wanted to squeeze whatever they can out of you. :\/",2,1,0

Only negative was a rude check-out clerk.  Called the next day and had a great conversation with Lewis the manager.  He was great and assured me the issue would be addressed.  He did everything to make things right.  Not sure what more you can ask for.  I read too many complaining reviews on Yelp without any talk about what people did to bring it to the attention of management.  In my experience with the ARIA they do everything then can to satisfy customer.  Rather than just bitch see what management says.,0,0,0

We had been to Aria on a previous Vegas trip to eat at Sage and do a little gambling, but had not stayed there.  Our flight got into Vegas at 11pm on a Sunday night, so we didn't get to Aria until after midnight.  At least 6 stations at the check-in counter were manned and line to check-in was over twenty deep with guests waiting to get into their rooms.  Despite a little wait, check-in went smoothly and we got into our room by 1am.  

Hands down, Aria has the most high-tech rooms that I've stayed in Vegas.  Upon opening the door, the room lights came on and the curtains over the floor to ceiling windows opened.  Most, if not all, essential room functions to include turning on\/off lights, opening\/closing the curtains, setting a wake-up alarm, and controlling the HD flat panel were controlled by a master control next to the bed.  Speaking of which, the bed and linens were among the most comfortable I've experienced in any hotel affording a very good night's sleep...what little sleep I got while in Vegas.  

The one glaring negative about our stay at Aria was the gaming.  I play blackjack and craps; however, I wasn't feeling very excited about the blackjack and crap options at Aria.  Throughout our entire stay, the table minimums for blackjack and craps remained at $50 and $15, respectively.  Really?  Even mid-week, mid-day?  I'd hate to see what the minimums are on the weekend!  Aria did have some $25 blackjack tables, but they used the continuous shuffle machines rather than a multi-deck shoe.  I don't play that way.  Aria had the highest table minimums of any of the casinos we visited on the Strip to include the Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, and the Cosmopolitan.  No wonder the tables were always empty! 

So, upon final review, Aria Resort & Casino is a fine place to stay especially if you can get a discounted room rate, and a good place to dine, but for your recreational, regular joe gambler, play somewhere else.",3,1,1

The staff is excellent and helpful. I have been here several times, and have never had an incident. As a matter of fact during hotel check in I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and the front desk sent chocolate covered strawberries and a box of macaroons up to my room. Perfect touch.

I would rate this 2.5 but yelp doesn't do half points, and i really do not feel the hotel warrants 3 stars. I've been to more than a handful of different hotels, and the expectations for this place were definitely not met.

The hotel itself, i rate it at a 4.
The interior is contemporary, the room layout is standard, but packed with high tech features. The location is close enough to the strip, and there is a definitely ""newness"" to the hotel. In theory this place really isnt too bad.

Now this is where it failed. . .. .Service.
Upon arrival at 11am, we check in. our requested room was 2 queen standard, as we had 4 ppl. She tells me all of the 2 queen rooms are booked, and they only had king bed rooms. it wasnt until i asked her to check for available 2 queens checking out, did it occur to her to check the ""dirty"" rooms. Once she found them, she put a hold on them, then returned my ID and credit card. Again, it wasnt until i asked her .. . ""what now?"" did she tell me to come back and check to see if it was ready. When asking for an approximate time, she told me anywhere to 6 or 7pm. Ok seriously, if thats the case, i think its time for management to do something and fix the hole they dug by overbooking. third time, it wasnt until i asked before she gave me the option of CALLING IN to ask about my room (which, trust me, i did ever 20  minutes out of spite). They also said they couldnt contact me when my room was ready because ""they were WAY too busy"". Check-in experience: 1 star.

Upon entering the first room (my friend's king bed room) all the controls went haywire. None of the controls worked, lights and curtains didnt respond. The automated features were moving at will, with 10 minute lag response. After calling for support, a tech guy arrived 40 minutes later to reset the system. On another note, the front desk number took multiple tries to even reach a rep, and hold time was on average 5 minutes at least. The front desk seemed to be on overload, and calls were being disconnected and held. Service was untimely, slow, and inefficient.

Other amenities. The Buffet priced at $26, food was mediocre. Not worth the price. American Fish food was ok, but WAY overpriced. $16 for 3 pieces of fish and chips, ridiculous. Portion size was not even worth it. There was nothing that stood out for dining, and we didnt have time to go to the clubs or bars. The actual casino floor, was not big. Tables and machines were actually kind of limited.

Overall, besides the high tech room, Aria has very little to offer. The room layout is exactly what you see in any of the MGM line of hotels, except ""fancier"". Service is an absolute joke, and the place feels like its run by a bunch of amateur college grads. No one knows what they are doing, and its absolutely chaotic. I must say the place was a disappointment for the standards Las Vegas should currently be at.",1,0,0

Have they never stayed in a luxury hotel?  is this the best they have ever stayed in?  They can't tell the difference between the real 4 and 5 star hotels vs the make elieve.

High tech gadgets they have at Aria is few years behind.  Venetian and Wynn had them ever since they opened few years ago.  So, what Aria have is nothing new.  What a dinky shower tub combo they have.  Such as compact room compare to other newer casinos.  Half the light doesn't seems to wor leavig it dark.  Such a dark hallway to get to your room.

Worst of all, I thought was the security crew that supposedly guards the entrance to enter guest elevators.  What is ARAI thinking of?  Yes, it's good that they should be guarded, however, they shouldn't hire some thugs that think they could intimidate you.  What, do they believe that if you have some big (FAT) dude guarding them would make the guests feel safer.  I was there on the weekend of mother's day.  They seems to pick on Asians more so than others  Don't those big fat #%@$ know that over 50% of their guests are Asians.    Since they are so much smaller than you big fat asses that they can push them around.  

ARIA, watch out, you have already lost some of the bigger whales as I've been told by a good source\/  Pretty soon, you will loose more with this lack of service or I should say poor service and having hired ex-mafix that couldn't hack it in a real world so they became a security of a casino guarding doors.

My fiancé leaves our room for the night to meet up with her friends while I stay back to watch our 10 month old. Secunity inexplicably stops her and start harassing her at the elevator. They had her mixed up with someone else, but refused to call our room so I could clear it up. They lied and told her they were police officers, threatened to process her and throw her in jail, would not let her leave, and all this was in front of the very public cafe. They also lied and told her she was on a red flag list; her name and address matched. It took over 1\/2 hour and I had to wake the baby before they realized they were wrong. BTW, her name was on the registration, but apparently it's the hotels policy that known trespassers can register at the hotel but can't stay there. Adam Schlientz was the head security person who was treating us like criminals even after realizing they had made a mistake. He actually told us we had no right to be upset. We went to the front desk to complain, but assistant manager Dan Jordan was no help at all. We never received an apology or a call back from anyone. Not only was the night ruined, she was so embarrassed that she didnt want to leave the room again. The next night we ordered room service. That's not what we went to Vegas for.

Aria punked us!!!- all 1900 of us!! (between the IronWood and Juniper & 'other' little ballrooms which are all part of the same facility- w just 1 bathroom on that floor mind you) for $100 each. Kudos for having tables at least, but 1st come 1st serve? No table reservations possible? So a couple (like us) who made sure to arrive early pays 2bills & now has 2 share an 8 seat table?? & sharing this table which we showed up early to snag--w\/ drunk ignorant strangers!?!? (who know ZERO about boxing-& make sure u get 2 hear it) Couldn't even comfortably watch the undercards bcuz every 30secs -""Aaay bro?!? Can me & my wife & my cousin & our baby & my abuelo sit here?"" ""Can u ask your lady to scoot over-ay she's fine bro"" ...Not to mention TERRIBLE audio\/video? Couldn't hear the announcers, video pm projector screen was washed out from all the extra unneccesary room lighting..And IT WAS FREEZING!!!!! The inglorious bar-sters didnt even offer any energy drinks (so we got to pay $10 for club soda) and then only staffed 2-3 servers per the 800 or so people in each ballroom? Everyone had to go to the 'bar' themselves. Took FOREVER since u had to buy drink tix 1st--THEN go over to the bartender & pay w the tix!!! Silly!! Asked the bartender about this and he even was like ""yeah i dont know why they do it like this it takes so much longer!"" He also thought not carrying redbull or other non-alki drinks was illogical. True story btw: In line for 10$ water I noticed the woman ahead of me dressed in what looked like a waiter outfit holding a large drink tray. I asked ""Are you a server here? I didn't realize there were servers for the tables here-i hadn't seen anybody serving?"" I swear she says ""yeaaaah, not everyone is getting waiter service though"" ?!?!?! I paid $100 to get in, 1\/2 ass bar service, sharing tables w strangers- ""WHY NOT?!?"" i asked...no reply...(why was she in the reg line anyway? Aren't u waiting on tables???WTF???)

We booked a non-smoking City-view King room, and warned them that we'd be checking in very late (our plane arrived at midnight).  After an exhausting trip, we got to the check in desk to find that we were the only one in line and the four agents were helping other customers.  But as soon as one customer finished up, the agent closed her station instead of helping us.  Not a good first impression.  That was when we were told that our room was a ""smoking optional"" room and that our ""non-smoking"" reservation was ""just a request.""  Well, that wasn't how it was presented to us when we booked.

We got to the room, which we were assured would not smell, and it reeked.  My husband was up coughing all night.  I had problems of my own.  The beds at Aria are ridiculously soft.  You literally sink into the mattress and there is no support.  All night I tossed and turned between nightmares of being stuck on high-gravity planets, being swallowed by pit monsters, being paralyzed, and sinking into quicksand.  And the ""blackout"" curtains leak a lot of light from the top and bottom, so in the morning when the sun rose at 7AM, I had no choice but to wake up with it, in spite of having fallen asleep at 2:30.

To be fair, the rooms themselves are gorgeous.  The decor is sumptuous but modern and tasteful and every room juts out a bit to give you a bit of a corner view.  The curtains and sheers open and close with the touch of a button and all the lights are on wall controls.  A single touch of a button by your bedside turns of all the lights and closes the curtains for you.

The lobby and public spaces are really cool with an eclectic modern decor worthy of the newest cruise ships.  There's always some new detail to discover.  The buffet is extensive and we didn't have wait in lines, but the food wasn't any better than a buffet in, say, Reno.

The second night they moved us to a larger room on a higher floor that was nonsmoking.  That was much better, but I still had a lot of trouble with the mattress.  I woke up at 3:30 AM with a horrible pain in my back (I do have some back issues, but I usually don't have trouble with hotel mattresses).  I finally put the two lounge chairs in the room together and slept on those, which was an improvement, but still not comfortable.  I don't know why Aria has chosen to go to such an extreme with their mattress selection.  It's like sleeping on a sack of peanut butter.  

That morning, I told my husband that we had a choice: we could either risk moving to a new hotel and eat the third night we'd booked at the Aria or I was buying a ticket home for that afternoon.  We checked out and went to the Mandarin Oriental.

I won't comment on the bars or casinos because I scarcely drink and we don't gamble.  We did have one drink at the Lobby Bar and, while it took a while for the waitress to take our order, the service after that was swift and polite.",1,2,0

The first problem is trying to find the parking lot. I guess I was a bit excited when I saw a street (Harmon) leading to the building. It ends up, that route only leads you to the valet. I had to go back down the slope and back on to the strip to find the self parking. But once inside, the parking spots were ridiculously large, making it difficult to find an actual spot unless you parked on the higher levels. Basically, each time there is a pole, the space in front of the pole will be striked out. This ended up making every other space unavailable. They could have avoided this problem if they just had stopper bricks to prevent cars from hitting the poles when parking. 

Once we found the parking lot and a spot, the parking lot is on the other side of the building from the hotel lobby. When we reach the counter, the employee checking us in (Marcus) was INCOMPETENT! It seemed as though he was reciting the instruction manual to us. We reserved a room for 2 queen size beds months in advance. He tells us that they don't have any more of those rooms available, but he could give us a king size bed with a rollaway. When we asked how they can run out when we made reservations, his answer from the manual was: ""That is only a request. There is no guarantee."" Apparently, the guy in line next to us got the same response. 

The girl working next to Marcus told him to call some number that could help him get a bypass code to give us a room that we reserved for. He said he called but couldn't get through\/the number wasn't working. When we asked to speak with the manager, Marcus tells us the manager is busy and asked us to step aside to wait. By this time, we were quite irritated already. Finally he walks up to the manager and gets a bypass code from the manager, giving us a room on the 12th floor (even though the guy next to us who got the same response earlier was given a room on the 38th floor). I've never had a check in experience last 25 minutes! 

The room was quite nice, very high tech. There was a control board that controlled the lighting, TV, A\/C, curtains, alarm clock all in one. However, the bed was WAYYYY too soft. My back ached the next morning from the softness, and I'm not even an oldie to have a back problem. 

However, the hotel itself has gorgeous interior architecture and designs. Everything was visually appealing and complemented the modern theme very well. 

The hotel is also centrally located in the CityCenter. The tram was very convenient in taking us to Crystals, Vdara and Bellagio.

The line was not very long but it took intirely too long to check in and receive our room keys.  We then found our room filthy...it wasn't even vacuumed. We were exhausted therefore we called it a night.   The next day, we decided to get a massage from a nice credible resort and spa. We checked in @ 3:45 and our massages were @ 4. Treatments were average at best. HERE is were the real problem began... My wife's WEDDING  ring and her ROLEX were stolen out of her 4 digit code locker during the treatment.  $$$$$ dollars stollen instantly.   As soon as we found the items missing, we immediately headed to the women's check in.   It felt like an eternity before sucurity showed up. I insisted to pull the video for check in and start doing an audit on who was in and out of the spa during that time.  Nothing happend on their part...absolutely no urgency.  Our chance to recover her goods deminshed every second that we waisted. They kept assuring me that their risk department would handle this first thing on Monday due to them being closed on the weekend. I also believe that they were simply trying to get us out of there.  We traveled back home and called them first of the week. I spoke to Katrina at the risk management department. She assured me that they were looking into the incident but yet Katrina had not received or gone over the report.  More time wasted.... every second waisted was a direct loss of our items. A controlled environment with security cameras everywhere and their response 4 days later was that ""We have no liability from the situation."" This is 100 percent wrong! They made zero effort to recover our goods! On the day of the incident, I went back to the spa 3 times to see if there was a sign stating that they were not responsible for lost or stolen items.... There was absolutely NO SIGN!!!  So how did my wife's sentimental jewelry go missing???? That is the question?!!! Al, a manager of risk management, assured me that there was a documented time stamp of every time the digital locker was opened.  I continued to ask him what time the locker was opened during our massages? Al could not answer the question!!!!! I then asked him about a possible inside job.  Al assured me no one had access to the master code. I then asked him who his boss was...he was reluctant on giving me Peter's contact information (general manager of risk management). I was transferred again... and Peter pick up my call.  I spent another 20 minutes of arguing and trying to look for some type of simpathy and solution. He basically told me they have zero liability on this...and there was NOTHING they could do. Moral of the story, Aria resort and spa gets the worst rating! I have never posted a review on any company. Whether the staff stole our items or they magically disappeared, Aria at the very least,  should be liable for half of our lost!!! I strongly discourage anyone wanting to stay at their hotel. Your items will be stolen and you will be dealing with risk management when you are at home.  My next step is getting my attorney involved and then contacting iHEART radio on their convention!  I will get them to change venues next year and Aria will lose Millions of dollars of revenue over a relatively small number for a multi billion dollar casino.  It's a good thing I spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on their radio stations over the country! I am POSITIVE I can...and I WILL get them to relocate next year!

We have been here several times and this morning we wanted to try the Buffet for breakfast. My husband had found that it opened at 7am and we are early risers, so off we went to be first in line. 

Well, we were not first, but close. We were asked if we wanted a table with a view, of course we said yes and were escorted to a table by the wall of windows overlooking the pool and spa area. It seemed this was going to be a good experience at this point things were looking very promising. That soon changed. 

As we made our way to the line, we passed in front of the deserts, not much on display but a few pastries, some coffee cakes, and some cookies. Next came salads, there were five choices, with the Asian beef salad being really good, very spicy, I found thick cuts of jalapenos. I liked it. 

I discovered three egg dishes, and a made to order omelet station. The egg and ham dish was runny, just didn't seem seasoned. The breakfast meats including bacon, link sausage and ham. I love bacon, but this wasn't crispy enough for me. There were the usual waffle and cheese blitz dishes. And then there were several meats sliced to order, like turkey, roast beef, and ham, but none of the sides you'd expect to go with them, like yams, green beans etc.... 

I did find bagels with a ton of fresh made cream cheese spreads, everything from salmon to sun dried tomatoes, a limited amount of fresh fruits, like cantaloupe and honeydew melon. But no fresh berries. 

Overall, I would say a disappointment, for the price we paid, I would expect more flavor, the hotel\/casino is fantastic, but the Buffet is off my list.",0,0,0

I like the architecture and modern feel. Everyone there was cool, helpful and professional but the only reason I had to give it four stars instead of five is because the bellman in the front blew it for everyone. 

I got dropped off by a cab and none of them even opened my door let alone helped me with my luggage. Even as I was walking up they continued their conversation as if I was not even there. And because I was wearing cute shoes all day my feet were killing me and I really could have used a hand. 

It really stinks they represented the hotel that way because honestly everything else was perfect. The girl that checked me in was super sweet. 

The room was awesome. I had a strip view that I enjoyed when I used my remote to open the curtains also had a nice king bed. The room was nicely appointed with a great bathroom and nice smelling citrus toiletries. 

The room also had a universal remote and in my case I was in town for business so every little thing to make your life easier is awesome.

I was somewhat expecting a nightmare after reading these reviews but our stay was awesome.

We stayed W,TH & F night and with a great internet rate and resort credit for the ""Summer"" package, our room was well below $100\/night, even on Friday night which is hard to find in Vegas, let alone for a hotel of this caliber. The parking lot was a breeze. You pull in off Las Vegas Blvd and follow the signs to self parking or valet. We happened to use self and every time we returned we got a space very close to the elevator. Not hard to navigate at all.

Check-in was very quick and friendly and we had our room within a few minutes. I will say that the woman at the desk mistakenly put a CC authorization through on my CC when I told her I didn't want to charge anything but  that was an honest mistake and never showed up on the bill.


Pros:

* Great architecture. Very post modern and seemed more like a beautiful hotel that happened to have a casino instead of the other way around.

* Great scent of jasmine\/vanilla pumped into the casino. Not overpowering like at Mandalay. 

* The only place we dined in the hotel was the Breakfast Buffet and it was fine for what it was, $15. I wasn't expecting caviar and pheasant under glass. Omelet bar, multiple carving stations, pastries, view of the pools and very good service.  

* Gelato locations are great and make for a nice little break from the 105 degree weather.

* Up until the last day, this is the only casino I actually won money at so that was an added bonus.



Cons:

* Three light bulbs were actually burned out in the room but a quick phone call to the desk resulted in them all being replaced by the next day and another $25 credit so not even sure this is a con.

* While customer service was attentive and acceptable, you never get the feeling they're going out of their way to be friendly. Strictly just answer questions and that's pretty much it. People can come off as curt if they don't go the extra mile and the service here, while good, didn't go the extra ""5 star"" mile.

* Tram has different stops depending on which side you board on. One side drops you at the Aria and the other stops at either Vdara or Monte Carlo so be careful to pay attention to the signs.

* Crystal shopping area left me uninspired. Just another high end mall like you see at pretty much every upper end hotel, but designed more like a multi level shopping mall. Nothing special.

I'm giving Aria 4 stars because overall it was a great experience with minimal issues. The reason it's not getting 5 is because it just doesn't seem like a 5 star hotel. 

Whether it's the not quite 5 star service or fact that every attention to detail isn't covered 110%, it seems like they're relying on the architecture to give it that 5th star and right now it's not quite there. 

Hopefully with a little more attention to detail, they'll get that 5th star.

I would definitely return.",5,0,1

From the Lyft Bar, Front Desk, CAFE (ooh this café is THE WORST), casino staff. 
The room I had was very nice with a view of the strip. I reserved because there was a deal which included free Cirque Du Soleil tickets and a resort credit. I couldn't believe what a good deal it was. But after staying you can kind of see why they have to offer so many incentives.
The restaurant options are kind of disappointing. The café staff is rude and make you feel like a murderer if you want your food to go. Perhaps I don't want to eat in a restaurant that feels cold (and I'm not talking about temperatures). I also ate at the thai restaurant.

The free tram is sooo convenient - takes you to Bellagio which is a great place to start walking down the strip.

It's also very environmentally friendly & quiet! We didn't hear our neighbors at all during our stay. The bed was comfy and I loved the one-touch technology! It worked perfectly.

So happy we did. We checked in around 11:30a. The line was pretty long but it moved fast. There was someone to great us before we went to the counter. Check-in was fast. We walked through the casino to our elevators. I love a hotel that divides elevators based on floors. It makes everything faster. 

Our room was trendy,beautiful and spacious. Although we faced the Cosmopolitan, I wasn't mad about the view. I am a tech nerd so I loved that everything can be control electronically from the curtains, to the TV and lights. One issue, we couldn't control the temperature from the control panel but that's minor. The bed was comfortable and my favorite part about the room is the fact the bathroom toilet has a door. Oh do not touch the snack bar, I mean you can but at those prices we just went to Walgreens and got water and snacks for cheaper.

This hotel connects to Monte Carlo and has a tram to Vdara, Monte Carlo and Belligio so travel was easy. We did not eat at any of the restaurants (besides buffet) nor shop since a 5 star hotel means 5 star prices everywhere but it was nice viewer the Harry Winston jewels.  

Walking to several places on the trip was convenient from this hotel. I'm not saying every destination is convenient but a few important ones are.

I have stayed at 6 or 7 places in Vegas, from the 5 star megaresorts tot the $29 a night.  I usually like my stays, usually because I get what I pay for.  I don't check into the South Point, a decent place but not really nice, expecting the Wynn or Encore.  I am okay with that because I get the room for $35 along with some decent card playing.

I stayed here with friends this weekend and we paid a premium price because we wanted a premium experience.  Unlike the slightly less expensive Wynn, of which I have had two very good experiences, this was awful.

First, the entire place is dark.  Very dark.  The dark wood and metal design is paired with horrible lighting.  I felt like I was staying at the mole casino the entire time.

Next, everything was very spendy.   I expect spendy on the Strip, but at no point do I feel like the money was returned to me in value.  The room was small... Very small... And many of the fixtures, paneling,  and compliments were of cheap or poor quality.  It felt like the room was put together in a rushed way and there were several minor flaws.

The service was horrible.  I would assume that this far after opening, the hotel would have worked out it's kinks.  I get that it is tough to create an experience for guests but at this point, a premium hotel needs to have their ducks in a row.  The front desk made promises at checkin that were made good, uniformed staff ranged from rude to sullen and checkout didn't work at all, let alone the horribly disorganized way they store and retrieve bags.

This would be a four or five star place if I had paid a price similar to the Luxor or Mandalay Bay or Treasure Island or New York New York, but for good money, Ii expect better, period.

We were there for 5 nights\/5 days (which is longer than I thought I'd ever spend in Vegas, but we had kid coverage, so what can I say?!), which is a long enough stay to allow for an accurate assessment of Aria.

All of the details, like the room automation, combined shower\/tub 'room,' etc., are already covered ad nauseum in this post, so here's my spin on just the facts as they related to our visit.

PRO's:

-We had a friendly check-in experience (unlike  others in this forum) and even got a free 'upgrade' for our anniversary

-Gorgeous hotel, especially in the lobby and casino

-Comfortable beds

-Room automation is cool (when it works; see ""Cons"" below)

-Good onsite dining, except buffet, which was mediocre


CON's

-Housekeeping was ATROCIOUS and deserves special comment.

  -Never refilled our ice bucket, even though we had chilled wine; even left it full of water once

  -Forgot to leave ice bucket liner

  -Forgot to replace dirty glasses

  -4 light bulbs were burned out in the room, so we left a note on the ground asking that they be replaced; never happened.  We got back to the room and the maid had put our note up on the desk.  We had to call maintenance.

  -You have to actually PLACE A PHONE CALL to housekeeping to request to have your sheets cleaned.  Hey, I'm all for saving water...just not while I'm on vacation.  I go to a place like Aria, and pay their room rates, so we can be pampered and have a luxury experience.  Glad I spotted the small card so I at least knew I had to call.

  -Never cleaned out the shower.  The first day there, I noticed a dead hornet on the bench in the shower.  I figured it must have died there between room changes and the maid would get it next time.  Wrong!  So we left it there to see if they'd ever clean the shower.  As far a I know, it's still kickin' back on the bench because it was still there when we left.

Now for the other stuff:

-The room was OK.  Not even close to THEhotel.  Automation is cool, but ours didn't work properly.  Even the check-in clerk told us we were in for 'a show' when we entered our room for the first time and I had read postings about it here.  When we entered our room, nothing happened.  In fact, since we checked in late at night and the room was sealed closed, it was darker than a bat cave and we were left fumbling for switches.  The controls worked fine when used manually, but we had to leave our lights on when we left because we knew they'd never come on upon entry as intended.  (Maybe they apply their savings from not washing sheets towards their electric bill?)

-Crummy view.  Our 'upgraded' room offered a Strip view.  I suppose the Strip could be seen if I could see through the windows of the Mandarin Oriental or Vdara that sat between us and the Strip.  ""Glow of the Strip view"" is more like it.

-Play at your own risk!  At least if you like the slots or video poker.  I can't speak for the tables, but I didn't see anyone having any luck at the slots the entire time we were there.  I resorted to walking next door to the Monte Carlo to gamble. 

-Good location on the Strip, but be prepared to walk to get out

-CHECK YOUR BILL CLOSELY AT CHECK OUT!  At check in, the clerk specifically warned us to 'check our bill' when we checked out to confirm there were no unauthorized charges from the mini bar.  He warned us that you can't even pick anything up for longer than 30 seconds, or you will be charged for it.  Sure enough, when we checked out, there was a $15 charge on our bill for chocolate poker chips.  We never took a thing from the mini bar and didn't even pick anything up, but I still felt like I had done something wrong when I had to dispute the charge at the front desk.  She didn't believe us, but still reversed the charge.

I agree with an earlier reviewer that the property is gorgeous and has tremendous potential, but I left feeling less impressed than I thought I would.  I think they're still working out the kinks.  I'd have to find an amazing deal to go back.  Otherwise, I'll go elsewhere and try something new.  There are just so many options in Vegas...",0,0,0

Stayed here over the weekend for two nights.  On the first night, we noticed the remote control wasn't working and called down for a replacement.  Never received a replacement.  Then we called the next morning.  After 45 minutes of no service, we called again.  Finally someone came to look at the batteries and said that the batteries were from years ago.  Made sense because the hotel barely seemed crowded the whole weekend so perhaps not that many people stay here.  That said, they could have easily upgraded the three parties that were staying here but nope, we were all spread out among lower levels with very boring views.

The room was decent.  The bed comfy and pillows soft.  The comforter wasn't especially fluffy or comfortable.  The towels were downright scratchy and hard and uncomfortable.  I was really shocked about that.  The shower and bathtubs are nice but they could have put a little more effort into making the rest of the hotel room nicer too.

Checking in was sort of a pain because the guy helping us took forever and mumbled everything.  We never really were greeted warmly or made to feel like the hotel\/casino valued our patronage.

Stayed here last June on a business trip that was for a conference being held in the Aria.  I was very impressed with the tech in the rooms.  When you first walk in, the lights come up slowly, the curtains open and the TV comes to life.  It has a very Starship Enterprise feel about it.  As you would expect in a new, top-end, Vegas hotel, the bed was very comfortable and the towels were plush and nice.  I didn't have any need to talk with the staff, so I can't comment on some of the bad experiences others had.  My check-in was quick and courteous, though.

Overall, I would go back if it were a business trip but on my own dime I'd probably stay elsewhere.",1,0,1

We stayed at the Aria on a normal weekend, booked a double bed and checked in at 5pm on a Friday and they said that they were all out of doubles so gave us one King and they were going to provide us with a roll away bed.  The lady at the counter assured us that the roll away had a full mattress and was as comfortable as any bed and that they were going to send it up right away.    Not only was the bed FAR from being like any regular bed, the mattress itself was probably about 1\/3 as thick as any regular mattress!  Uncomfortable indeed!  Not only that, we didn't get the bed when we got into our room after we checked in, we got it after midnight after 3 follow up calls and 10 minutes spent on hold for each call!   I'm taking my business back to Wynn and Palazzo.

I know I sound like I'm bitching just from one bad experience but we met 5 other parties at the pool and they were all stuck in King bed rooms as well.

Since we were guests at the hotel, we asked to be put on the guest list for  Haze, their club. We were told that it was taken care of but when we arrived at the club, guess what, we weren't on the guest list.  We ended up getting in for free and not waiting in line only because we were a group of girls.",3,1,2

We weren't even planning on coming to Las Vegas, but our trip to Mammoth Lakes was canceled from San Francisco.  So we re-directed LV and rented a car to get to Mammoth. 

After the frustration of canceled flights and lost baggage from United, the check-in at Aria was super easy.

We got the king-room with strip views.  Floor 21. 

The room was fantastic.  Everything was as expected.  We didn't want to leave!

For this price we paid (similar to a best western off the highway) how can we complain about anything?

The attention to detail at this hotel is incredible.  Just spend a few minutes in the lobby or on the 2nd floor (where the Starbucks is and gym\/pool) and admire all the detail the designers, architects, and builders went through.  Really is tremendous.  I hope everyone that stays here can appreciate their hard work.  I can't even fathom how hard it was constructing this hotel.  The glass, marble, fountains... wall finishings....  wow.  A true work in modern architecture.  

Only complaint (or more like observation) is the casino seemed to have more smoke smell than other large casinos.  But this is Las Vegas, so some smoke should be expected.

Was between Aria or the Bellagio.  Since it was a new property, I wanted to give the Aria a shot. Hired the hotel to pick up the wife from the airport through the concierge.  Somehow that got botched and she had been waiting on the side of the curb at the airport for 30 minutes and it was raining and 50 degrees.  Called concierge and they said they could schedule a pickup later that night.  I informed them it was my honeymoon and she was on the curb.  I asked them to pull my car up and I was going to personally pick her up since airport was only 3 miles away.  I went down stairs and was told that the Valet car retrieval would take 45 minutes because of the line.  She finally took a cab, got in over an hour later.  A\/C didn't work that night, ended up getting charged for $20 on room service when we never ordered room service. Never did the hotel try to make it upto us, send a bottle of champagne, nothing.  I left bad feedback and a manager named Justin Jennetto emailed me and said he was forwarding it to the necessary dept.  I replied to his email and he never responded back.  Nor did any dept email me back.  Im contacting the American Express concierge dept (where I booked it from) to let them know my experience.  Ive stayed all over the world at 5 star resorts.

Pros
Beautiful decor, stunning
Bed feels like a cloud.
Touch screen remote for the room is fun & cool.
Smells great
Overly polite staff
Cafe Vetro is pretty yummy and open 24hrs
The City Center Tram is so convenient...it will get you to Bellagio, Monte Carlo, Crystals, and Aria, as well as the other hotels in City Center. Plus it is free and fast. You hardly ever wait.
Location - this hotel is super close to more great stuff, especially when making use of the tram.
Valet is pretty fast and very friendly
Great views from your room
Casino has a great atmosphere. 
Very eco-friendly, as others have pointed out
The alarm is cool.
Beautiful art is everywhere in the hotel.

Cons
My phone has horrible service in the room.
Room service is so friendly, but it takes forever, and our food was yummy, but not out of this world. The breakfast is best from their room service.
You can have a bit of a walk from the elevator to your room.
That fun remote and the lighting can take a little bit to figure out.

The Aria hotel is not only beautiful inside and out, but it has also renewed my faith that there ARE hotels out there who care.

I went to Aria with my company and coincidentally the trip also happened to be my 3 year anniversary.  I arranged for some amenities to be brought up to the room in honor of this special occasion.  While the coordination didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped, Aria Front Desk took charge of the matter in spades.  In their defense, my request was not very ordinary.

I think it is impossible for a service company to get everything right 100% of the time, that's why Customer Support exists.  When something goes wrong, I, as a seasoned Customer Support executive, am always eager to see how the company handles the clean up.

Aria blew my expectations out of the water.  Without going into the unnecessary details, Aria not only saved the day (and weekend), but they also created a fan out of me.  I have been telling everyone I know about this place and will continue to do so.

I have been to many hotels in Vegas and it's nice to know I don't need to jump around anymore.  I'll be staying at Aria from here on forward.",4,1,1

It took 30 minutes to check in because the guy said our room wasn't ready but we could pay more money for a downgraded room that was available. It took the manager to use his ""managers access"" to the system to give us our room. So there was a room available the whole time but we had to argue and wait for the manager to use his power to help us. 

We left the tags to our dresses on the table next to bed but housecleaning threw them away!! Without the tags we couldn't return our dresses so there goes $50. I called housekeeping and the supervisor said that they're not even allowed to take anything out of them room, including tags, even if they think it's trash. And all we got out of this mess was a note to the front desk for if we wanted to complain to them when we check out.

I had VIP service here and from start to finish it was well worth it. I felt like Donald Trump!

They sent a limo to pick me up and drop me off to the airport. While I was waiting to check in I hung out in the VIP lounge which was full of free food and drinks including wine and is open 24 hours! 

My suite was beautiful. Great view of the strip and all the luxuries of home, in fact the suite was better then my home. There is a built in sauna in the shower! The toilet was one of those smart toilets with headed seat and wash buttons. There was a dining room, living room and bar and TV's in each room. Simply amazing suite.

Casino was typical.

There's a theater where they show the Elvis Cirque Du Soleil show which is very fun to watch.

A larger room with no micro or coffee machine, 2 refrigerators; one full of overpriced items to purchase and the other was empty, a view of the roof and part of the MGM hotel.   Every morning I have to go downstairs to get coffee at starbucks which is already overpriced but because they're in the ""Aria Hotel and Casino"", I pay double the price.  Oh did I mention that the room they gave us overlooks the roof.  Im constantly seeing guys walking back and forth on the roof. Not sure if they're maintenance or not,  but a bit creepy for me.    Im studying so Im kinda stuck here in the room.  I would have taken the microwave and coffee machine over the fancy electronics.
I can wipe my own bum  thank you very much.  I dont need a fancy toilet appliance to do it for me.   I can also get up to close the curtains and turn off the lights.   This isn't something that impressed me at all.  We leave on Friday because they wouldn't honor the same price to stay until Saturday.  The convention ends at 2:00 Friday and when asked to extend check out time, we were told that it would be another $40.00. We declined of course. So on Friday I'll have to hang out in the casino until the convention is over.  We will be going someplace else Friday night, and will not be returning to the Aria hotel and casino again.  The nicest people here are the ones cleaning your room.  Gigi is a gem.  She deserves a raise.

The hotel itself is very modern and architecturally appealing. If you appreciate the design in architecture, you will understand what I mean. It didn't feel like Vegas inside; I guess it was because I'm used to the gaudiness in some of the other nicer hotels. But I like it. Simple, modern and technologically advanced. Signage seemed to be a problem as it felt like forever when trying to find the hotel lobby from the self-parking garage. I guess they only anticipated people taking taxi's or using valet upon arrival.

One complaint about checking in; a staff member had an open sign but seemed to be deeply involved with something else. ""I'll be with you in just a minute"" was more like ""I'll be with you never."" We were standing there waiting and that jerk face didn't even apologize or look up after saying anything to us, but we found someone else who was more accommodating of our presence. It was obvious she was conscious of her training as she handed me the pen, making sure the Aria logo was facing me. I'm sure once they get in the groove of things, they'll be well seasoned.

My room. The real moment of truth for me. Upon entering you have to swipe your card on the reader to unlock the door. Nice touch. I open the door and the curtains automatically open, tv and lights turn on and I am slightly amazed. It is a decently sized room for double occupancy, perfect for one. I had a king size bed and it was perfect; if two queens were in there, it might be a different story. Bathroom is gorgeous. Love dual vanity sinks. Love the oval drop in tub and shower in one enclosed area. Shower head was a little low pressured but it was fine in getting me clean and temp was perfect. Love their towels too, very soft and kind of ribbed. I understand it is a LEED certified hotel, so good for them. Closet had two robes and two luggage stands. 

Touch screen remote. Nice. And it is even personalized as it shows your name on the screen. There is a little bit of a lag when scrolling through the channel guide but I really wasn't there to watch tv. It's nice to have all those music genre options though. Oh and the alarm option, totally customizable; the best part of my stay was waking up to the curtains opening and tv turning on. Not some loud ass ringing or buzzer. That was the perfect way to get my ass out of bed being as comfortable as it was. Down filled pillows and a comfy mattress. I slept like a baby for those few hours of sleep.

Light switches on each side of the bed is great! ""Good night"" option turns off everything in the room, even closes the curtains. I love how they don't have those signs you hang on the door for privacy\/service. Just press a button and ""privacy"" lights up outside in red or ""service"" lights up in green.

Even though it is a little bit of a walk to get to the strip, I'd stay here again, especially since I'm excited to check out the new club Haze and Eve at Crystals. To give you an idea, it took me about 15 minutes to walk from hotel lobby to bellagio. Although, I suppose I could've taken the tram at Crystals. Walking allows you to check out the exterior views of the City Center and all its glass.",7,4,4

They have a bathtub\/shower combo which was something I had never expereinced in a hotel and think it is a great idea. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend. 

Despite the five star rating, I had issues with the following:
1. They provided Wi-Fi for 2 days and then you have to pay for it, that should be included for free, for the duration of the stay. Also, the signal would go in and out on my iPhone and iPad that should be improved. 
2. The room service would come later and later it seemed each day, One day our room was not cleaned until 1PM. That is not acceptable.
3. The fridge was stocked full and if you remove an item, even briefly, you are charged. They should have an empty one, that is not $28 dollars per day.

Or else I don't think that we could have afforded the room on our own.  My first question is, what does Aria mean?  I found out.  It means the expressive melody.  And someone told me it also means the center.  The owners...MGM decided since it is located in the center of their many other properties, they would call it Aria.  Then everything started to make sense to me.  The design is sleek and whispy, beautiful and elegant.  As you enter the front, the water fountain is so pleasing to the eye.  I agree with others that the lobby doesn't have that gross smoke smell.  

The rooms:
You are supposed to show your key card to the staff before you enter to the elevators.  My guess is to keep the party scene down?  We were located down a super long hallway.  It was kind of annoying when we had to go places, especially in heels.  The room itself was nice.  The beds are comfortable.  I liked the bathroom a lot.  Frosted glass door for the toilet and see threw glass for the shower.  Ooohh lala!  There is a control panel next to the bed that controls EVERYTHING!!!  Kind of cool.

Hotel:
The hotel has a lot of nice restaurants.  My favorite was the Five50 pizza place.  The wedding chapel was very lovely.  Casino is to the point.  My all time favorite thing about Aria's casino was the ATM machine that breaks change.  I seriously wish these were everywhere when I need to break some change.

Pool: 
I reviewed the pool.  It is okay, not my favorite.  My favorite so far is MGM, Monte Carlo and Ceasars.  Just because they are so grand.

I've stayed at MGM, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Venetian, but ARIA has topped them all by far! I love love love this hotel which has, obviously, worked out its kinks from its opening month. 

First of all, the AROMA throughout the valet, lobby and casino floor is absolutely amazing! It is a smell which I cannot explain, but it does a great job at masking the cigarette smoke smell. 

Valet is quick, check-in was speedy as they had numerous lines open. The staff is helpful and professional. Took about 10 minutes to have our luggage brought up.

The casino itself may seem small, but most people don't see that it is divided by a bar and it continues in the back. The slots REALLY PAY out! MegaBucks has been hit here 2x within 4 months and those ""wheel of fortune"" slots have ""Spins"" hit a ridiculous amount of times! The casino floor is very exciting on weekends!

Their rooms are absolutely gorgeous with full walls of glass, spacious bathrooms with large spa-tub and separate toilet, and THE MOST COMFORTABLE BED YOU WILL EVER SLEEP ON! This has got to be the only bed where I actually sleep through the entire night without tossing and turning at all.

It has many yummy restaurants along with a Jean Philippe Patisserie famous for its chocolates and desserts. Their Thai restaurant, Lemongrass, is open til 2am daily. Aria is also conveniently located within steps of Crystals and the Marquee nightclub!

Comfort: the mattress and bedding were amazing! Modern and stylish design. The modern push button lighting was confusing but there is a master button to turn everything off. 
Value: everything is expensive here, but if you pack well it helps. There is a walgreens nearby; I suggest shopping there for water and essentials. 
Service: exceptional! Housekeeping especially. I want to write a letter in fact. I was so pleased with especially one, Tyiesa. She turned my room for me when I was feeling sick. What a wonderful person!! 
Cabanas: awesome deal on the weekdays! $200 gets you a server in your own private area for the whole day. It is stocked with waters and snacks and fruit and vegetables. 
Check in: fast and efficient.
Check out: a breeze! 
Convenience: centrally located on the strip.

Let me say that the girl who made our reservation on the phone for us was great. She even gave us an upgrade to our room to a street view. But here is where it all went down hill. When we arrived at 11am at Aria Mar 9, we paid for early check in. Not only did we did not get the early check in, we also didn't get the room upgrade we were given. They asked us if we can wait 40 min for our room to be ready, they will text us when it is ready. 1 hour 30 minutes later, they still haven't text us so we had to wait in the ridiculously long check in line again to see if our room is ready. When we got to the counter, the lady gave us an attitude while checking if the room was ready, made us wait another 10 min before we got our room. Now that we got our room, I thought finally, is all smooth from here on! Nope, wrong again. The refridgerator didn't work so I couldn't keep my medicine cool. we called front desk about it. 2 hours later, nothing, So i decided to keep my medicine in an ice bucket. called and 4 hours later still nothing. Is someone even working here? Ok fine, I'l keep the medicine in the ice bucket. Then on Mar 11, My fiancee and I went to our wedding, our room was a mess so we ask the housekeeping to clean at 12pm. We got back to the room at 6pm, our room was still a mess. Ok, at least we have dinner to go to, so we called housekeeping again at 6pm then went to dinner. We came back at 10:30pm, guess what? Our room is still a mess!!! REALLY? no one cleaned our room in 10 and half hours? So we called housekeeping AGAIN. They said we are almost there getting to our room. REALLY? you need 10+ hours to clean a room. A housekeeping girl finally got to our room at 11:45 ish. By the time they finish cleaning, is 12:30am. Great, ruin our wedding night why don't you?

DON'T STAY AT ARIA. Their service are horrible and they don't care. All they did was apologize then charged us our bill. They only care they get their money. They don't value you as a customer!

I came here on Memorial Day weekend, so it was super busy. Busy enough that they didn't have time to fulfill our requests (we needed a roll-away bed). The service and management was terrible that weekend, though I couldn't really hold it against them - they were the new kids on the block and they probably still weren't used to hosting so many people!! If I were to go back tomorrow, I'd expect a lot more from them. 

The rooms are really nice, with a nice comfy bed!...I think. I didn't spend very much time in it :) The bathrooms are pretty with a shower and tub behind glass doors. 

I spent quite a bit of time at the casino, it being my first time in Vegas since turning 21!! =) I didn't gamble though. I sat in to watch my friend play blackjack, and then poker. The casino staff are very friendly to spectators. The casino is nice and new and pretty. As is the pool area!

I've stayed at this property since going to Las Vegas has become sort of a ""hobby"" for my girlfriend and I. Anyways, some quick tips and then to a comprehensive review.

QUICK TIPS! QUICK TIPS! QUICK TIPS!

1. Parking is plentiful. After Harmon Way, there is an inlet for Crystals, Mandarin Oriental, and for Aria! 

2. Instead of parking on the second floor of the parking structure, try parking on the THIRD FLOOR! That gives you direct access to the walkway to the casino and saves you an elevator trip.

3. The 20 dollar tip trick has held true for me here. If you don't know what it is, it's a check-in trick that allows you to get a ""complementary"" upgrade from whoever checks you in.

4. If you're going to Vegas for a specific reason--Bachelorette party, first time in Vegas, wedding anniversary, relationship anniversary, etc.--mention this when booking in the comment section and mention it again when you're checking in. It pays to be excited! They might be able to comp you some shows or send you up a dessert platter on the house.

5. If you're looking for a quick bite, Jean Phillipe is just downstairs to the right of the elevators. No fancy chocolate fountain, but a smaller wait and less tourists taking photos.

6. There is a tram that has three stops: 1. Monte Carlo\/Parking lot of the Aria, which is really the entrance to the casino on the third floor of the parking structure; 2. Crystals for shopping, also has the best direct entrance to the check-in area, 3. Bellagio\/Vdara, both are accessible from that location

7. Turn down service! Request this and you get some awesome chocolates and nice comfy slippers. Pretty standard at most hotels, but at Aria it feels like a treat. Really romantic for couples. :)


Now the real deal, the big review.

I love the Aria. I won't ever cheat on the Aria as long as they can still serve up the fantastic room deals that they usually have. We just got back yesterday from our trip and we were able to book at $95 a night with $100 Food and Beverage credit. Look for the deals and avoid the upsell. You can easily tip the person checking you in a $20 to secure a higher floor with view or even if you go all out a panoramic corner suite. This is what me and my girlfriend was able to get to! We had an awesome person check us in early in the afternoon who hooked us up majorly.

Anyways, this hotel is my favorite place to stay because of the service, the decor, the rooms, and the gaming area. In terms of service, it's a big deal for me to see people actually greet you in the morning with a genuine smile. I know that it's difficult to work in the service industry, but I've never had a really bad complaint about the service. Sure, sometimes the shampoo is a little low or a robe never makes it back from the laundry. However, whenever we complained about any housekeeping detail, the staff has been incredibly apologetic and willing to bend over backwards to make it right for us.

Next, I want to say that the rooms are lavish and the bed is fantastic. To be honest, the bed feels like sleeping on a cloud with all that padding. Sometimes though I find the bed to be too soft (First World Problems, I know!) and I end up aching a bit. But, the rooms have been designed with some comfort in mind. I love the shower\/tub design that most resort rooms are fitted with. I'm not so much a fan of how the corner suites are set up, but that's another issue because they are still incredibly comfortable.

For me, another thing that makes the Aria stand out is how awesome the decor is. It feels very modern, clean, and very comfortable. The subtle and unmistakeable vanilla smell radiates throughout the casino floor. It made me want to get an ice cream! The other thing that I've noticed is that the smell of smoke is really well contained in the Aria. This also brings me to the next point about the gaming area, I've never had any problems with the dealers or finding a cocktail waitress. In fact, most of the time I've had them come within five or so minutes of me sitting down or have had them come by multiple times. Even during the down times in mid day or late morning, there was nothing that caused me to believe that we wouldn't get good service. Furthermore, the tables and chairs are all comfortable and the slot chairs are well padded!

I've had nothing but very positive experiences with the Aria, and I can't wait to get back there again sometime in the future!",10,1,1

This time around i decided to try out this hotel because it has a modern personality and it was very beautiful.  We got in around 10:30 in the morning and there was already a line for guest to check in.  I walked up the front desk and told the front desk representative that I had a reservation.  The front desk representative told me everything about the hotel which was great and i was happy to hear that he was trying to help me out in every way.  As soon as we got the hotel key, we went up the elevator and walked into our room.  As soon as we walked in, I was amazed.  The view was beautiful since we were on the 27th floor.  The room was marvelous and the bathroom was a little small but it was ok.  They have 2 sinks, The bathtub and the shower is together so you can do both at the same time.  We got a king size bed and it was very huge.  Everything is all touch, meaning, you can control the tv, window screen, air temperature, lights with just a touch.  
The only bad thing is that if you do touch the mini bar or move things and put it back, it will record it and will be charged for that item.  You can not put anything inside the mini bar or else they will charge you $50 dollars.  Also the wi-fi in the room was very slow.
Other then that it was perfect.  We will come back to stay at this resort again.",4,2,1

We were celebrating his birthday so naturally I wanted to stay in a nice hotel. 
It had been years since we both had been in sin city and Aria had not been built yet. 

It is definitely a beautiful hotel.
As soon as you walk up, you notice the beautiful details of a waterfall.

When you first walk in the aroma of cigarette smoke does not overwhelm you like in some casinos on the strip. It is clean and bright which I loved. 

...Then you notice the long check in line. Which of course is to be expected at a popular hotel on the strip, the line when smoothly and probably as quickly as possible. 

The staff was courteous and friendly and got us checked in and on our way. The elevators are grouped up by floors which is nice, they also have someone manning the elevators checking for key cards, which is great, but it almost seems like it'd be more updated if the elevators had a key card security slot like I've seen in other hotels.

We stayed on the 20th floor and our room was SOO Far from the hotel. You would think there'd be more than one elevator for the floor, but there isn't and it was literally a trek from the elevator to our room. 

When we got to our room. The lights were off, the curtains were closed. And it took us a minute to find switches to everything, as everything is controlled by a little mini control screen. 

When we finally got everything on, we were greeted by a beautiful view of the strip. 

Our room was smaller than I pictured from the pictures. The bathroom was nice. The separate 
soaking tub was a really nice touch which we used every night we were there. We got two robes and slippers. Housekeeping was prompt to bring us toothpaste and an extra pair of slippers when I called down. 

Housekeeping was also excellent at keeping our room neat and tidy which I appreciated. They tidy''d our room in the morning and did a turn down service at night. Chocolates and all.

The pool of the Aria was wonderful. We spent a few hours down there lounging around. I wish there were more shady spots available as the Vegas sun was beaming down on most areas. It'd be nice if they had more umbrella's available. 

We also got two free buffet meals. We used it for dinner on a friday night. If it weren't free I would definitely pass on the buffet.

The biggest complaint about our stay was check out. We checked out on a sunday morning. I understand lines are going to be long. But you would think with a hotel so up to date and a room completely controlled by a remote, you should be able to review your bill on your TV screen and check out through there. I've been to much lower end hotels such as hilton and can check out from my room. The line was long and although they tried to go quickly it was a tad annoying that that was our only means to checking out. There was a person going around with an ipad asking if people wanted to express check out with them, but they didn't go down the line in any sort of fashion so they never even asked me and skipped me, which annoyed me even more. 

Other than that, our stay was pleasant, and we would stay here again.",1,0,0

It has floor to ceiling windows with great views of part of the strip. The best while relaxing in the tub.

The pools were nice, really warm since they're directly in the sun. A drink from the pool bar is a must! It was kind of crowded toward later afternoon, but still room to enjoy. There's an option to buy\/reserve lounge chairs for the day ($40\/e), but its not needed as there are plenty of chairs available.

There are complaints about smoking (in a freaking casino).. and lack of Christmas decorations.. and the prices in the restaurants. Some people are too ridiculous for their own good. I'll try to write this review from a more sane point of view! 

Service\/checkin: I've encountered many awful check in experiences at the Venetian YEARS after they opened. I stayed at Aria just 2 weeks after opening day and had a great, smooth experience. 10 minute wait? On NYE? Am I in heaven? Honestly quickest Vegas checkin experience I've ever had and this was on NYE! The girl seemed nervous that was checking me in (she didn't have her speech fully memorized yet), but she was sweet and tried hard. She even bumped us up to a higher floor with better views without asking.

Room: Amazing! I love modern and this place was built for me. Loved the bathrooms, loved the views, loved the amazing remote control thingy. Most of all - I loved the beds. Honestly the best hotel bed I've stayed at in all of Las Vegas. Sheets couldn't be softer, and I adored the mattress. 

Food\/Amenities: During our limited one night stay I can't say much other than WOW. We had a slightly disappointing experience at Julian Serrano, but I can tell Aria has major potential. Beautiful casino, awesome sportsbook, tons of incredible eateries. I look forward to coming back for more! 

I can't honestly say one negative thing about the service, room, etc. Some people are too picky for their own good.",22,19,13

The Aria Hotel in Vegas is so well staffed with so many people who were of immediate help I cannot begin to name them all and it would not be fair to those I forgot. David and Maria would be safe bets.

Hotel rooms in Las Vegas do not get any better than the Aria, (except Mirage and MGM Signature) so if your going to spend wild money spend it at the ARIA. The cost is not much more than any other nice hotel. 

About the hotel room. Extremely Quiet! No slamming doors and housekeeping is so quiet you never knew they were there! Room temp is NOT controlled by their iPad it is controlled on the wall, and it is NOT in Fahrenheit it usually reads Celsius! So 21 is a good number!! [Bet 21 for me] You will LOVE their digital scale in the bathroom! I only weigh 72 Kilos!!! WOO HOO!!! During our trip we went to see Celine Dion and she is fantastic! But the filthy carpets at Caesars' Palace is fairly inexcusable. I was so ELATED we were NOT staying at any Cesar's operation.

About the casino - I did play everything the casino offered over a five day period and I did win a LOT. On slots and on card games. They have the fairest old school rules if you bet a bit high - like $20 bets. I left even but I played a LOT with $6k and I mean a LOT! So that's good-I played for hours ultimately for FREE. Mostly recouped and saved myself at blackjack though. The slots are totally fun, most new and many cool themes. My assistant got me hooked on ""Game of Thrones"" which actually did pay out nicely beyond being mesmerizing. 

The Casino ventilation is VERY powerful so smokers are not that big a deal and they also have non smoking rooms for the ultra sensitive. Rooms are just gorgeous and just about any view is dynamite. The pillow were the best pillows I EVER slept with and they DO sell them down stairs and On-Line. They KNOW their pillows rock! They are also reasonably priced\/ Clocks in room both have USB ports to charge phones so there is less competition for sockets. [Whew] They have beautiful stores so GET UOP when your ahead and go buy yourself something you would NEVER ordinarily buy! Then return and work with your budget again. 

There IS a Starbucks there! I met MANY card game acquaintances and got to know them better. Perhaps it is good to be dragged out of my little kingdom for COFFEE!

One of Aria's best attributes (beyond its very nice educated staff) is it is within small walking distance to most everything. Like I was able to walk to Bellagio and if I did not want the short walk they gave a cute ""Aria Tran."" We were also able to just walk to the Team Mobile Arena to see ""Imagine Dragons."" So that was awesome--a few steps and wallah! We are in our second row seats! 

I was with MLife which is a MyVegas program and I am considered highest level at MyVegas. I was allowed SIX. In part, because I did buy some chips over a period of five months. This is the first time I was actually able to REDEEM my loyalty points to SEE if MyVegas really is worth playing back at home or wherever I travel. I was VERY skeptical and felt it would be a nightmare and not worth my valuable time. 

Short answer? HECK YES! I was able to be compted two nights at Aria, compted breakfast for two at Aria, took a Maverick Helicopter ride at night for two and was picked up and dropped off in a limo all as part of the Maverick experience all compted. We met GREAT people on our voyage! (How do you spell compted?) I am a bestselling author so I should know-but I don't. MYVEGAS an M-Life program DOES WORK and IS WORTH IT!!! In fact my card got us past long long lines I felt really guilty about skipping! Mainly at check in and oddly at Bellagio. We also had compted (free) dinner buffet for two at Bellagio. The Aria buffet is out of this WORLD! The Bellagio Buffet was all cold food and that just made like nice prime rib and mashed potatoes not so enticing to enjoy eating. The Aria ALL food that is supposed to be HOT was HOT! And the variety truly endless! I give them the best Buffet award and Mirage gets the second Buffet Award. [I went to just about every buffet in town BTW] And guess what? I also redeemed the $100 FREEPLAY reward (as long as I had a three night stay) which I did.

I will say a bit more advice about MyVegas Tips and M-Life Tips. TRY to plan your MyVegas rewards usually 90 days ahead of time and read the expiry dates before ordering! TRY to use them in the same vicinity such as all at the same hotel if possible. We had so many [14 total] we had to redeem from walk able places-such as dinner for two at Bellagio. The few we did not bother to redeem from MyVegas and gave up on was because reality said we were tired and not worth cab fare to go all across town just to redeem some free meal. The best offers are Mon-Thurs and I also find the BEST time to enjoy myself.",0,0,0

The view of the strip is fantastic!  Most of all I LOVED the automatic curtains and control tablet that allows you to control virtually EVERYTHING in your room.  There is a good morning setting that opens the curtains and turns on the music and there is a sexy goodnight setting that closed the curtains and turns on relaxing, sexy music.  Nice Touch!!!  The shower and bathtub set up is pretty cool too. 

 Is the Aria worth the price?? Absolutely not!  Apart from the few perks in the room this hotel really doesn't have much going for it in my opinion.  There is no food court to speak of and everywhere you can go to eat is exceptionally high priced and lacking in flavor to say the very least.  If the dining options were at least good it would be different, but the food just wasn't good.  The pool area is nice, but the cocktails are outrageously priced $32 for a 32 ounce pitcher of mojito, yikes!  Too much for a mixed drink if you ask me.

The Place: Location is utterly perfect, next to Bellagio, across the Strip from Planet Hollywood, close to everything else. City Center is a flat-out beautiful space. Ostentatiously spacious with soaring ceilings, gorgeous floors and lots of other fine fixtures in between. Art, art, art everywhere, some of it really good.

The Hotel: We arrived at 5 pm on Saturday and did not have to wait in line to check in. At a couple other times during our stay, there were some lines at check-in\/out, most noticably at about 11:30 on Tuesday morning.  The elevators are separated into banks for the differrent floor levels, which makes the rides quicker. Never waited for an elevator. The room was spacious, well-appointed, clean (it better be for a 6-month-old hotel). One complaint: Someone on the staff had obviously used the room to smoke pot in just prior to our arrival. Bedspread sat on, hand towel used, wrapper from a spray-can of air freshener in the trash. Front desk offered to move us, but the view was so nice, we stayed. The remote-controlled-everything was fun after a bit of figuring out. Very nice bathroom with separate WC and walk-through shower to the soaking tub. Excellent room overall.

The Casino: Well-designed, spacious, plenty of tables for everything (I hate slot machines, but there were a million). $10 limits during the day, up to $15 at night. Friendly dealers. Not as smoky as most. 

The Restaurants: Skip the buffet. As noted above, I got it free, but still not very good, except for the desserts. Best bet is the Jean Paul Patisserie--great sandwiches and sweets.

The Pool: Plenty of space, three big pools and three big hot tubs. Am I still a little kid or is it too much to ask for water somewhere in one of those pools that is more than 3.5 ft. deep? There were lifeguards.

The Staff: All very polite and competent, just not very ""friendly.""

Bottom line: I'd go there again and again if it was free every time.",2,2,1

Beautiful architecture, state of the art technology, and friendly staff. We checked in fairly quickly, got to our rooms, and after a few minutes of fiddling with the technology I had it figured out pretty quickly. I would have to say that the people complaining about the technology probably didn't figure out how to do it right. I had trouble for a little while too, but most of it is just common sense and having the patience to think about it for more than a second.

The stores connecting are beautiful and professional. The Aria buffet has very good food and it's conveniently located right in the center of the strip. However, the entrance to this casino is a little bit confusing and probably took my party 20 minutes to find. We went to every entrance but the grand entrance. You should enter through Las Vegas Blvd., FYI.

All in all, a good stay. Beautiful hotel with friendly staff.",2,1,1

One thing I knew was this hotel holds a ton of people. On past visits, I was able to skip the line and do a mobile check in or wait in VIP. This time around, I didn't have that luck after my initial check in, which still took quite a lot of time. When I made the reservation, they told me they would give me an upgraded room and send something up to welcome my party. None of this happened. 

Also, I had requested connecting rooms. My first two rooms that we checked into on Thursday night were connecting but the other 3 rooms were not connecting and not even on the same floor. With this many rooms in the Aria, I would think this would be a simple request. Not the case. When I went to help my friends check in the following day, they made us wait in an extremely long line for nearly an hour. If I were going back to Vegas in the near future, I would stay anywhere else. Palazzo, Cosmopolitan, Bellagio... They make checking in easy. The Aria hasn't got it down yet.

When we got there they said no rooms were available. For a hotel with 40+ floors and no room available was mind boggling! They told him they would text him when the room was ready and we could leave our baggage and go walk around. We hung out and called back around 4pm and was told after being on hold forever that the room was ready. Once we got into the room my husband told me to go check out the bathroom. He's blonde. I'm brunette. I walk in there and noticed a whole bunch of brunette stray hairs! Stray hairs all over the sink. Stray hairs on the ground. That was the first time I stepped into the bathroom so I know it wasn't mine! Since I'm a neat freak I always bring cleaning wipes so instead of making a big stink I just cleaned it all up by myself. My husband later got his text at 9pm! What the heck? If we would've waited for them we would've gotten in our room at 9p!!! I called the front desk and spoke with Stephanie to request a late check out at least due to all these problems which is the most they can do and she said the latest they could check me out was at 1p no exception. Horrible experience. Not as upscale and organized as they should be. Customer service is horrible. Stay elsewhere. We stayed at the mandarin last time and it was beyond awesome!

He completely ignored us in order to service as he told us 'the VIP guests staying at the hotel towers'.

Pros - 
1) Really large hotel rooms.  You aren't tripping over each other if you are traveling with someone as these rooms are very spacious.  Everything is High Tech including how you open the curtains, turn off the lights and TV and let the outside world know if the room needs to be cleaned or not.  
2) Workout facilities are including in the resort fee and they don't disappoint in this area - the equipment rivals what I have at Sports Club LA\/San Francisco, so I was right at home on everything they had and they have a lot.  Color scheme is very contemporary throughout the hotel and it's visually engaging everywhere you look. 
3) Pool area was not crowded - didn't expect it to be in November, but it was actually in the 70s when we were there so it also wasn't out of the question if you wanted to use it.
4) Location - surprisingly central to where you want to go and has a free tram that goes up or down LV Blvd so it was pretty easy and being set back, you weren't treated to the usual strip clubs card delivery you get when walking up\/down the Strip and really no one asking for spare change in the area.
5) Smells clean - they are pumping in scented air to kill the smoke - a positive for me.
Cons
1) Bathroom had a weird combo tub shower area, probably more of a drawback for whomever has to clean it as if you take a shower, the tub area gets wet and needs to be cleaned whether you use it or not.
2) Resort Fee - really?  Not necessary.  This isn't Motel 6, so you don't need to up charge the Resort based on price paid for the room
3) Food - no real deals in this place - everything is pricey, so you will have to travel out or go to the Cosmopolitan next door for a better priced food offering, but everything we ate there was very good.
4) Gaming area - could use more variety of machine options and some lower priced table stakes.

- The king sized bed was really comfortable
- Spa was good

The Bad:
- It smelled like a 50 year old woman's perfume every time you walked in.
- The design of the hotel SUCKED. You had to walk forever to get anywhere. 
-  Hotel room bathroom was horrible. Separate toilet room, but you could see through the glass, so it served NO purpose, no counter space, the bath was inside the shower, the shower was slippery, and water pressure was weak sauce.
- Had to stay in a single King bed room after repeatedly requesting two queens and even calling the night before we arrived, and they never sent us a promised rollaway bed on the first night.
- Calling downstairs was impossible. Nobody answered half the time and when they did, we had to wait for up to 45 minutes.
- Concierge closes at 9pm.
- We waited around 45 minutes for our car to come back from the valet
- They had a ""multimedia center"" that had tons of different types of plugs (including USB), but was NOT iPod compatible.

When we were transferred to the store, the clerk couldn't tell us how much it cost and hung up on us.

Granted they moved me to another room but all I got out of being inconvenienced and a headache was a $50 room credit. Really? My wife got dizzy and coughed for 20 minutes.

Okay, the good.

As an invited guest, check in is a snap. There is a little desk next to the main one.

Self park entrance is on the LEFT as you drive into the city center street.

There are more parking spaces on the 3rd and 4th floors.

Once you get into the casino proper, go to the back wall (directly across from the entrance from self park) and follow it to the left for a short cut to guest elevators and lobby.

The rooms are a little too high tech for their own good.

Everything is operated by buttons: lights, shades, TV.

When you walk into the room, hit the Master On button to at least see what is around you.

The alarm clock is a touch screen control panel next to the bed.

I made the mistake of turning it around to look at it at 4:30AM (to see what time it was) and it turned everything in the room on, including opening the shades.

So, word to the wise, be very cautious when touching the device lest you trigger that master on switch.

The minibar is sensor activated meaning, if you pick up an item to look at the label, you are charged for it. Even if you put it back.

I locked the minibar and bought my supplies at CVS and ABC Store.

I had gotten a pretty good deal on the room through the MLife players club, and while Aria is usually well out of my price range, between the deal and splitting the cost of the room, it worked out to be reasonable.

Now I have a problem: We had such a good time at Aria that I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to convince him to stay anywhere else.

Our room was comfortable and had a beautiful view of the mountains, which now that I think of it is better than a Strip view in a lot of ways. The room had a nice 42"" tv that was clutch for basketball-viewing (we were there for March Madness) when we didn't feel like dealing with the crowds in the sports books and bars.

We didn't eat a lot on property, except a morning breakfast at the Buffet (highly recommended). We primarily frequented the bar just outside the race and sports book, where if you play $0.75 a hand at video poker or blackjack, you can get comped drinks. It's also conveniently located to the Skybox walk-up window when you need some munchies - although pricey at $6, the french fries are actually quite good.

So why didn't give Aria five stars? Well, everything is on the pricey side - but that's what you expect from Vegas. The problem with Aria is that in Las Vegas terms, it's in the middle of nowhere. From the casino floor, you're about a 10-15 minute walk from anywhere you might want to go, and 20-30 minutes from most of the places you actually do want to go. For a weekend, this isn't a biggie, but we were there almost a week - over time, all that walking adds up.

Bottom line, of course I'd stay here again, given the right deals and such. I just wish it was closer to...well, anything.",4,2,2

Thanks to Players Club I was able to secure a Friday and Saturday night at $139. 

First, the registration desk setup.  Absolute chaos and every man for himself.  There is no organized line, just a mob of people standing in clumps in front of the desk.  Dear Aria management, please visit The Palazzo to observe how to do guest check-in correctly.  We checked in at 7 PM, not too late, but apparently they had run out of all two-queen deluxe rooms for the night.  Except for ONE on the 5th floor.  Lies.
____________________

Okay, I'm sure you've seen pictures of the rooms.  Or read the other reviews of the rooms, the decor and carpets, etc...blah blah, but let me break it all down to the bare bones for you because MGM Mirage wants you to believe they operate a property with what they practically describe as the second coming of Jesus hotel rooms, claiming to be the new standard in Las Vegas luxury.  You know what it is?  It's a bunch of crock.

Let's see how ""the new standard in Vegas luxury"" stacked up to my rather lukewarm expectations:

1-2-3- Go!

You would think before opening the hotel to make it presentable, they would power wash the exterior of the building.  But no.  Our ""floor to ceiling"" panorama windows had a thick film of dirt on it, evidently grime left behind from when the Resort was under construction a few months ago.

In room touch-remote technology that everyone raves about was neat to play with at first, but it really is not anything spectacular.  The fun & cool factor wears off rather quickly, and later actually becomes a pain in the ass to use.

Bed? Sumptuous and silky at first when you plop down on it, but you'll wake up with that hangover joined to an unexpected lower backache.  The mattress is TOO soft with not enough back support for anything longer than a 2 hour nap.

Not to mention at 520-sq. ft., the size of these ""luxury"" rooms are like maid's quarters in comparison to the standard fare offered at Encore (700 sq. ft.) and The Palazzo (720 sq. ft.) --- and these latter two properties are three years older.

The biggest gripe I had with the room was primarily with the bathroom.  TERRIBLY designed.  Just awful.  First: the bathroom door.  It's this cumbersome giant sliding wooden pocket door.  You want some privacy? Go lug on this massive block of wood on sliding hinges.  Repeat in opposite direction to open it.  Are we in goddamn Imperial China?  Just install a regular f*cking door for crying out loud.

Second, the sink water pressure shoots out so forcefully that it jettisons water EVERYWHERE immediately upon contact with your hands.  WTF??!  Literally, just rinsing my hands with the faucet on half-power resulted in the counter, mirror and bath amenities soaking wet.  Not exaggerating.  So you can imagine washing my face in the morning wasn't particularly pleasant.  I had face-wash foam splattering back onto the front of my t-shirt and into my hair.

Third, as an obvious decision to save space rather than sensible approach to design, the designers tucked the soaking tub INSIDE the enclosed shower stall, in the very back.  Uh.

Lastly, the partition that separates the toilet from the rest of the bathroom is a frosted glass panel that you can TOTALLY see through.  What the hell is the effing point of having a closed-off toilet area if you can see friend ""X"" taking a fat dump behind a wall made of glass while brushing your teeth at the sink?
____________________

Called down to the front desk THREE TIMES to report a broken lock on the sliding bathroom door and if they could send someone up to fix it.  Every instance, they said they would send someone up immediately. Nobody showed up for all three requests. Oh yeah, and each time I called down, I was on put on HOLD for at least 15 minutes, often times leaving it on speaker phone, and left the room for a smoke and returned unsurprised when greeted with the usual ""Thank you for holding. All of our front desk representatives are currently busy. Your call will be answered shortly."" F THAT.

Service across the board is dismal and not cordial for a self-proclaimed upscale hotel.  Seriously, do NOT book Aria if you're looking for 5-star service, attention, and friendliness.  The hotel may be new, but that's all you're getting.  Eye candy.

The very few upsides to our stay: maid service was flawless.  I know maid service is so basic and nothing should go wrong, but it seems to happen all the time to other people, and once in a blue moon, myself.  Thankfully, we had no issues here.

Cocktail service is also quick and comes around frequently in the casino. So kudos to that.

I'm glad I was able to stay and say that I've experienced Aria.  But I'll just continue to play it safe and stick with The Palazzo and The Venetian.",20,17,7

The hotel itself is very visually appealing and the vibe is somewhat less casino-esque than most other hotels on the strip. However, be prepared to fork over a pretty penny on anything City Center related. With that being said, I expected significantly more than what we actually got.

The check -in process was quick and painless and our room was ready significantly earlier than expected (around noon on the day we arrived). However upon enter the room we were greeted with a distinct cigarette smell in this non-smoking room. In addition, it appeared that housekeeping wasn't very attentive as there was dust everywhere and the floors were dirty to the point of very obvious hair and dirt visible in the bathrooms. Most of the furniture was also stained. The master bathroom toilet's ""electronic"" functions did not work and there was a major crack in the metal hinge on the door. Also, the sinks are terrible (they look nice but...) as the splash water everywhere. The tub also leaves something to be desired. The views, however, were nice and we also enjoyed turndown service.

The facade with multiple water features and soaring curved glass is spectacular.  That's where the splendor ended for us, everything else about ARIA is simply just ""ok"".  Casino floor never really seemed crowded, even late at night. Staff is decently friendly and helpful. Here'a a little more:

PROS
- Relatively spacious rooms that have great linens, awesome automated features (curtains, etc) always really clean (housekeeping does a great job - also really great toiletries 
- More than 4,000 rooms and it was sold out while we were there, but yet it never felt terribly crowded
- Pretty central on the strip to lots of things including a tram that loops beween ARIA, Bellagio, Monte Carlo, and the Crystals (high end shopping mall)
- Beautifully appointed space throughout - modern yet classic, just chic enough without being overboard - and none of that themed crap so many of the other casino\/hotels have going on
- Reliable and fast valet parking (""Free"" meaning included in the mandatory ""Resort Fee"" you pay daily)

CONS
- No in-room coffee makers
- Super sensitive automated mini-bars with sensors - if you accidentally bump something it charges to your account
- AC in rooms doesn't work all that well (especially on 115 degree days), leaving it too warm to sleep comfortably
- Pools are quite small, but do seem to have lots of seating (although the lounge chairs are all really close together)
- Check in takes forever and lines seem to be never-ending

Tons of restaurants to choose from, although most are quite pricy. If you wanted to, you could stay on the hotel premises your entire visit and never leave. 

Included in the daily $25 resort fee tacked onto your daily rate (per room, not per person), you get ""access"" to the pools (most of them), gym. WiFi and also ""free"" valet parking....but when you valet park, they never ask for your room or if you're staying, so really anyone could park for free. 

In sum, ARIA is ok, but with all of the competition in Vegas, I'd hope my dollars would go a bit further.",6,0,1

You also get private check in, away from the crowds in the main lobby, also a plus.
The suite was gorgeous, but after a while we realized the room temps were at 80 degrees plus, and would not go down. We called the concierge and they said they were having a\/c issues. We changed to another Sky Suite, but the temps in there never got below 75 degrees. So we were pretty hot the whole time, inside and outside. 
Another issue was housekeeping never came one day, even though we had the 'service please' button on all day. 
The sinks in the bathroom are so shallow that water splashes out when you run the faucet. 
On the plus side, bathroom was gorgeous, and the toilet seat was heated. The toilet also had a built in 'bidet', where you could wash and dry your front or back, if you know what I mean. (this is a family friendly site!! lol)
We went to see Viva Elvis at the theater, show was excellent and the theater was very plush. We ate at the buffet one night and the food was very good.

After arriving through the private Sky Suite gates for check in is where the ultimate in pampering really started. The hotel it self and service was top notch. Everyone fullfills your every need. The suite offered every ammintie from a hugh bar which was stocked with our favs to the 4 flat TV's through out, to the massive 8 seat dinnig table to the three bathrooms you could choose from and the best part of it all....The view of course (56th floor) was AMAZING!

Shaun, our concierge from the start of reservations, really made sure the suite had everthing we needed to feel at home and enjoy. From the custom engraved welcome bottle of JW Blue to the simplist of thing as a can of Kodiac (which the hotel does not carry anywhere in its hotel) some how 2 cans were at the bar awaiting for us. When something like that gets arranged for you, you know Aria and the staff are there for you! Thanks Shaun!!!!

Reserving a Sky Suite intitles you to enjoy the privacy of the Sky Pool, which is a private pool ""just"" for Sky Suite guests. This area's amminities are what set this area aside from the other GA pools. See Ryan at the pool's front desk to get the best seat in the house.

The hotel is gigantic and beautiful to look at- lots of massive, dramatic art, giant chunks of granite and walls of glass, etc.  In one restaurant the dividers between the banquettes were made of cross sections of huge wasps' nests.  Difficult to describe, but so cool in person.  I was there for work, so I didn't have to pay for anything (except gambling, where it took me about 20 minutes to wipe out my checking account), which is extremely fortunate, since breakfast for three came to about $125 one morning.  The linens were unbelievable, and the bed was amazing.  I spent most of the last day by the pool, where the crowd was so friendly- everyone was so glad to be at such a fabulous place!

Eventually we purchased a room for one night and in the morning when we got up to leave to another hotel, the valet guy grabbed my dad and said our car wasn't turning on.... ok how is that possible when it is a brand new car. Unfortunately, the valet drivers do not know how to function a keyless BMW and left our car on all night which caused it to let the battery die. Once they saw that the car wasn't turning on, instead of helping us all they kept saying is that ""they aren't liable and can not do anything about it""....ok? This is a multi million dollar hotel and you guys can't afford a jumper cable?! They had to go and look for one for an hour and a half. Very rude, very disorganized, very unprofessional hotel service will not be coming back ever again.",0,0,0

We had booked 2 doubles.  Instead we got 1 King bed, which meant they wanted me to sleep with my buddy.  Not cool.  We weren't the only room with that problem: other people we spoke to were given a roll-away (10 hours later) that had bug beds.

It was fast and easy with no hassles like I've had at other hotels. Their sports book is filled with lovely TV's just about everywhere. It will definitely a place that I would like to go back to. 
I also attended Haze during my stay, which I'd have to say wasn't all too special. It was just a regular club to me, nothing that I'd die to back to again. DJ was ok, drinks were expensive...same as any other club I suppose. 4 drinks we ended up dropping 80$ with tip, if that gives u a rough estimate.

The service was wonderful! Firstly there was a private check I'm area which offered a speedy check in process and offered complementary snacks which is great when you come in from a late night of partying and need a quick bite of something to eat lol.
The room itself was also very nice , not a lot of decor but the views were amazing , the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was to die for (they even had a heated toilet seat and a bidet!!) There was a seperate living area as well as another bathroom.
The service associated with the room itself was something I loved. The young lady who checked us in voluntarily walked us up your our room (which wasn't very close & I'm sure walking in heels after standing all day to check people in didn't make the walk the most comfortable but she did it anyway) I also called down to room service and was greeted by name when my call was answered (it might be juvenile to some people but I was blown away lol) someone even came up to our room just to make sure everything was up to our standards.

We loved the modern look of the rooms and the hotel itself. The blinds in the room opened as soon as you walked in the room to reveal a beautiful view.

The beds were comfortable and soft. 

The check-in process was smooth since we checked in at 1am. The check out process was easy and hassle free as well. I hated the resort fee of $25 but that is pretty common in all the nicer resorts. 

We checked out the Gold Lounge on a Thursday and we had a blast. We didn't have to get dressed up and we got free admission and free drinks for the lady.

Looks great from the outside. 

Full:

You know those girls who look SUPER hot, but they pretty much have a vegetable as a brain? Yea, this is the hotel version of that... 

I hate to say it but it's true. The design and everything is great with the fountains and water running everywhere along with the lights. You are ever greeted by the valet parking service once you arrive (who by the way only open the doors for the ladies....). Once you get into the lobby you see crowds the front desk is very inefficiently lined. The line is not blocked off you you have a huge crowd of people blocking other crowds of people who have just arrived with plenty of luggage and that just makes everything worse and even more confusing. The lobby is nicely cooled though, which is the only plus I have to say about this place. The elevators are pretty far off from the lobby and people who hate carrying heavy luggage might want to reconsider. Once you get to the elevators, you need to watch the signs carefully and make sure you take the right elevator to your floor cause they do not cover all the floors which is pretty inefficient and poorly designed. 

The rooms are nice and very modern and computerized. With a touch of a button everything gets turned on and the curtains can roll back. Don't touch the fridge if you DO NOT want to get extra charged a ridiculous amount for snacks ($3 snickers) and bottled water ($8). Be warned. 

The walls are NOT soundproof. So if you live next to a party of douches, you're pretty much stuck there to deal with them. Don't expect to be able to change rooms. And don't expect to be able to reach the front desk through phone to have some one to go over there to tell them to shut up next door. You're much better off taking matters into your own hands. 

The pool is nice since there are different sections for adults and kids. The jacuzzis are plenty warm. And the water seems clean ""visually"". The only bad thing about this place is that it closes too early (6pm)

The valet pick up location is too far from the main door so if you have a lot luggage it will be very tiring to get to and this is coming from a pretty fit guy. 

The buffet is okay, but not worth you're money.",1,2,2

I read other reviews first and thought, ""Naw, these bad things happen to other people not me."" Fail. Checking in took forever as the employees are super slow, and when we FINALLY got to our room, we discover the lock to enter the room is completely dead. About twenty minutes later and two employees attempting to help us, they give up and tell us to sit on hold with the front desk in the elevator lobby. Twenty more minutes passes by as I drink a beer in frustration. Finally we decide to go down and get this handled since we had to still eat dinner & get ready for the clubs. The manager was nice for being super stressed  so he upgrades our room, but still the room was just okay, too much crazy technology that no one can figure out,. I would have rather stayed at Palazzo or my favorite - The Trump. We ordered room service which was bland, overpriced, and made my boyfriend sick. They failed to give us our free play money in the casino too, saying it 'wasn't in their system.' And watch out for timers that go off in the morning, turning on your TV, all the lights, and the blackout curtains! We complained and ended up getting our room comped but it wasn't worth the hassle. I wouldn't say it's as beautiful as everyone says, it's like most nice hotels on the strip. It's just not quite there yet, they need to work on a lot of things.

We stayed on the 3rd floor so not much of a view but who cares? The room was for sleeping in only! 
Upon entry the room lit up- fancyyyy. We stayed in the King Deluxe room. There was more than enough space for two people in there. Lots of storage and plenty of counter space in the restroom too. The bathroom had different types of lighting and was really well lit (what you need so you don't look like clown after doing your makeup). There was a tub and shower equipped with the works (shampoo, conditioner, soap).

After driving for nine hours in traffic due to an oil and carrot spill on the I-15, I finally arrive. I get out of my car, and it turns out there's no luggage service on this side of the hotel. Great. So I walk my tired and sober ass over to the other side of the hotel, only to be greeted by a pissy front desk girl, whose time I'm obviously wasting. She barely makes eye contact as she curtly tells me the city view room I had booked is not available. But for the inconvenience, I'll be credited $50. Fair enough. I make my way up to the room, where the control unit is not working. I call front desk, and the same ray of sunshine answers. 

Me: ""The control unit is not working.""
Sunshine: "" Siiiiiiiighhhhhhh...did you try the remote control?""
Me: ""No, but I think someone needs to fix this.""
Sunshine: ""Ok, siiiiir. I'll send someone up. Can I be any more of a rude *unt this evening?"" Ok, I made the last sentence up. But you get the point.

I've never had a front desk person be so enthusiastically rude like this, so I called a manager. But of course, he\/she is not there and I can only leave a message. Probably one of a few thousand they ignore on a nightly basis. And as you can all guess, I never receive a call back. Oh, and the room was a disabled access(?) room, so you can't stand under the shower head without bumping your knee on the little chair. So that was awesome.

Next day, I get moved to a city view room, which actually has a worse view than the standard room. And I also call hospitality to see if I can get some utensils. They wanted $1.50 per utensil. Nickel and dime, much? 

On Sunday, I finally check out, only to find out the $50 credit had magically been forgotten. So I complain, and find out that it was applied towards food and beverage. And I had also been charged $43 and tax for a Grey Goose bottle I moved in their fridge. If I had that credit, shouldn't it have been applied to the Grey Goose I didn't drink? When I mentioned that Sunshine never mentioned the $50 being a food credit, I was given my money back. And I also asked to speak to a manager in person, and all I got were a few disingenuous sorrys and nods. Worst $600 ever spent. Whatever you do, please do not give them your business. They do not know the definition of hospitality.",12,4,1

there is nothing spectacular about it. the décor is nice and chic but kinda minimalist in comparison to the other vegas greats.

the rooms are large and the smart technology is great. I wish the bathroom would've been a little bigger (and it would've been super cool if the wall was glass in the shower to be able to see out of the room floor to ceiling windows).

the service was good but check in was a LONG wait. about 30 minutes standing in line and it was only 9 am. they did have a great feature where they gave us room keys and text us the room # when it was ready so we wouldn't have to wait in line again.

Came home around midnight, pulled back the sheets and.......there was blood on the sheets! SO, grossed out, we call downstairs and pack up our bags! First off we called for about a half hour before we were able to get  a hold of anyone. So that kinda annoyed us. Someone comes up to get us, and moves us across the hotel to the sky suites. which by the way was the same room just in another tower that was hid behind a door that you needed your key card for! So get on up there, check the bed, we are good to go.....til we went in the bathroom and there were maxi pads all over the place and the soap had been opened and there was pubic hair on it! Not to mention the bell boy said, wow, it kinda smells in here! um, yeah that it did! So perhaps the girl who bled on our sheets in the first room, had been moved to this room? god only knows! In any case, he tried to call downstairs, got no answer so he went down himself! Him being the bell boy. So about an hour later, and many calls from us, he came back up and said we are going back to the other side where we came from. Whatever, at this point it was 3am, it was three hours well into the moving situation and I just wanted a bed! So we were going back to the other side and opened the next door to where we found a beautiful suite! wonderful, drop our bags we are going to bed! So we didn't even fully check out the place til the morning! it was awesome! the bathroom was our favorite place, the toilet had heated seats and it was wonderful! Just wished we could have enjoyed it a bit more, because I woke up to realize that my wallet and one bag had been missing! Bell Boy never got all the bags! SO I went down stairs and had to find someone to let me in the other room, which took well over an hour and a half, finally got my bag and around 2pm I was able to enjoy the pool! We were tired and annoyed! The next day at check out we felt like we had to negotiate to get someone to take a night off or something. I mean we spent our first night being shlepped all over the place! We loved the place but the service and managers and obviously cleaning people were not up to par for this upscale new hotel!

To sum it up, I had no service at the front counter, a dirty room, no towels, dirty bathroom, locked out of the room waiting in the hallway for it seems like an eternity and told that they could do nothing but have me wait, then sent to a second room that was dirty again with a non working remote control! WTF! I shot 2 videos of my experience which are up on youtube and the management on shift did not seem to care.  I have video of me telling them that I have video of the crappy service and they didn't even want to view it at all! Ridiculous, definitely.  Our past 2 stays at Bellagio, a sister property of theirs (MGM) and Wynn(Encore) have been excellent.   

My recent stay at Aria was alarmingly bad. In the past 8 years I've been frequenting Las Vegas, I have not complained once about hotels I've stayed at. I started my experience on the 20th of December with nobody greeting us at the front desk check in with lanes open. We eventually walked up to the attendant (with her head down not looking at customers) and got our room. The room was dirty with dirty shower and hair all over and no towels. Also, we had to call for the in room dining menu since no folios were filled, just empty shells. On our 2nd night we were locked out of our room and then told that the entire key creation system was down so we waited for someone to let us in. Problem: nobody was sent up to help let us in. We iPhone searched for the front desk again and got someone up there eventually, who ended up unable to help. Cue second master key holder and I started shooting videos via iPhone to show this service. She also said there is nothing to do but wait. My gf had stomach problems and needed to get in to our room we paid for but we could only wait as she was unable to do anything. Cue locksmith and finally we get in. Since the entire key lock system was dead in 21224, we were moved to 33121. Good luck with that, because not only was that room dirty when we walked in but the remote control didnt work. I called in to have it fixed while we gambled and the remote in the second room was stood upright but still did not work. Our past 2 stays were at Bellagio, a sister property and Wynn, both of which were great experiences. Never in my Vegas experiences have I encountered such ridiculous service. I've included the YouTube links below of my key lockout experience for you to view. The assistant manager on shift did not seem to care about my videos but I think the public will. I hope this will shed some light on my displeasure and you will understand that I could not imagine how service can run like that in a high level casino. I hope you can give me an explanation on how this is worthwhile of the money I spent to visit your establishment and how the service was in the videos I've made.",13,6,2

The rooms are decently priced, but make sure you book in advance for some better deals. Expect the room rates to be at least 100 or more plus fees.",3,0,1

We paid $80\/night on the weekday (spent a lot more inside the casino). Despite not upgrading to a room with a view of the strip for an additional $25\/night, the view of the Nevada sky and Aria pools was still breathtaking.

Big rooms with wide windows, spacious closets, and a touch screen tablet that controls the room, lights, temperature, TV, and calls room service. The bathroom is dope because the shower and the bathtub are connected. Beds come with two super plushy body pillows. Worth the money! Only complaint is that the hallways are long, so we'll probably request a room closer to the elevator for convenience next time. 

It takes a while to walk out of the Aria, but there is a tram that connects to the Bellagio and lots of bridges that connect to other parts of the strip. Food options are slightly limited since the restaurants inside are much nicer ($$-$$$+) and the nearby mall only has designer brands.  There's a lot of nearby fast\/cheap food in the Cosmopolitan and Planet Hollywood. Nevertheless, we got to randomly peruse the Snapchat Spectacles vending machine one day in the promenade. There's also a Pressed Juicery, a Pinkberry, and a game room! 

The Aria is within walking distance of a few art galleries and there's a bunch of cool sculptures and abstract art around the hotel, but nothing worthy of specifically visiting like the Bellagio fountains or garden. 

There are 4 pools total, one is reserved for Sky suite guests and the other is a lounge\/pool club, which wasn't really popular. The pools are gorgeous  and offer a lot of shaded seating and the pool bar has great mojitos! There's also a small Jacuzzi near the entrance. 

Wonderful housekeeping service! I'm a huge slob when I travel so I only expected new towels and a freshly made bed, but they even folded up my dirty laundry, provided bags, refilled the amenities, and placed all my makeup on paper placemats. Nice touch. 

Edit: On the day we left, there was a shooting at the Cosmopolitan and the police closed off parts of the strip. Thanks to the bell desk service, we were able to skip the taxi line and make our flight while most cars were blocked on the strip. 

All in all, the Aria is modern and very classy. Definitely one of the most gorgeous hotels on the strip with boujee restaurants and designer boutiques. Would definitely stay here again. :)",3,0,0

The rooms are nice and modern. Tv, lights and curtains are managed via remote control thru the tv which is really cool. The staff is friendly and kind. Regarding the restaurants:
1) Spanish food: Julian Serrano: two thumbs up. Delicious. Waiters get. Little bit In your face though.
2) Italian: Sirio: another two thumbs. Yummie Italian food and desserts. 
3) cafe Vettro: nice and practical. Lots of options to choose in the menu. Open 24 hours.
4) dessert and pastries: Jean Philippe: some of the staff is rude but the pastries and the coffee mmm mmmm good.
5) the buffet: did not like it at all. Staff is really nice. But the options I thought where few and not that good.

TIPS
DAILY SERVICE FEE:  Yes the hotel charges a 25 dlls daily service fee which includes, wifi, daily newspaper, gym and phone calls. Which by the way Vegas is doing is, pretty reasonable. Just make sure you make you get the 25 dlls worth

FREE TRAM: there is a free tram that takes you to crystals shopping center and Monte Carlo. This tram is really useful when coming back from Bellagio or Caesars Palace.

Luxurious and high tech rooms- the best feature is that you can open\/close curtains with one button. The ""good night"" button also turns off all lights in addition to closing the curtains. The views from the rooms are expansive- whether you're looking out on city center or the desert. 

The pools are also amazing. It's mainly an adult scene, though there are a few kids. It's very laid back and serene. The staff maintains it well- cocktail waitresses and staff refilling the water coolers are frequent.

The restaurants are also high-end and don't disappoint.

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of interesting slot machines and the drink prices.  Slots are pretty stodgy and basic. Table limits are often at least $15 per hand\/roll, though this should probably be expected in a nice hotel like this. The drink prices at the pool are too high- $18 for their most popular drink- a mojito (though they are quite good).

But if you want to romance the hell out of your date Vegas-style, then Aria certainly beats Bellagio, Wynn, Venetian, and Mandalay Bay hands-down.  From the elevator interiors to the benches by the hotel registration to the gold playing card dividers that mark the poker room, Aria is all about opulence.

Yes, it's brown inside.  It's warm.  It's sophisticated.  Anyone wanting some place where you can walk around the casino floor trying to look cool with your cardboard case of Budweisers, please, go elsewhere.  

I like that the restaurants and lounges are really set back off the casino floor.  They blend in with the casino floor.  The poker room is beautiful and well-spaced...dimmer than Bellagio, but more elegant than Red Rock.

But really, the most amazing thing here is the Sports Book.  (I almost hate saying that, because now tons of sports fans will be flocking there and taking my seat).

(I'm sure my opinion of Aria will change with future visits...especially if I decide to stay there overnight.  Since there are still parts under construction, I wouldn't be too harsh on Aria.  For those expecting perfection from the very beginning obviously don't appreciate the sheer amount of effort it took to design such a colossal project and make sure it's doors were open before Christmas.)",9,2,0

The ""check in line"" was a mob of people pushing their way to the front, made worse by employees taking upwards of 45 minutes to check in each room!  After 4 weeks of being open, the check-in desk employees were still sneaking under the desk to consult their handbooks.  

The high-tech room key system didn't work for us, as 4 different sets of keys failed to magnetize, leaving us sitting in the hall outside of our room as we waited 45 minutes for someone to come up and rescue us.  It might have been quicker to stand in the check-in line again, given that even the replacement keys they sent up for us didn't work, as well.

We were traveling with colleagues who had to change rooms multiple times, thanks to overwhelming odors, dirty rooms, double bookings, and broken a\/c.  One fellow traveler had so many room problems (including being given the key to a room that ALREADY HAD GUESTS IN IT!) that the Aria management finally gave up and moved him over to a room at the Bellagio.  

We were told by sources in the city (cab drivers, other hotel employees) that the average training for hotel employees is 4 weeks, and to save money Aria employees were only trained for 1.5 weeks.  That would explain the concierge who couldn't tell us where a restaurant WITHIN THE HOTEL was located.  We asked for a map, located it on the Promenade level one floor up, and asked ""Is there a quick way up to the 2nd floor?  An escalator, perhaps?""  She also didn't know, and said she had no idea how to get to the 2nd floor.  We gave up and went back to the guest room elevators.

The one bright spot was our dinner at Sage.  Delicious, luxurious, a great experience.  Stay somewhere else but come to Sage for dinner.  

I would absolutely not go back to Aria or recommend it.  Any new hotel will have some kinks to work out, but we didn't find the hotel staff or management nearly solicitous enough about the overwhelming, obnoxious, visit-ruining problems.

The room was great with floor to ceiling windows, separate living area and a large bathroom.  The ""Control 4"" unit which controls lighting, TVs and drapes was a little complicated to use, but I can see how it would appeal to the high-tech crowd.

The hotel is large with 7 bars and 16 restaurants.  How large?  It took me nearly 15 minutes to walk from my end of the hallway room my car in self-parking.

While the casino is pretty standard for Vegas, the rest of the public spaces have beautiful design and are kept clean.  

The pool area is nice and large enough to accommodate the crowds.  There are 2 large main pools for the masses along with 3 whirlpools.  There is a separate pool for guests of the Sky Suites and the Liquid party pool. The main pools are pretty laid back with drink service and music playing.

After the long drive from LA, I had to use the restroom.

What was waiting in the toilet was either the previous occupant's or the housecleaning's urine in the toilet.

To say the least, that is not what you expect from a hotel that is brand new(two weeks old) and is supposed to be a 5 stars.

Upon further investigation, there were many other things wrong
-trash in multiple garbage cans
-water in the ice bucket
-only one cup, without the plastic cover
-counter tops had watermarks and food stains

After noticing these items, we called the front desk around 12:45 AM and spoke to an agent.  The agent did not apologize for the inconvenience and said she would send a bellboy up with the keys to our new room.  Not wanting to waste our night, we called back at 1AM, to find that they have not even made the keys yet--let alone send a bell boy up.  At 1:20 AM, we follow up again, but this time, the front desk lady has attitude and argues with us saying we haven't been waiting that long(almost 40 minutes up to this point).  Finally around 1:35 AM we receive the keys to the new room.  The gentleman who brought us the keys did apologize for the state of the room and would take it up with his supervisor.

After going to the new room, I went to closest ice machine, which was, you guessed it, broken.

When I came back to the hotel after a night out, there was a situation in the elevator lobby which lead up to my floor.  Namely, there was crazy guy lying face down, pounding the floor and yelling.  EMT and hotel staff were on the scene and eventually cleared the way for people to access their rooms.  To be fair, the hotel has no control over this, but in the light of experience I had so far, this was just another inconvenience that added to an overall bad feel for the hotel.

Having been to Vegas many times, I have never had a bad experience like this.  First impressions are everything and Aria seems to be off on the wrong foot.  I would certainly not recommend this to hotel to my friends and will not come back.  For the price point and amenities, I would rather book Palazzo, Venetian, or Bellagio.

Maybe because its duch a big resort they think that being rude and non helpful wont hurt them but trust me eventually people will go to other resorts, there are plenty to choose from that won't mind taking their business & treating me the way I deserve to be treated. 
So when i made the booking the one request i made was if we could have an early check in because our flight was arriving a good 6 1\/2 hrs before normal check in. When we arrived they said the room wasn't available yet and they would email me whenever it was. So we decided to walk around the malls and grab a bite to eat to waste time. After 6 hrs have passed and still no email & it was already regular check in time we went back and the response was "" well the room is ready idk why u didn't receive an email"" when i asked of they would upgrade us or even give us complimentary drinks or something the guy bluntly said no there is nothing i can do! We get to our room and even complimentary water isn't offered in the rooms. Then on our last day we asked for a late checkout and they said all they could do was 12pm after that we would be charged! Seriously the worst so called 5 star hotel i have ever been to. They are cheap and have the worst customer service, even my siblings and sister in law all had bad experiences. We will not be back.

My husband and I were in Las Vegas to get married and stayed for only 3 nights. We loved the Aria and we were very impressed with our stay. Our room was gorgeous, although it was only the size of a standard hotel room. It had upscale finishes and a beautiful view of the strip. The bed and pillows were amazing, best night sleep ever, I felt enveloped in luxury. We loved the shower and bath, duel sinks and private toilet. The provided amenities were quite nice as well and came in handy (sewing kit, citrus shampoo, makeup remover wipes, etc) Not to mention the entire casino is so gorgeous and the staff is incredible. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming, and the security was very ""on it"" so we felt quite safe leaving belongings in our room. At one point during our stay my feet got badly blistered from walking in sandals so my husband called the front desk and they brought up a nice little first aid kit in no time flat. My only complaints were that 2 lights in my room were burnt out and Aria is actually a bit of a hike from the strip, especially in such hot weather. We dined at several restaurants inside Aria and we were blown away with all of them except the Aria Cafe.. It was a little overpriced and our food wasn't very fresh. I can forgive that though as our waitress was very friendly and accommodating, plus it was quite late. Overall we had a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend the Aria to anyone visiting Las Vegas!",0,0,1

The rooms themselves are great. separate bath suites to the bedroom. Fairly quiet and you can't hear your neighbors. But the last time I came here, a few bones to pick...

1. We set an alarm for 7:30AM for the blinds to open and TV to turn on. It turned on an hour earlier both days even though the clock on the control reflected the right time. 

2. We left our room at 8AM to 3PM and service never came to clean the room. This seems like a pretty generous window, but over the course of 2 nights, we never had our rooms serviced once.

The hotel itself is supposed to be 5 star, which not that its not great, but I don't know if it compares to the Wynn etc.. Anyway, the hotel is very classy and nice, the hotel rooms are very nice, the bed very comfortable. My only pet peeve was that they don't have a coffeemaker in the room, which i know sounds stupid, but that's the way I like to wake up in the morning. A lot of hotels I realize are doing that lately but anyway.

There are 2 attached ""centers"" if you will , the city center and cosmopolitan, and in these 2 there is everything. Food, shopping, nightclubs or just a perfect excuse to walk around just to people watch, which is always a must in Vegas. 

I am suprised that people have a had bad service at this hotel and felt that the rooms were dirty. I did not have this experience at all.

the moral of the story here is: bid on priceline.

Oh and another note, the layout of the hotel is really bizzarre. The placement of the lobby in relation to the front of the hotel and the parking and then the guest elevators to take you up to your room makes no sense.

I had left my ipad charger and realized it shortly after I checked out.
I went back to the hotel and the concierge had confirmed with me that housekeeping retrieved it but it will take couple hours to get it to lost and found.
I had to leave Vegas so she took down my number and told me security will contact me and it will be mailed to me, free of charge.

After not hearing back from them for a week, I called and now the security tells me nothing was retrieved from the room. but I was specifically told that it had been before. He told me a person will be contacting me to start an inquiry\/investigation on it on that day.

Of course not to my surprise, I dont hear from them so I call back again 3 days later and now the lady in security is telling me she does not know of such procedure of starting investigation and maybe i should try calling back to speak to that guy again....

When you walk in, the open hall welcomes you and you feel like you stepped into a modern world. Outside the hotel there is a gorgeous waterfall that runs along the walls and the hotel exterior is surrounded by other hotel\/business and lots of architecture.

The slots don't pay out much and we lost a lot more compared to what we won, I'd say 10 times more. Tables are pretty pricy compared to the older hotels like Paris and Harrah's (which start around $10-$15 a hand) and start at $25.

The one thing I do wish is that the hotel created an environment that would encourage guests to explore more with visuals or signs. We spent the first 3 days at the ""front"" of the hotel and had no idea there was an upstairs until we decided to eat the buffet on the last day. 

We enjoyed the buffet much and it wasn't overwhelming and had a good variety. Next time we will order the ""inclusive drinks package-all you can drink"" that is around $15. We were too boozed out to drink anymore on our last day as you can imagine.

They do have a nice late night café that stays open but be WARNED! The night club in the hotel is very close to that café and you can hear the bass of the hip hop\/techno\/dance music as you eat, it can be distracting but hey, its Vegas.

Great rooms, lovely bathroom, and a little too high tech for me with the gadgets but still a great room. They charged us $35 for a tequila bottle we didn't use and then reversed the charges when I called them to tell them we never touched it nor opened the bar. The bottle was still there.

Let me set scene of my first few moments within this hotel and you be the judge if you'd stay here! 

Upon arriving, we entered the check in line around 10:15pm. There was a shorter line of about 5 people in front of us. The line moved quickly, we started talking to our check-in women within about 10 minutes. Since we decided to extend our stay by one night we actually had two reservations that the girl had to merge into one. This took her 15 minutes to do. Which is fine, I understand that part takes a while. She seemed to have an issue finding a room that we could stay in for that additional night, but after another 10 minutes she had our key cards ready and suggested the bellmen take our bags to our room since our friends were waiting for us to go out. We did this, as at the time it seemed the fastest thing to do. Once we met up with our friends, we decided we needed to change our outfits for our plans, so we head to our room. We had booked the deluxe King room, but we were assigned a room with two full beds. This was not ok. And also no bags yet in our room. It had been about ten minutes since dropping them off. We called down to the front desk and the woman replied saying she had a different room we could move directly to, and she would notify the bellmen to redirect our bags. Once we make our way to our new room, the key card doesn't work. So we head back down to the lobby, where we ask to talk to a manager. We have to tell our story to the first, to a new front desk girl so she could turn around and tell the manager who was standing directly behind her. It was now past 11pm, still no room and no bags. She reassigns us a room, after telling us we couldn't have been that hassled and also that the bellmen won't just leave our bags in our room. This was news to us since both the precious front desk girl and the bellmen said they would leave the bags in our room. The manager told us no, they won't leave the bags without us in the room. If I had known that, I would have taken my bags to my room myself. So now, we finally have new key cards and head to our room after more than one hour of being in the hotel! We were fairly mad about such a hassle. The manager didn't seem to care at all, she did give us an extra room credit for our trouble but was not friendly or caring at all!
 We stayed here for three nights, the room it's self was ok, just like any hotel in Vegas. The pool is nice if you arrive early to get a chair in the shade, the prices are crazy expensive though so be aware of that. We also tried out the buffet at The Aria and wow, so gross! For $42 you would expect fresh food. No! Most of the signs above the food were labeled wrong, and if the food wasn't cold, it looked like it was reheated and sitting out for a while. Very gross, barely ate anything! 
Upon checking out and viewing my bill I noticed they billed me incorrectly and didn't apply my room credits correctly. I talked to the concierge about it and they said I would have to wait in the ""check-in"" line which was about an hour or more long in order to talk with the manager.

She understood and went to talk to the manager herself. Took all of two minutes for her to talk to the manager and the bill was fixed.  What a hassle! Everything about this place was a pain in the butt. I will never stay here again. The staff, they do not care about that either.

Trying to quell my gambling fix at 10pm on a Tuesday night and finding nothing but $15 minimum tables was a bit of a letdown.

Bathroom - Very nice.  Heated toilet seat with the Bellagio fountains built in...and a dryer to say ahhhhh to.

Restaurants - Pricey and questionable....I suggest taking a walk across the street and eat at 'Earl of Sandwich' for fraction of the cost and get much better quality food.

The rooms were real classy, clean. I love the modern design. It reminded me a lot of the Hard Rock, which I stayed at a few months before. 

BEWARE: It seems that most hotel rooms now have this cute little display case of purchasable items. Don't touch it, don't remove things from it, or your room will be charged because it will be assumed you took the item. I think there's a few seconds of grace period, though.

It didn't happen to us, but it almost did!

We went in December, so we never saw the pool area.

However, we were on the 18th floor and had a spectacular view of the Cosmopolitan pool deck (which I heard is a club by night - the Marquee, I think?) Awesome voyeuristic advantages lol. Cosmopolitan was still closed at the time, but still. VERY NICE VIEW.

One problem with our stay - checking in, as someone else mentioned, is slower than it should be because there's no line. Also, we reserved for 2 queen beds, but they had us reserved for one king bed. WTF. And apparently, they were going to charge us extra per night for 2 queen beds. I think it was an extra $30. So, we kept to the 1 king bed and had a cot brought in for free. Jerks.

Other than that, it was a great stay. The cot was comfortable and the rooms were nice, clean, and comfortable. I'd go back again and hope for an improvement, but it still was a great stay.",0,0,1

The view from the wraparound floor-to-ceiling windows was fantastic and the blackout curtains kept the eye melting post inebriation sunlight at bay. The wet bar area with refrigerator was a great touch and was well used from the time we arrived until the time we departed. Our hosts even provided our group with a bar kit for mixing. 
The pool area was what you would expect from a Vegas resort of this caliber: beautiful people and fruity drinks. There are multiple pools which always seem to be busy and restaurants adjacent so you don't have to get out of your bikini to have a snack.

THE GOOD: new property, eco features, nice and comfortable rooms, interesting design, good air.

THE BAD: Aria's marketing solicited us to come and offered 2 for 1 Elvis show. So we came but the show was cancelled due to crew's vacation (??). We got pretty ticked off and asked Aria's staff to give us some simple comps. Instead, they said we should go around and look for another show at another property (Aria has only the Elvis show, which went black for a couple of weeks). 

As a part of our package, we also got some free play. Machines were not accepting it or showing used up credit, where in fact it was not used. Staff admitted computer problems, but didn't do anything to make us happy.

We called the managers - no help. They were repeating the same thing like little parrots. We travel a lot and I have NEVER seen such un-empowered staff. They have zero (0) authority to make any decisions to make the guests happy. Sad and disappointing.

The property has nice and modern design but its functionality is questionable. Examples: Bathroom sinks splash water. Barely any place to hang the towel. Bathroom's sliding door is too heavy and difficult to close without noise. 

Your room can be far, far away from the centrally located elevators (which are fast and quiet). All these casino\/hotel open areas feel more like a modern railway station in Europe or Asia than a casino. The place feels cold (not cool) and empty. It is completely different feel and touch than Bellagio or Wynn, which have warm colors and very artistic design.

A couple of weeks ago some friends and I went to Aria for dinner (Carbones - which we LOVED!).  Between dinner, drinks, and our 'slot contributions', I would guess that we easily dropped $500-$600 that night - again, everything about the night was perfect ... Until it was time to get the car and go home when we had to pay almost $15 in additional ransom money to the parking police (aka Valet) - which was on top of our customary tip.

We heard rumors that MGM was going to allow free parking through year end (with LV drivers license).  Apparently, they have exceptions to the rule.

Although I'm a ""local"", I still like going down to the strip for a nice dinner on occasion.  Not to mention all of the times I become an unofficial tour guide for out of town guests.  I will undoubtedly continue to visit MGM properties in the future - they have a big enough footprint in this town that you can't avoid them entirely (especially when friends come to town).

There were two queen beds, a 42"" plasma, marble bathrooms, and a fun little control pad that controlled the temperature, tv, music, lighting, etc.  

The casino was darkly lit, almost put me to sleep late at night.  Most of the tables were $10-15 during the week, and $15+ on the weekend.  One complaint is that there are not many food choices here.  There is a small sandwich shop that also serves pastries\/cakes\/sweets that are almost a crime to eat since they are such beautiful pieces of art.  The sandwiches from this place were delicious. I had the prosciutto sandwich that had mozzarella and basil on it...I don't know if it was the hangover, or the quality...but the sandwich was to die for.  The other place to eat is a small Skybox Grill that serves pub style food, and a skybox express that serves pub style food on a limited menu.  Both places are very expensive, I usually made the 10 minute walk to the Monte Carlo food court to save $$$.  

The sportsbook was b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l! It had a pair of giant LCD screens that made watching sports a real joy. They also had something like 92 different plasma screens, but not enough seating so most people were left standing.  

The service was not up to par..they had us wait for 6 hours to get into our room, yet they called me twice to tell me my room was ready. When I showed up at the front desk to get the keys, they said that the room was not in fact ready. This was very annoying since we were so far away from the frontdesk.  Then our TV broke down, which was a huge deal since we were watching March Madness.  

The beds were probably the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on, even the roll-away we had in our room was incredibly soft and thick.  

The most important thing about this review, is that the drink service is legendary.  At the sports book, I had 2 drinks on deck and I had to turn away the cocktail waitress (who was incredibly friendly).  Even while at the penny slots the cocktail waitress came around every 5-10 minutes.  Never have I been at a casino where they came around too fast.! I saved a ton of money just drinking 'free' booze.

The rooms try too hard to be modern.  There are several sets of buttons in the room that do different things depending on the state of the room. Totally not intuitive, guys. Try to be more like Apple and less like Microsoft with your design choices.

The rooms themselves are high-quality, clean, and look modern. If you're going for a sexy night, then it does the trick.

ATT signal quality was poor in my room on the 18th floor, such that it would take about 5-10 min to send\/receive messages. So, if you're making a rendezvous, you might want to communicate from the lobby floor.

The supposed iPhone\/iPod dock takes a proprietary connector that you must buy from the wet bar for ~$30. What a rip-off. So, bring a male-to-male audio cord that plugs into your headphone and into their line-in jack.

The design is totally dialed in and cohesive, and an insane amount of thought and attention to detail were poured into the design process. Strolling through the same area at two different times of day will produce different experiences, daylight reflecting colors, passing through textures, nighttime showing off elegant form. Completely innovative materials and textures abound. Breezing through other premier hotel\/resort\/casinos on the strip after Aria was a comedown, and these were places that made my jaw drop at one time.

Check in was quick and easy; staff is friendly and professional. The room was incredible, loved the technology, like Back to the Future or Demolition Man. Now I want my own industrial loft hooked up with the same technology. Even for this over-40, it was very easy to figure out. Decoration is exponentially more beautiful than the competition. Rooms are modernist but not minimalist, so all the predictable attributes are there, plus the heap of technology setting the experience a head and shoulders above the rest. Loved being able to program the room scene for different times of day, and how I'd like the lights, music, curtains and temperature to wake me, and in what manner I'd prefer my room to to spring to life when I enter...drapes open, lights, and of course music or not. The bathroom is a religious experience, with a steam shower and overflow egg tub cordoned off behind glass. Loved the overflow tub. Toilet duties are accomplished in a generously sized, frosted glass alcove which closed completely. Shampoo\/conditioner\/shower gel matches the scent pumped throughout the hotel, one of the plethora of small details touched upon. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, the quality of the furniture, fabrics and materials top notch, and predictably, nothing garish, just slick, gorgeous design . Maid service is twice daily. No floppy, plastic ""do not disturb\/please make up the room"" signs, instead push a button and a discreet red LED ""do not disturb"" appears next to the door. When you return, months or years later, you slide your card and the lights, music, temperature, and drapes adjust to the way they were when you left. Sweet! We were spoiled by the standard room, at half the price of some of the blue-chip properties surrounding it.

 Parking is easy enough for a 5 year-old, turn in from Las Vegas Blvd, ""Aria Self Park"" appears in front of you. Markers in the garage are cool in a Buck Rogers way.

You won't find typical casino prints or billowing anything here. ""Vegas fancy"" doesn't exist, making some uncomfortable. Aria and City Center proper is basically a large art museum housing a hotel\/resort\/casino, and not everyone is interested in art. As this project was coming to fruition, I stated that if a certain demographic said ""but it's so cold\/ugly\/inhuman\/stark,"" that they'd nailed it. And they did.  If you're looking for ""fancy,"" try the rest of the strip, strewn with people in puffy painted shirts, wearing running shoes with every outfit. If you appreciate modern architecture at it's purest and more genuine modern art than the Museum of Contemporary Art, this place will be feast for you. What they've done has snared me, and boatloads of others who were enjoying Aria.

City Center will be a smashing success, already attracting their target demographic, repelling the riff-raff. Bravo! 

A couple things: the menu and food in the cafe are meh, and the hotel needs automatic exterior doors.",1,0,0

Now, for anyone who actually knows me that is the exact opposite of the way I like to operate, but I do like to get wait I paid for.

I booked this hotel through expedia and upon checkin was told that my reservation for two queen beds was actually only a request and that my only option was to go for a room with one king. Now, unfortunately, I was not staying with an attractive brunette, but two friends and one bed between three people doesn't go very far. However, the front desk told me they could send up a cot and the next night they would switch us over to a two queen room. Awesome, right? Except there was no cot when we returned to the room and when we call the front desk they were out, and the next night there were still no double queen bed rooms available. I was very polite about the whole thing (getting mocked by friends for doing so) and felt that the hotel was pretty unapologetic about the entire thing.

Now, the room was pretty nice - brand new, modern and super clean. However, the main drawback of this hotel is that it's off from the strip so it adds another 5-10 minutes walking back to the hotel (which in 40+ degree weather when you are hungover feels like eternity.) That and the pool here is actually split into three pools (so there's no central area to hang out at) and opens late and closes fairly early.

This hotel might appeal to an older crowd, but if you are younger and going with friends there are probably more convenient and better deals to be had. On previous trips I stayed at the paris and the venetian and both were much better in terms of value\/customer service in my opinion.",5,2,1

The bed is lumpy and the comforter is not down and can not be cleaned. That was a big surprise at a 5 star hotel. The bathroom is very small with a glass toilet room that you can see through.  The bath and shower are combined making he bath claustrophobic and the water pressure was terrible. When we came back late at night the room had not been turned down and when we called we were told you have to request a turn down. That is not resort like. And finally the worst part of the hotel is the curtains. It was so bright in our room all night because of the lights and by 7 am we felt like we were sleeping outside on a park bench. Horrible!

We had previously booked the Luxor and ended up getting a better deal here last minute. We requested a non smoking room with two queen beds. Their check in is set up the same as the Bellagio. There are multiple lines and I am assuming a hotel employee is SUPPOSE to be guiding guests. When we got there it was complete chaos. It took forever to check in, someone blatantly cut in front of me. I called attention to it and they said they were their first. Total BS! This is why it is so helpful to actually have a hotel employee to stand there and direct the guests to a line. if they aren't going to have someone do it, they need to set up a line with ropes. When I finally reached the front desk they were very nice and had our room reserved for us. We were slightly worried that since we showed up late in the evening that they wouldn't have our queen beds but we didn't have a problem. I read in past reviews that people had had this problem.The hotel smells like vanilla. Not everyone in my party liked it but I thought it was better than smelling smoke. the rooms were nice and had lots of storage. The room had two hanging closets, a chest of drawers and drawers in the bathroom. We needed all this storage with having four girls. The room is controlled my a touch remote. It was very easy to operate the blinds and the tv. They only problem I had with it was at check out. The touch remote can't access your bill to view on the tv. I called the front desk and they told me to use the regular tv remote. The regular tv remote worked, but what is the point of having a universal remote if it does everything except for access your hotel bill. In Vegas that may be the only time you use your hotel remote. The room was pretty clean. I took comfort in the fact that only two months of people had used it. The hotel had just opened before our stay. The toilets had to be flushed twice sometimes, it's a green hotel so their is less water in the flush. The buffet at the Aria was really good. I felt like we got our money's worth. There were a ton on crab legs out. It's not like Wynn buffet were you have to wait 15 minutes to get crab. We saw the VIVA ELVIS show and it was amazing. We bought our tickets at the concierge and they upgraded our section for free. The stay was overall nice. I think Aria was working out their kinks because they had just open. I would stay their again. Their price was very reasonable for how nice and new the hotel was. It is a 5 minute walk from the strip. It was hard to navigate how to get to the strip the first time. It would have been helpful if their were signs. We walked down to the pool around noon and couldn't find a single seat. There were plenty of seats but they were all taken. It is a popular pool so make sure you get there early.",0,0,0

We booked 2 connecting double queen rooms few weeks ago to share with the cousins. The rooms here are relatively smaller than double queen in Palazzo and more expensive. But the rooms we had were nice, modern and new. They put a lot of towels for us which I really like. Their shampoo, conditioner and lotion were not those cheap ones, and the containers were very cute looking. :-) Also, the rooms were kinda ""high-tech"". We just needed to press buttons for lights, blinders, drapes\/curtains. Very cool. 

By the way, I love the hotel lobby. It was decorated with beautiful fresh flowers. Every counter has a fancy, beautiful vase of fresh flowers. The receptionists were very nice and helpful. 

The casino is smaller than other hotels but it's fine with me. Their shopping is very spacious. Sometimes I feel like they have too much open space.. such a waste.

I arrived during EDC weekend when the reservation system went down and everything had to be done manually. I ended up waiting in line almost 2 hours before I got to my hotel room. When I went to checkout again, the TV checkout system failed to work, requiring me to wait in line for 30 minutes to checkout. I heard that long check-in check-out times are common place in Las Vegas, I don't know. 

I was very pleased with the corner suite I got at Aria. I felt like a king every time I walked into it and I never wanted to leave. The room was so big and so much larger than I had expected. I loved how Control4 was integrated throughout the entire room. I was impressed with both how well they had it working and with how well their custom integration worked with their hotel services. Every light switch was labeled and you could control the curtains with the touch of a button. When you left the room all you had to do was press a button that said ""Service"" to indicate that the room was ready to be clean. Very cool. I liked how all the TVs were wall mounted. Everything was just very clean looking, modern, and up to date. Even the toliet seat was heated. Now that is attention to detail! 

Whenever they would clean my room they did it perfectly. They cleaned things that I would expect to normally be skipped. They paid extra attention to every detail. They even put chocolates on the night stand near my bed every time. One day they put out the slippers for me to wear. Every time I came back and the room was cleaned, it looked like the very first day that I came to the hotel. They even folded my clothes that I had lying on the bed. They put my toothbrush and my other bathroom nessecities on these square paper towels to keep them off the counter. I was amazed. I had to take a double-take every time I came back to my room to make sure that it was actually mine. 

I ordered room service 3 nights. Each night it took about an hour from the time I ordered it to the time I received it in my room. Room service was pretty accurate for the most part when they gave time estimates. I had the Seared Halibut twice which I liked a lot and I recommend. I also tried the pizza which was decent enough.

Aria has a really nice spa. It felt very heavenly. I could stay there for hours. They have a salt room which was interesting. I don't know if I could tell if it was working or not. The infinity pool was cool. I liked how it overlooked the Liquid Lounge and you could hear the music and watch the people mingle below as you sit and relax high above. They have 4 hot tubs all of different temperatures. I especially liked the Eucalyptus sauna. It was better than the sauna at Caesars. Also I liked how there were less naked dudes walking around at the Aria spa as compared to Caesars. But Caesars did have an Artic room and a mineral water bath. I had a massage at the spa. You could tell it was higher quality that what you would get from a chain massage establishment. I could definitely tell the oils that they used were higher quality.

One afternoon, I stayed at the pool. It was very enjoyable. I'd recommend everybody check out the pool. I didn't do any gambling at Aria so I can't comment on that. Aria is a little bit of a walk from the rest of the strip. I would say it takes about 10 minutes from your hotel room to the bridge on the strip if you walk normal pace. Probably get that down to 7 minutes if you walk more briskly.

All in all, I would come to Las Vegas again just to stay at Aria. I enjoyed my time. Thank you Aria.",1,0,1

OK, its Vegas which is all about money and nowhere is that more true than at the Aria where criminal activity seems to be institutionalized.

I've been going there for an annual conference for 6 years, and I've noticed a few things:
1. If you expect anything from anyone that works there, start the conversation with a $20 in your hand. (I'm not talking about special treatment, I mean anything at all...like checking into your room without waiting for hours so that the bellman can get paid for taking your bag.)
2. If you choose not to bribe employees, they'll kindly take their own bribes by adding drinks to your restaurant bills and mini-bar charges to your hotel bill. I've had as much as $150 in bogus room charges and my colleagues have similar stories about restaurant bills padded with phantom charges. (And FYI, trying to reverse the charges is a huge headache.)
3. The place has been in constant decline since it opened. Electronics don't work, plumbing is noisy (i.e. you hear the showers\/toilets of your neighbors), and the ventilation is awful.

As an LA resident, the one-night Vegas trips have started to become somewhat of a all night party\/gamble\/clubbing binge, and we usually decide to stay in the cheapest hotel possible.

However, since we booked the hotel at 2:30 am the previous morning (figure it out), we decided to splurge a bit, and headed for ARIA.  Although this was for sure the nicest place I've stayed in Vegas, it doesn't compare to luxury hotels elsewhere.

The location is great, and the new shuttle comes though, so it's easy to get to Monte Carlo & Bellagio. 

The front desk was pleasant, although the guy kept calling me Mrs. Decker, when there was no evidence of me being married.  Although I did stay with a male (who was subsequently called Mr. Decker, lol), we had a two queen room, and I don't wear any rings etc.  It was just a little awkward, and I tried not to lught.  

The view from our 21st floor room was of the Vdara and Cosmopolitan pools.  For a ""backside"" of the hotel view, it was pretty decent.  The rooms were big, the beds were fluffy and EVERYTHING was automated by a little touch screen remote.  The beds, the music, TV, curtains etc.  I was pretty excited about that, although there was a bit of a delay in the touch screen, which made me accidentally turn everything on\/off\/on\/off a few times due to the delay.

The bathrooms were large, but the shower pressure was weak, the towels were stiff, and they provided 1-ply toilet paper.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to charge $200+ a night for a hotel, I don't think it's too much to ask for the good TP!

We ate at the buffet ($37 on a Saturday), and I suppose it was decent.  There was a TON of seafood including crab legs and lobster.  I'm allergic to shellfish, so this didn't thrill me.  There was still a wide selection of other foods, but the focus was definitely on sea food.  They also provided unlimited house wine, which tasted cheap, but it was free, and I like cheap wine anyway.

I didn't spend much time in this casino, as we hightailed it to Bellagio shortly after our dinner.

I didn't use the spa services, but I purused

There wasn't anything that made this hotel absolutely outstanding, and for the price I would say it was average.  If it was more moderately priced, I would have added a 4th star.",0,1,0

Yup, I don't think this is a 5-star hotel. I was unimpressed, and here's why:

1) Took almost an hour to check-in. 

2) Requested a non-smoking room, but instead received a smoking room (11th floor) when the front desk told me they the non-smoking rooms were all unavailable. After leaving the lobby, I spoke with my co-worker, who waited behind me in line to check-in that went to another front desk representative, actually received a non-smoking room (30th floor). My front desk representative did offer me that they would switch me to a non-smoking room the next day because Housekeeping clean the room around the clock, and that they would leave me a message on my room phone with the new room # the next morning and I can just pack up my belongings and move effortlessly. That never happen.  
 
3) I saw a bug crawled up on the left side of the bedsheet the first night I was there. Eek.
 
4) Two lamps in my room did not work.

I completed an online survey shortly after my stay (in March '13), and let the Guest Relations personnel know of my experience. They've offered me an upgrade to a Corner Suite.

Location is great. South strip near all the other big hotel casinos including Paris \/ bellagio \/ etc.
The valet parking is easy to use and free. They are very quick about retrieving your car when you are ready to leave. I always tip those guys well. You have to figure they run all day and all night long.  
The check in process took a little longer than expected. They could have had more staff working the counter. The rooms were clean but like any other Vegas room fairly small. I needed extra pillows and housekeeping was quick to bring those to me. Room service was good and had a lot of choices. It was delivered quickly but as you know very pricey. 
I felt a little out of place in the casino. I like to play five and 10 or even $15 blackjack games. Very few $15 tables most were $25 and up. The poker room was smoke-free and offered a lot of options if you are into that. The dealers seem to be a little stuck up some were not very social at all.

I haven't been to Vegas since construction started on the City Center. As we drove up to it in the taxi, I was amazed at the sight of it. There is a little fountain outside with lights and a waterfall that many people were taking pictures of. Traffic control outside Aria seemed to be quite efficient, and is very reminiscent of an airport terminal as Rob P. said. 

Check-in took a ridiculously long time; I think it was just our luck. No matter what line we would have waited in, I'm sure we'd have picked the wrong one. I felt that the check-in process reflected the new-ness of the hotel and service staff. The lobby is beautifully decorated, very modern in taste, though the seating areas don't look very comfortable at all. If you look above the check-in table along the window, you'll see a sculpture that is supposed to be a model of the Colorado river (or so I'm told). After getting the keys to our room, we headed through the casino to the guest elevators. The casino area is very dark, no matter what time of day it is. 

Our room was on the 9th floor, and it seemed like forever to get to it. There is only 1 set of elevators; I would have welcomed elevators on both sides of the hotel itself to cut down the long journey back to our room after a full day of walking. 

Anyway, we had a Deluxe non-smoking room. We were in awe as we entered the room and looked around. First off, you can just hold the key up to the panel on the door to unlock it. No swiping needed. There is also a control panel inside that can be set to ""Privacy"" or ""Service"" instead of little signs hung outside your door. The bathroom is spacious. There is a private area for the toilet (though you can still sort of see through the smoked glass) and the shower also contains a tub area for soaking (I made use of this every night!). the room was also very spacious, the bed very comfortable. The lights and curtains in the room (including the bathroom) can be controlled by a touchscreen panel at the side of the bed. This made for a very comical moments when boyfriend was in the bathroom and suddenly the lights would go out :)  I enjoyed the room very much. You get huge closets, with two hotel robes, luscious towels, a hair dryer. The only thing I missed was slippers! I would have really loved to have slippers too. Bath salts or bubbles would have been a nice touch too, although they are for sale in the gift shop.

The service at the hotel I would say is average. The people who serviced our room were wonderful. I appreciate the little details such as putting down little foam doilies (i dont know what else you'd call them) under our toilettries so that none of the countertops would get scuffed. Downstairs in the Casino, the hostesses were a little too attentive, sometimes getting in your way while you're at the tables. They also have no idea where anything is in the hotel yet either. Boyfriend asked for directions to Barmasa and was pointed in the complete wrong direction. Still some kinks to work out overall, but Aria as a whole is very promising. 

Another thing that bothered me was the fact that I can't cross the street in front of City Center. Crosswalks are equidistant from the entrance, so you lose either way. Unless you decide to play frogger in the middle of traffic. 

One bit of advice if you decide to stay at Aria, there IS a back entrance!! Our last cabbie was nice enough to tell us this, and it was SO much more convenient and less of a hassle getting back to Aria from Rio this way. 

Aria is probably one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at. I loved how modern it was, how clean and new everything is. I don't think there is a gimmick to this hotel like the others on the Vegas strip, except that it's new and shiny, and definitely attracts a crowd. I'd say it's worth checking out, and if you have the opportunity to stay here, you should give it a try :)",2,0,0

but what was starting to disappoint us was the fact we had a show to make Thursday night and wanted to quickly return to our rooms to shower and change before heading out again.
But as we return to our room our key cards didn't work, so we had to return back to the lobby and stand in line all over again and when finally having the situation of the key card resolved; we never received a sorry for that guys, or we do apologize for the inconvenience; nothing of the sort, okay no hospitality there. 
Then the day of our check out, as I am getting changed, housekeeping knocks then simply just opens the door upon us, no mention of housekeeping or of who they were they basically knocked and never gave us time to answer before coming straight in, we got a ""sorry I'll come back later"" and then not even an hour later we have some one from the front desk knock again telling my boyfriend they have it in the system as he check out already and they need to let housekeeping come in and clean. When he never did any such thing and our check out wasn't until 11 and it was 10 o'clock and the lady proceeded to tell my boyfriend he needs to call downstairs and tell them he never fully checked out and to not send house keeping up & he's like we only have an hour left but okay. Then as we proceed to leave and ACTUALLY check out, it shows he never checked out and if we had left and took the lady's word saying we did, he probably would've got charged for even more smh.

The hotel markets itself as a luxurious one, but for the common people among us, this hotel brings nothing but disappointments.
 
The impression begins with the 15-minute check-in queue (at 1am !)... Maybe if you order an expensive suite, you get a private check-in service, but the common folks have to queue.
 
On your way from the parking, you pass through the whole casino before you get to the lifts. A 5 minute walk. Some more long hallways, endless walking. Finally, you get to the room.
 
The room is modern, featuring fancy gadgets, but what about your own gadgets? Where's the electrical outlet by the bed?!
 
Oh, forgot your charger at home? Here, there's a set waiting for you on the table, at a scandalous price of $40. Ditto for an Ethernet cable. (Why, didn't you know paying dozens of $$ for a power adapter reaffirms how rich and successful you are?)
 
Need to put something at the fridge? This minibar, it's not for you. It's packed tight with snacks and liquor, all horrendously expensive.
 
Above the minibar, you can find a bag of potato chips, dubbed ""Hand-Crafted Signature Potato Chips"", carrying the hotel's logo, selling at 4 times the price of a pack of Lay's. So this must be what the rich and famous eat, huh!
 
Need Internet access? Shell out more $$. Somehow much cheaper hotels manage to provide this service for free.
 
And on top of that, with all the ""glitz and glamour"", it didn't take long to find dirty spots and signs of bad maintenance in the room.
 
Need to print something out? Oh why, there's a business center! ... which charges $1 per minute, $15 minimum! In any 3-star Holiday Inn, they'd gladly let you make use of a ""business room"" with a PC connected to the Internet and a printer, without charging you any extras.
 
The hotel makes sure to mark all the checkboxes of a luxurious 5-star hotel: anything you might need is ""readily available"". Concierge, private gaming, top-notch restaurants, business center, but what about the simple things? It supposedly caters to rich and upscale guests, or at least it tries to give this impression (let's face it, the majority of ARIA's rooms are common folks' rooms), but do those rich guests enjoy being nickel-and-dimed and grossly overpaying for things?",4,0,1

The hotel is beautiful, centrally located, and ""close"" (vegas close) to the hotels\/casinos my friends and I tend to frequent. Because of my M-life card, we scored some great deals on the rooms (on the website, the room we got for  ~$180 was listed at ~$400 ... I'll take it! We had 3 rooms under my name - 2 with 2 queen beds and 1 with a king bed. I totally understand that connected rooms are not guaranteed, but I did request it at booking, confirmed before checkin, at checkin at 10AM, and said we would wait for our rooms as long as we had to... and our 2 queen rooms ended up being just 1 room apart. I guess it's better that we were that close than super far, but come on.

Check in\/Check out - Check in here is one of the most inefficient processes I've seen at any vegas hotel I've stayed at. Mobile check in means you don't get to talk to a human with requests. Talking to a human means standing in a crazy long line only to be told that you have to talk to different people for the different questions you have (I needed a key to the room that was already checked into the day before and wanted to request connecting rooms for the other two) - meaning more lines. I've stayed at a few other hotels around this one, and I must say - those were a lot better. Check-out was fine - we paid extra for late checkout and they said if we left earlier, to let them know and we wouldn't get charged. We stayed late and I did mobile check out, which was easy enough - however, I had to call to get a final itemized bill - which I think should be automatically emailed out if you're doing mobile-check out.

Rooms - The rooms are great, spacious, and beautiful. The beds were meh, in my opinion - I tossed and turned the entire first night. There's a tablet that controls everything. Although the tablet said it was 64 degrees in our room, all of us woke up throughout the night with complaints of it being hot. The shower was great with good pressure. The only issue (that everyone I've ever talked about Aria to also has) I had with the rooms was that there's one group of elevators and the building is LONG - which ends up being super annoying (especially when one of your friends has a room on the other end, about the same distance from the elevator as you). Free wifi is great :)

Casino - I am not a fan of the casino here; I would much rather gamble elsewhere. Even on previous visits, I haven't found that the craps dealers are as friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic as other casinos and this trip didn't change my mind on that. We started here, played a bet, and immediately decided to go elsewhere. Our last morning here, we did play blackjack and those dealers were MUCH better (interesting, too, considering craps is considered the more social game).

Pool - we went to the Aria pool on a Saturday and with 6 out of 8 of us showing up around 2pm, you would have thought it would have been hard to find lounge chairs next to each other, however, the attendants were great in bringing chairs to squeeze by the few that our friends were able to save for us. We ordered food and drinks - food was ok, drinks were good, service was slower but good. A few small things were missing, but overall it was fine! There are water coolers around so you can help yourself which is great (not cold, though). 

Food\/Drinks - Didn't try too much at this hotel but... Starbucks is conveniently located on the promenade level by the guest elevators and while there is always a long line, it's expected and convenient! Jean Phillippe is delicious! Food and drinks at the pool were pretty good. Aria cafe was decent for breakfast, but not something I would frequent again with all the other options around. 

Concierge - I called the concierge (Kevin Carmona) to have them deliver a birthday treat for the person who checked in a night earlier in one of our rooms. It was very easy to order through him, he was very detailed about what they offered and the costs associated with it, and he said it would get there within an hour or two of check in and it did! 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. For the most part, all employees were friendly and accommodating! We would probably stay here again.",1,0,2

Reviewing based on what is aptly called THE BUFFET. 
Came here for Sunday Brunch ( we had a complimentary breakfast for two coupon from a neighboring hotel that is part of the MGM resort properties), and simply paid the difference.

A lot of choices, and nearly every  dish was delicious. Generous servings of prime rib, brisket, pork from the carving station. American cuisine  - biscuits, gravy, waffles, french toast, pancakes, huge selection of bread, rolls, muffins, pastries. Chines breakfast items of congee, dimsum. Italian station was really a lot of kid friendly choices including pizza. Seafood station has both hot and cold crab legs, mussels, clams, the scallop ceviche was not my fave ( I almost NEVER spit out food, but there was that bad texture and taste on the scallop). Enjoyed the cured meats and cheeses (Asiago, Fontina and one more choice). Quiche Lorraine was a tad dry (sitting in a warmer too long, perhaps). 
Smoked salmon and really peppery smoked trout also at the seafood station.
Fruit and salad station had a good variety but nothing spectacular.

Really good service from the servers (who bring out a carafe of coffee to each table). Requested a carafe of Iced tea and got that as well. 

They also will not clear your table until you are pretty close to ending your meal (when you start pushing away plates or stacking them to make room for more) so they are not hovering around.

my family & i spent xmas '09 in vegas & went to check out the new city center. i'm not much of a gambler nor shopper, so i was looking forward to spending some time gawking at architecture, sculptures & other stuff that had been hubbubed about.

parking was such a confusing mess - my sister is a seasoned veteran when it comes to vegas driving & city center had her beat with its lack of signage, backed up lots & confusing layout. we finally just parked at planet hollywood & walked over.

granted, i'm not an architecture expert - the extent of my experience is a year of office gophering for an arch\/design firm in culver city - but the structure of the aria itself was very bland. & i'm a little sad that city center is so ginormous that it drowns out everything that's interesting around it. there was a nice henry moore sculpture outside the entrance, & above the reception desk floated maya lin's colorado river-inspired piece. after some wandering around, we found a chocolate sculpture in their sweets store worthy of a food network challenge, then a cute pyramid-lined cactus garden upstairs in front of the steakhouse.

the casino floor was dark, smoky & the layout of machines & tables made it seem extremely cramped. i walked around a little bit & before long, noticed little blue pop-ups on the screen of almost every slot machine, not unlike the blue screen of death that haunts pc users. i don't know what the problem was, but whenever anyone tried to cash out they had to wait for an attendant to come by & personally hand them money! you'd think the village people were in town, the way everyone was waving their arms trying to get hotel staff's attention.

looking at other reviews, i guess the place is just going through some growing pains & should get on track in the coming weeks. but really, is it worth forcing an early opening just to catch the holiday crowd$ & ending up disappointing & scaring away potential return visitor$?

way to end the year, with a one-star review! better come up with something else to ward off the bad ju-ju.",7,1,0

Short & Sweet Overview: 

Pros - GORGEOUS casino and hotel with fancy and fabulous eateries.  Starbucks, Cirque du Soleil, 5 star dining, Pressed Juice and more all inside!

Cons - they don't have a lazy river pool and the restaurants are all pretty pricey.  There aren't any ""cheaper"" options aside from Starbucks (which is higher here than their normal prices) and Pressed Juice. Also, I could smell smoke in many of the restaurant options from the casino which I greatly dislike :-(


Longer Review: 

The casino is gorgeous with tons of the newest slots and tables but most of the tables were around the $100 minimum mark the weekend we were here which is too high for us but we did win on the slots - bonus!

The check-in and check-out process can take 45 minutes easy to more than 1.5 hours so try to do mobile check-in \/ check-out on their app.

They'll usually let you extend check-out from 11 to noon if you ask in advance.

We told them it was our Anniversary and they sent chocolates to our room - class!

We also had a bottle of champagne delivered to our room and the service was fantastic.

I really liked that security\/staff checked your hotel key each time you came back to the elevators \/ rooms portion of the hotel.  

The room (we had a Deluxe King Strip View European Plan) was gorgeous with a HUGE walk in shower and tub combined.  The room was beautiful and everything was controlled with an iPad!  Super cool to be able to open curtains or change the temperature of the room from the bed.

We ate at the ""Buffet"" for the weekend dinner ($44) and oh my was it ever good.  I think we were only able to nibble on about 1\/5 of the food stations.  Pay attention to the spots where the chefs cook for your to order!  The grilled scallop in shell and giant prawn was amazing!  We honestly didn't even get to try 4 of the chef stations.  The dessert station was insane and we were already way too full but seriously amazing.

Jean Phillipe Patisserie on the casino floor was AMAZING.  The savoury ""Forrest"" crepe was seriously the best crepe of my life.  We couldn't eat it at the tables because the cigarette smoke from the casino was so strong that it made me feel unwell.  So we just popped up to our room to enjoy our meal.  They also had the most gorgeous gelato I had ever seen. 

I would definitely stay here again although I would like to see a lower priced eatery (unless I missed it) and a quicker check-in \/ check-out process available.

Thanks Aria for a FABULOUS Anniversary getaway weekend! 

P.S. It's about a 10 minute walk from our room to the strip\/Miracle Mile Shops.",5,0,4

Arriving was a pain, and it took forever to find the front desk from the airport shuttle drop off.  I looked past that after seeing the sea of cars waiting for valet in front of the other hotels.  Once at check in, it took a full 30mins of waiting before we were offered a room.  All that angst however metled away when my friend and I were upgraded to the SkySuites for the whole trip.  

The SkySuites at Aria is something else.  Private elevators, great views, complimentary private limo service to the aiport , and get this - a private complementary bar and pantry for SkySuite guests.  Every night I was there I had a full dram of Johnny Walker Black, poured by yours truly.  Our ""suite"" was really just a very very nice double room, but it felt upscale even compared to our bachelor's actual suite.

The nightclub Haze was a decent time.  My friends got hassled a bit because we didn't bring in any girls, but since we got comp'd by the hotel, there wasn't much to complain about.  Beers and mixed drinks were expensive, but the high end stuff (like Johnny Walker Gold) was cheaper than in ATL bars so I stuck with that.  If you are gonna pay $25  for a drink - better one full glass of quality booze than two of watered down cocktail swill.  There was a lot of high end talent at the club, but most of them were hanging at the tables.  Seriously, if you are planning a Vegas trip in advance - just budget in getting a table.  It's worth it.  

The brunch buffett was pretty good - lots of high quality and tasty choices.  I also liked the steakhouse, the steaks were overpriced but cooked to perfection.

I don't gamble, but the casino wasn't all that smoky, and there were some awesome lounges and bars surrounding it that I wish we had time to visit.  Maybe next time.

For a first time-er to Vegas, the Aria did manage to impress.",0,0,0

THE GOOD:

- Nice atmosphere, architecture, decor, etc. It helps that it's new, but it's also generally stylish (both in the rooms and in the casino)

- Convenient tram to the Bellagio, close access to a variety of stores, nice and large driveway makes coming and going easy.

THE BAD:

- The rooms have this ridiculous touch-screen control pad. It's absurd. Admittedly, there's an ""ooh"" factor when you walk into the room and everything turns on (all the lights, the TV, and the curtains are computer-controlled), but after trying to turn things on and off using the touchpad at 11pm when I'm dog tired, the shortcomings of this system are profound. It's a neat idea, but very poorly executed...old-fashioned switches and knobs are easy and effective.

- The restaurants I tried were over-priced and the service is slow. The buffet was merely average, with a 10-30 minute wait for a table. The cafe was a long wait as well. The pizza joint was crazy expensive for what I got....The food is good, but nothing exceptional.. Certainly nothing worthy of the premium I paid.

- The casino is small, and the sports book is a joke. If you like to bet sporting events - or just hang out in the sports book - you'll want to go somewhere else.

- The rooms are nearly as expensive as much nicer hotels (like the Wynn or the Bellagio), but the overall experience is inferior to a hotel like the MGM or Hilton (which are similarly priced).

Perhaps in time the Aria will find a niche, but right now it seems like a conglomeration of a lot of different concepts: Part casino, part exclusive resort, part affordable and family-oriented hotel. All of this compromise left me less than impressed.

Still, if I can get a deal, I'd have no problem staying here again.",2,2,2

Where do I even begin? Lines were long to check in and out. Got into my room and the view was beautiful, BUT when the drapes pulled back I was SHOCKED to see something lying on the ground....try DIRTY LINGERIE!!! YACK! And NO this is NOT a TYPO!  Ok, I know we are in Vegas, but I really don't want the visual with it. Then I go into our bathroom..toothpaste splatter all on the mirror. Of course I called the front desk...waited 10minutes for a LIVE person to talk to me. They apologize and gave me a $50 credit..REALLY? They tell us our new room is ready and that our keys have been activated..uhhh NOPE. Got to the new room and the keys don't work! Had to call the front desk...AGAIN. Security comes...let's us in and leaves. To our surprise none of the lights turn because it's all digital!!! We are now in our room with no lights and me having to call...AGAIN AGAIN! By now I'm fuming. I had to call the front desk 3 times within the first 2 hours of being there. 

The next day we ask for housekeeping...bless their hearts..they did a great job, but the housekeeper had either dropped my bottle eye cream and tried to put the lid back on and BROKE the lid completely. I wouldn't have mind if it wasn't $100 bottle of eye cream!! I was seriously over it by now. 

To add salt to wounds, I asked for a late check out...by the time we got back from our breakfast our room keys were demagnetized! Are you kidding me! I had to call yet AGAIN for someone to let us back into our room to retrieve our luggage. We now had 15 mins to run, check out, and catch our shuttle to the airport.

I have had MUCH better service at other hotels then this first time experience.  Shame on you Aria! I expected much more from such a prestige hotel as this.  

When I get back home they send a survey asking how was my stay. I tell them the horrible experience I've had and still NO RESPONSE.  Paul Berry, Vice President, do you even read what your guests even write??? 

Trust me...the view might be nice, but that's about it.  

And since Aria seems to not want to acknowledge my bad experience ..I'm hoping you won't make the same mistake as I did.

This hotel was really crowded, and they ran out of rooms with double beds and rollaway beds.  Despite we booked our rooms for double occupancy, we did not get it and people in our party had to sleep on couches and on the floor.  I think the hotel still needs some time to run its operation smoothly.

Pros:
- Decor was contemporary.  Everything was new.
- High tech features in the rooms.  You can choose to open the curtain, turn on the TV with a specified channel, and turn on all the lights when you set the alarm clock.  I felt like a queen when I was woken up in style.
- The bath was in the shower.  Interesting design but nice.

Cons:
- Hidden hotel elevators.  We walked pass the elevator banks a couple of time because they are hidden behind the chocolate shop.
- The layout was not clear.  We did not know that there was another side of the casino hidden behind the Players Club until after we checked out.
- No covered walkway from Aria to Crystals Shopping Center.  You have to walk outside to go to the next building.
- $30 to use the fitness center.  The machines and equipments were upgraded from those in the 24-hour fitness.  But nothing special that was worth paying $30 a day to use the facility.",4,0,1

Pros: The room was very nice, clean and modern with a great view a (although we were only on the 6th floor....I imagine its even better from higher floors). We got the deluxe king room.  The bathroom had his\/her sinks, separate bath and shower.... all  very nice. There were some nice techie features like automatic drapes and bedside monitors that operated the lights, TV etcetera. The whole hotel and casino seemed never ending with lots of options for restaurants, events, gambling.  We went to see Zarkana Cirque Du Soleil within the hotel which was Amazing. It was also easy to walk to other Casinos and events... mostly under cover through the city center... there is also a Tram that picks up at Aria.  Very convenient. 

Cons: Check in had a long line but was still fairly efficient. I thought it was longer due to the fact we checked in on Xmas eve but looking over at the desk subsequent days there was always a huge line.  My only legitimate complaint was.....No coffee maker in the room!  A small thing, but this was a major bummer for me. It was a long walk to Starbucks on the 2nd floor and had to wait in a HUGE line to get my morning coffee. We also tried room service the 2nd day which was very nice but kind of a splurge at over 80$ for 2 plates of pancakes, a side of sausage, coffee and one OJ.

I was excited when we (my boyfriend and I) walked in.  Felt fresh and fun.  Check-in went really quickly and we were in our room in no time.  The room itself was nice.  

There were a few downsides:
-No fan in the bathroom (would help with privacy as you can hear everything your partner is doing in there)
-Not a lot of outlets (except the bathroom).  Was a game against time to keep two phones and an iPad continually charged
-No room in the fridge for personal things ($50\/day charge for another fridge).  To me this is a huge issue for a place that averages 100* temps and $4+ bottles of water.  I was told not to drink Vegas water.  I did one day and paid the price.  

My biggest issue was on my 2nd day (out of a 5 day stay) housekeeping threw away a bag of bandages, aspirin, Pepto, etc.  I had bought a large amount of items at Target to help with blisters and general sickness while on vacation.  I spent a good $40 on these items.  These items were siting in the Target bag with an empty water bottle.  When we returned to the room the afternoon of the 2nd day, there was one bandage sitting out on the counter and the rest of the bag was gone.  I was upset but felt if I talked to the front desk I could be reimbursed or comp'd some things. I talked to the front desk and was told I would get a call from somebody.  24 hours later I heard from nobody.  Called again and there was no record of my call.  Made the complaint again and was told somebody would call.  Again, no call.  The day of my check-out I called housekeeping and explained that I was checking out in 3 hours and needed resolution.  I wasn't wanting the housekeeper punished but just wanted to make them more aware of what they were throwing out.  They wanted me to file a police report against my housekeeper for theft.  Ummm....for bandages?  It was clear that they accidentally threw away the bag.  I'm sure they weren't there to steal bandages.  After arguing with them, I got a call from lost and found who wanted me to file a report on where I lost my items.  By this time, I hung up the phone on them and ignored future calls.  At check-out they comp'd our resort fees but it was frustrating that it took all of that time\/effort.  

Overall, ARIA was in a great location and was a fun hotel to stay in.  We did a lot of stuff outside of ARIA working our way up and down the strip.  Due to the insane amount of hotels\/casinos on the strip, I probably wouldn't stay here again but would recommend it for other people.",0,0,0

At least when it comes to traveling-my pops is a travel agent and I've been around (the globe, that is-get your minds outta the gutter please!). The Aria offered some promise from the brochures and online photos, but five minutes after walking in, I was cursing myself for even agreeing to come to Vegas. It epitomized everything about the city I hate, and no number of Bottega Veneta or Chanel stores in the adjoining Crystals shopping center can pretend to make it any classier than it is (or totally isn't).  Everyone in my group agreed-five of us with various levels of interests, standards and tastes.

The people staying there generally included guys with hair gelled so high they look 6'3"" even if their driver's license accurately reads 5'9"" and girls who yell at the elevator door man for daring to ask that they put on a shirt when they aren't by the pool. They make the folks of Jersey Shore look like Beaver Cleaver and make me want to vomit. 

But let's say you love Snooki and dream of carrying the same ol' tired Louie V. bag that every unoriginal 'fashionista' owns. This hotel still sucks. First the hateful, unfriendly woman at the front desk tried to stick us in a smoking section room despite us being booked in a non-smoking floor. The room had stains all over the duvet and pillowcases, and was tiny. When we spoke to someone much more normal downstairs they moved us to another room, which was clean enough, but nothing special.

The food was also a disappointment. I ate at the buffet, their cafe twice and all three times was underwhelmed. The buffet has a nice selection and staff is great, but the food is just not worth it. The cafe's menu was incredibly limited and the food was so bland I was feeling separation anxiety for Bellagio's options and general level of standard, despite the beautiful modern decor here.

Mkay, so by now you're thinking I am a major bitch. That's only partly true-I simply have no patience for places that tout themselves as luxurious destinations only to offer up a meat-market experience wracked with mediocrity and low standards. This place suffers from a confusion of what it is and what it wants to be. It sucks getting lured into the hype-it's all style, no substance. Though really, that's generally what I think about Vegas itself, so never mind me for not getting it. 

The casino pays out better than some others, so that's cool, but staying here isn't required for that. Other than to hit up some shops (Papillon made the trip by introducing me to the out of control, amazing sunglasses of Thierry Lasry-if you win big it's fun to poke around in here), move along.",10,9,3

I reserved two 2-queen rooms months in advanced.  When I got to the check-in counter at 6pm, the girl had to ask her managers to find a room for me because they were completely overbooked for the night.  It took her at least 15 minutes to find my first 2-queen room.  Then, it took her another 15 minutes to come back from her manager with a 1-king room.  She said the hotel always overbooks because they expect about 60 cancellations per day, but apparently no one is really canceling so they don't have enough rooms for their guests.  

Here's the deal breaker -- security at Aria is horrible.  I left a key at the bell desk for one of my friends who flew in late because the rest of us went out for dinner.  When I left the key with bell desk, I left them my friend's name without giving away the room number.  When my friend arrived, my friend realized her key didn't work when she got to the room.  She called security and they opened the door to the room for her when the room wasn't even under her name!  That means she could've gone to any room, and the security guard would've let her in and break into your room.  I guess now I've given away how to break into any room at Aria so stay at your own risk.

During our 2-night stay at the hotel, we had to get our keys replaced 4 times for one of the rooms.  The keys just kept on failing.  It would work the first time, but not again.  

The spa service was great.  I had the 25 minutes signature massage and the 25 minute red carpet facial.  The massage was so relaxing and my therapist really helped me loosen up my neck and shoulders.  The red carpet facial felt like a face explosion.  The tingly feeling they tell you about felt like a third degree burn at the time.  It did look great afterwards though.

It had 2 large flat screen TV's and a small one in the bath area, comfortable seating in a living area and a dining area that had a wet bar and an extra refrigerator (separate from the minibar) which made saving the leftovers from Aria's excellent restaurants a breeze.

The bedroom area was spacious and the bed was super comfy.  The pillows were the things dreams are made of...literally, I never had such sweet dreams.  The bath area, well it was the best I have ever had in a hotel.  Large dressing area, whirlpool tub, separate shower with a bench, large closet, and a toilet that well let's just say it was a magical toilet and leave it at that.

The assorted chocolates left at the evening turn-down service we really good as  well as the turn-down, everything laid out, room refreshed, everything tidied up, so nice to return to, the service was above and beyond.

I also appreciated the Aria's attention to security, some may see having to show your key when entering the guest room elevator area a hassle, but having stayed at less secure MGM properties (Mandalay Bay to be exact) and seeing the problems of lax security I appreciate the attention to guests safety and security.

This is our new go to hotel when visiting Vegas.",7,2,3

THE GOOD:
1.  Hotel room, hallways, casino floor, lobby, exterior all look absolutely breathtaking.
2.  Front lobby, concierge, housekeeping, room service, bellmen, express check out guys all provided excellent customer service.  You truly are treated like a princess...or prince :)
3.  Booking here, we got a 2 for 1 ticket deal for the O show and total for 2 nights on Memorial weekend was $333 including tax and everything.
4.  Housekeeping was so sweet- I had bottles of bath products laid out and I came back to find it all organized neatly for me.. YAY! :)
5.  They are FAST at checking you in, checking you out, getting your car.  Efficient serivce.  I lauve.

THE BAD:  
1.  One thing that sticks out like a sore thumb is the Valet guy on our first day there.  Tipping is not required, but with every guest that did not tip him when he hailed a cab for them, he made sure to make some sarcastic comment loud enough for guests to hear.  VERY unprofessional.
2.  Although I passed by their shopping mall attached everyday I was there, I never could find anything- everything was super overpriced.  Shopping experience just wasn't as fun as the forums at Caesar's.

OVERALL:

Being a huge Elvis fan (yes, really), I jumped on the offer.

Aria has a number of features that make it notable.  Its rooms are quite luxuriously appointed, and the universal remote to control every aspect of the room, from temperature to drawing and closing the shades, is very cool.  The rooms also provide free wifi, a welcome feature.  Also, being a craps player, I am very grateful they dedicate so much space to the craps tables.  There are 8 that I counted, which is pretty unusual.

As far as foods, Lemongrass Restaurant prepared some fantastic and authentic foods, which, quite frankly, was surprising for a ""pan-Asian"" restaurant.  The buffet didn't appeal so we skipped it; in fact, on a previous visit, I had the Sunday brunch and found it disappointing.

And of course, there was Elvis.  I liked this show primarily for the music, which were re-mastered recordings, occasionally mixed with some singing accompaniment.  The storyline is a loose and rosy biography of Elvis' life, and it kind of glosses over the rather sad and drug-addled tail end of the King's life and career.  Good, not great.  If you're a fan of Elvis, it could be worth seeing, but otherwise probably not too different from the other Cirque shows in Vegas.

On the negative side, customer service was mixed for an establishment with aspirations of appealing to high end clientele.  Many times the attitudes of the people we dealt with was just...surly, for lack of a better term.  They generally were helpful, but never in a particularly friendly way.  And at least 3 dealers I played with never cracked a smile or said a word.  Some of course were very friendly and chatty, but, again, I'd expect better attitudes at a high-end place, especially when the majority of blackjack tables on the weekend bump up their minimum bets to $50.  Also, a mistake was discovered at checkout regarding a charge, which seemed to have been resolved at the time, but I had to call back after returning home when I discovered the charge had re-appeared on my credit card.  Hopefully this time it stays dead.

Being that it was FOUR DAYS later i called to ask why. Apparently someone smoked in our room,,,, nothing found, no butts, no ashes, nothing.. purely based on smell. I explained to the girl on the phone that none of us smoke..one of my friends is a personal trainer and I have asthma. We absolutely would not have been smoking in a room with no windows and hardly any ventilation, quite frankly my throat would close on me. I called the hotel and spoke to a desk girl who advised me that they smelled smoke and needed to charge my room. OKAY BUT...

1.) Why\/How are you charging my card four days later then?
2.) If you did not find any proof of smoking in our room why are you charging me especially with out my knowledge or any warning
3.) Do you not recognize that this was EDC weekend and you did have wild youngins running around smoking in your hotel hallways (day and night might I add).. could you not have been smelling that? 

At this point the girl on the phone was getting me quite frustrated so i asked to speak to a manager. The girl on the phone gave me a run around for probably 35 minutes. Each and every single time I asked ""OK so if you cant help me can i speak to your manager"". After having been placed on hold at LEAST 10 times trying to speak to a manager the girl on the phone informed me that they were unavailable and that i would have to call my card company to dispute the charge. EXCUSE ME?? Why on earth would I have to do that? If your hotel is the one charging me why would I dispute this with my card company? They have not one thing to do with it... would your company like me to call them and lie saying a fraudulent charge is being placed? I know who charged me, i know (supposedly) why they charged me... why should i call my card company?

The concierge asked if we were celebrating anything (which we were) and she extended our check-out time to noon (yay) and I received some goodies in our room for my birthday. I recommend leaving your bags in the car if you are checking in before their check-in time. Our room wasn't ready early so they text us when it was. They gave us the keys ahead of time so when we received the text we could just walk into our room and not have to wait in the line for check-in again.

Only downside to this stay was the usb port technology. We couldn't connect our phones to play our music throughout the room which totally sucked.

You control all lights, temperature, curtains, alarm clock, entertainment, room service, check out service, etc.., The shower and tub are locked in one stall,  which is great. You got a phone in the toilet room which is EXCELLENT for those special calls!

Room service was quick and the food was not bad. Again, I had the $100 in food credit so I spoiled myself with the filet mignon. It was the best room service steak I had experience. It came with a 10oz, bowl of fries, and a variety of bread.

The downside of the Aria is what's downstairs in the Casino level. It's vacant and it just seems like a ghost town. It only has one gift and snack shop. You have the high-end Crystals mall next door but it only retails clothes. The resort is definitely catered towards adults and not families.

On the other hand... Beautiful rooms!
First stay here was in Jan 2010.  Booked a Panoramic Corner Suite.. GORGEOUS.  Kind of on the small side, but the decor was modern, but super comfy.  The bed was the best part.  Bidet in the water closet, just to inform, centrally controlled EVERYTHING, beautiful bathroom, great service.. I mean GREAT.  I called for a car at noon, went down fifteen min prior, and it pulled up at 5 to the hour.

Was upgraded to a 1 br sky suite (not the penthouse) on the second stay.  Gorgeous room.  I was greeted and walked through the private check-in, entrance\/elevator (no effing headache walk through the casino).  There was a little snack\/refreshment lounge-type area.  Really tremendous service.  Again, not a huge suite, not much larger and besides decor, really not so different from the corner suite.  Basically similar room with better service and view.  Jean Georges Steakhouse was pleasant.

I really love the rooms here, it's really just the casino and general area that irks me.  I am not a fan of City Center as a whole due to the awkward navigation design.  Aesthetically pleasing, but not the most functional design... wish it was more open.  It feels like you're locked in, especially with all the tourists walking around and bumping into you.  It's empty and over the top at the same time.. It just has this overall disjointed, unfinished feel.

There's like 3 entrances, believe the main one for the lobby is in the 'back', where the nice Buddha statue is. 

Layout wise, I find it is one of the easier ones to locate the restaurants (in the back), separated by a walkway to the casino floor.

Additional floor where the buffet is on 2nd level along with the French & steakhouse.

Let's see what Mr. Wynn has for us at the City Center.. the sharp design and neon lights were breathtaking!! 

My only complain is the front desk lady\/check-in.  2 queen size bedroom 4 days\/3 nights.  We arrived at 9pm, expecting our room to be ready.  The lady at the front desk said our room should be ready but the room is not cleaned.  Ok, she told us it should take 10-15 mins (to wait for managers approval on the cleanliness of the room before we checked in).  We can move to a 1 King bedroom , 2 queen size bed smoking room or wait.  We decided to wait.

I just want to check-in, drink, party and gamble. The front desk lady was being so rude, not apologetic at all.  I asked when the last guest check out, she said 5pm.  Ok, so there is 4 hours to clean a room and it's still not finished.  She made us wait 45 minutes while she ""talks"" with her supervisor.  Her reply, ""This happens to all of the hotels in Vegas."" Are you sure? We checked in at 9pm and you are still overbooked. When I stayed at Venetian and Encore there were no problems.  In fact, the check in was so smooth that I enjoyed my stay there than Aria. The lady even had the nerve to tell me to check the fine print on the website that rooms are not guaranteed. At this point I was so heated that I wanted to leave..period. I work in customer service as well, you do not cold-heartedly dismiss guests\/customers like that.  At the very least you can say it is out of your control and apologize.

Would I come back here? Most likely not.  The interior looks old, who decided to have dark brown as their wall panels? I felt like I was in a UPS nightmare. Hopefully other guests will have a better time checking in and if you do, do get the Strip View. 

Checking out is quite old school.  We thought you can check out via the TV; but not at Aria. You would need to fill out a card and drop your room keys into a box. They do need to check in the Key box before calling me and telling me that I will be billed for an extra day since I have not checked out.  I was already back home by the time they called me.

I really didn't appreciate the 45-minute wait time to check in... Now that is partly my fault, as I did not do me online check in. And after 12 p.m. they do not accept online check-ins. However the checking line was extremely long, and partly because they didn't have enough staff there to assist customers.

I did appreciate the chocolates left in our home to celebrate our anniversary weekend.

Just remember when you are reserving a room even when you prepay, you still have to pay for the Resort fees, and the self parking or the valet parking... BTW you have to pay for valet parking now at most if not all of the hotels on the strip.",6,2,2

Cons: Aria wants to cater to higher socio economic status people, tables are on the higher end. they will charge you $25 a day for maid service, even if you don't have your room cleaned.  All restaurants are overpriced (except for the Lemongrass which is the best restaurant).  expect to pay $5 for a cup of coffee.  The deli staff isn't very friendly.  The pastries look good at the deli, but be aware, they're not always fresh. you could wait up to 45 minutes just to check in and it will take about 15-20 minutes just to walk from parking to reception. If you want true luxury and don't care about the casino, stay next door at the Mandarin Oriental. I get bored with the Aria and find myself going to New York for a more relaxed fun time with more food choices. If you want to party with dancing and drinks.....go to the New York casino.  Don't stay here. 

Pros: Clean, Modern, friendly staff, good restaurants (overpriced), pretty casino. CVS is right next door. the aria train will take you to other casinos for free.  

I think I'm going to move on from the Aria and stay somewhere else.  I just realized the Cons outweigh the Pros.",0,0,0

There is also a really good pub there which is less expensive than the hotel's eateries.
Room was modern and nicely appointed although the bathroom fixtures were kind of cheap and they have this strange connected shower\/bathtub combo that was a fail.  The room had smart controls for everything, by the third night I had it figured out and then I checked out.

We stayed for a short weekend trip during the July 4th holiday.  The main reasons I chose Aria were because the rooms looked spacious, it had a casino and they had decent pools.  Also, the location was preferable because we wanted to be close enough to the strip that we still could walk to our shows at Bellagio and MGM.  We wanted to stay somewhere a bit quieter than other hotels because we were looking more for a relaxing weekend vs a party \/ raging trip.  Aria did not disappoint.  It was lively enough that it wasn't boring but was not crowded at all and bit more secluded from that young, party scene.

The check in process was a breeze.  We arrived around 9 AM but did the mobile pre-check in the night before.  I had requested an 11:15 AM check in time and just as promised, I received an email shortly after 11 that our room was ready.  We conveniently passed the long check in line and picked up our keys from the kiosk in a matter of minutes.  I loved that the elevators were split into 3 sections by floor number.  There was never a wait for an elevator and you breezed up to your room pretty quickly because you skip a bunch of floors.  Our room was on the 10th floor and while it had a back view of the hotel (not facing the strip) it was still nice and open enough that we could still have decent scenery.

The room itself was more than enough space for the two of us.  I saw other people's pics of things broken or dirty but found none of that in our room.  The room was not overly modern  yet not at all outdated and I loved being able to control the shades, lighting, AC and TV with the in room tablet.  The bed and pillows on our King bed were super comfy to the point we actually thought about buying a couple of the pillows for home!

The only reason I took one star off was because they charged us $16 for the minibar, which I'm still disputing.  The minibar must be extremely sensitive because all we did was open it and that seems to have set off the sensor.

All in all Aria turned out better than expected and we will definitely be back.",2,1,3

We've been a lot more often as of late on family business. The point of my preface is to let you, the reader, know I am not easily impressed with hotels and casinos. I'm jaded. My fascination and bewilderment have long ago given way to degeneratism. That being said, the Aria at City Center has rekindled my interest in the posh possibilities that Las Vegas holds.

We were offered 3 complimentary nights after staying at the dreadful Monte Carlo a month prior, also in the MGM group of hotel\/casinos. I was unsure what to expect, but figured what did we have to lose? The place was band new, how bad a room could they give us for free? We arrived late Friday\/early Saturday, groggy from the drive out in the rain. There was just a few people in line waiting to check in. We got to the counter and I promptly tried the good old $20 trick, which did not work this time. We were simply offered the same room on a higher floor.

After settling up at the front desk, we made our way through the casino toward the guest elevators. Along the way, I noticed a lot of interesting slots, some old favorites, some new, but right now, all I can wish for is sleep. We arrived up to our room, and upon entering the lights slowly came up, the drapes opened, and soft music was playing in the background. Now that's what I call a greeting! Hardly comparable to the smack in the face of stale smoke you get upon entering rooms in some of the older hotels. 

As mentioned in other reviews, the electronics in this room were nothing short of awesome. Although, I could not help but imagine an elderly guest trying to figure out the controls. I found them easy to use, and was very impressed. I would have been more impressed if the touch screen controller were wireless, but hey, you can't have it all... The bed was incredibly comfortable, the bathroom had a separate (yet together) tub and shower, as you can see from others' pictures. The wi-fi signal was strong, and the internet service was fast. Everything was really top-notch. I haven't been this impressed since my first stay at Red Rock, and this blows it away, no comparison.

Saturday night, we ventured into the casino. We were disappointed to see table minimums all set at $15 or higher. I'll be honest, I like to play tables, but the thing I fear most is losing so fast I don't have time to have fun. We decided to explore the slot options instead. There were many machines on the floor beckoning, and plenty of denominations to choose from. The slots all seemed a little tight, but not too bad. I think we lost a little, but not enough to complain. Cocktail service at the slots was a tad slow, but the drinks were healthy in both size and alcohol content. I much prefer the nice sized tumbler you get at Aria to those little dinky glasses you get at most places on the strip. I'm a big fella, and those go down in two or three sips.

Cocktail service definitely improved at the tables. We were lucky enough to find a  $10 minimum 3 card poker table (which promptly went to $15 once my wife sat down) and took a break from the slots. Dealers were friendly, as was the pit boss who promised a good rating. I hope he wasn't lying, because I already want to go back!

We, unfortunately, did not get to dine at any of the restaurants. The only meal we had at the Aria was the buffet for brunch Sunday morning, which was part of our offer and also complimentary. I was not impressed with the buffet for breakfast, especially for the price of $50 for 2 of us. I'm glad it was free, I would not have been happy to have paid for it.

In summary, (because let's face it, I've rambled long enough) this place is impressive. Any opportunity to stay here should be seized. I know I will return. Thanks Aria!",6,2,2

We were charged a resort fee on top of already paying for the hotel room. 
The toilet pipe actually broke!!!! That was a HUGE con. We have been to many gorgeous hotels, and even less than 5 star hotels and never has something like that happened to us. 
Housekeeping skipped our room one day, and came much later when we called. 
When it finally came time to check out... we were unable to do it through the TV. So we called from our room to check out, only to be placed on hold for 10 minutes. Finally when the staff returns, they say not only can we not check out over the phone, but that, we are 10 minutes late in checking out and may have been charged for the next day!

Why were we not told to that checking out over the phone is not possible in the first place!!! 

So we go downstairs to check out like everyone else, and of course there is a LONG line...mind you this is a random middle of the week Wednesday we checked out.

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of ""rentable""  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' ""cube"" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded ""resort fee"" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24\/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.",36,38,33

I usually prefer staying at The Trump, but Aria had cheaper rates and I figured we'd try something new. Also, didn't hurt that we were so close to Earl of Sandwich! The hotel is beautiful and our room was gorgeous, but the staff appears to have some communication issues and it just got really annoying!

The first 30 minutes we were in our room, we get a knock at the door from a maintenance worker. Apparently, someone had called in to fix the bathroom door? Umm... we didn't call and it wasn't broken. The guy checked the door and left. We were traveling with a toddler, so locking the mini fridge was super important because if you pick something up, you automatically get charged a $50 restocking fee. After several tries to lock the fridge, we call the front desk and tell them that the lock is not working. The front desk tries to lock it through the computer and it doesn't work, so they say they will send someone up to lock it manually. Maybe another 30 minutes go by and someone knocks at the door and says they are there to fix our bed... We tell the guy our bed isn't broken, but we we were told someone was coming up to fix the lock on the fridge. The guy gives us a tube of chocolates and tells us someone should be coming up. We wait in our room for 2 hours and no one shows. We called the front desk and they finally tell us that they won't be able to get someone to fix the lock until the next morning. That would have been nice to know 2 hours ago so we didn't have to wait around!

The next morning, no one shows. As we're leaving we finally get a call informing us that they have no technicians available to fix the lock. Ok, doesn't matter anymore, but we made sure that we didn't have a bill for the snickers my son tried stealing out of there. If they would have been honest from the beginning and told us no one could fix it, that would have been ok. It was just annoying having to waste our time in our room waiting for someone who wasn't going to show up. I don't appreciate being lied to and given the run around. Honesty is the best policy :)",5,2,2

We booked 4 rooms here for a family member's 50th birthday celebration.  Bottom line is we wouldn't do it again because as beautiful as the Aria is, none of their restaurants are suitable for vegetarians... or should I say vegetarians who want to eat well when on vacation.  Sure, a vegetarian could get something with calories in it, like bread, but when you're in Vegas, you want to live, even just a little.

See my other reviews for specific Aria restaurants and how they fall short (some of them failing, like Sage) for vegetarian diners.  Here's a brief re-cap:

Sage - vegetarians won't get enough to eat here, on just a calorie basis alone, unless they want to eat a basket of bread.  Vegetarian acommodations are made only begrudgingly and seem to punish vegetarian diners.  (Sure, we'll take out all the meat etc. but you'll only get an empty shell of a meal.)

Cafe Vettro - Denny's has better food, quality wise, but this is probably the place with the most options for vegetarians.  The wait is up to 40 minutes.  Cold, uncooked hash browns for breakfast.

Jean Philippe Patisserie  - skip breakfast, nothing hot offered that doesn't have meat in it.  The treats are prettier than they taste.  Most of the ""cakes"" are actually individual mousse's wrapped in a paper or sugar wrapper.

The Buffet - strangely has no real salad bar, just a small station that's smaller than most salad bars at Carl's Jr.

When you're spending a lot of money on a vacation, or like us, having a milestone birthday, you want to live it up.  Those who've been to Vegas know well how hard it is to get around -- it's a journey just to get to the next hotel in most cases, so often you're going to rely on your own hotel for meals and entertainment.  Those who designed Vegas *know* that.  That's what they hope, that you don't go elsewhere.

In our case, the birthday boy was turning 50 and he was the vegetarian.  We had 4 rooms including a suite  at the Aria and ate at Aria's ""premier"" restaurant (Sage) for the big celebration.  The birthday party meal should've been the jewel in the crown of our vacation, but instead it was a consolation prize at best.  The other restaurants didn't help.  The guest of honor had to supplement his daily meals by getting in the car and going to 7-11 to purchase things like nuts and bananas.

I think the Aria could do better at accommodating all kinds of guests.  Vegas is nearly on the west coast, only a 5 hour drive away from L.A.  How about some 21st century food options, like vegetarian meals and a decent salad bar?  Wynn's doing it.

p.s.  Like a lot of hotels, there's a lame usurious ""resort fee"" per day on each room that doesn't even get you privileges to use the spa facilities.  What you get for the ""resort fee""?  Wi-fi that barely works and access to the hotel pools (not the spa pools, just the hotel ones) that shut down very early.  Those should both be free, same as at Motel 6 and Days Inn, okay?

p.p.s. As another reviewer noted, the rooms are supposedly high-tech, wired for using remotes to control the curtains, tv, etc. but they're often broken or faulty.  Our tv was broken - we phoned tech help and a nice guy from the UK helped us.  He said the tv's in the corner rooms were having wiring issues in general.  He did however tell us a work around to get the Wi Fi working because you get dropped every 20 minutes or so.  That really helped.  FINALLY:  you can't just plug in your ipod to play music.   You have to buy a cord from Aria which is ""conveniently"" supplied at the mini-bar for $30. Geeeeeez.",3,2,0

Pros: 
1) The room was very nice. The 1 king bed room was big, modern, and comfortable.
2) I loved the shower set up with the big oval tub and a separate area for shower.
3) Casino floor doesn't have a strong cigarette smell like the other casinos.
4) Workers were all very polite, from the cashier at Chill to the bell man.
5) They come to turn down your beds for sleep and put chocolates on the bed. 
6) I think they have some kind of no kids policy because I barely saw any. That was nice.

Cons
1) I thought it was going to be closer to everything else but because it is in the back of City Center, it is actually quite an extra walk to get there. They call it the heart of City Center but it is more like the backbone, because it is not in a central location.
2) I got a room with strip view but because of cosmopolitan (I think), most of the strip was blocked. I got a nice view of City Center and MGM and that's about it. Not as nice as the real strip view with bellagio, Paris, etc.
3) We stored our luggage twice with the bell desk. The second time, they lost my water bottle that was in a side pocket of the bag and bent a brand new umbrella. We even told the bell desk to be careful handling the umbrella and they put a fragile sticker on it, but they still bent it! Also, it is partially my fault for putting a water bottle where it can fall out but considering this is not a cheap hotel, they should so a better job of keeping their guests' bags.
4) They made it sound like if you move anything in the mini fridge they will charge a restocking fee of fifty bucks. We were so careful not to touch anything but at check out, they told us we were charged for the chocolate almonds. Wtf? I'm 150% sure we touched nothing. And it was even sketchier when the front desk staff didn't even question me when I told him so. Does this happen often? Or are they trying to get away with these extra charges?
5) $28 resort fees!? For what? 
6) their touch screen control of the room is a really cool concept, but it was jot intuitive at all. We got some good laughs out of it (couldn't get out of nighttime mode during the day!) but it should be easier to use.

All in all, it is a beautiful hotel with great rooms but they have a lot of work to do before they become the upscale hotel they want to be. Aria did not meet
 expectations that I have when paying $180 per night for a room. I will try somewhere else next time I'm in Vegas.",0,0,0

When we arrived to the hotel, we upgraded to the executive suite. Omg. Best suite ever.

It was maybe around 2,000 sqft. It had 2 restrooms, a boardroom, kitchenette and a nice big bedroom.

With this suite, we had access to the lounge which offered great refreshments that were complimentary. Service was great. 

They also arranged transfers to the airport. 

It was 2:43pm and were sitting in the Las Vegas airport... my Bf comes up to me and says: ""You're going to kill me"". But with a half drunk smile on his face. 

""I forgot the money in the safe"".

So immediately, I call ARIA. I speak to someone in security. It's 2:58pm and we are the last to board because we're debating on whether or not to stay and go pick up the cash. They called me back and told me that they sent someone to go check and all the money that he forgot was there. Phewww. 

Unfortunately, they can't mail that much money. So they had to cut a check. This trip was epic. 

Thank you, Aria! Fan for life.",2,1,2

I was really excited about going to vegas because I usually dont like to go, but I thought new hotel woohooo!! It wasn't as woohoo as I expected :\/ There was definitely not enough people at the front desk to check people in, we waited for about 20 minutes. 

The room was nice but it had some glitches like the one remote to work everything didn't really work everything. Opening the blinds was delayed and it turned on the wrong lights. However it was really cool that his name was on everything. The decor of the place wasn't as fancy as I had hoped either. It was very abstract, which I usually enjoy, but this was not too eye catching or exciting. 

Don't even get me started on the service. We got lunch the next day at one of the restaurants and the service was horrible. It took 3 different servers to finally  bring us our drinks, and they didn't even bring a cold glass for a beer. We asked for lemons twice and never got them. Then our original server disappeared and we ended with a new server. 

At one point we thought to ourselves we were just looking for things to talk ish about the hotel. The thing that blew me over the edge is that we went to the spa and I went into the bathroom and it was sooooo uncomfortably hot in the bathroom, it was disgusting.

The beds were very comfortable, the tv is huge (you can connect your iPod), there is a good amount of floor space, and the bathrooms were nicely done and included both a shower and a bath tub. Everything in the room can be controlled by a tablet at your bedside. Including the curtains! The floor to ceiling windows provided a beautiful view of the strip.

But this last visit was just okay for a few reasons -

1) I arrived at 6pm and my room was not ready.  Huge bummer when you're traveling and tired.  

2) The morning of check out, housekeeping attempted to OPEN my door around 930am, without even knocking.  Why don't they know who is checked out yet?  

3) Room service.  They have new iPads in the room where you can put in your breakfast order.  It said please allow 30 min for food to be delivered.  I put in an order of yogurt and tea and after about 45 minutes, I called to see the status.  The person who answers informed me that the wait is actually 60 minutes.  Assuming it was a new iPad system issue, I asked if there was anything they could do to speed my order up, considering it was pretty simple, and they said no.  

4). Uncomfortable bed!  I don't know what happened, but 5 years ago when I first stayed at Aria, I made a mental note that it was the best hotel bed ever.  This time my bed was way too soft and had a weird center line that rose up and poked into my back, almost like it was 2 twins that had been pushed together.  Maybe it is time to get some new mattresses?

Love the rooms, love the atmosphere, love that it doesn't smell like cigars despite all the smokers. 

I have been to Aria on more than one occasion and besides the key cards sometimes not working that is the only negative I have been able to find. 

Love that they have a remote control in your room that allows you to control the lights, tv, music, even the damn drapes.  Love it when your buddy is in the toilet and then you turn off the lights from the other room.  He turns it on, then you turn it off.  Yes it is a bit childish, yes I am in my 30's and yes it is still funny to me. 

But the coolest button to me is the  ""Goodnight"" button.  When you hit that button, everything shuts off.  The TV, lights, the drapes close and you have a dark room to knock out even if it's 11 a.m. and you are just stumbling in. 

Also if you gamble in the Casino area, how can you not love that they offer you Macallan scotch.  That is some good scotch that at a regular bar or club it's worth almost $15.  Love those penny slot machines just for that reason.

This was the first time we stayed at the CityCenter-the hotel is walking distance to Vdara, Mandarin Oriental (which I think we want to stay next time...), Cosmo and the shopping areas.

Rooms are pretty standard, but extremely clean and an excellent bathroom. Lotions and shampoos had a mix of lavender and cedar- nice.  Views are pretty amazing and although the hotel is typical Vegas huge, it still seemed manageable. The gym is absolutely amazing-state of the art everything-you have to walk through the spa area to get to the gym and the lavender smells are awesome.

The restaurants are excellent (even the Buffet was pretty good-we had late breakfast there and it is quite international-very reasonable price too). For breakfast, I would go to the Buffet rather than the Aria Cafe if you like various breakfast meats, scrambled eggs, potatoes, dim sum and variety of pastries.  The food at Jean Georges Steakhouse was pretty amazing, despite the uppity waiter.  There is a STARBUCKS on the second level- loved the fact that the drinks were stronger (like they added an extra shot of espresso) and the scones were glazed and huge!

I recommend that you call housekeeping prior to your sightseeing. It is  a huge hotel and it is best if you call housekeeping at least half an hour before you depart (especially if you like to take an afternoon nap in a clean and refreshed room).

There were only a handful of kids:-) -very helpful to have a serene experience at the pool. The hotel is definitely kid-friendly but it really doesn't cater to the family of 5. A lot of couples and groups of friends.

Room was quite nice and the bed was comfortable, however like a lot of people mentioned the technology was glitchy. 
Being a new hotel, they do still need to train their service employees a little better, concierge was completely unhelpful.
Check-in was a bit of a challenge because like a lot of people mentioned, there is no formal line. Just pick a spot somewhere in the lobby and walk up when you see a open spot at the front desk. 
Pool and hot tub weren't too bad, fairly small given the scope and scale of the entire hotel.
Overall I think I would love to visit a year from now to see if they are able to work through the customer service issues.

Stayed here again in the corner suite on the 51st floor. Wow, what an experience, amazing views and the room was huge! Now you will wonder why I haven't added an extra star... well I think they still need to work on their service issues or at least IT issues. Attempts to call the front desk from the phone in the room was a waste of time, the phone would keep cutting out (the wired phone and wireless) I got so frustrated I just went down to the front desk in person. Also they advertise that there is a iPod hook in every room in the hotel... well they forget to mention except in the corner suites. This is still a work in progress and they hope to have it down by the end of the year. When I asked how they could help me, they asked if I would like to be downgraded.

From the entry to the hotel, to the exit process after checkout, the service level was severely inferior.  Allow me to list a few of the issues encountered over a 2 night stay.

If you come in via shuttle, no one greets you and takes you to your room.  Most hotels of this caliber INSIST a bellman show you to your room.  Not here, you are given a map and are on your own.  Thus, forced learning about the high level of technology on your own.  Daunting at first but eventually you get it.  No one in the hotel can intelligently explain it, either.

Eventually our bags arrived separately, and this guy didn't know anything but how to carry a bag.

When you arrive at your room, it has the normal key less entry, but it also include a number of electronic indicators for ""Privacy"" and ""Service"" on the outside.

The housekeeping staff thinks the ""Service Light"" is ONLY to used make the bed in the morning.  That included the manager of housekeeping on the 52nd floor.  We allowed the service light to burn (without response) for 12 hours at a time, to refresh towels and other items used during mid day\/evening showers.  We NEVER got them replaced, except during the morning bed making.  It was 114 degrees, so multiple showers daily, were mandatory.  The staff either ignored the light, or 
looked at the room, did nothing, and left the light on.

Upon arrival all the lights didn't work in the room, and it took 2 trips by maintenance to rectify manual switches that over ride the computerized controls.  Apparently not on the housekeeping list.  We also had to call for soap, discovered after the need arose during a midday shower.

Got charged for a ""birthday comp"" and probably wouldn't have caught it, if our room charges were more active the second day. BEWARE, the billings are very hard to understand and evaluate.

The computer system that controls everything  crashed twice, causing the room to be ""dead"" and uncontrollable for 10 minutes at a time.  No lights, phones, movable drapes, nothing.

The automated Check Out system also crashes.  We always saw long lines at check out and couldn't understand WHY the systems wasn't being used.  We couldn't check out via telephone, Internet or the in-room TV and tried for 50 minutes, almost missing our shuttle to the airport.  It took the bellman at the pickup point to finally get us checked us out, and I never received a detailed billing via email as promised.

My wife was literally ""run over"" by the large gent seating us at the breakfast buffet, because he was too busy texting, while leading others to their table to notice her in his path.  No comment or apology, it was like she didn't exist.

The food service staff in the buffet doesn't understand the need to clear dishes, glass plates from the table, or refilling fluids like coffee or water.  We finally had to ""bus"" our own table.

The cocktail service in the bar is abysmal.  They are more concerned about clearing glasses from empty tables  (and there we a lot of empty tables), and replacing dead candles on them, then getting drinks to new customers.  From the time we sat don't until we received our CORRECTED drink orders was over 20 minutes.  

I spoke to the beverage manager, and while he was polite, he was nonplussed by our comments.  You don't need to worry about getting drunk, the incredible wait between drinks will eliminate that fear.  We watched other tables and they had the same issues as us.  

BTW, our own ""dead candle"" was finally replaced 50 minutes after our entry, during the servers 5th trip to our table, to give us the bill.  I think 2 Crown Royals for $46.08 (without tip) is a bit much.

This is a wonderful property, marred by incredibly inept management and execution of services.  We've spent most of our travel in high end properties, and frankly if this one is rated 5 diamonds, its more because of the facilities, not the service...  I gave it 2 stars because of the same reason, it deserved only one.",0,0,0

But first, I'll say 8pm is a ridiculously early gym and pool closing time, when you require people pay for it in a $28 per day fee for services at the hotel. The internet connection that is free might as well be non-existent. We were there for a computer conference and it was embarrassing to not have our internet working.

Now, onto vomit bags. On three separate occasions in the evening, we saw women in nice clothing being wheeled into elevators by staff holding her head and pushing her. She was clearly over intoxicated. So what did they do? They found a red and slightly black bag, about the size of a whole foods bag, and they covered her head with it. That way when she got sick there would be a bag over her head and she wouldn't throw up anywhere. Please, please, use a back elevator for this instead of the main drag? Second, I saw one on the way out on a stretcher. They used that same silly bag to put over her head. She was dressed to kill, on a stretcher with a vomit bag over her head. This dramatically takes away from the 4-star ambiance they are aiming for.

Now, I appreciate that the hotel needs a line of credit hold on your card to make sure you don't run up a bill. However, they put three holds on my card, $172, $933, and $344, curtailing my credit line. The piece of paper I signed when entering was for a $500 hold. They are in breach of contract, and days after leaving, the pending authorizations are still not off. This is simply unacceptable. Accounting told me we owe $112. Holding 10 times that out of my credit line is a ""do not return signal for me.""

Getting a cab here is a little easier than other places. And they have pigeon benches (really). And they are central. 

But don't take things out of your minibar to cool off something of your own - they will charge you a $50 rearranging fee. Unless you want to rent a fridge for like $30 from them. This is unacceptable for a 4-star aspiring place.

This hotel is state of the art with futuristically beautiful decor. It made the other hotels, that are not that old, ie; NY NY, MGM, Luxor, Excalibur etc. etc. look outdated at best.  The deluxe double room had a most comfortable bed with giant feather pillows and a large picture window with curtains that opened with the remote control.  The remote control could be used to do any and all the lighting in the room, tv, drapes, alarm.  I felt like I was in a James Bond movie. Many excellent restaurants in the hotel, pricey but great food.  You did not need to leave the hotel for any reason, unless of course you wanted to see entertainment elsewhere.

As one of the newest additions to the Strip, it's always fun to walk around the new casino floors and to visit the shops. I'll admit that I'm a fan of the classy yet modern theme they went with; however I do wish they had better integrated all the buildings in the new 'City Center'. It's a little annoying that I can't walk easily from Aria to Cosmopolitan when both buildings were essentially built at the same time.

The rooms were impressive. Anything that used electricity was linked together and could be controlled from a single remote. Setting your alarm to open the blinds and turn on ESPN was pretty neat.

The rooms did have a couple downsides. The fully-integrated electronics could be a little annoying (ex: navigating the remote to choose a channel to watch was arduous). Also, the bathrooms didn't have any locks for privacy (but they were quite luxuriant).

One of the main differences between this and the Bellagio is the tablet in the room that can control the lighting\/shades\/temperature\/etc.  You can even order food if you want to pick it up at a couple of their restaurants.  Very convenient.  Although the timing is off.  If you order lemongrass, your food will be ready alot sooner.  If you order from five50, they won't even make your order til a future time (I went to pick it up and they said it still had bugs and that they can start the order right away).   Thats the only two places you can order from, hopefully they add more and fix the bugs.  I also think the menu is limited for pickup which is unfortunate.  Also for platinum members---be prepared to wait for checkin\/checkout.  They used to have a separate section, which seemed to move pretty quick, but not anymore.  You have to wait for the first 2 attendants (invited guests sign), and everyone else gets to wait for all the other attendants.  So, this time, the 2 people I was waiting for took forever with helping the current guests, and the other line was moving quick!  I could not believe it took over 45 minutes to checkout. The only thing that made this worse was the person in front of me kept cursing at how wrong this is, and the couple behind me stood really really close to me. Worst 45 minutes of my trip, and I had some really bad luck at the tables.  Something is wrong with this new system.  Maybe the lady working near the line was supposed to make sure the invited guest line is moving?  Who knows, because she was just talking and laughing with a co-worker the whole time.

I love the decor, the modern architecture and the smell!! I had family staying in one of the suites and got to check it out and loved the design and view.

Just got back from a vegas trip and this time I got to stay at the Aria and I still love it but there was 3 things I didnt like...

1) The AC - You can set it to as low as 62 or something but the temp NEVER went lower than 70... and usually never went below 75 during the day. It seemed like it only worked well at night...

2) Room Size - The size of a regular room is about the same size as a normal room at The Mirage... I usually get great deals at the mirage so a small room is no problem... but spending so much money at a hotel that is brand new and cutting-edge, I would expect bigger rooms... still... not a huge con but it would have been nice if the rooms were the size of say Palazzo\/Venetian.

3) It's a lot farther away from other casinos than you think - Its easy to get to Bellagio... but anything further than that like Mirage, Wynn, Venetian, etc... its a looooong walk. It takes a long walk to hit the sidewalk... so most of the time you will take a tram to bellagio then walk outside from there... usually its ok but when your drunk and tired that trip can be killer lol..

You can control anything with a simple touch of a button. They don't have DND door tags - press the privacy button next to the door and voila! The chocolates for their turndown service were good. The bed was very comfy. Flat-screen TV, mini bar, fridge, nice marble bathroom with separate shower and tub. The toiletries are by Citron - I was expecting something better but oh, well.

Aria is one of the new very tall hotels at City Center in Las Vegas.  Here is a rundown on the pros and cons (a pleasant experience overall).

Pros:

--Nice rooms.  Contemporary, clean and comfortable.

--Location.  City Center is near a lot of the action (with casinos like Caesars and Bellagio closeby).

--Lots of places to eat in the hotel.

--Because of its newness, the smoke smell is less strong.  Still, I feel Bellagio and Wynn are better at clearing out the smoke.

--A different option.  Not as ""theme-like"" as other casinos.  This could be a pro or con depending on how you feel about those ""theme-like"" casinos, but at least it provides an option for those who are looking for something else.

--The interior\/decor of the hotel\/casino (like the rooms) are modern and sleek.

--The exterior is pleasant to look at and all glass (very similar to the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott at LA Live).

Cons:

--While Aria is located on the Strip, it is a little bit of a walk to get down to the sidewalk to visit other casinos.  I like walking in Vegas, but this may be a con if you are not wearing comfortable shoes (or need to get somewhere quick by foot).

--The rooms are small.

--I think their rates are a little higher than other serviceable hotels nearby.

--I only tried one food place (Cafe Vettro) and it was not good.

--While this place is a different option, the lack of a theme or style gives the hotel kind of a too simple feel.  Once again, good or bad depending on your perspective.

I haven't stayed at many hotels in Vegas so it is hard for me to rank Aria, but my experience at Aria was pleasant overall.  Since Aria is near a lot of casinos I like, I would come back, but I would do so only if I got a good deal.

Note: They have little packaged accessories (such as an iPod auxiliary cable and charger) next to nuts and candies on the counter.  These are obviously things (expensive things) you can buy (like the minibar).  The items are weight sensored so if you pick one of them up, the hotel automatically charges your room.  So you lift it, you bought it.

They will take it off your credit card if you picked it up to just get a better look.

Trivia: Aria was featured on a recent episode of ABC's The Bachelorette.",28,20,25

My room had a city view, sunsets = amazing view. It was also spacious, modern, oh and the bed was super comfy ! I was on the 18th floor which was a plus for me. The higher the better. I did almost everything I dined, I played games at the casino (first timer), went to the liquid pool lounge (good vibes), went to the spa (great massage), and checked out their lounges & clubs.

All I could do was file a report over the phone with the security staff. If my item is returned or if I am reimbursed I will update this post, but as of right now they have not contacted me.

Mankind lives only for hedonistic pleasures and everyone is young, thin, and beautiful.  To me that's the theme of the recently opened City Center and Aria Casino.  

This would be a great place to hole up in the event of a worldwide viral epidemic or a zombie invasion.  I'm sure the place is hermetically sealed and the glass is zombie-proof.  I could imagine armies of the dead banging against the Aria's 24-hour cafe's glass walls as I enjoyed my $18 bacon and eggs.  Service is so attentive and congenial, it was almost like MGM Mirage had created a staff of ""Stepford Wives"" robots or clones.  When we ordered drinks in the Aria's Deuce lounge, the smoking hot cocktail waitress sat right down next to me to take our $15 each (!!) mixed-drink orders.  As she closely leaned forward (giving me an eyeful of her beautiful décolletage), I thought maybe she was going to offer to come to my room afterward.  I guess service is good only up to a point.  :-)

I was surprised to see $10 minimums at the craps tables.  Compared to similar upscale competitors like the Wynn LV and Caesars Palace ($25-$100 minimums), that's pretty reasonable.  As I was the only one toking the pit crew (what's wrong with these cheap rich bastards?), they happily chatted me up.  

Base Dealer:  ""So sir, what do you think of the Aria?""
Me: ""It's pretty but it has no soul""
Base Dealer: ""What places do you consider to have soul?""
Me: ""I love the El Cortez and Golden Gate""
Base Dealer: ""Huh?, Those places are dumps""
Me: ""Hey those places give me 10x odds, can you do same?""
Base Dealer: ""Uh, no"" 

Despite the less favorable Strip odds, I caught a hot roll and walked away with more money than I showed up with.  That paid for drinks at Frankie's Tiki Room plus I bought a Frankie's T-shirt.  :-) 

Overall the Aria was a nice place to visit but I doubt that I'll return (unless that zombie invasion happens).",2,6,0

2001: A Space Odyssey, much?  Lights gently rise to on; curtain smoothly slides open revealing a stunning view of city center and the strip. Beautiful amenities, sparkling bathroom, fluffy towels, comfortable and clean beds, clean carpeting, rows upon rows of down filled pillows on each bed, a crystal clear LCD flat screen. The room had lots of drawer and closet space. Bathroom was nicely tiled and very clean with extra towels and lots of little resort shampoos and conditioners, soap etc. In room wireless for free, a multitude of outlets and electronic connections. Certainly the nicest room in which I've stayed while in Las Vegas.

Beware the mini bar and any prepackaged goodies - your room is automatically charged as soon as you remove the item from its place through use of weight sensing racks. Very tempting but extremely pricey peanuts and drinks. 

When I first entered the lobby, I was stunned; the casino was nowhere to be seen. This is a place for those that like to dine, shop and relax. Absolutely, there's a casino, it's just hidden behind a wall of artwork unlike every other casino in town. Soaring glass ceiling, plants, marble floors. Beautiful. Of course, once you check in, that's when you have to go through the casino to get to you room. Only guests with key cards are allowed to the elevator banks. Nice. 

This early weekend in March was unusually warm and the pool had just opened. One of my best friends from college and I headed down to the pool. Terrible soundtrack but gorgeous setting, palm trees, hundreds of chaise lounges, beautiful pool, plenty of sunshine. The pool is not hidden behind the casino like many other places on the strip. Somehow, the sun is blissfully everywhere. The best part? Why, of course,  the 32oz margaritas served at poolside with any tequila you fancy - Patron Silver in my case. Two of these bad boys each and we are plastered. Head over to the hot tubs for a little relaxation. It's time for a nap before hitting Carne Vino for dinner. 

How's the casino? Nice, very nice. Perfectly new, packed, exciting. My buddy won $400 at craps so profitable as well. Not being a big gambler, I spent just enough time at a blackjack table to have a couple free drinks. Nicely lit and not smoky at all. 

Room service for breakfast on the way out on Sunday morning was excellent. Eggs benedict, thick ham, perfect hollandaise sauce, nicely toasted English muffins and perfectly poached eggs. Fresh brewed and deliciously rich pot of coffee. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Expensive as room service always is but in this case, absolutely worth every penny. Quick service, friendly delivery, sparkling flatware.

This place is definitely worth a return trip. I've stayed in three different casinos and walked through almost all of them at some point. This is clearly the winner. Extremely centrally located on the strip. Excellent deals and clean, clean, clean.",8,4,4

The girlfriend and I flew to LV and when we arrived at the airport the Skysuites limo driver was waiting at baggage claim for us. We got our luggage, and he proceeded to take my girlfriend's luggage for her. The entire arrival into to Skysuites was flawless. As soon as the limo pulled up into the private entrance to the hotel a bellman was already getting luggage out of the car before we were out of the door. The limo driver proceeded to walk us all the way inside to the reception desk where a very pleasant lady name Olga assisted us. 

While checking in another person came by with complimentary beverages. Originally I had booked a mountain view Skysuites during a special they were having, but I decided to ask about a city view if possible. Olga was happy to inform me that I could have an amazing room on the 56th floor facing the strip...at not extra cost to us!

After arriving at the room we were amazed. The curtains opened, the Tvs turned on, music started playing... welcoming us to the room. The room in itself was immaculate. Plenty of space, very well designed, and they made efficient use of the entire layout. I know other reviewers were complaining about the in room technology but I found the technology easy to work and was extremely innovative. Being able to control the entire room from a touchscreen was something really nice. Plenty of times in other hotels I would forget to turn off lights, close the curtains, etc before hoping into bed, but with this it didn't matter. With the simple push of a button labeled ""goodnight"" everything turned off, the curtains closed, and we were at peace in one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. 

The rest of the stay was remarkable. The pool was really nice, LIQUID was a blast except for the $100 minimum for a lounge chair, Cafe Vetro was delicious, the buffet for a Sunday brunch wasn't half bad, and the tram from city center to Bellagio was very convenient. 

All in all I did not have any problem with the hotel, everything was perfect, any staff that we walked by in hallways or the casino always greeted you with a smile and hello.

This hotel is 5 years old already, and some of the age is showing in some places.  The other reviews aren't wrong - some of the furniture is beaten up.  But - the housekeeping is good and I felt the place was clean.  We stayed here for FREE once 1.5 years ago - that was our first time.  It was a good room, high floor, service was great, buffet was good!  This is our second time - paid full price, check in clerk asked what was the occasion - to celebrate a bday!  Put us in a lower floor corner room with a sliver of a window without a view of anything good.  The worst part was lugging our stuff to our room only to have the keys non functioning.  Had to go all the way back down and back for new keys.  Later that night, their free wifi wouldn't recognize our last name and room #.  Called front desk at 11:30pm only to have them have us talk to their IT dept to troubleshoot their wifi issues.  It took an hour.  And when speaking with this front desk woman, the only thing she offered was a $50 credit to food and she kept specifying not including gratuity.  And she would remove the resort fee for one night *if and only if* they couldn't fix the wifi issue.  What kind of customer service rep says that in a luxury resort?!  In their system, they had our last name wrong, but we had to spend the hour troubleshooting like morons in this high end resort at midnight.  The tech managed to manually connect us via our IP addresses and bypass their system.  I guess no resort fee refund.  The worst part was rather than empathy or professionalism from the front desk girl, she said even her devices can't connect sometimes here, and there's *nothing* she can do.

We did have reservations for their Spa services - which were excellent facilities and staff.  We ate twice at their breakfast buffet - which staff was fantastic but food selection is very minimal and just ok.  

We stopped booking at Paris 2 years ago when they started to really go downhill in customer service.  We want to be loyal to a property - we hoped it was Aria.  But we will definitely keep looking.  We are going to try the Wynn and Cosmopolitan next.  Prices aren't the most important - it is feeling like you're welcomed and that they sort of care about your stay!",1,0,0

The room is huge and the view is awesome. The cool gadgets and tech options are interesting but really not needed. The housekeepers are awesome don't forget to leave them a little something for their service.

Things I liked:
Security, free parking, valet, doesn't smell smoky in casino, pool, lots of food choices, not as expensive as you'd think, people are very helpful

Things I didn't like:
Everything is pricey, can get crowded, can be a long wait to check in (we've stayed here 3 times. 1st time it took 10min, 2nd time was about 30min and last time was about 2min), sports book and restaurant outside of it.

You can save a lot of cash if you sign up for their offers on the website. They will send you texts. The last time we went it was 150 total per night with a 50 per day resort credit. It was great! We selected the last week of January and stayed M-F. The 150 included taxes and resort fees!

Shop around for the best dates and deals. You can stay here for the same price as an off strip Holiday Inn. This is not the best hotel in Vegas but it is awesome! The hotel décor is very chic.",0,0,0

Sort of a mobile charging valet  which is really cool. I like the good life because the service comes with high expectations....that's why you pay premium prices. The hotel rooms were cool. The view from the 52nd floor was breath taking!! Some of the amenities did not work....the phone. And they offered to do nothing about it until the next morning. So you lose points for that!

I'll stay pretty much anywhere as long as its clean and I feel safe.  So when it comes to the Las Vegas strip it's pretty hard to not have either of those things amongst all the major resorts, therefore differentiating can be difficult for my experience.  

The Aria has beaten out every other place I've stayed in Vegas and given the comparative prices it should have.  Had it not there would have been a problem.  However, I was completely blown away by the standard of personal service we received here that I catapulted it to five stars due to an excellent combination of personality and luxury.  

We arrived at the Aria at about 11am local time and we headed in to drop our bags off until we could check in.  Much to our surprise our room was ready and our check-in hostess was incredibly delightful.  She smiled constantly, very knowledgeable and possessed the ability to have a conversation with us that was genuine and not awkward.  Now take this experience and move it over the course of the entire resort and the duration of 5 days and you have the Aria.  Every encounter (from the shops, restaurants, players club desk, housekeeping, etc) was fantastic and that is not an easy thing to come by these days.  Kudos to their human resources staff in their hiring procedures.

Now, for the facility itself, it is beautiful and laid out very well.  There is a good mix of different ranges of restaurants and bars.  The ambiance is phenomenal.  It does not have the congested feeling of say Caesar's or the Bellagio despite having nearly the same population on the casino floor.

The rooms were very nice.  The technology stuff is a little over the top at first but we essentially did not touch the tablet after the first hour and did everything manually.  I would have preferred a coffee maker in the room or at least a soda machine (make it expensive I don't care) on every floor so I have a caffeine option in the morning without heading downstairs.  However, I sucked it up and headed to Starbucks on the Promenade in my pajamas a couple days surrounded by businessmen in suits, oh well.

All in all, it was a great experience at the Aria and it is a place that I would consider staying again if I decide to stop trying new resorts every trip.  They should be proud of their personnel and the atmosphere they have created there.",3,0,0

the rooms are smaller than wynns but also half the price.  we had a broken light in the room and made it very dark for most of the stay.  when we notified them, it took them a few hours to come and fix it.  by that time we were out of the room.  the tub, shower and toilet are all in the same room, making it somewhat difficult to share a bathroom.  the tub was inside the shower too.

The front desk clerk was not very nice, I mean, technically, nice but the policies were pretty lame and she wasn't very polite about explaining them to us newbies.

They ask you to leave a deposit equal to somewhere in the range of $125 per day pre-charged on your credit card to be able to charge anything to your room and apparently, one of the promotions they were running with a free buffet a day was tied to this deposit.  Since we were there for 6 days that was TOO much money to have tied up in one place for us so we opted not to do that. It made getting the promotion a huge pain, the cashiers at the buffet had to call the front desk each time.

I would have likely spent much more $ if that deposit wasn't so steep. We ended up paying as we went, which isn't good for them, that second $25 drink by the pool (granted, they're HUGE) would have seemed a lot easier to order if I was just signing a bill rather than pulling out cash or a card.

The rooms, however, were really nice and the beds are as comfy as previously reported. Shower set up is in front of a large soaking tub, with the sinks and mirror in front, toilet to the side behind another sliding glass door. Figuring out the remote is tricky for the first day, then it's fine.

The pool area is great though, just stay away from the one near liquid as it gets WAY TOO LOUD. I also found that by the weekend, it was too 'Jersey Shore' party central at the back pool for my liking, from about 11am and on, it was too crowded and trashy for me.

The rest of the hotel is fine and good, the decor is a bit manic, but the stand out employees were the bell staff and the pool security guy, both of them were AWESOME.

Still, there was an additional charge of about $30\/day to use the spa area - hot\/cold pools and such- since we normally stay at the Red Rock and it's included in the daily 'resort charge' this seemed lame. There's still a resort charge of $20 a day but it's just a glorified tax, it's not like it's optional.",5,6,5

Now the bad...

I consider myself an old school kind of guy.  I've been to tons of hotel & casinos around the world, and this hotel's customer service is extremely lacking and the way that they take care of guests feels downright insulting.  My party had rented out about 15 rooms for a bachelor party, we booked the flights and hotel through Jetblue which included flights and hotel and even a promotion to a show in Vegas.  Right off the bat, we should have sensed something was wrong when we tried to redeem the show tickets by calling the number they provided and the number was ALWAYS busy! I mean we tried calling every 30 minutes for 6 hours straight.  Ultimately we had to call the Front Desk and speak with a manager to even take advantage of the promotion.  He said they were extremely busy, which is why the phone is always ringing off the hook. Really?  In this day and age and with all the money people put into gaming, you can't afford to have multiple lines for a promotion for a group of people that are going to be visiting you hotel and spending money??? OK, i let it go...

We arrive to the hotel and attempt to check in...""I am sorry sir, but all we have available are king rooms, we are completely booked""... That would be cool, if I were staying with my wife, that would be cool if I were staying alone... But I am here with 25 guys, we booked double beds and now you want us to stay in a king room because you overbooked?  That's BULLSH*T! With 4004 rooms, you are telling me that you are completely sold out? After arguing for about 15 minutes with the clerk, suddenly a double opened up...  Go figure huh?

Ok, all checked in... We arrived on Thursday, NO SERVICE to the room until SATURDAY, even with the SERVICE request light on...

Casino?  I sit down to play, and the pit boss comes running over and says to the Dealer in a rude way ""Check his ID, don't deal him cards until you check his ID"", now I am happy to oblige, sh*t, its a compliment to be thought younger. However, every casino I have been to prior to this, the pit boss is really courteous and comes over and politely asks for ID, this pit boss basically demanded I show her ID and when she saw I was 30 years old, she just walked away. No Apologies for being rude sir, no have a great time sir.  Just shut her mouth and walked away.  

Needless to say, I will NEVER come back to stay at Aria again.  I enjoy casinos that treat their guests with respect and go out of their way to  make them feel welcomed.  Aria fails miserably at customer service. If you want to make a comparison, ARIA is like that totally hot girl that is nice to look at but is a total bitch when you go up to her.

Walked in and immediately took note of the intoxicatingly delicious vanilla smell that is filtered through the lobby. Check in line was long but moved pretty fast. We were checking in early- 11am- so I tipped the girl checking us in $20 in hopes we could get a room right away. Ended up with a strip view room on the 30th floor and it was ready immediately. Sweet! The girl was super sweet, asked us if we were there for anything special. I told her it was my bday trip and later when we got back to the room there was a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and coconut cakes. Delicious and the gesture was thoughtful and appreciated. 
Room was nice and clean. Beds were fab. View was great from our room. Major hike from the elevator though. Glad I didn't bring heels this trip!
Pools were ok. I was disappointed that there wasn't a poolside restaurant during the week and the pool menu is lackluster at best. Cocktails are pricey but strong and creative. One off putting thing was the sewer smell that permeated around the pool area. We sat at two different pools on two different days and the odor was noticeable at both. Yuck. 
We didn't eat at any of the nicer restaurants on the property as we had dinner elsewhere both nights. Aria cafe was a major disappointment for breakfast and I was bummed at the lack of good breakfast places in the vicinity of aria.

First the good: The rooms have very nice, good sized amenities, robes in all rooms, good closet space.  The beds are comfy, if you like those types of bed that are very plush, it felt almost like sleeping on a cloud.  

The Casino is very...uncasino as it lacks the constant ding, ding, ding of machines with bright gaudy lights and smells like Vanilla.  The décor is richly colored and textured with fabulous artwork.  There is almost no wait time for elevators, and it is situated well on the strip.  

The bad:  Customer service is sorely lacking.  The casino is large so for those of you who don't put service as an important factor then this should not be a problem as there aren't many instances where you will come in contact with guest services.  

We arrived on a Thursday night, the lines were shallow, and there were plenty guest agents ready to check-in guests.  The line we picked was a bad choice.  We were probably fourth in line and it took about 20 mins to reach the check in counter.  When it became our turn to check-in there was no greeting, no smile, no warmth to our GSA.  The GSA had told me that I had booked a room with one bed, when I needed two.  She asked if I wanted a rollaway bed to be put in the one bed room for no extra charge, otherwise, it would be a $30.00 per day fee to get a room with two beds.  Now. Working in hospitality myself I knew this was complete bullshit.  I told her that the extra fees made me feel like I was being nickled and dimed in what is suppose to be a 5 star luxury hotel and casino.  Her stare was blank and she then again asked me if I wanted a rollaway bed.  Frustrated with the slow, blank stare of this GSA I asked to speak to the manager.  
When I spoke with the manager, I again was met with resistance.  I told him that I was disappointed that a hotel so large and upscale would try to nickel and dime guest.  He sternly informed me that charging more for two rooms was the Aria's business model, and that this will be a trend most hotel companies take.  I then told him that I work for a hotel company, and that this is the last thing we would do to guests.  At this point the manager knew I was not going to cave.  Begrudgingly the manager told me he would waive the fee as if he was doing me some sort of tremendous favor.  
Also, while the remote controlled everything in the room is very cool and novel, things are slow to work (like a 3 second delay even when going through a tv guide), and there is a distinct clicking made by the lights as they start to cool or reset themselves, which is annoying as you are trying to fall asleep.

Also we needed to call engineering as half of our bathroom controllers and outlets did not work.  This however was quickly rectified. 

Resort fees were $20.00 a day plus tax.

All in all, the hotel was shiny and pretty, but don't expect anything below the surface.   Until they can provide a better customer service experience I probably would not go back.",1,1,2

The amenities are great, and absolutely love the pool and gym! However, this time I noticed several things such as worn\/slightly torn carpet, the ironing board got stuck open and could not close, batteries on tv remote were dead,and the worst was probably the privacy light would not stay lit. So when I was trying to sleep in, I had people constantly knocking on the door asking if I wanted the room cleaned. I did mention the issue to all of them, guess it never got passed on. Also, the water pressure in the shower was intense to say the least! There's no way to adjust it, wear a shower cap if you do not want you hair to get wet because it literally sprays all over and even into the bathtub on the side. If it wasn't for these small issues, I would give Aria a 5 star. Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, and the rooms are extremely clean.

Our flight got in very late at night.  We checked in with no problem, but once in our room, there were no electrical outlets bedside and I use a machine to help me breathe at night.  When we called the front desk, they said they would come right up with an extension cord.  Well, that was 45 minutes later and by now it was 3am and we were very tired.  Finally, the service person came in but the extension cord was too short and hung 3 feet in the air next to the bed.  He apologized and said he would get a longer cord in the morning.  Ok, so if I got up in the middle of the night, I could easily have fallen on the extension cord and hurt myself, but they didn't seem to care about that.  Oh, and when I told the front desk, she said I should have ""asked in advance for an extension cord.""  Really?  Even a Motel 6 has an electrical outlet next to the bed!  Then, the light was out in the shower.  We called about that and they did have it fixed by the evening.  Honestly, the people working there were pretty cold.  Everything in this room is on a computer, so if you are not a techo-savvy person, don't stay here.  What was REALLY frustrating is after eating out one evening, we had a doggy bag and moved around some cans and snacks to make room in the mini-frig.

And not a strong like, just a middle of the road type like. We'd go out on a date again if she were paying and I had nothing better to do type like. But let me start at the beginning.

Aria is a very pretty property. I guess the theme is ""trees"" because we saw them all over, and the overwhelming color scheme was chocolate brown. If you are sensitive to smell, be warned, the vanilla scent is pretty strong in the casino area. There is lots of art and the Christmas decorations were very pretty and matched the ""tree"" theme.

We stayed over the Christmas holiday, and the casino was pretty busy, which I was pleased to see, being a local.  Check in was swift, and I requested a nicer room on a high floor.  We got 21st floor with a view of the Cosmopolitan pool, so I guess that qualifies.

The room definitely has all of the technology bells and whistles. Wave your key over the door panel and it unlocks the door. The tv remote controls everything from the curtains to the lights to check out, and there is a panel near the bed which controls l everything in the room as well. The curtains opened and the tv played music upon your entry. At times it was a bit confusing, but we figured everything out pretty quickly.

However, I was not in love with the layout of the room. I much preferred Vdara in terms of layout to Aria, actually. The entryway seemed to be a misuse of space, and the bathroom was a bit strange. The bathtub was enclosed in a ""room"" with the shower instead of having the separate shower and tub. The water closet (ie toilet room) was surprisingly large, but had a frosted door rather than a real one, so if someone was washing their hands or putting on makeup, you could see the person in the toilet area handling their...business, which was kind of icky.  There was no fan in the water closet, either.

The bed seemed a bit too soft when I sat on it, but it actually was very comfortable. It was like sleeping on a cloud. 

Now for the bad... We left our room to do some post-holiday shopping at about 9:30am. We turned on the ""service"" button on the panel by the door.  As we left, we noticed that housekeeping was servicing rooms right near ours (we even spoke to them) and figured that our room would be cleaned shortly. We returned back to the room at about 4:00pm to find that our room had NOT been cleaned, which was really annoying.  I called down to housekeeping, who apologized and said they'd send someone right up.  30 minutes later, no one had come. We went downstairs to the front desk and put in another request for service. They said they'd spoken to a supervisor and would send someone up. We went back to the room, 20 more minutes, no one had come. We found a housekeeper on our floor and asked her, getting more and more annoyed. She radioed a supervisor, and FINALLY after another 15 minutes someone came to clean our room. Getting our room serviced at 6pm is a bit ridiculous, especially since we'd been gone all day!!

Cocktail service was pretty nonexistent. I only played for about 30 minutes at a time, but never was approached by a cocktail waitress.

The Spa, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. I will write a separate review for that, however. 

MGM and their resort fees...Whew! Tax and resort fees (which include free access to the gym and free Wi-Fi) totaled almost an extra $40\/night. Make sure to factor that into your calculations. 

All in all, it was ""fine"", but I'm not going to go out of my way to visit Aria again for my next staycation.",1,0,0

A few years ago I had a very specific issue with the hotel and wrote a complaint to the VP while highlighting all of the positives. I was extremely impressed with the response and it kept in the back of my mind. 

Fast forward 2 years and I was back in Vegas for a Bachelor Party and while most of the guys were staying at the Cosmopolitan I reached out to that VP to see if they could win me back. Did they ever.... it was an amazing 5 days at the Aria. As expected all of the restaurants were amazing, the room was beyond expectation and the service on all levels was what you expect from a top notch hotel. They have earned my trust and I will stay at the Aria from here on out. 

Now big deal you might say.

The next day, they apparently did not have record of anything downstairs, so we had to go through the process of asking for a better room all over again.

Our friends tried to call the front desk to check out, after being placed on hold for 15 minutes they went down. The person at the front desk made it sound like it was an incident problem.

When I went to Vegas in February, I walked through City Center and got caught up in the fact that they were opening up a Tom Ford store in Crystals. Afterward, my friends and I wandered through the crowded casino and marveled at Schnabel's take on Walken and the craps pit that was FREEKIN' AWESOME!!! 

Last Saturday, a friend and I took our regularly scheduled, every 8 weeks, impulsive trip to Vegas and stayed at Aria. What a great idea it would be. After-all, we play there, we eat there, there's very attractive cocktail waitresses (The best in Vegas) and they have a $5 limit craps table on most nights. Aria is FREEKIN"" AWESOME!!!

My boyfriend and I came down for a quick holiday weekend and stayed here for 2 nights.   Now let me just tell you the one and only selling point here (everything is just complete icing on the cake):  The.  Beds.  Here.  Are.  The.  Most.  Incredible.  Beds.  I.  Have.  Ever.  Slept.  On.

I don't think I moved a single inch during the night because of how comfortable I was and how amazingly perfect this bed was.  I don't think I've ever slept on a more heavenly bed.

Some more positives for you:  

The bathroom is huge and the bathtub is what your dreams are made of.  Take as many baths as you possibly can.  Need to shower too?  No problem, it's right next to you.  It's fantastic.  It's amazing.  

Most of the room is controlled by a tablet that charges on the nightstand by your table.  You can turn off and on the lights, change the ""mood"" of the lighting, control the TV, control the drapery, order room service, turn on music, and turn the lights in the bathroom off and on.  Like... what?  I can't even fathom this stuff in my wildest dreams.  Maybe I'm just... too middle class for this.

The room itself is quite large and roomy (at least the king sized bedroom is!), with ample space for ambling about and drinking prosecco at 8 am because you god damn can.

A negative is there is absolutely no space to put things in the fridge... it's all full of things that IF MOVED for more than 60 seconds, they will be charged to your card.   Sure, I'd love to just eat the stuff in that fridge but a bag of gummy bears would have set me back TWELVE DOLLARS.

I can't be too mad though.  This hotel room treated me nice.. REAL nice.  I even won 100 bucks in the casino with a dollar in the 25cent slot machines.  I can't complain.

The ambiance of the whole hotel and casino is very upscale, and very relaxing.  I can't explain it better than that.  It's worth the money and the stay.  You will not regret this.

(1) So we get to Vegas around 5pm and get to the hotel to find that Aria has a daily parking rate of $15, even if you're staying at the hotel..... ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Since when??? 

(2) There was a huge line at the front desk so we decided to try the mobile check-in. BIG MISTAKE! I followed all the instructions, which prompted me to ""wait for an email"". My bf and I went to the bar to get a drink while we wait. We waited for 15 minutes, which turned to 30 minutes, which turned to an hour! After waiting a total hour and a half, we decided enough was enough. We didn't want to wait any longer so we went to the mobile check-in staff member to ask for help. I complained, telling her how long I waited and STILL haven't received an email. She said the system was down and that we had to get in line and check-in at the front desk. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! So I had waited an hour and a half for NOTHING! Good thing I went and asked... I could've waited all night!

(3) When we finally got to the front desk to check-in, they only had QUEEN bed rooms available, when I booked a KING room. We didn't really have a choice but to take it. 

(4) When we got to the room, we immediately realized that one of the key cards they gave us wasn't working. When we went to the front desk to complain, they said it was another technical error on their part.... SERIOUSLY?????

(5) Key card... whatever. I let it slide. So we went back upstairs and call the bell hop for our luggage. 10 minutes later, the bell hop brings the WRONG LUGGAGE! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! That made us wait another 15 minutes to get our luggage. 

(6) There are a couple things that I really didn't like about our room, other than the fact that we should have had 1 KING bed instead of 2 QUEEN beds.... Our sink counter was SUPER small. I barely had any space to put my toiletries and makeup on it. PLUS our sink was all clogged and gross! ALSO we didn't have a bath tub! I checked the list of amenities before I booked the room... and I went to Lush and got myself some awesome bath bombs so I was SUPER disappointed to find no bathtub in our room.

(7) After staying in our room the first night, we complained and complained and were FINALLY able to get the KING room that we booked. 

And for going through ALL THAT TROUBLE, there were no comps on anything... We should've had that first room for FREE if you ask me!

the first thing we noticed when we got in bed is that it was slanted...with feet higher than our heads, a little odd, and the bed was soft but very lumpy.  since we were exhausted, it didn't stop us from sleeping.
in the morning, such a LOUD racket!  when we left the room we discovered there was construction on that floor.  they were scraping the wallpaper off and hammering off things.  why was anyone staying on that floor!!!
and i was not impressed with the bath supplies; not much lather in the shampoo or bath soap.
when i checked out, i mentioned the bed issue and the construction to jasmine, who checked me out.  she apologized, (and of course not her fault), but there was no compensation or offer of an aria bag or anything.  so for those reasons, they don't get 5 stars.

I really don't like cigarette smoke and the smell is usually my biggest gripe about hotels in Vegas (and about Vegas itself). While Aria is not smoke free (except for the smoke free guest room floors... if you want completely smoke-free stay at Vdara next door), they have taken huge steps to minimize the smoke impact in the public areas of the hotel, particularly the casino floor, and it makes an ENORMOUS difference. I'll never stay at another MGM, Caesar's, etc. The smoke smell really is a night-and-day difference.

The check-in process was a nearly all day affair!  Upon arriving at the hotel, we had to wait over 30 minutes while the significantly under-staffed (but very professional and very nice staff) checked in hundreds of guests.  After a long walk with our heavy luggage, we arrived at our first (of 3) rooms.  The high-tech room system was not functioning - we weren't able to open the blackout shades or operate anything electrical in the room so hotel management secured a move to the room next door.  After a nearly 30 minute wait (and 3 phone calls to the front desk), security showed up with our new room keys.  After settling in - it was clear that this room didn't work either.  The high-tech room control device malfunctioned here too.  This time, the shades stayed open, we couldn't turn off the lights, and the TV couldn't be operated.  Another call to the front desk manager (Jennifer) and she offered to send engineering and due to the ~60 minute wait time we decided to spend our time by the pool (that experience is detailed below).  After two room software re-sets, it was determined that we would need to be moved again.  Again, another 45 minute wait (and 2 phone calls to the front desk) before the bell man showed up to escort us to our room on the other side of the hotel.
This room worked (except for the slow drain in the shower which caused water to overflow onto the beautiful bathroom floor).  The bellman didn't bring our new room keys (as was promised by the front staff) - so on our way out for the evening, we stopped by the front desk to pick up a new set of room keys.  They were still swamped!  Not even a manager was available to get us keys without waiting in yet another 30 minute line.  We gave up and just went out for the evening. 

The pool area, while beautiful and spacious, was not a good experience either.  It took 1 hour and 30 minutes before we were served our first pina coloda.  We flagged down the attendant, who confessed that only 2 people were assigned to the hundreds of pooside guests.  We were offered the opportunity to stand in line at the bar for a cocktail - but were adivsed that the wait time was expected to be at least 30 minutes.  Did I mention that this was on Friday afternoon?  How would they be able to handle weekend guests?

To be fair - the hotel did credit us a one-night stay and a $100 food\/beverage credit.  There's really nothing more they could have offered, but even a free room and $100 of drinking was NOT worth this much hassle!  We literally lost nearly one day of R&R.

I wish I had time to check out the gym and spa in the hotel.  I think the hotel has different kinds of suites and rooms depending on your needs, but we just got regular rooms and were very very pleased.  The views from the 34th floor of the Aria was awesome.... during the day AND night.

Our room was very spacious with a living room, dining room, two bathrooms (one of them being super massive with three sinks and a bath tub in the center) and a bedroom. Whoever thought I would say this but the housekeeping were on point with EVERY LITTLE THING in our room! Our room came out organized and super clean every time they touched up the place.

THE CLUB: We came the last weekend Haze Nightclub was open before they shut down for awhile for remodeling. They played awesome music on Saturday night with DJ E Rock as their resident DJ.

Wow factor? Check.  
Luxury? Check.  
Modern rooms and decor? Check.  
Reasonably priced rooms?  Check.  
Good location? Check. 
Upbeat Vegas ambiance? Check.

Yeah, it seems to have a little bit of it all.  The rooms are very nice... especially with the impressive ""first-time"" entrance to your room (all of the curtains, lights, and music open and turn-on automatically in grandiose fashion).  It is a bit of a rush, and you immediately have that ""Wow"" factor.  The rooms are appointed with modern decor and furniture --  you just get that feeling of luxury even in the standard rooms (I've also stayed in the Suites and they are one of the best Suites I've been in Vegas).  

I must say that with all of the fancy technology in the rooms being controlled with the ""one-button-does it most"" type of controls, it also happens to be a downfall in effectiveness and simplicity.  It's frustrating to figure out which button controls which lights, and to what degree.  What sucks most is that by the time you finally figure out what button does what, you're just about done with your visit!   I would recommend providing simpler light switches or controls to provide quick, easy, no-nonsense control of in-house electronics.  

The in-house restaurants are good.  There is a Starbucks, a Tapas restaurant, Todd English Pub, a slice Pizza place, and a breakfast\/coffee place as well.   There is also the Crystals shopping mall in the next building which has many of the big name designer labels and high end restaurants as well (Mastro's Steakhouse and Wolfgang Pucks restaurant).  

Not a huge gambler but I do play, and I did enjoy the friendly black jack dealers who didn't have  the smitten Vegas attitude that many dealers have at other gambling places in Vegas.  As a sports fan, I would have liked it better if they made the Sportsbook more of an important piece of their gambling area with more grandiose tv's and leather chairs.  The Sportsbook is off to the side -  almost as an afterthought with a poorly laid out floor plan.  The poker tables section looks a little small, but in turn, it gives the effect of being crowded and lively each time visiting that area.   Plenty of designer fun type slot machines (you know, the goldfish, the wheel of fortune, or spin and win type of slot machines), and there seem to be more video-digitized versions of Roulette, Craps, and Blackjack than I've seen elsewhere).    
 
I used the Fitness room during my visits which is very nice.  Great view of the pool and more at least a dozen treadmills, and spin cycles, with weight machines as well as free weights. 

I like the semi-centrally located location on the strip.  It's walking distance down to Caesars and if you don't feel like walking, you can take a inter-hotel tram to Bellagio for free. 

For it's newness, and upbeat Vegas feeling, this is my favorite spot in Vegas as of now.  I'll keep coming back.",10,5,6

Their Hotel room IMO, is a little bit lackluster, I didn't complain but the room I got had defective controls for the shades and lights. The touch screen monitor didn't work next to the bed which made it annoying to walk up to turn on and off the lights at the corner. Not too big of a deal, but at least the bed was comfortable. 

Where Aria really shines IMO, is their casino. I love the casino and the wide range of it. Their poker room is pretty much the best in Vegas. The only property on the strip that can even come close to challenging them are the Wynn properties but they don't offer half decent rewards. 

I also ate at the resident Lemongrass Thai restaurant there, I would say it was just decent. I think I should have tried the steakhouse.

For an extra $5 or $10 (I can't remember the exact amount) you can have bottomless champagne, but you need to mention that when you pay. We found that vital piece of information out AFTER we paid, but the waitress was kind enough to let us in on the deal upon ordering our drinks. 

As far as atmosphere, I enjoyed the vibe. There was a lot of nice lighting, not too harsh nor too dim, perfect after a night of heavy drinking and\/or gambling. The colors are soothing and there's huge windows that let you see life outside the casino\/hotel. The booths are comfortable enough that my friend decided it was safe (and okay) to lay down on the un-frumpy cushions in between plates. Food is basically sectioned off by genre: seafood and sushi, breakfast, meat, dinner, Asian, desserts, etc. 

Food wise, it was OKAY, hence the 3 stars. The crabs are pre-cracked which I loved, but other than that the food was not all that special. Also, they don't serve mimosas. What!? They have champagne and orange juice, but they don't serve the two together in a glass. Several of us ended up ordering juice and poured it in our champagne glasses ourselves. (*Sidenote: If you decide to take on the self-made mimosa, it's best to use a spoon to transfer juice into the champagne if you can't pour quickly enough.)

an all expense paid staycation, if you will.
From the moment we stepped foot on the property, everything that could've gone wrong did!
The worst thing about it was that nobody gave a crap leaving us very disappointed and dissatisfied with their service.

the hubby's company must've had at least 50 rooms reserved per night as well as the conference area for meetings throughout each day for a total of 2 nights and 3 days.
we assumed that we would receive top notch service because we were a part of this large group.
we assumed wrong!

we entered our corner suite on the 'omg, i'm so high up, i might throw up'th floor.
at first glance, we were amazed.
the technology in the room is incredible (everything is controlled by one little remote), the views from the corner suites are beautiful and unobstructed and the room itself is nicely decorated with a comfortable bed and beautiful furnishings.
the bathroom is awesome looking especially with the jacuzzi tub sitting smack in the middle of it.

but then, as we began unpacking and putting our stuff away, we started noticing the little things that are seemingly unimportant but can definitely take a 5 star review down to 1.
i opened the mini fridge to put our waters away and found the last guest's leftovers.
i called down to housekeeping to inform them of their mistake.
the woman who answered the phone said to me, in the most condescending voice possible, ""did you want me to send someone up to your room to throw it away for you?""
to which i replied, ""no, that won't be necessary.  i am perfectly capable of throwing it away myself.  thank you very much""
so, i grabbed the laundry bag (which is plastic, btw.  um, you're a AAA 5 diamond hotel.  use nicer bags!) threw the leftovers in it and left it in the hallway outside our door where it sat until the next afternoon.

we never received a call from the front desk to ask if our room was sufficient.
seriously?
i've received better service at a boutique hotel in torrance, ca!!!
and this is supposed to be a AAA 5 diamond hotel?
wow, AAA must have some seriously low standards.

i went to use the toilet and the light in the water closet was out.
OMG!
are you f'n serious?
do you not check these things before the next guest checks in???
i called down to maintenance to have it replaced but they never came.
i didn't bother calling again.

then i used the sink to wash my hands.
after doing so, i had to use a bath towel to wipe myself, the mirror, the counter and floor down because the stupid faucet splashes everywhere when you put your hands under the water.
worst design ever!!!

this all happened on day 1.
oh, but we ordered room service and that was actually good.

day 2 - we returned to the room sometime in the afternoon and noticed that we still hadn't received housekeeping services.
called down to request it (didn't receive an apology or an explanation as to why it hadn't been done yet) and then went out for dinner.
upon our return, we noticed that the bed had been made but nothing else had been done.
a plastic laundry bag full of toiletries (about 5 bottles each of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion) was left on the bathroom counter.
none of our towels were changed but a stack of towels was left on the sofa in the living area.
beyond frustrated, i decided to take a bath in the 'oh so luxurious' tub.
BIG MISTAKE!!!
the tub design is so not functional.
i filled the tub, threw some bubbles in, got in and turned the jets on.
to my surprise and dismay, water and bubbles started ejecting themselves out of the tub, onto the bathroom floor!!!
so, of course, i turned off the jets.
about 1\/3 of the tub water had been splashed onto the bathroom floor.
i drained even more, down to about half and turned the jets back on.
didn't help!
same result.

thank goodness for the stack o towels left on the sofa because it took about 5 bath towels to wipe up the mini lake in our bathroom.
FAIL!!!
to top it off, the a\/c in the living area stopped working.
i didn't call down to maintenance since we were obviously not going to receive any service.

couldn't check out fast enough on the 3rd day and definitely will never return.

my husband's company was so thoroughly disappointed as well and has decided never to use aria for company events again.

i would not recommend this hotel to anyone and i still can't believe it's a AAA 5 diamond hotel.
if it were based on my stay, it wouldn't even be on AAA's radar.

There was a touch-screen control pad with controls everything in the room (lights, curtains, television, etc.) and it was the first time we every saw something like that. The windows are huge and you can either get a strip view or a mountain view room. The bathroom was modern and nice, but lacks any type of theme. One thing I would complain about in the bathroom is the bathroom door, which is a sliding door. I really don't like sliding doors in hotels. Also, the door to the water closet, was really just a smoked glass door, which sucked. However, the bathroom is spacious enough to have a separate walk-in shower and a huge soaking tub.

I love Aria for its class, it's shape, the public art that is scattered throughout, for the large upstairs walkways and restaurants.  There is so much that I admire about the place.  

The Lumia Fountain in the porte cochere is a spectacular thing to see even in daylight.  The wood paneling at the concierge was recycled from the old Boardwalk Hotel that was on this site, an idea I think was superb.

The Elvis Theatre on the second floor has some interesting art across from the entrance, and there's more near the buffet.

No review would be complete without mentioning the Holzer art in the North Valet pickup area.  It's stunning to see, especially at night.  I've been surprised that a Las Vegas casino would be so forward looking as to install this art.

The property appeals to me a lot in many ways.",3,0,0

First impression was wow nice room. A bit on the small side but its vegas. I just stayed at the Hyatt in Nashville $200 a night this is close but no cigar. Here is why the bed and I can't stress that enough. If you are staying in a red roof motel 6 ect this would be your average bed. This is why I don't stay at these hotels. That and they are usually a little on the dirty side.  Lets get back to the bed first night laid down and the bed sagged so bad that you felt like you would slid right onto the floor. Went to front desk and they offered to switch it out. Went back last night I think they jus spun the mattress. When you spend this kind of money the mattress should be top of the line not old saggy and soft. 

The control in the room cool but not real functional. It is very slow to respond and is not very intuitive at all. It is a neat concept but for me the thing is so slow I would rather toss it out the window. Not a deal breaker for me but it is frustrating to use. I think they should look at the iPad and take some pointers. 

Overall I am not real impressed. The staff is very nice but that is the way it is at every hotel I have ever stayed at with this type of price. So what sets it apart? I haven't figured that out yet and if I can't before we leave in five days I will stay somewhere else in 2 week and in February when I come back. 

My wife says I am a hotel snob maybe she is right. I do spend a lot of time in them and mostly Wyndham or Hyatt. I don't mind paying the higher rate but when I do my expectations are higher as well. 

Bottom line if your 20 something you won't care you'll be to drunk to notice the mattress anyways. If you in your 30's or 40's and past that stage it may make a difference at the price level. Me I think I am going to try the Wynn.",0,0,0

The room incorporated with a lot of new technology like the switch button for the curtain, and some sensor for your food bar and fridge. It says it the stuff is removed for more than 60 seconds or is replaced, you will be charged! 

Vegas, the hotel is just for sleeping.

There was only the lounge open for entertaining at night, the club was under renovation. So I felt not a lot of fun in the night if you don't gamble. The lounge was $30 for gentlemen and $20 for ladies once it passes midnight. But ladies have unlimited drink all night. Not a whole lot of people in the lounge, but you still have no where to seat unless you have bottle service. Dance floor didn't get crowded, I guess just not a lot of people know it.

Edit* so here's the scoop, we stayed here for 5 days 4 nights great place over all. The rooms were nice ABC clean and the thought behind them were good.

The tablet controllers worked the first day in the corner suite. Then all of a sudden, wifi acts up and my tablets go into reset mode. Not that I can't get up to turn on lights or open and close the blinds but dang buttons on the walls were not working properly at times as well. 

My parents had the nicer corner room, my dad and mom complained that the bed mattress had such over use that you can tell the people must have been some big heavy people because of the indentations still in the mattress. Dad Eve told an house keeping manager who came by and she took note and made a call but nothing came about of that interaction. I even mentioned it to the front  desk in the lounge suite during check out and he told me that we could have asked for a firmer bed and I said that my dad mentioned it to a staff member but nothing happened. I was disappointed with that portion of service. The house keeping staff didn't follow through all the way. I don't care if we have the privacy light on we don't mind phone calls to see if we're are available to have a bed replaced. Not able to sleep properly is not right.

 * Hotel * 
Check-in was more painful and slow than expected, but the room was clean and modern. The view from the full-length windows was like many in the nearly 4000 guestrooms: clear and of the next hotel and the freeway. You didn't come for the view, so, enjoy the comfy bed and nice amenities in the bathroom before hitting the strip again.

* Restaurants *
With more than 10 places to eat, Aria really offers something for just about everyone. I love the Jean Philippe Patisserie for pastries, croissants, and crepes. Lemongrass is Asian-Thai Fusion when you need it while Barmasa is a bit overpriced Japanese, yet fine. Of course, The Buffet (as it is called) is the buffet and should fill you for one day.

* Activities *
Viva Elvis was an ok Vegas show, but not a very good Cirque du Soleil show. I'm looking forward to its replacement in November with another Cirque show called Zarkana. Haze Nightclub is only open Thursday - Saturday. It may not be the best of the best (ok, it isn't), but it was still fun for one night. For shopping, have fun ""looking"" at the expensive merchandise at the upscale name brands in City Center. The casino isn't nearly as large as you'd think, so, it still has a small casino feel to it. After you lose your cash, use your credit card to pay for a visit to the Spa or get a Cabana at the Pool.

There has been trips where I've stayed in the lesser hotels and some that I've been fortunate to have the detailed and memorable comforts of the more fancier, more name brand establishments. However, I had never stayed in any of the City Center hotels and so the anticipation was big. I was finally going to stay in the immaculate Aria and I don't remember a time when staying at a hotel piqued my interest as much as this last trip.

Let's begin!

Firstly, the décor of the lobby pretty much stated this wasn't a cheapy motel. This was grown folk Vegas. This, in essence, is what Vegas is turning to; a super resort-y type place with the quaint desire to please the 25-40 year old demographic that has some expendable income to blow (or for a lack of better term get blown...). It's the True Religion 'brotification' of Vegas and well, the result is immaculate. The ceiling of the lobby, with its oversized origami, contrasted this. The sheik velour and deep earthy tones of the lobby is a symbol of the color scheme and design of not only the myriad of pathways to our room but the room itself.

Vegas' foundation was built on the skeletons of long ago mobster kingpins. No, wait, that's not right--they've built it on excess and with the Aria it continues. However, it isn't that excess where you're at a loss or overwhelmed, but one of that you could grow to love a place like this. That, if you were able to beat the fabled odds of Vegas, you'd put a 10k or 50k marker and be welcomed with open arms and possibly more amenities that mark the 21st century Vegas.

The fact that the rooms were comfortably constructed with the awesome laissez-faire technology of control via a tablet was off-set by how solid and awesome the bathroom and showering area was. Well, the hot tub was home to the consummate drinks and spirits but beyond that the beds were extremely comfortable and we were able to house multiple partygoers comfortably. The music selection, however, was limited to the throes of Top-40 and the uhnz uhnz uhnz of EDM (Electronic Dance Music). There wasn't any hip-hop or commercialized rap for our pre-partying and recovering needs. Gracious, as it may be, the room was very satisfactory.

Next up: Café Vettro...

What you tend to get with the 'Vegas greasy spoon' ilk is variable. Sometimes you get something on the terrible side of Denny's and other times you get fare that is worthwhile and delicious and attainable at an ungodly hour such as, well, 4 in the morn. Café Vettro is that place. While it is a tad bit pricier than other 24\/7, it offered superb selections for a quick, painless, and sustenance-necessary birthday dinner. I settled on the pork chop with an apple au-jus, rosemary mashed potatoes (I believe), and country style green beans. Let's just say its okay to eat pork a little less than well-done. It's okay to say you're enjoying stuffing your face when it is delectable as my meal was. Garcon! This was uh-mazing and fuel for the night about The Strip. 

Is there anything worth disparaging about the food and ambience of Café Vettro that I'd like my readers to know? Not really. However, the 2nd time we ate there--the service was extremely slow and the sandwich I got was a bit too sodium-laden and the food wasn't as premium as it was the night before. Perhaps it was 4 and I, too, would be lacking in the culinary expertise at the break of dawn. It still was, however, eatable nonetheless.

Secondly:

Probably the only non positive remarks I have is for the pools. I mean, it wasn't a terrible experience but it was a little limited and the crowd was more d-word than lively. I mean, I should expect that from a visit to Vegas but as a veteran of many-a-pool in this fabricated city, I know when there is a fun vibe and one that leads you to not want to be in the water for fear you'll catch a mythical and realistic disease or infection. The pool layout was cluttered and that is probably due to the lack of space. While I should be numb to the fact that the pool side bar charges and arm and 2 legs for a bucket of tall can Stella Artois. 

Also, one quick referendum on the pools: DO NOT rub your eyes! I did this and whatever lurked in the water seemed to agitate my eye for a great deal of the afternoon. YUCK.


So, in closing--and I'm kind of sad this will be the last time I spend this long reminiscing about a birthday trip that was remarkable--I would like to thank the Aria for being all that it was. That it opened up my mind farther than the megaclub, stripclub, and buffet prejudices I had previously. That I can enjoy a super resort and though the patrons are not my cup of tea, I can enjoy the architectural beauty and interior design and still partake in all the goodness that there can be had in Sin City.

Spent the weekend here with the wife and another couple and have a fantastic time.  The hotel itself is gorgeous, with interesting architecture and amazing art inside and out.  The services throughout the property are top notch, including a great spa and wonderful restaurant choices.  It was also a nice change to be able to see the sun throughout a Vegas resort\/casino, even from some sections of the casino floor.

Overall this is most likely my new Las Vegas home away from home.

Positives
+  Our room was spacious and well thought out with a very spacious and pretty bathroom.  The electronic controls were also a nice touch and made it easy to quickly turn all the rooms lights on and off

+ The Spa is fantastic and fairly reasonably priced.  Massage services were excellent and was hard to leave the spa with all the great areas to relax, including the hot stone beds, salt room, jacuzzi and outdoor pool.  Also was a nice touch to be able to relax by the spa pool overlooking Liquid, the ""adult"" pool.

+ Hands down the best in-resort restaurant choices across the price spectrum.  Had great quick lunches at the SkyBox Grill (breakfast burrito and salsa was yummy!) and Jean Philippe Patisserie, adequate breakfast at Caffe Vetro and a wide selection of dinner choices.  We settled on American Fish and Twist (next door at Mandarin Oriental) for dinner, but could have easily settled on one of the many other choices.  Leaving aside that I'd rather go to Bar Masa or Jean George in NY.  This could easily be a ""never-leave"" type Vegas resort if that's what you're looking for.

+ Dealers throughout casino were excellent and extremely pleasant.  Seems like MGM took the best dealers from all of its properties and brought them to Aria.

+ Overall a beautiful building inside and out.

+ Great location on the middle of the strip and incredibly easy access from the airport

+ Very nice, large pool area.

+ Fairly generous comps for such a nice\/new hotel

+ Easy check-in\/check-out and with bag storage you get to jump the taxi line, making trips back to the airport super easy

Of course there were some negatives

-  Casino floor is rather dark with a noticeably low ceiling.  I wish they had opened up the casino floor a little bit

- Casino is unnecessarily loud with music and particularly PA announcements a few notches too high in volume

-  More confusing to navigate than most casinos, with very poor signage

- Pool service was a little slow.  Seemed like they just didn't have enough staff for a weekend when the hotel was nearly sold out.

These negative were more than made up for by all the positives though and I highly recommend",0,0,0

We were very pleased with the room.  We had a Deluxe King. It was perfect size, and it was perfect for our budget as well.  When we first walked in, we noticed that one of the lights right by the door was flickering. But seriously...why complain about the light? We were in Vegas! You aren't spending that much time in your room anyway!  The rest of the room felt clean, and more than big enough for two people.   The windows in the room were amazing.  We had a great view of the Cosmopolitan and Vdara, and you could see the Bellagio right behind them.

There is a free tram that runs between the Aria, Cosmopolitan, and Bellagio.  I wish we had found this a few hours sooner (my poor feet would have appreciated it), but just know that it's there :) It makes traveling between these hotels SO much easier! Clearly, you have to walk the strip.  The tram is just an added bonus when walking in heels, or if the heat becomes too much. The tram entrance is towards the back of the casino, near the coffee shop!  

Our group really enjoyed the Aria's casino. Friendly dealers, lots of games, very spread out. There were tables with low enough minimums for us ($10 Blackjack!), but also tons of other minimums mixed throughout. 

The staff was amazing and friendly. Everyone went above and beyond to answer any questions that we had. I felt like they truly cared about each of the guests. Also- a safety bonus- they require all guests to flash their room key before making their way to the guest elevators. Since I'm a Vegas newbie, I'm not sure if this is standard or not. It did make me feel safer though :)

I needed something fast and in a pinch. I called and they said to just come on in and they would take care of me. After pulling into the wrong valet side, I was told to go to the other side which took me a good solid 20 minutes to navigate. The whole check in process took about 20 minutes. The one thing that sucked was the 25$ ""resort"" fee they tacked on to the room. A standard king ran me 400$ for a Saturday night, kinda pricey for a regular room.

Once I got to the room it was nice. It wasn't over the top nice but it worked. The bathroom had everything we needed and the room did as well. The bed was super comfy and the pillows as well. I opened up the wardrobe and found a robe and slippers that was a major plus in my book. The channels on the tv kinda sucked and they had NO rap music stations to listen to. 

Room service was way too overpriced for my liking so I decided to hit the buffet. It was meh BUT they had all you can drink  beer\/mimosa's for 12.99 . I WAS ALL OVER THAT. I gambled a bit and ran into Dirt Nasty and Riff Raff in the casino. 

Overall this casino is super nice, new and very professional. I only dinged it a star for the price.",1,0,0

Aria is a modern and gorgeous hotel with the friendliest staff!  Known for being the greenest hotel on The Strip, Aria is truly a great place the stay at --- my preferred place to stay at!  The rooms are clean, the beds are inviting, and it's very modern and chic.  Everything is controlled by a bedside tablet and it's convenient.  I love how the tub and shower are connected so you can splash around [be it single or with a partner] and not have to worry about making a mess.  ;)  Jean Phillippe Patisserie is right downstairs and they have some truly delicious sweet treats.  The Buffet at Aria is also pretty spectacular and they have a 24-hr cafe to cure your drunken cravings.  And being a short-walk to Monte Carlo's monorail is definitely a plus.  It's connected to Crystals after all!  

Hey, a girl loves to shop.

Anyways, while The Cosmopolitan has definitely stolen some of the lime light, I prefer the friendlier Aria staff and people compared to the snobby Cosmo staff.

Everything about the Aria Hotel was thought out, from the food selection to the signature vanilla scent in the lobby, there is nothing mundane about Aria. 

Be prepared to be swept off of your feet by the service, the location, and the amenities. When you enter your room it is ALL systems are a go. The automated curtains draw back to let in the amazing view, the lights turn on, and you can even program it to que up your favorite music. 

The bed was to die for, so comfortable. The bathroom has both a HUGE tub and a HUGE shower, and they are both behind the same door which is a new concept I've never seen before but was a really nice feature. If you are sharing the room with a friend, have no fear, there are two large wardrobe closets, plenty of drawers, and of course the standard desk\/nightstand. 

The room is the epitome of high tech. Not only do the key cards to get in the door operate via touch, everything in the room can be controlled by one central remote; but be careful, this lead to me turning off the house lights instead of the TV while my friend was in the shower haha. 

I also visited the pool during my stay. The water was the perfect temperature and super refreshing in contrast to the desert heat. Plenty of chairs to lay out, and they are not at a shortage of sun rays for your tan. 

As far as clubbing and going out, it is just a short walk or cab ride to the best clubs in town, and the taxi line was NEVER longer than 5 people, which was great, and we were there over Halloween Weekend. 

Overall, my time spent at Aria was amazing, and by best Las Vegas hotel experience to date. Great location, Great Service, Beautiful hotel.",2,0,0

the room we got was standard size with technology all around you. the beds were really too soft for my taste but the linens and blankets made up for it.  the bathroom was good size, i like the shower\/tub combo ""room"" and the fact that the toilet was also isolated from the rest of the bathroom.  the only complaint was that it seemed difficult to find a comfortable climate setting - either too hot or too cold.  

we ate at the buffet and the cafe (forgot the name), the buffet was a 2\/5 but will give the cafe a 3\/5.  the aria is not a top-lister for dining in my opinion.  

otherwise the whole complex has everything you need.  not that you'd wanna stick to just one place in vegas but if you had no choice you really wouldn't have to, especially when the entire center is complete.

definately worth checking out for a nice stay in vegas.  next time i'll check out the mandarin oriental.  i stayed at the one in san francisco and liked it and curious if las vegas is the same",0,0,0

Room is really nice and comfortable. 
Everything in the room is controlled electronically which is really cool. Bathroom is nice with a strong-pressured shower and a nice size tub. Pool and Jacuzzi outdoors are beautiful and relaxing. 

A few (minor) things I didn't like: 

Daily ""resort fee"" - they make you pay extra for things that should be included in the regular hotel price. 
No hot water machine or fridge in room. 
Casino needs to be ventilated better; it felt very stuffy with a strange odor (to mask the cigarette smoke).

The tram from the Aria to Bellagio was also a nice discovery.. it definitely cut down some walking time.

Super fancy, is what I thought as the bell hop showed us around the room and explained the remote controlled lights, curtains, etc. Add the fact that we got a lobster and all-you-can-drink wine at the buffet and the hotel was really beginning to blow my mind. 

Have I mentioned that this was my first visit to Las Vegas? That might have something to do with the general mind-blowing feeling I got - I mean, there really isn't any other place like Vegas, right? 

The casino is pretty nice, not too big and has the pleasant scent of vanilla wafting through it. The restaurants are fancy (and pricey) - we mostly ate at the 24 hour restaurant, which was pretty good. Free wi-fi in the rooms made me very happy. We didn't find the pool until our last day there, which is sad because they keep it open all year long (but with shorter hours in winter.)

My only real complaint is with the Front Desk staff. While friendly, simple customer service skills seemed to escape them. It takes them too long to pick up the phone, courtesies such as ""Your room number is..."", ""Have you enjoyed your stay?"", etc. are apparently not in their repertoire.

I have seriously never ever been anywhere close to being as impressed with the design alone of any place in Vegas as I was with the architecture and design of this place.  I can honestly say that It actually caught me off-guard a little bit.  Even the fragrance of the place was the most inviting casino fragrance that I've encountered anywhere in Vegas (it smelled like Vanilla tic-tacs to me, no doubt carefully chosen.)

Normally, in Vegas, even in places where they strive for ""opulence"" (e.g., Wynn properties, Palazzo, etc.), I'm normally in constant motion, not really impressed, and just pretty much running on adrenaline through the places on my way to popular hot spots or the tables on the properties. This is the first property in Vegas where I was actually just like, ""WHOA!"" and had to just chill for a bit and actually take a relatively  good look and check out the place.

The visual design of this place is *so* modern, with so much glass, abstract textures and abstract artwork, that it truly looks like a well-planned Sci-Fi theme.   After checking out the property, I actually thought that ""Aria"" (pronounced ""AW-ree-uh"") was a play off of the ""Area 51"" of sci-fi-and-UFO-related pop-culture fame,  due to the futuristic sci-fi mood that I saw all over in the design details (even the restroom stall doors had an abstract alien-looking texture).   I mentioned this to a table games dealer who didn't know of the theme being ""sci-fi"" specifically, but he totally agreed when I mentioned that that the name ""Aria"" really seems like a play off of ""Area 51"".   Apparently Aria means ""air"" in Italian, but I am *seriously* wondering if this name choice was intended to be a clever double entendre (It IS whether they mean it or not!)  - either way, A+ to MGM Mirage corporation and the architecture firm who designed this place -  I think it definitely raises the bar for Sands, Wynn, etc.!!!!    Aside from the impressive visuals, the staff were friendly and welcoming.",2,1,1

We arrived and were greeted by our delightful limousine driver in the baggage claim area.  She was professional and so kind.  The limo was absolutely beautiful; a creamy metallic stretched Cadillac.  From the start, we were welcomed and wished a happy anniversary, which actually was on the day we arrived, Jan 8th, from nearly every single person on the staff at Aria.

Our check-in was a lovely experience in the VIP lounge, which was beautiful and supplied a variety of snacks and soft beverages, and free wifi, too.  

Once our lovely strip-view corner suite was ready, we were escorted to our room.

It was AMAZING!  Great view and beautiful spacious room.  To our surprise, there was a beautiful box of Aria signature chocolates and a healthy big basket of fruit, along with a bottle of champagne!  A note from the hotel said 'Congratulations....' and a second note from our concierge assistant 'Cynthia' also wished us a happy 40th.

We left for dinner shortly after and upon returning, about midnight,  my husband asked me to use my key and open the door.  SHOCK AND AWE!!!  The suite had been decorated with balloons and flowers, even rose petals on the bed and two single roses on each pillow.  I had never seen anything like it in my life!  In fairness, my sweet hubby set that up and paid for it, but not even he knew how beautifully it would turn out.  I will remember this for the rest of my life! WELL DONE ARIA!  Just AWESOME!!!!!

We enjoyed a nice turn down service every night of our stay and delicious chocolates each night, too.

Our room was a corner suite, which featured a separate bedroom, living room, bar and refrigerator.  There were two separate bathrooms; one Aria calls the 'powder room' and the other a full bath with a waterfall shower and bench, a fantastic Jacuzzi and a separate toilet which was a multi-function bidet.  There is nothing like a warm seat in the middle of the night!  The bathroom also had a double vanity with two sinks and enough amenities, even bath salts.
 
The Aria fitness center is packed full of treadmills, elliptical, stationary bikes, and every sort of weight training equipment you could hope to see.  The gym has floor to ceiling windows and allows you a great view while working out.  There is an additional fee for use of the spa area, but it's nominal at $30 for all that is offered; make up, hair, massage, facials, etc.  The price is on par with other hotels, so not inexpensive, but not ridiculously over-priced either.  I just didn't have time this trip.

There are MANY choices for dining at Aria.  I reviewed those we dined at in separate reviews.  There is something for everyone.

The casino is huge and offers everything from slots to blackjack and several different types of board poker [3-card, 4-card, Ultimate Hold 'em, etc].  Minimums are usually $10 in daytime and upwards of $25 at night.

The Aria Sports Book is fantastic.  Sadly, I forgot to make a bet on Clemson and they won the NCAA football championship!

The Aria poker room is very large, with both tournament play and cash games $1\/$2, $2\/$4 and pot limit games.  The tournament structure is great!  Yes, the buy in is usually $100+ but the blinds are typically 30 minutes, so if you play your cards right, you could be there 6 hours or so to make the final table.  The pay offs are wonderful!!!!  Depending on the number of entrants, even 12th will be able to cash.

The casino is also surprisingly NOT terribly smokey.  That's a huge plus for me as I am a former smoker and hate the smell of it now.  

Cocktails for players are complimentary and there was no shortage of servers asking for orders. They are fast, too.  Please remember, we are in the new millennium!  I still see people tipping just $1 to a server.  That is ridiculous! Maybe I go overboard, but I tip at least $4 or usually $5.  This is how they make a living.  The extra will also get you better service and more attentive service.

Our journey back to the airport was excellent, too, in a beautiful cream-metallic Escalade with a very sweet and professional driver.

We were staying in a smoking room and I felt that the attention to detail may have been lacking just because of that factor. The headboard, while pretty, was covered in dust which created a cloud as soon as we hopped into bed. The corners of carpet by the nightstand needed a vacuum.  The glass doors of the toilet enclosure didn't align property so going to the loo was announced with a loud Klang every time. But the bed was comfy and the housecoats were a treat to wear.

Getting food and drinks in the hotel was pretty pricy, even Skybar which is the burger bar type thing was a little on the high side. DO NOT buy drinks at the pool bar, bring your own from elsewhere as the margaritas we bought were $19 EACH. Ouch. Do not bother with the hotel buffet either. It was certainly not the culinary highlight of the weekend. Most items were odd, soggy, and cold. If I had been hung-over, I would have felt really gross afterwards. 

Lastly, whatever you do, DO NOT MOVE ANYTHING IN THE MINIBAR. They have this ridiculous scammy fee that if you put anything of your own into the minibar, they charge you a $50 fee. I had put in a water bottle before my boyfriend noticed this, and even though everything had been put back, they still tried to charge us for the most expensive item in there, even though nothing had been consumed. We had to do the whole speak to the manager thing when we checked out, and while he did remove the fee, it was time consuming when we just wanted to get out and catch our flight. I got the impression that the whole M.O. was to nickel and dime and sneak in fees. Fine if you like arguing, but I don't and hate the dishonesty of the whole attitude. 

Location wise, it's also kinda tucked away from the strip. Fine if you want to stay exclusively at the hotel and casino, but if you want to get out and explore, it's quite a convoluted walk to get out.",2,1,0

the day before check in, i called to confirm our reservation of non smoking 2 queen bed and the reservation staff said that was correct and made no mention of no guarantees.  We checked in the next day  and got a king bed with a roll away.  

This is probably the most shocking part of this review.  I checked the sheets and found not only hair but stains that resembled bodily fluids and it wasn't just a stain- it was the real thing. the sheets had not even been changed but the bed just re-made.  I also found hair in the shower. Secondary to that the furniture was dusty and the carpet looked like it needed to be vacuumed.  i called house keeping and they came to change the sheets and were very apologetic and very nice.

i called the front desk to let them know what was going on but no exageration ,was on hold for 15 minutes before an a front desk staff was available.  The front desk staff was told what had happened and she said that a queen room was now available if we wanted.  i told her i wasn't sure because the other guest in my room had already left for the evening and i didn't know if she wanted to pack her stuff up and move.  In response she said, your refusing a queen bed and thats what you wanted?  i asked to speak with management and they said they could not speak with me now but would call me back.  6 hours later still no call...

Anyways, there's more but i hope  you're all getting the idea of what type of experience we had at the Aria.  I don't think i would ever stay at this hotel again unless they offered me something special to give it another chance and even then i'm a bit hesitant.  To be fair, some of the staff were very professional but some were just awful.  The pastries on the casino floor were really yummy especially the chocolate croissants.

* Ambiance: modern, swanky, luxurious!  Certainly catering to young crowds. We did not see any family with kids during our stay. 4 star. 

* Location: convenient in the middle of the strip. There is a tram taking you to the Bellagio, the Crystal shopping mall, walking distance to the cosmopolitan, the Mandarin,  etc. 4+ star.

* Motifs: modern with some asian influence. Room is spacious and modern. High tech control panel. Small bathroom with double sinks.  Many storages. Comfy bed but  no seating area. No coffee maker in room. There is a fridge but filled with the resort ' s drinks and snacks. No personal fridge available.  4 star.

* Service: Average!  We checked in early on friday morning and even though the resort was not full, we did not get in our room until 2 pm. $20 trick is no longer working!  3 star. 

This is averaged to 4 star for me! 

We stayed here to see Jason Mraz in concert at the Chelsea theater of the Cosmopolitan. Picked Aria since it is close to the Cosmopolitan.  We paid for the deluxe city view. It is pretty nice view of the strip. 

The room is spacious.  We like the technology... just wish there is a table with dining in room possibility!  The bathroom is smaller than other resorts in the same class but clean and modern.  

There is 2 working pools, 1 jacuzzi and 1 extra pool under construction.  There are plenty of lounge chairs... pretty generic... not as swanky as the cosmopolitan ' s pool or intimidating as the Cesar Palace's ones. There is plenty of sun!

Overall,  we enjoyed our stay.  Everything is expensive.  There is star buck on the promenade (2nd floor). Jean Phillips has good desert and reasonable foods. The buffet is probably the way to go if you are traveling on budget!

If you don't want to be bothered by the house keeping, make sure to turn on the privacy light by the door!

First off, service, service and service. For the prices they make you pay for this hotel, you would at least expect friendly service with all the staff. No smiles at all from front desk checking in. You can get a better welcoming from an automated machine. The taxi stand attendant on two occasions was super rude! Very pushy to get everyone in a taxi even if there wasn't a long line. He snapped at me and words were definitely exchanged! The dealers at the roulette and blackjack tables lack personality or excitement. Dealers at the Palazzo, Venetian, MGM and Bellagio are way more fun and enthusiastic!

The rooms were nice and modern. I liked how the tv, music and the drapes all opened to welcome you. Comfortable beds after a long night out.

I love the main entrance\/valet area. It's open aired and there's a beautiful water feature. Our check-in on a Friday afternoon was super quick and the staff was friendly. My only gripe is that since I booked my reservation through the player's club although I had requested and paid for early check-in they didn't let my friend who got there 1.5 hours earlier than I did to check in. She had a long flight and I would have loved for her to have been able to relax in the room until we got there. They said I had to personally be there to qualify for the rate I had received on the room through my player's club. I guess I get how people could abuse their player's club perks by booking discounted rooms for their friends and family, but I think they should have let her check in & just required me to show up with my ID within 2 hours of check-in or jacked up the room rate. 

The hotel is impeccable, the housekeeping staff would literally stop what they were doing to acknowledge guests to say ""Good Morning"" and ""Welcome to Aria"" it was a nice touch. Our room was just perfect. Spacious, quiet enough to fall asleep even though Marquee's music could be heard a little and the beds & pillows were very comfortable. I loved that we could control the curtains, TV, lights and music from a tablet on the nightstand. The one thing we found odd was the see thru restroom door. It's frosty, but you can still see people's silouettes wiping their butts or pulling their pants up. How is this appropriate? LOL Luckily we were all girls and we didn't care, but I can see how this could be awkward for other groups traveling together like families or colleagues.

I suppose it's not completely the fault of the Aria, but it certainly colored our experience from the get go. We were suppose to get a hundred dollar dining credit which we didn't get.  So strike two before we ever get into the room. The much talked about welcome to the room where the curtains open didn't happen instead we fumbled around for the light switch for a minute and spent another minute trying to open the curtains, for some reason the ""open curtains"" button didn't want to work on the first few attempts. 
The room is not bad looking. Rather modern looking with floor to ceiling windows and the control panel for the room is kind of cool once you get the handle of it, even though it's not very responsive to touch.
In room is a pressure sensitive minibar making so you  can't use the fridge unless you pay a ridiculous 50 dollar ""restocking fee"". 
The room offers separate shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and body lotion which is nice. The water pressure is not too great but its manageable. I liked the separate bath and shower. The tub is a decent size but not a jacuzzi tub. 
We stayed for three nights and only had the room serviced once even though we had the ""service"" light on from 10 am to 11 pm. So we had no clean towels for our last day. 
We had breakfast at Jean Philipe bakery, which was nice, but we were over charged.  This happens and I understand that, but when I asked for the difference back one lady grabbed my ticket and left for 5 minutes, then another lady came back looked at me then left, then 5 minutes later came back with someone who I assume is the manager. Neither one of them looked at me or said a single word to me. After a few minutes of playing with the register they put the difference on the counter and leave. No ""sorry for the mistake"" ""I apologize"" or ""fuck you"".  That really shows me a lack of service at a place revolves around service.

It was a nightmare. My husband and I stayed at the Aria hotel for the weekend 3\/24\/17-3\/28\/17. I was stopped for my ID three times in two days. This first time two cops rolled up to myself and one of my husband's male coworkers sitting at a slot machine. Took our licenses and walked away with them typed our info into a lap top they had. Then left. The next day, I was at the Lift bar in the casino talking to People I didn't know 3 guys and a girl. Two hotel staff members pull me out of the group to again take my ID. They relay my info to someone on a radio and begin to describe what I was wearing. Not 10 minutes later, I'm now sitting at a slot machine while my husband is at a card table playing 21. A man in plain clothes (I suspect undercover security) asks me ""hey are you working "" I'm pissed now and scream I'm not a damn hooker! He apologizes and walks away... I told my husband what happened we complained to the manager and to the hotel security manager. Of course nothing was solved just a weak apology. Later in the evening I see hotel security escorting two black women out of the casino, I assume for soliciting I guess not sure. My husband and I are usually VDARA guests when we come every year for the Baker to Vegas relay race. And we will make damn sure we never set foot in Aria ever again, as well as tell everyone at our station and department to boycott this establishment.

Everything was modern and elegant, as one would hope for something surrounded by so much hype.  The casino level is adequate, not an impressive space to be sure.  No real late night snack options, which was quite disappointing... but enough dining options during regular hours that you could eat here the whole trip and not be disappointed (but I don't recommend it... so many other awesome places to hit up).

There is a stocked mini fridge with alcohol, soda, snacks. Prices for these items are high and not worth the amount to me, but what can you expect 1. You're in a hotel and 2. You're in a hotel in VEGAS!  Of course these things are overpriced.

The bed....oooohhhhhh the bed!  I felt like I was sleeping on clouds made of marshmallows!  I have tons of issues with my back, and the 3 nights we spent in this hotel, I had NO pain (except my tired legs from walking too much).  The best part, you can purchase the mattress from the hotel and it will ship to anywhere in the US.  There's a card in one of the dresser drawers with all the information.
These mattresses are specially made for the Aria and can only be purchased through the hotel.

Love the staff here!  While walking through the halls every staff member we saw was very friendly and always said hello and asked how our stay was wether they were from maintenance, housekeeping, or guest services.  Seeing as I myself work in a hotel I know how important this is.

Of course there is a casino on the main floor right off the lobby, and you do need to walk through the casino to get to the guest room elevators.  We're in Vegas people.

We arrived at the airport, went to the appropriate spot to meet the driver of our complimentary limo to the hotel...who wasn't there.  After waiting twenty minutes, we called the concierge, and eventually were told we should just take a Lyft as the driver wasn't coming...this after waiting around for 45 minutes.  We were offered a $150 credit, though, which cheered us up!

After our Lyft ride to the hotel, we we waited in line to check in...and waited and waited and waited.  Not a good start to our vacation, especially after the airport fiasco!  Finally more front desk staff arrived, the check-in person confirmed several credits we were expecting and everything was all set.

The room was wonderful -- pretty, comfortable and spacious.  Everyone we dealt with from that point on was so pleasant and friendly: housekeepers, room service personnel and doormen were all spectacular in terms of their service.  The food from room service was consistently  delicious and arrived promptly.

We took advantage of the late (4:00 pm) check out, but members of the housekeeping staff stopped by five times between 11:00 am and when we left...even though we had told the front desk and had told housekeeping about the late check out.  A little annoying, but they were so pleasant that it was acceptable.

This time we confirmed ahead of time the complimentary limo ride to the airport -- which the concierge had apparently never heard of.  We did finally get our ride and said goodbye to Vegas...and then when we got home and received our online statement, none of our three credits had been included.  My husband spent 40 minutes on the phone with someone from the hotel, who did fix it all...but it was frustrating.

Despite it being a holiday weekend, I could still find tables at MGM going down to $10, even at night.

The hotel is nice, but again, my room at MGM Grand is nicer. The Aria room had a bunch of issues. The minibar fridge was broken all weekend so all drinks were hot. We left our room for 7 hours during the day and returned to a dirty room - room service hadn't been picked up and it hadn't been serviced at all. They send someone to clean up finally, but they never refilled the water bottles. Later that night, we call and say, hey we need those waters. They say, that's a separate dept. that fills the minibar and they also didn't do their job. And as a result, to get a bottle of water, we had to pay $30 at room service instead of $10 in the minibar.

Rooms are great, but I find the remote console thing to be annoying. It was a bit confusing to figure out (granted. I may have been a little buzzed... but I just wanted to turn all the lights off and pass out).

Another big negative for me: I originally had a comped room booked with two queens but they said they were at 104% capacity and had no rooms with queens left. They put me in a room with 1 king and added me to some list and said they would call me back, they never did. The following day I ended up calling the Front Desk multiple times and eventually a room ""freed up"" after people checked out.

The sports book needs more seating and the night clubs haven't really gotten popular yet, however the central location of the hotel makes it a cheap cab ride over to all the hot spots.

Went here on the opening weekend just to pop in and see what Aria was going to be bringing to Sin City.  Overall not impressed.  Wanted to have one drink in their ""Deuce"" Lounge which we ended up calling the DOUCHE LOUNGE.  

The clientele...wow.  

The staff...get off your high horse - you work here I'm sure you don't own any shares in the company!  They were being very rude to everyone.  Even the guy that follows the servers around to point a flashlight so the dumb bimbos can see....snob....wow.

 I was with a couple that have LOTS of money but don't act the part and they basically tried to make us order bottle service after taking a brief seat to take a look at the overpriced drink menu.  Drinks came and there was lots of pressure to move ASAP and the drinks were not at all well made.  I have been to many high end hotels in Vegas but this one is high end with tons of 'tude.

Valet was quick and easy.  Check in as well, although the line did grow significantly after me.  Front desk was kind and courteous however $20 trick didn't work, she was able to ""upgrade"" me from a regular deluxe room to the mountain view room which was nice, I tipped her but less than the $20 since it wasn't a different room upgrade.  Elevator's were extremely quick, did not have to wait long to get to the room or downstairs.  

Room:
The room was extremely clean and modern.  I would not say that it feel's luxurious, but definitely felt more so than others.  We did have trouble with the toilet flushing but the service man was at our room extremely quickly and the flush was just unhinged so it was a simple fix.  The mountain view was very nice, we were able to enjoy a nice sunset view, as well as an awesome fireworks display across the dessert during the 4th.  We were able to see the entire dessert lit up with fireworks from a far.  Touchscreen controls were convenient for operating the lights\/shades, however it was annoying to operate the TV.  I preferred using the regular remote.  The Aria has one of the nicer showers of the resorts I have stayed at.  The water pressure and temperature were great, and there is also a bath tub inside the same room as the shower, you can create a sauna type experience.

Location:
Extremely good location with short walks to the City Center, Cosmopolitan, Planet Hollywood, and a free tram that connects you to Monte Carlo (with NYNY nearby), or to the Bellagio (where you can walk to Caesar's Palace).  Tram's are usually there within 15 min of each other.  

Pool:
There were 3 pools at the Aria, not including Liquid Dayclub.  The pool area wasn't as nice as the MGM or even the Monte Carlo, but it was big, seemed to have a lot of greenery and umbrellas for shade, and was easy to grab some chairs in the afternoon.  You would think a brand new resort would have a pool area more comparable to the other high end resorts but it was definitely acceptable to lounge around and relax at.

Food:
Plenty of high end restaurants, although limited on cheaper and late night eats.  Jean Philippe Patisserie is a great place to pick up a crepe, pastries or gelato, but it is pricey and is not 24 hours.  The only ""cheap"" places to eat would be the 24 hour cafe or the pizza place, however the cafe does not have great reviews.  You can always walk nearby to the Cosmo to Secret Pizza or across the street to the Planet Hollywood for Earl's.  Plenty of bars and places to lounge and a drink as well, though there was a line at The Deuce bar\/lounge for the UFC fight.

Gambling:
For this trip me and my gf enjoyed the slots.  We had a good run but in the end the house always wins, but we did enjoy ourselves and service was very attentive in bringing us drinks.

All in all, Aria is a great place to stay on the strip for modern and clean rooms, great location, and a nice new resort to enjoy.  I would definitely return again.

+ Everything on the bed is soft, including the linen cover.

concierge service was excellent.

we were coming into town with about 20 of our friends and had 8 rooms reserved.  I emailed about 3 weeks beforehand to the concierge's desk for assistance on getting us all onto one floor and getting us into HAZE.  both requests were done and when we arrived at 3pm on a Saturday, we all stood around for an hr waiting to get checked in.  this was such a minus to us but what else can we do.  on top of that, some of the rooms were not available so about 4 of the rooms were not on the same floor nor were they ready until after 5pm.  Other than those hiccups, we had a nice time there.  the hotel was not HUGE so no one got lost.  the room was great size and the rooms with 4ppl in them were very comfortable.
we all went to HAZE and got in with no issues and no wait in line...just the way I like it.  
the bakery downstairs...heaven!  we smell that richness thru-out the whole hotel.

on eve of us leaving, we had 13 of us having to go to the airport at the same time.  I called concierge's desk again to see what they can do.  AWESOME service...$98+ gratiutiy got us extra stretch limo that fit all of us.  that's chump change out of our pocket for all that we spent in vegas that wknd.

+++CHECK-IN+++ It was a breeze and quick since we arrived on Thursday. Service was friendly and courteous. 

+++RESTAURANTS+++ They have quite few top notch names when it comes to culinary. We really did not eat here, we opted for simple food outside the casinos. I am not a big fan of fancy restaurants, not because I am a cheap skate, lol...but rather I enjoy small mom and pop joints. I have learned that there are plenty of good eateries away from the strip and all the casinos. I am still in search of more hidden gems in sin city.

+++THE ROOM+++ Our room was on the 21st floor and it was nicely appointed. Many views from the huge wide windows. Bed was comfortable. Bathtub was separated from the shower on its own area with this magnificent views. Nice to just lay back all day in lavender infused warm water and forget about it all...Two large TV, one in living area and one in the room. Be careful not to remove any of the drinks, sweets that they have in the room for purchase. You move it or replace it and you will be charged $50 for re-stocking.

As another reviewer mentioned, check-in lines were long and the clerks were not that helpful.  Aria needs to hire more check-in clerks.  When you check out, there is a $20 a day resort fee on top of what you thought you were paying for your room.  There are taxes on that $20 fee, too.  We checked other Las Vegas hotels and many had a $15 resort fee.  We were charged $8 for the ""refreshe"" bar.  We didn't touch anything in the minibar.  We were told we used a bottle of Fiji water.  We said we did not and they took it off our bill.  The couple we traveled with had the same $8 charge.  This is so dishonest.  They automatically charge you and hope you don't see it, but will quickly take it off if you complain.  We will not stay here again, because of this dishonest practice.

We waited about 20 min in line to check out, which made me nervous about making it to the airport in time. They have a mobile check out, but I had to dispute a charge from the mini bar that we never purchased. They fixed this issue super quickly, but it seemed like the line never died down.

 My boyfriend set this up for Valentine's day and this hotel came highly rated. We were EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this hotel and its ""customer service"".

Upon arriving, we were suppose to have a king size bed, guaranteed, we ended up with 2 queens. We were suppose to have a dozen red roses and chocolate covered strawberries delivered upon arrival. That did not happen, and when they did finally deliver, the strawberries were already going bad! The TV remote didn't work, the fancy ipad type room control didn't work, the AC wasn't working. After we called down - we were credited $75 dollars for our inconvenience.... for the cost of that hotel, $75 was like a $5 credit anywhere else.

The next day we went to the spa and that was not bad. I have been to a few spas and that one was decent. Except, my facial lady was trying to be cute, I guess, but instead was offensive. Went back to the room to find it cleaned, and our liquor bottles rearranged and all. The cleaning person put my bottle of rum (with a wood cork top) under the 100 watt table lamp and it started to burn the cork. As I removed it from under the lamp and tried to remove the cork before it exploded from the heat, it burned my hand so badly, that it ruined the night! They sent over security who assured me someone would call and take care of my issues - it is 2 weeks later, and that hasn't happened yet! Called down again to the front desk and they said for my burn and inconvenience, they would issue a $50 credit. 50!!! Seriously?!?! We called to say we may be late for our romantic Valentine dinner at the Jean George, because I am working around a burned hand, and they said they would not be able to hold our RSVP and we would lose our table. We then went to dinner, on time, and in EXTREME pain, at the Jean George steakhouse I had walked the rest of the casino with NO issues, but immediately entering the restaurant, I felt on the floor because it was SUPER SUPER slippery!  I was trying to be EXTRA careful - I still fell IN THE MIDDLE of the $%#&$ restaurant! The waiter came to our table and made a joke of my fall immediately and said ""careful the floor is slippery"" then the what I assume is the manager, came and asked if I was OK. Didn't offer any help, or  food or drink or anything. The restaurant Jean George - was OK. We go to a lot of steak houses and this one is WAY over priced. We ordered one wagyu steak (15oz) shared by us 2 and 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine came out to $400. REALLY?! Though the lobster mashed potatoes were SO GOOD!

I was going to say something but why?! For another $50 or &75 crappy credit? When we spent well over $2000 that weekend? NEVER going back to that hotel EVER. To pay that kind of money for crappy service! The Sahara has better service! The Luxor well surpassed the room and spa expectations. And those are OLD casinos.

The view of the hotel from the footpath is breathtaking.  The hotel is set back from the Strip a bit so there is a visual sense of depth and grandeur.  The façade waterfalls that alternated speeds were really quite beautiful.  The lobby is very modern and the casino's air didn't seem as smokey as others. 

I was nearing my home base at Excalibur and decided to stop here because I felt lucky.  I approached the cashier and asked to exchange cash for tokens.  Ah, wrong!  The cashier kindly says, 'the machines take cash now, sir.'  Ah, how embarrassing!  It's been ten years since I've been to Vegas and a lot has changed, including no tokens.  LMAO!!

Trying not to be unnerved by my experience,  I head to the video poker and play a few.  Then I move to the 1 cent machines and start having amazing luck.  After just $5, I'm winning close to $80.  Very nervous that I'm going to lose it all, I slam on the cash out button and head back to the cashier with my voucher and receive my cash.  Not a gambler, I hurriedly stuff my winnings into my wallet and head back to Excalibur for a quick dip in their pool to take advantage of my resort fees.

Friends got us a suite at Aria for our honeymoon. I had expectations, I guess, because the hotel is so well-marketed it suggests a certain grand promise. There turned out to be some discrepancy between reality & expectations.

At first we were awestruck. There was a remote control for the shutters, & the view of the Strip through our room's floor-to-ceiling windows was amazing. We found some gourmet chocolates that were reminiscent of London chocolates someone once gave me, with novel flavors like Dark Lime & the like. At the front desk, we were told that the mini bar items were sensor-controlled & will immediately charge the items to our room if we so much as move or lift them. Nice. James Bond stuff.

Our good impression of Aria, unfortunately, didn't last very long. I found some streaks of something dark in the toilet. I was going to inspect it, but figured that wasn't such a good idea. I told myself to just try not to stare at whatever it was.

The cleaning lady also kept entering our room without knocking. She did this about 4 times before we decided to double lock our door & avoid the awkwardness of the situation. Her repeated barging in scared us from even attempting anything, so we mostly just watched TV & eventually left the room to get some dinner. She didn't apologize.

Thinking back, I believe what she was trying to do was surreptitiously leave the bottle of congratulatory ginger ale in our room, which our friends got us. That or a menage. Maybe not. What I find unbelievable is that a hotel such as the grand Aria doesn't have a better system for doing this sort of thing. This lack of professionalism is usually expected of cheaper hotels & motels -- not a place such as Aria, which boasts of sensors & motorized drapes in their suites. Maybe they need to look into hiring some ninjas.

All in all, I must say I'm ambivalent about our stay at the hotel. I felt that the cons outweighed the pros, & I can't say I really enjoyed our non-honeymoon there.",11,13,4

I have a question of any Aria employee that might read this... What the heck are you folks, that run this hotel thinking anyway? 

We were invited guests, meaning we gamble too much. I just don't get it, why would a hotel this beautiful, amazing, wonderful, soothing and not to mention WAY expensive, allow such shoddy service in the housekeeping department and in the room of an invited guest to boot? 

Our first room, among other things had a dirty q-tip on the floor in the bathroom when we checked in and it was still there two days later, when we checked out. After trying to figure out why we couldn't get the room to cool down I discovered the A\/C filter was so filthy and caked with dirt that the air couldn't circulate so I called the front desk to ask if they could change the filter, which by the way, after it was changed the A\/C worked like magic. I would think from a energy cost savings perspective they would watch that sort of thing. The next day we had to call housekeeping to reqested they clean the room 5 hours after having the ""service requested"" light on in the middle of the day. 

After two days of more gambling we ""achieved"" Platinum status (no judgements please about the gambling) and we were upgraded to a beautiful corner suite on the 51st floor. Now this was one amazing room, views up and down the strip in all directions. But housekeeping in the suite was actually worse if you can imagine that. Now I know it's not one disgruntled employee, it is the staff of this hotel that needs a kick in the pants.

A bobby pin was on the living room floor in plain sight when we checked in and a dust bunny was on the floor in the bathroom, and you guessed it, they were both still there three days later when we checked out. So they must not own a vaccuum cleaner. On the second day, we left the room at 10AM, turned the service light on and didn't return until 4:30PM. Yep you guessed it, the room was just as we left it. Also part of the platinum service was supposed to be turn down service, with the cute little chocolates on the bed. The first day of course that didn't happen but whatever, maybe we weren't out of the room during that time or the privacy light was on, no big deal. Day two...full disclosure here, I like the little things like turn down service in a fancy hotel...I made sure the service light was on and that we were out of the room during the time to clean it but I had to call again at 3:00PM to ask when that would happen, ""right away"" I was told so I left again while they cleaned the room. I came back to a clean room with 1\/2 the towels as before, so I guess they ran out of towels so they only took the used ones but left no knew ones, whatever. I spent some time in the room and left again around 6:30 for dinner. Left the service light on and expected to have the bed turned down and a nice little treat when we can back at 9:00PM.... I bet you know where this is going, you're right, it was just as we left it. I called housekeeping again and asked when turn down service is performed and I was told between 6:00PM and 11:00PM. I said great I am leaving, you can come anytime, I'll be gone at least a couple of hours. I came back at Midnight and the room was once again, just as we left it. 

In a  hotel where a hot dog is $15.00 and a basic breakfast in the ""cafe"" is $25 (it has the feel of a cafeterria by the way, with poor lighting to enhance that feeling), this sort of stuff will doom this hotel. I am the first one to sign the praises of a job well done but I am not afraid to point out failings either. This hotel is already sort of out of the way even though it's on the strip but it sort of now has the feeling of trying too hard to be snooty or ""upscale"" but they are failing at the little easy stuff. They are NOT ready for the big time for sure. 

This is our second time at this hotel, the first was great, but this sort of stuff is a sign of internal struggles to me. Maybe it's poor managment or some sort of inflated self image that does not square with reality, whatever the problem is, fix it or I will  not be the only one writing bad reviews. Excuse me, I guess that is already the case.  

Look, I work hard for my money, and I think everyone deserves a decent living wage when they work, I would not want to spend my life cleaning rooms because I know it is very hard work but if I was going to clean rooms, damn it they would perfect when I left.... and I tip. I tip a maid everyday in every hotel room I stay in, sure occasionally I have forgotten but it is never intentional and I never forgot in this hotel, until I checked out, then it was intentional. 

So please chime in everyone, is $10 a day too little, is that the problem, or is this an example of a hotel that doesn't care, or is trying to be something without a vision of what it takes to be that?",5,3,0

Overall, Aria is worth a visit. I was here during fight weekend and the place was packed. For such a large hotel, the valet service is extremely fast even without calling in advance. There are 2 locations to pick up your car so be careful to walk to the correct location. 

The suite came loaded with a living room, dining room a 1\/2 bath and an office in the guest quarters and the bedroom in rear. The master bath had a HEATED toilet seat. I never want to sit on another cold one again. My first experience with a built in beday with pressure monitor included. Hmm, I'll pass. There were also several telecommunication ports to hookup phones, laptops, radios, gaming systems, etc. Those really came in handy!

The elevators are very quick... you'll find yourself not waiting more than 20 seconds for one... at least that's what I experienced. The walk to the room from the elevator can be quite a stroll if you are towards the end of each floor. So don't be surprised if you get lost or walk up to the wrong door after a long night of ""fun"". I was on the 19th floor and it happened.

Enter the room by using a proximity card... kudos for using new technology. No longer will you need to fight with a key or swiping a card hundreds of times or have to worry about the your data on the magnetic strip being erased when trying to get the door to open. Simply place the card on the doo-hicky above the door handle and open says-ah-me!

When you walk in for the first time, the lights turn on, the curtains open, the TV turns on with your name in the corner of the display... all automatically. Very nice touch. I definitely want to get the auto-curtains for my home someday... yes, lazy.

The rooms are very spacious with a king size bed and the bed itself is extremely comfortable for me. The sheets not only looked clean, but felt clean with plenty of pillows. The room temperature was accurate and easily regulated. 

The bathrooms are also spacious with duel sinks and marble all around. The shower was roomy and the pressure was just right. The quality of the shampoo, conditioner and shower gel was above average and were re-filled daily and towels were plentiful and also replaced daily. Housekeeping did a nice job at cleaning the rooms and even organized my toiletries after the first day of service and kept them organized.

My only complaint and reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the line for check in and out. I know it's a 4000 room hotel but with all the technology in this place you'd think there would be a better way. Kiosk maybe? Still hate the resort fees too. Been to Vegas 24 times now and this is probably a top 3 place for me to stay.",0,0,0

Aria is not only visually stunning, but equally if not more welcoming.  We came for our wedding anniversary and splurged and reserved a suite in the Sky Suites.  The level of service starts with the well dressed chauffeur who picks you up at the airport, drives you the hotel in a limo through a PRIVATE entrance.  No dealing with the crazy front of the hotel, no crowds, just quiet and a private registration desk.  The check in was flawless and the smiles were genuine.   The registration clerk even asked if we would like to be escorted to our room.  She took our baggage claim check and seamlessly made everything happen. 

When we initially opened the door to our suite, it had been set up for the curtains to simultaneously open, revealing our magnificent view of the Las Vegas Strip.  It was sheer magic.  The kind of magic that gives you an automatic smile and expectations of wonderful things to come.  Our suite was massive and absolutely gorgeous.  The modern decor is impeccable and yet very warm and inviting.  Hubby and I realized quickly, we weren't going to be leaving our suite as much as we normally do in Vegas.  It was too awesome to miss out on.

The service our entire time here, exceeded our expectations.  We were spoiled rotten.  We ordered breakfast in the room several times and besides being delicious, the service was quick and the set up was PERFECT.

The in room amenities were so ON point.  From the lighting to the temperature of the rooms, to the heated toilet seat (has a booty wash feature too), to the toothbrush, toothpaste, razors, vanity sets.. and on and on and on available for your use.  Everything in its place and top quality.  One of my favorite features was the turn down service every night.  You come back to your suite to find everything cleaned up, the bed turned down, slippers on each side of the bed and a lavender balm to apply to help you sleep.  Oh yeah, don't forget the gourmet chocolates either.

I have often wondered how people could make a hotel their permanent residence.  After this stay I will no longer query that.  I could live here easily.

The hotel has EVERYTHING you could want.  An absolutely beautiful spa, pool areas (private one for the Sky Suite guests), restaurants (some of the best in Vegas), bars, lounges, Zarkana the show.  Honestly, if you wanted to come to Vegas and only stay in one spot, this is the place to be.

I felt welcomed, safe and cherished during our entire stay here.  I can not wait to come back.  Worth every penny!!!",8,2,6

The Aria is my favorite hotel on the strip. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, clean and modern (love the remote that controls the lights and blinds). We were given a room on the 20th floor and other than the extremely long walk from the elevator everything was perfect.

We originally booked a corner suite, so we checked-in to the Tower Lounge. Check-in was basically instantaneous; no wait. We checked in with Raniel, and he really looked out for us: In a nutshell, the corner suite we booked had an electrical issue with the room, so he managed to upgrade us to a Crystals Suite (which is a HUGE UPGRADE). The Crystals Suite was 10 floors higher than the original corner suite to which we were assigned, and it was the nicest hotel space I've ever stayed at. Sprawling, clean, meticulous attention to detail, and beautiful decor. We had awesome views of the strip (MGM, PH, and Monte Carlo). At night, turn down service was insane. They left us chocolates, slippers for us in our exact shoe sizes, and turned on soft music for us. Overall, Raniel gave us the absolute best service imaginable and deserves a raise!!! He even remembered us later in the weekend and asked how our anniversary was going :)

Here are the other highlights of Aria:
+Tower Lounge: We grabbed breakfast here every morning & were able to grab a free table each time. Delicious food: bacon cheddar scones, croissants, green tea coffee cake, raspberry coffee cake, fresh fruit. And constant flow of coffee, tea, espresso, sodas, and bottled water throughout the day (and desserts if you're into that). This place probably saved us at least $100 in breakfast and coffee fees! Use this amenity if it comes with your room!

+The pool & pool bar were AWESOME. We went in the mornings around 9:30 and always got chairs in good spots. The pool landscaping is gorgeous like a sculpture garden. Heated pool. Towering views of Aria & Vdara when you look up. And the pool bar is a must. I know the drinks are ridiculously pricey, but you are in VEGAS. Everywhere is pricey, and these drinks are mixed very well & will make your experience that much better.

+The decor & architecture throughout the hotel are gorgeous. These factors made Aria our favorite hotel on the Strip. It is super modern, chic, sexy, and open. We were in awe of the space! 

+Javier's margaritas we the perfect zip for 4pm fatigue. Definitely put some tipsy pep in our steps! 

+Jean Philippe pastries are so good. Need to try more than one. We particularly liked Opera & Imperial cakes.

+Good spot on the strip\/ centrally located\/ easy connection to Cosmopolitan. 

Some things we didn't care for:
-Caution that some of the corner suite views are less than ideal. We were originally assigned a 6th floor corner suite facing the tram station and some really ugly metal structure that I think hid mechanical stuff. Luckily we got upgraded, but we wouldn't have been happy paying a premium for those views.

-Aria Cafe. Seriously, DO NOT be tempted! The service was so slow for lunch (took 1.5 hrs to get out, and it wasn't even that busy at 3pm). The turkey club tasted like Denny's, yet cost $26!!!! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!!!! Stay away!

-Javier's shrimp cocktail is very meh for the price. Stick with the margaritas and chips only for happy hour!!!",1,1,1

Haze was also a lot of fun. I'd recommend getting VIP entry one way or another so you don't have to wait in the ridiculous line. J. Cole was playing the night I went, so maybe that's why it was so long. I was one of the lucky ones, though...

The only downside (and I don't really consider this a downside), is it's a bit longer walk since it sits a little off the strip. But no big deal.

I have enjoyed their Standard, Tower Suites, and Sky Suites!  Each room has a magnificent view, comfy beds, and, great ventilation!  The amenities do differ in each category, as one should expect!

Besides the wonderful rooms\/suites; there is their fabulous gym and spa; a smoke-free sports viewing room; awesome restaurants for an array of tastes; a lively nightclub; and, inviting cabanas and pools!

There are plenty of tables to choose from in their casino; their entry foyer's seasonal displays are outstanding; and, limosine service with Sky Suites!

Spontaneous trip, but the engagement, wedding, and everything else was always in the plans. We looked around at hotels (Yelp, Orbitz, etc) when we got there. I hadn't been to Vegas in years. We looked at several hotels and decided this was definitely not the cheapest, but after looking inside, we figured it was our wedding and opted for a nicer and more expensive room at the Aria. We shelled out about $250 for a king room on the 5th floor. 

We thought the room was gorgeous! Updated and modern. Electronic controls for the curtains, lights, music, and everything. The view was OK, but had mostly a view of the roof down below from the 5th floor. The bed was super comfy! We finally got to bed about 3am and just melted into it. Super soft! We liked the decor, etc and we're generally impressed with the room even tho the controls for the lights were a little difficult to figure out. 

The mini bar was well stocked. But super expensive as they always are. It surprised me when I saw a sign afterwards that if anything is removed from the fridge for more than 60 seconds you get charged for it. Huh? I hoped I didn't check anything out for more than a minute! 

The casino floor, shopping area, restaurants, etc seemed very modern and clean to us although we didn't go to any of them. We were only there for a day and always opted to eat elsewhere. Check out the strip, etc. 

What I didn't like was that the self parking was way on the other side of the casino from registration which was a big walk from the elevator, etc. We had to walk about a mile it seemed to park, get a room, walk back to get our stuff, back to the elevator, etc. 

Overall, it was a good experience. We checked out several other hotels and casinos while there. You can get a $50 room, but you get $50 amenities we found. Depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a cheap place to sleep, get a $50 room. If you want to really stay in class, go with Aria, the Cosmopolitan, Bellagio or something. Expect to pay $200 or so. 

So....check out the Aria. Give it a try. It's nice. If you don't like it, don't go back. I think you'll be impressed, however. We may check out another hotel in the future, but enjoyed our night at the Aria. No major complaints. And overall, we really enjoyed the room.",0,0,0

First, I got upgraded to the Sky Suites after arriving late to Vegas post my 3-hour flight delay (Screw you, Spirit Air!) The suite looked just like a regular room but the view was gorgeous! Like! It did take us awhile to find the safe...we even looked behind the paintings to see if it was hidden, lol. Other than that, the room was nice, clean, with a ton of cool features! I love being able to set my own wake up call by selecting the time the TV or lights should turn on, and choose for everything to shut off before bed, etc. Oh, and being able to control the curtains on the main switchboard. The only comment I have regarding the in-room technology is that there isn't a TV in the restroom (something pretty standard in most high-end hotels in Vegas). Aria, please fix that. WTF? 

As for the pool, I liked the pool side service except for the high drink prices. I ordered one bloody mary, and it cost a bloody $16. OUCH, they should have stabbed me with a knife instead of robbing me. 

The girls and I also checked out LIQUID, the pool party at ARIA. It was MEH unless you want to pay for a cabana.

Last but not least, the morning when I checked out, I noticed a bogus  $12 charge from the mini bar on my bill, but when I called to contest, they took it right off the bill with no questions asked. Customer service FTW.

1- The parking garage is a far convoluted walk to the front desk. You have to cut through the entire winding casino floor. 
2- The front desk staff wasn't nice or friendly, until they sent me to someone else's room. Yeah, they gave me someone else's room. 
3- Resort fee= ridiculous. You don't even get complimentary bottled water for $20 a night. You don't get free drinks either. The pool was also closed. 
4- There's nothing to eat here after midnight except for room service. Well, there is one place but according to Yelp reviews it doesn't even count.
5- The lounges here were completely dead on Friday AND Saturday night. I went to the Cosmopolitan instead. 
6- The touchscreen in the room is laggy and annoying at night. The screen is so bright that you have to put it facedown to get any peace. 
7- I was on the 25th floor facing the strip and had no view. It was completely blocked out by the other city center buildings.
8- Didn't see anyone winning money, and I spent about 4 hours total here gambling\/ watching other people gambling.

Our room was spectacular.   We did not have a strip view, but a gorgeous view of the mountains and the Monte Carlo.   The room was impeccably appointed with modern, luxurious decor.   The technology was really fun.   As others have noted, the curtains opened to greet us when we entered the room.   The control panel allowed us to control the electronics for the entire room without ever leaving our bed!

We had 2 queen beds as requested, and they were very comfortable.   Each bed came with a practical tower of incredibly soft, comfortable pillows.   The bathroom was beautifully laid out in what appeared to be some kind of marble.   

I cannot sing the praises enough of the Concierge desk.   All of our interactions with them were fun, helpful, and quickly responded to.   They always worked hard to help get our reservations, questions, or concerns addressed with a  smile.  We had great experiences in the casino, the lobby bar, Julian Serrano, Sage, and Cirque du Soleil as well.

As others have noted, the Aria is pricey.  Cocktails at the pool will run you a minimum of $20 per mixed drink in general, but that's Vegas!   Vegas is not a budget vacation destination and the Aria lives into making it feel like a luxury experience.

A couple of customer service notes:

1.  We checked in with a large group at the end of Columbus Day weekend.   We waited in line for check-in nearly 30 minutes and they seemed a little bit unprepared for the rush.   A group check-in desk for large parties would be REALLY helpful.

2.  When we arrived, a room was not ready for us until after 4 PM Vegas time despite the fact check-in is 3 PM.   It took two visits and a $10 tip for the concierge to get us into a room.   We had left the East Coast at 5 AM that morning and were utterly exhausted.  

3.  The toilet in our room didn't work upon our arrival and it took about 24 hours to get it repaired.   That's a pretty basic, essential part of my expectation of a hotel, and I would have liked to have seen a more urgent, timely response.  

Otherwise, a wonderful visit!!",0,0,0

So, when I find myself driving up the 15 North and welcomed by construction on the freeway and construction on Las Vegas Blvd. I knew that some things never really change. There's always construction for something new. It's like a conundrum wrapped in a riddle. 

Speaking of things that are new.....I stayed at the Aria during a friend's bachelorette weekend. The casino and the hotel was very modern and clean. The hotel is also located right next to the City Center (which consists of high end shop and a Mastros) and is directly on the strip a block away from the Bellagio. The room were easily the nicest Vegas rooms I've stayed in. The decor and furniture in the room and bathroom was contemporary and modern. Pretty much everything in the room is controlled by a remote panel - lights, TV, window curtain, clock, etc.

Beautiful use a water. Hear me out, reader. I find that every hotel has a different play on how they use water in the decor of the hotel. And Aria did beautifully with their waterfall wall outside the hotel. I was entranced every time I walked outside toward the valet.

I also thought the service was great. Every employee was super helpful! And really polite and understanding. I came with a group of eight other girls, and if we changed our minds about what time we were leaving the room, or forgot to put the service light on, everyone was super understanding. 

Ok, so if I'm gushing about this hotel, you'll probably wondering why I only gave it four stars. One simple reason......silly you might call it.

But I imagine it's you're paying, what you're paying for a room in this amazing hotel, there should be coffee maker. Here's the insult to injury - after getting dressed and packing up to start up my drive back to LA. I went downstairs to find a quick, cup of coffee and was greeted by the Jean Phillipe cafe - where the coffee only line was a 20 minute wait and the cost of a large brewed coffee was $4. That's $2.30 more than a large brewed Starbucks coffee! Had the group not been under a time crunch, we would have tried to locate a cheaper cup of coffee.

Room: It definitely isn't cheap to stay. The room was a lot nicer then what I was expecting. It was spacious, everything was electronically controlled. The restroom was amazing. I absolutely love the bath and shower combo. No fridge for you to sore drink because it's censored. 

Casino: cool big have all the new a lot machines

Store: 24hr store to buy almost everything you need or forget. Meds, pads, exlax haha

1- We booked 3 rooms and received an email a week later offering us a $25 dollar ""up grade"" for the view\/room.  2 of us paid it, and one did not.  When we got there, all 3 rooms were the same type of view, including the ones that we paid extra money for.  We were told that view interpretation varies!  I think we just paid extra for the same rooms we would have gotten anyhow.

2-  Hidden Fees!  Upon checkout we saw a $25 dollar a day Resort Fee.  We were told this was for a newspaper, gym use, and WiFi.  Really?  We were never told about these resources or fees.  I later researched it, and apparently several Hotels have one, but the Aria\/MGM is the highest compared to other hotels which charge $6.00-$11.00 dollars daily.

3- At night you can hear everyone loud and clear talking in the halls.

4-  The line to check-in was like the DMV on a Friday!  And for some reason it wouldn't allow us to express checkout in our room, so we also waited to checkout.

6- The bell service is split into two seperate areas with seperate staff, so you are expected to tip the guy taking your luggage, and then tip the guy who brings your luggage back.  Usually, you tip on recieving your luggage and all tips are shared.  I asked a bell employee about the system.

All in all, not going back and won't recommend.",2,1,1

It wreaked of cigars, cigarettes, and who knows what. Debated if she should call and switch rooms because we were so tired. We decided we were going to be able to rest and sleep well with that stench. Called front desk to double check we weren't assigned to a smoking room and they confirmed it is a smoke free room. Asked to switch rooms, waited over 30 minutes for someone to come rescue us with new key card for a new room. Mind you I talked to 3 people during this whole process and not one single person offered an apology. 

Finally got to the second room, guess what? The snack bar is completely a miss. No waters. Missing snacks. What is wrong with this place?

Funny thing, they have a scale and since my group of friends are doing a weight loss challenge, I thought it was perfect for the weigh in the following morning. Guess what? Oh that thing doesnt work.

We were so excited because the hotel is new and beautiful. We arrive for checkin-in, and get ready to check into our 6 rooms. This is where things start to go downhill.

We requested double beds in all rooms, we got all king size beds. They have no rollaways. awesome when you're planning on 4 to a room. Most of the rooms were good, but the customer service was terrible. 

The first night I was ready to go back to my room around 1:30 or 2 AM. My key didn't work. I go down to the front desk to get it fixed. There are 7 people in line, some people still trying to check in, and one person working the desk. 

I waited an hour to have my key reset. I asked the guy why he didn't have any help, he replies, ""MGM is cheap"".

Great center strip location with easy access to fabulous restaurants & Crystal shops. From 25th floor, I got a decent side view of the strip and entrance water fountain.

Gorgeous & sexy architecture 

Great valet service: will have your car ready for pick up when you call ahead

A little sense of (false) security with staffs checking for key card - because they really don't ~.~

Not so good: 

Who said casino area was smoke free? It is not! Smoke here and smoke there. And ashtrays in full display. Yuk...

Awkward set up - what? frosted door for toilet area??

Ouch! Blackout curtain is not so blacking out at the top. Something that I did not experience at Wynn or Encore

Annoying weight sensored mini bar fridge

Must walk the whole promenade to go back and forth to Spa... Not so Zen! Same thing for pool access. And hint hint - do not expect exclusivity at the pool unless you are staying at Sky Suites. ~.~

Valet pick up is outside of main or north side lobby. Not so cool in 100 degrees Vegas Summer heat.

It is one of the newer lodging options offered by mLife group. And we get great perks through it. But it feels like certain parts of its set up are... Awkward.

This is one of the most expensive places to stay on the Vegas strip, but it's not the nightly room cost that hurts the most, it's all the little extra fees imposed for what should be basic services.  First up the new Vegas universal scam of charging a resort fee of $29 a day in addition to your nightly room cost.  Secondly the minibar in your room is rigged like an explosive ready to go off should you have the poor sense to eat or drink any of the beverages and snacks stocked in the rooms only refrigerator.  You can get your own refrigerator however the cost is $25 a day plus taxes.  This is my fourth day here and my room has been cleaned only once and that was after I had to go to the front desk and complain that our room did not appear to have been cleaned completely before we arrived.  There was a damp towel on the floor behind a chair and a huge booger smeared along the bathroom wall.  Some of the many mini-bar items were missing and after reading the signage I wanted to make sure that I was not going to be held responsible for the missing items.  Before I forget, I would like to mention that the Fiji water large bottle in the minibar is $8.50.  A ski mask and a shotgun would be more subtle than trying to rob your guests for with an $8.50 bottle of water.  Exploiting guests like that is an asshole move, period.  
Lastly, if you're going to provide ""free"" Wi-Fi make sure is it is at least operating at 20 Mb per second - anything else is simply unusable and completely frustrating to someone who may have brought a laptop specifically so they could do work while on vacation.  I was told at check in that the $29 resort fee included free Wi-Fi...

We left early came back at 4:00 pm. Our room was still not done, came back later in the evening so I called the front desk to complain they apologized and offered a room food and beverage credit of 100.00 sound like a lot but when you have a plain vodka tonic cost 17.00 even when gambling doesn't go far. So they said they would have the room cleaned first in the morning we were leaving early at 7:30 am for horseback riding so I figured it would be taken care of, we got back at 2:30 our room was still unmade and dirty. I called again gif as nitty response asked for a manager said they would call back didn't happen.

The good:
-The rooms are pretty technologically savvy.  There's an iPad-like thing located on the nightstand that controls basically everything.  You can close the blinds, control the TV, and even ""refresh"" the room (which also puffs some smelly-goods into the bathroom!) without even leaving your bed!
-The bell-people are friendly and quick.  We had no problem getting our stuff to our room and then back to our car when we left.

The not so good:
-The north valet guys are RUDE.  They don't direct you to where they want you to park, but then honk someone's horn when you park in the wrong spot.
-The mini fridge is completely unusable.  If you pick up an item for more than 30 seconds, you're automatically charged.  The person checking us in didn't bother to inform us, but fortunately I heard the person next to us being told, so we had no issues.  The fridge is also stuffed to the gills, so don't bother putting your own stuff in it.
-The towels are HARD.  I prefer to exfoliate with face wash, but this was a double whammy.  At least my face was nice and smooth after a double exfoliation.
-No free water bottles in the room.  Sorry, but I'm paying $25 a day in resort fees.  I think a bottle of water would be nice.
-I frequently heard the neighbors talking at 2 a.m.  The walls should be a bit thicker.  I can understand hearing someone scream, but regular talking?
-The valet people just aren't as nice as I expect.  Offer me directions, it means a lot even if I don't need them.

Here's the deal:  If I'm paying $200 a night for a room, I expect a certain level of service and I just didn't get it here.  There was nothing WRONG with the hotel room, but the service just wasn't up to par.  Comparing to the Aria's sister hotel next door, Vdara, the Aria just didn't live up to my expectations.  The Vdara is cheaper, quieter, and smells nicer, due to it being a non-smoking, non-gaming property.  They offer two free bottles of water a day in the rooms and also offer directions every time we retrieve our car from valet.  In the future, I'll stay at Vdara.",3,1,1

The line for the concierge was also ridiculously long, but there were often helpful staff members milling about who could answer general questions. The loud music at the pool was annoying, but that appears to be the case everywhere in Vegas. The $20 ""resort fee"" is kind of a rip off.

I used to like THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, but that property is a bit dated.  Service is awful, too.  I like Encore, but everything is so expensive there.  Bellagio is one big tourist mecca.  The other hotels (Caesars, Venetian, PH, etc.) feel claustrophobic. Dark.  Low ceilings.  Smoky.  Same crowd you'd find on a Carnival cruise ship.

My favorite hotel is Mandarin Oriental, but they don't have a casino... and if I'm in Vegas, I kind of want a casino in the building.  Easy access.  Aria is part of the City Center complex... same as Mandarin Oriental (and Cosmo, which I'll get to in a separate review).   Big, open casino.  High ceilings.  Newer machines.  Very little smoke.  Lots of good dining options (except for their buffet... which is terrible). The rooms are all modern and high tech.  Bathrooms are clean and logical.  Service is exceptional.  Elevators are grouped by floor ranges... which makes for a quick trip. They have a ""promenade"" level where you can get to the spa, pool, Starbucks, the shops) without having to go through the casino.  The resort even just smells nice.

The fitness center is cool, but it closes at 8PM... which is pretty early.  Back to the dining options... Todd English's P.U.B is a great place for chicken parm sliders, lobster rolls, and good food at a reasonable price.  The Five50 pizza joint serves some of the best pizza I've had (awesome when you're highly buzzed at 1AM and need to fill your belly).  Lemongrass had slow service, but awesome Thai food. Blossom offers typical Chinese dishes, but 5-star service in an elegant setting.  My best friend is Chinese and agreed that it was some of the best she's had.    They've got a Javier's off the casino floor if you want a tasty margarita, Mastro's if you want a steak, and the list goes on (Julian Serrano, Sage, Social House, She by Morton's). 

Aria's got a good location. Mandarin Oriental is next door and offers MoZen and a nice bar with a view.  Cosmo isn't too far away.   A bridge will take you across the street to Planet Hollywood, Bubba Gump, and a bunch of stuff.  CVS is nearby.

So... it's relatively new, big, clean, and offers a lot of variety.  I'd stay here again.",8,3,2

I arrived in the evening and had a long distance to walk from where the bus from the airport dropped us off underneath the facility on the south side.  While it was a long distance you get to walk past all of the casino games.  

TIP:  Take a cab from the airport to the Aria.  They will drop you off right in front of the lobby.

The lobby was well staffed and moved quickly through the line.  We walked back to the elevators which are separated into four banks.  My room was on the 6th floor, overlooking the city and when I got to the room my mind proceeded to get blown.  I swiped the keycard and opened the door the room lights slowly brightened, the black-out curtain automatically retracted, followed by the sheer.   Then the TV turned on.  It was just that little ""extra"" that proves the designers of the Aria knew how to deliver the goods.

TIP:  If you arrive at night, get familiar with the layout and light switches.  There is a master switch by the door that will turn everything on to full brightness - or turn everything off immediately.

The room was very clean, and everything can be controlled either via an interface on the TV, or from a remote located on one of the beside tables.  The king size bed had great pillows, as well as a superior mattress and bedding.

The room does have a mini-bar that is well stocked with everything from candy bars, chips, and soft drinks, to your favorite beers and distilled liquors.   Of course the Aria is hoping you'll take advantage of these goods and pay the higher prices, which might be necessary if your in the mood.

TIP:  The Aria requires a credit card at check in for incidentals.  This amounts to an extra $130\/night authorized as pending.  Of course everything is reversed once you check out and the final bill is reconciled.  If you decide to use your bank\/debit card keep in mind your financial institution will block this amount from the balance in your account and the credit may take a few days to appear before they release your funds again.

While I was only there for business, and I'm not a gambler I thought the prices in the two restaurants were comparable with other Las Vegas fine dining.  And just as the other Yelpers mentioned, it's proximity to the airport, integration with the tram system, and connection to the City Center which has upscale dining and retail shopping makes this a definite destination.

Even though I was there for a short time I will be back again with my spouse and enjoy all the other portions of the complex, like the pool\/spa, buffet, and perhaps the casino.  Thanks again for a great stay Aria.  It made my business trip memorable.",5,0,0

I was pretty skeptical after I booked this place, due to the other reviews, however I had no problems here.  The customer service was AMAZING, everyone was so friendly and helpful!!
The hotel is beautiful, not cheesy Vegas style, and smelled so nice and clean, at first I wondered if it was smoke-free--it's not but they do a terrific job ventilating:)

The bars and restaurants are good as well--The Union was a little over-priced and the service odd, but there are some cute boys working there, so whatevs....

And on to that topic...the place was literally crawling with hot business men types, super clean cut and good-looking, probably since its a convention center as well, so this was probably the first thing I noticed...I will check it out in a couple of weeks to see if thats the norm.

Haze was just another ""club"" scene, not really my cup of tea but if your into that cheesy clubby Ed Hardy wearing douchbag scene than you might like it, or if you're looking for a one-night-stand with a shirtless spraytanned d-bag then there you go:) ha

The Spa was beautiful and the gym was over the top amazing, you have to pay $30 to use it though, probably since it cost them like a gazillion dollars to put in, but it's really amazing and again..hot guys dripping from the walls here:)

There's something refreshing about not having a set time to wake up, eat, drink, or go to bed. Pure freedom. Aria makes it especially easy with the best rooms on the strip, a central location and plenty of eclectic restaurants and amenities.

Let's start with the room. They are full on Smart rooms. I'm talking touchscreen everything. Turn on the TV? Done. Change the temperature? Done. Open just the blackout curtains and leave the sheers closed? Done. It's awesome! There's even a goodnight button that let's you shut everything off and close the curtains at once. The beds are equally as amazing. Soft and luxurious linens cover a hefty pillow top mattress that I could fall asleep on for days straight. It'll cure any hangover (almost!). The bathrooms are large with his and her sinks, a large bathtub and a shower. The TV includes a component box where you can play music through your phone, stream movies through HDMI or connect your computer. Free turn down service is available by calling housekeeping where they leave you slippers and little chocolates by your bedside. And every window juts out a little so you get a small corner view. It doesn't sound like much but it makes a big difference when you're facing the strip!

How about the rest of the hotel? It's new so they know how smart it is to have high ceilings and pump the smoke out as quickly as possible. I read somewhere that 80% of the air is replaced each hour. It's still Vegas so it's not perfect, but step one foot inside Excalibur and you'll immediately notice the difference! They also scent the air with a hint of vanilla which is a nice touch. The restaurants on site vary from cheap to expensive and there are plenty options. Jean Phillipe is an affordable stop for a quick lunch or dessert (They're amazing! Try the Nutella napoleon!) while Lemongrass is my favorite moderately priced (cheap by Vegas standards) dinner restaurant serving Thai and Asian cuisine. While it's no Mandalay Beach or Mirage pool, the pool area is pretty solid with a choice of three pools. If you're looking to avoid children, head to the one in the back left and you'll be golden. 

Overall, while I've stayed at many hotels on the strip, I find myself coming back to the Aria. It's a true 5 star hotel unlike many of the three or four star properties that would easily lose a star if they were located anywhere else. With it situated directly in the center of the strip, the location is hard to beat as well. Do yourself a favor and try Aria out. You won't be disappointed.",2,3,4

Don't get me wrong, this hotel is BEAUTIFUL (of course it is, it's brand new...) BUT there are a few things that could definitely make this hotel a 5 star hotel. 

Like I mentioned before, the rooms are beautiful and modern. There are two controls (one remote) and one beside touchscreen that control the lights, curtains, temperature, etc for the room. It's very snazzy. 

The staff was nice enough (a little bit slow in getting a bellhop and security - we were locked out of our room and it took FOREVER causing us to run even LATER for our flight and we eventually missed and had to re-book)...

I was very frustrated at first because like my other fellow yelpers, my room was given away. I originally booked for a 2 queen size bed room NON-smoking b\/c I have asthma...and specifically put in the notes at the time of booking that I had a late flight coming in. The front desk receptionist told me that the only rooms available were 1 king size, SMOKING rooms which I said NO. 

He eventually gave us a non-smoking king size hotel room and said that the front desk would give US a call the next morning. They did not. I called early in the afternoon and got a GRUMPY woman on the phone who told me that I had to call back in 2 hours. Um, hello, am I supposed to remember to call your butt when I'm out having fun in Vegas? I think not. Major FAIL Aria. 

I went back to the desk later and spoke to the same receptionist as the first night. He apologized and put in the request AGAIN and said I should call the next morning because the exact same thing happened and our correct room was given away. So irritating. He then comped $50 to spend @ the hotel (we already did get free spa passes for all three days plus an ""upgrade to a city view room"" - never got that upgrade oh well)...A few hours later, I spoke to another receptionist and he was able to get us the RIGHT room. FINALLY!! 

All in all, the room and amenities were nice...I've heard excellent things about the Aria's nightclub, but was not feeling well enough to go...

The rate for the Aria is 250?? a night?? Would definitely NOT pay the full price for it..totally not worth it. Service is not the best and although the rooms are excellent, the fact that they give away rooms is not cute. Especially when it apparently happens a lot. Way to go Aria!

It's newer than most in the strip and its huge! 

You can't smell any cigarettes and it's very beautiful. 

Tons of trendy art all over the place and tins of space. You don't feel cramped or like you're rubbing elbows with others when playing. 

Higher in the limit side most machines are $1-10 and the tables are more like $50-$100 a hand! 

You need deep pockets to play here. 

It's easy to get in and out of if you walk from other properties in the strip but difficult via car. 

I actually found it to be less crowded than other casinos. It might be due to the high cost of rooms or that others just prefer other casinos.

Having all the space was convenient and nice to have. 

I love their tub with a separate shower. But the bathroom wasn't spacious. Dislike the pillows too, they were too soft for my preference.

Even though the bed was divine and very comfortable, one of my four pillows had mascara left on it and it looked kindof fresh- like in the ""previous"" guests. I'm not a huge NEAT freak, but there was dust everywhere in the room.  Since it is such a new hotel, I wanted to also experience the ""newness"" of it but dust and cobwebs really turned me off. Our TV remote didn't work so had to have Maintenance come to fix it.  We did not get our room cleaned on our 3rd day.  We just called for clean towels instead of complaining.  I loved the complimentary bathrobes and they were super comfy, but now I'm beginning to wonder if they were clean or not.  Couldn't a guest just hang theirs back up after using it, and then I come in and throw it on?ewww
I will also agree about the taste of the water.  It was sooo nasty, even just to use it to brush my teeth.  
MY BIGGEST GRIPE is the noise from the Cosmopolitan next door.  It is still under construction but let me tell you, they were testing the emergency alarms all four days we were there.  And YESSSS even during the night.  I had to use my earplugs to sleep and I also had to pop an Ambien.  The noise was very very disturbing.
 The hotel elevators were really fast and the walk to our room was not too  long, but trying to find the damn elevators from the casino floor was complicated.  We got so turned around the entire time we were there.  We tried like heck to remember which direction was to the Guest Elevators, Tram to Bellagio, or to the Elvis Theatre.  We walked in circles so much I got all the workout I needed.  I did not like the waitstaff in the SkyBox bar.  It wasn't even that busy, but every single one of them were totally cold to us. Oh, they did get nicer to us when they brought out our check. The Buffett wasn't that good either. Waitresses just not really that kind and the Omelett guy seemed really bored.  
BEST OF ALL   I would say the entire staffing at the front desk and all of the Bell Hops were BEYOND professional.  They couldn't have been nicer to us.  We had a very nice CheckIn and Check Out experience.  Could NOT checkout from our room on the t.v. though   Not an option. Loved the showerhead, loved the bathroom layout and enjoyed playing with the Master control.  Did I mention how great the bed was?  Super comfy and warm.

Aria is an elegant space with a modern, fun decor. Compared to other hotels on the Strip, Aria has a mimilasitc design that feels classy and calming. There's a very cool tree motif that I noticed throughout the resort; whether it's a carpet pattern or wall tile designs, the curving beauty of raw wood inspirations are stylish and interesting.

Excellent service from every aspect of Aria staff made our stay a truly 5-star experience. Kanema at check-in was so friendly and accommodating, and she went out of her way to match us with a lovely room. She along with Heather made sure that my parents, who were arriving days later, would receive a room on the same floor too.

We used the North Valet multiple times a day, and each attendent moved fast and was quick to help with bags or directions. In similar fashion, housekeeping was excellent, and our room felt as fresh as if we just checked in each day of our stay.

The on-site gym was wonderful - plenty of machines & free weights, along with complimentary towels, water, and apples. The pools and hot tubs are clean and well-kept, and service is very prompt without hovering too much.

My experience at Aria was pleasant but not as great as I expected. 

First, for the good things-- check in is fairy quick as there are lots of open counters, all of which have their own lines. The check in staff was also extremely helpful and accommodating. Because of our late check in we ended up having to take a room on the smoking floor and were pleasantly surprised as there was no odor in our rooms. =)  It is also one of the most techie hotels, the rooms are all personalized and lights and curtains can all be controlled with a master remote control.

Now, for the downsides-- the casino floor is small and all the tables are crowded especially if you want to bet low. You often have to wait 10-15 minutes to get a seat a table with a low minimum bet.  Also, housekeeping failed to clean our room even though we specifically asked for it to be cleaned TWICE. 

Neutral-- if you're going to be going in big groups, know that both the toilet and shower have a see through door and the sink is attached to them making it difficult for people to get ready at the same time.

Everyday we went down to save lounge chairs when we woke up with a towel and magazine and then came back hours later to enjoy sitting in the shade. You don't need to reserve a lounge chair as it costs money and is in the sun. Gym is huge and wonderful! Fresh fruit daily which we happily stocked up on.

I lost who knows how much on the blackjack tables, but made it all back at the Craps tables.

The hotel staff was better than most and the security guards were on top of checking the room keys which made me feel better about keeping my bikes in my room.

As expected, the fridge was booby trapped with a 30 second switch, so we couldn't keep our drinks in the fridge. The view from my room was pretty epic as well.

I'm an invited guests at Venetian and Bellagio, but i opted to pay and stay at Aria.

When we first arrived, Aria did not feel like a hotel at all. it felt more like a convention center. the parking lot was so freaking far from the lobby,  we lined up for 20 minutes to get checked in. The front desk lady gave us a room in the 8th floor. we walked through the teeny-weeny casino and walked to the hidden elevator. When we went into the room, it was one giant big mess. there were chips and nuts all over the floor, the sheets are all over. Bottomline, they checked us into a DIRTY room. we called the front desk and were asked to move to 29th floor. we waited for one HOUR for the hotel keys to get to the new room. When we got to the new room, another disappointment! what they claimed to be a ""clean"" room was full of dust!! We called the manager and they did not even ry to compensate and moved us to another room. The last room was still dirty and dusty. the lights were not working properly, windows were dirty. i was sneezing like crazy coz of my allergy. the rooms are super small too.

This hotel is definitely not ready to be opened and not up to par compare to venetian and wynn! the casino is so small and the slots were all either 1 cents or $5 machines. no variety.

We stayed during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and got the added bonus of checking in at the  Tower Suite Lounge. We were able to avoid the very busy check in line at the main lobby. Nice! 

**The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly.
**The Tower Suite Lounge is located directly across from the main registration desk or main lobby.  Not to be confused with the Sky Suite Lounge. You enter through two large double doors. The lounge  is comfortable with complimentary coffee, espresso machine,  tea, sodas, juices, bottled water, and snacks. The sodas, bottled water, and juices are stored in the refrigerated  compartments just below the espresso machine and coffee urns. Cool! 
**The hotel is beautifully decorated. 
**Our room with city view is spacious, lux and beautiful. Cool! 
**Lights, climate control- A\/C, entertainment units, and drapes are all tablet driven. All info re: hotel  amenities; restaurants; and things to do are all available on the tablet. Cool! 
**Large bathroom with shower\/roman tub combo. Cool! 
**Great meals at Pizza Five50, the Café, and Julian Serrano. Hosts, food servers, drinks servers, and bartenders all super-pleasant at these establishments. Cool! 
**Lots of eateries.
** Awesome snacks, service and drinks at the beautifully decorated Lobby Bar (great spot to unwind, catch your breath, part yourself from the Vegas excitement, quietly watch people buzz through the large lobby, and have a refreshing cocktail, cold beer, or glass of wine). Cool! 
**You can watch your favorite ponies (various race tracks) at the Sports Bar- Real fun!  Cool! 
**Room rates are very reasonable for lux value. Cool! 
**Access to towers are secure with a guard stationed at the elevator entrances. Cool! 
**Plenty of self-parking, but can be cumbersome  when exiting the garage. Take a cab, UBER, or better yet, ask local Vegas relative or friend to shuttle you around. Make sure to reciprocate and buy them a nice meal and\/or drinks. 

If you don't mind the Las Vegas Blvd. strip traffic, and want to stay at a lux hotel that won't break your wallet, ARIA is a great lux escape.

**Resist and stay away from the room mini bar selection. The price for convenience can be jaw-numbing\/eye-popping. Not Cool!  Upgrade to the Tower Suite and enjoy access to the lounge for the complimentary drinks and snacks as you wish! 

Also, needless to say at this lux property, the eateries are not  for the budget minded. Try the restaurants and splurge on quality dining. Worth it!

Out of a six night stay, I can't identify one person who provided anything that resembled good service.  Wait times were long everywhere - daytime or night - and we regularly had to wave down staff for assistance during any meal that didn't involve us ordering at a counter.  

Our room had peeling wallpaper, gunk stuck above the shower, and hair from a previous stay on the floor.  And, Mobile Check In, that promises to help you skip the line, doesn't work. 

On our fifth day, I became violently ill - ultimately, I found out I had contracted norovirus at some point during my stay - and couldn't get a manager on the line to take a report about potential food poisoning.  Despite speaking with the Front Desk, speaking with Room Service when I had to order soup, and after leaving a voice message for an admin in the F&B department, I only received an email response three weeks later from Guest Services after I completed their ""How Was My Stay"" questionnaire.  I was instructed to call Security to file a report and, when I asked for someone to call me, to make sure they actually had time to speak with me, I was told ""A member of their team will call you directly to discuss in detail all of your concerns"".

Under construction during the big financial crash it sought to outdo all its rivals on the Vegas Strip in terms of looks, architecture, amenities, and luxury.

Every aspect of this hotel is a visual treat and a work of art.  The hotel rooms themselves were quite luxurious even for the entry level two bed versions with great fit and finish everywhere.  Luckily I managed to score a discount hotel room rate after years of patiently waiting and jumped on that ASAP.

For food, highlights include the Jean Phillipe Patisserie, Julian Serrano tapas bar and its connection to the Todd English PUB.  Also for those who have the late night munchies post club, they do have a 24 hr eatery Cafe Vetto.

My only minus point which really can't be held as a criticism given the level of luxury, is the lack of a convinient quick fast food court.  No you'll have to walk over to the neighbouring Monte Carlo for that.

It is a pretty big property so the experience is similar to staying at MGM or Cesar's but I actually think their signage is a little better so I never got lost and was always able to find my way back to the room. I also appreciate that they have someone checking room keys day and night to make sure no one gets on the elevators other than people who are staying there (or overnight guests of someone staying there, wink, wink... hey it's Vegas after all).

I found the room to be plain but adequate. The bathroom was pretty nice. There was nice tile\/granite and a big garden tub that was behind the shower so if the water overflowed it went down the shower drain. Very smart. However, I did notice some of the bathroom tiles had a little bit of staining\/mildew. So, not perfect. Really my only major issue was the bed. It was just not comfortable. It felt really lumpy. It was soft, which is how I prefer my mattresses, but it just felt worn out. I also didn't like that they had a synthetic comforter instead of a duvet with a sheet cover that could be washed. Most hotels are doing that nowadays for sanitary reasons. Also, their ""blackout"" curtains let in a bunch of light from the top which also made it difficult to sleep late. Anyway for whatever reason I just couldn't get a good sleep there and so that is the main reason for subtracting a couple stars. I mean, you can go to any casino in Vegas to gamble\/eat\/drink but you need a comfortable sleep afterwards so that's the main reason for staying somewhere nice, right?

I do still think Aria is a great property, though. I like their understated décor and lack of a cheesy theme. I don't really care for their buffet but all the other restaurants we've tried have been very good. And we did get a chance to use their pool area and it was really nice as well. A major bummer was that they did not have anyone serving drinks and there was always a line at the bar. Someone needs to tell Aria that the recession is over and they need to staff up. They did not have enough valets or people working the front desk either. Or servers in the casino area. One day our room did not get cleaned at all.

Although we got a very good deal for the weekend stay we could have gotten this deal at other better hotels, we decided we liked the central location.  After reflecting back on the location decision, it really wasn't very critical since we ended up taking Uber to most destinations anyway.

Hotel room was OK and needed some updating.  Shower pressure was amazing and I took more than my typical one shower a day since I really enjoyed it.

The rooms could use some technological updating, like being able to sync TV and speakers with devices, better charging stations, etc.  The room is feels like its more than 10 years old in that sense.

The public areas in the hotel are really great and offer lots of restaurant choices, nice casino floor, very nice pools, shopping, Starbucks, etc.  It is also connected to a higher end mall with good shops and restaurants, so the location and amenities are definitely a big draw for some.

Pool atmosphere here is not a young loud party scene.  It is rather a more older late 30s-50s quieter scene with some kids here and there.  Definitely not all family with loud kids, but also not young 20s party scene.  They do have a day club named Liquid which is cool if you want to party.

I found breakfast at the cafe to be super overpriced and the quality of food to be lower than par.  My omelette was very springy (almost like fake eggs were used) and coffee was just passable.  The Cafe, however, was very good and came in handy after one night of partying and needing to eat very late.

Check in check out was very simple and convenient.

I love the public art in this casino.  Check out the second floor between the ice cream shop and the buffet.  They have some great art on the walls.  Plus, they have holes in the floor left of the buffet (across the hall from Jean Georges, American Fish, and Sirio) where you can look down to the first floor.  It's a pretty interesting design.

Something I discovered on my last visit - this is an occupancy based property.  Which means that if the occupancy is low, they start temporarily closing restaurants.  Because it does not front the street, not many people walk in from the street apparently.  We went when NFR and the marathon were in town and four restaurants were closed!

I'm not into smoke-filled casinos.  I'm not into Elvis impersonators.  So, the fact that I could have enjoyed my recent stay in Vegas at all is a testament to Aria.  It's one classy, non-Vegas, well-designed, stunning place:  a city of steel and glass.  If you want Vegas cheese, go elsewhere.  If you want a place with a little class and fewer drunks, I would recommend staying at Aria.  

My suite was a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall glass, apartment-sized pad with everything electrified.  Wake up to your curtains automatically opening throughout the room.  Enjoy your well-equipped bathroom and your Toto Washlet.  Then make your way downstairs to one of their elegant dining spaces.  

I wish I had more time to have shopped at Viceroy.  I managed to be actually inspired by the men's clothing they had.  In 15 minutes I nabbed a pair of John Varvatos pants at 65% off, and got them hemmed for pick up later that night.  Now that's Vegas!

In addition, the conference facilities were clean, generous, and well-equipped.  Nothing too elaborate, but everything you would want for a large-scale conference or meeting.

My only complaints, which are small, are:

- The bathroom sink faucets splash back at any water level.  Did no one on the design team actually notice (or get soaked by) this design flaw?  
- No in-room coffee maker...even in a suite?  Really?!
- The Aria limo picking me up at the airport was an hour and 15 minutes late.  However, they made up for it with a beautiful cheese and wine service in my room.

The rooms are fun! Modern with automated controls that do everything from open and close the blinds to controlling the lights. 

The Pools: instead of having one large pool they split it into multiple smaller pools which opens the space up for more chairs and cabanas. The wait staff is great and there to get you almost anything you need or want. 

Staff: From checkin to checkout, the staff is there to make your stay wonderful. I told the front desk attendant that my Fiancée was visiting Vegas for the first time so he shifted our room so we had a view of the strip. Our blinds broke at one point and within 3 minutes a tech knocked on our door and had it fixed in 5 minutes. The maid noticed we used certain bath products more than the other and without asking, stocked extra.

Here's what could be improved:

The conference food was sub standard. We had a white fish that no one could eat or identify.  The AV equipment caused some problems throughout the day and some rooms were 90 degrees while others were 60.

Besides Jean Phillipe, the other dining options are not so great. Other hotels have buffets that are significantly better than Aria's the Buffet and the Aria cafe is ok at best. Instead go to Wicked Spoon or Gordon Ramsey Burger.

I was very impressed with the ambiance.  The art and aesthetics were terrific.  Down to the embroidered leather wallpaper in the halls.  Coolio.  The rooms are auto-everything; controlled via the flatscreen.  Mostly novelty, but fun.

We didn't really leave the room much during the day, as it was cold out and were are still in that super-early, fun, whirlwindy phase where everything seems impossibly romantic and sexy.  So we did order a lot of room service (tasty, but slow and sometimes forgetful) and enjoyed the thrill of being on the road.

All in all, this was something between four and five stars.  I have to say, I didn't love that when I asked for a 2 PM late checkout, they charged us a half day rate.  Whatever.  Maybe I didn't win the lottery.  But, wait... hold on... JACKPOT!",1,1,1

We know we wanted a nicer hotel and after a lot of research we chose the Aria. The location is great- right on the strip next to the Monte Carlo and the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio is right next to that. 
The check in went smooth and easy and every was very friendly. The lobby is clean and airy and the decorations up for the Chinese New Year were very beautiful.
Our room was great. When you walk in the lights turned on automatically, the shades open and music\/tv turn on. The view was spectacular (esp at night of course). The bed was SUPER comfy, the bathroom was amazing and it was clean. There is a touch pad that controls everything in the room, and also you can do that from the remote\/TV. I found that didn't always work and I never figured out how to turn on the bedside lamp.
The buffet is pricey- brunch for 2 was $75 and dinner was $100. However, after trying a buffet at another hotel as well for about the same price (brunch) I can firmly say that Aria's food selection, presentation and temperature of food was MUCH better. 
The casino's were nice and clean. We didn't try any of the restaurants or clubs.
We also went to Zarkana (Cirque show) within the building and it was AMAZING.
My only complaint is this: On the day we checked in we saw the mini bar which states you have 60 seconds to pick something up and look at it. You must put it back prior to 60 seconds or you will be charged (a sensor recognizes the item is gone). We noticed immediately that the prior guest figured a way around it- a Coke and Water were half drunk. We laughed about it- right then we SHOULD have called the front desk so we wouldn't get charged but we didn't- we were starved after our flight and were more concerned with going to get lunch. Low and behold the next day housekeeping found the bottles in the fridge and pulled them out which resulted in us being charged. After discussion we decided not to mention it because I said- we realized we should have said something right away. But they should realize their system is flawed since clearly 60 seconds is enough time for someone to grab a bottle, drink a bunch, and then put it back without getting charged.",0,0,0

In addition, the bed was kind of misshapen and way too soft (not in a good way).  The one bright side was that they did provide free WiFi!

We booked 2 nights for our 5th year anniversary. Months in advance I had booked our room and requested a view upgrade via email, just to see if it was a possibility.

So we pulled up to the Aria and from the outside, visually, it looks like a museum, extremely modern, and quite large and expansive. We used the valet and bellboys, they were quick and friendly, and we arrived during an extremely busy check in time, there were cars and lines of people everywhere, but none of the staff seemed to reflect the chaos going on around them. I went inside to get in the huge check in line that wrapped twice around, trying not to get irritated because i did not want to wait in that line...it moved very quickly and when we got to the front, once again the staff was incredibly friendly. Laura checked us in and asked what occasion we were there for and upgraded us to the sky suites. My heart sank into my stomach, I had seen the sky suites online and it was just a dream to even think of staying there. I cried i was so excited. We are on a serious budget, we have a new baby and would never spend that kind of money so it was an amazing blessing for us to get to stay there.

Walking through the casino, you would never know it allows smoking, the air is perfumed with a beautiful, soft floral scent, every where you go, so refreshing. The sky suites have a private access entry, lounge and elevators. The room was out of this world, breathtaking. Huge windows, amazing view, super clean, comfortable bed, awesome tv's, lighting, everything is touch screen. The maids offer you chocolates and turn down service, you get a newspaper daily, i just cannot say enough about the room! Amazing jetted tub, large shower with sitting area, bidet toilet.

The restaurants were so pretty, of course it is a luxury resort so it was a little pricey, the buffet was delicious! The pool was very clean, had servers waiting to serve you, plenty of towels and chairs. Everything in my opinion was top notch. The design of the hotel is so beautiful, tons of attention to detail everywhere you look. It is immaculate. Aria's staff was always friendly and went above and beyond to help us plan evenings out, get us into clubs on the VIP list, arrange transportation...etc. We were treated so wonderfully. We have stayed at many luxury hotels in vegas, the ritz, secrets in cancun, etc. & we both feel that this was the best overall experience we have ever had.

The interior was not designed in traditional casino-form.  It looks much different than the other casinos on the strip in that it has much more a trendy\/nightclub feel.  Even the Encore at the Wynn, a new hotel, still looks like an upscale casino, but Aria reminded me of a string of nightclubs and trendy bars with contemporary minimalist decorating.  The lighting is much darker than the other hotels, but the foot traffic in the casino was heavy and people were at the tables.  

The spa is gorgeous, but again, there weren't people utilizing the facility there, rather just walking through viewing- it is very well-decorated like some yoga retreat center.  The restaurants looked uninviting to families (dark, trendy, and each with a unique colored-glow) but probably appealing to a younger, single crowd.

I asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available- perhaps a room with a nicer view, and she quickly shot me down.  She confirmed my reservations, and asked me if it was correct.  I told her no; that I had requested two adjoining rooms, and that I had food and beverage credit for each room.  She said she would see what she could do.  She was able to get me the adjoining rooms.  However, she said that for the food and beverage credit, I only had $50 per room.  I told her that when I booked the rooms, it said it came with $100 each.  She then got authorization to give me $100 each which was very quick and no hassle at all.  I wonder if I could have pressed my luck with $200 credits per room!

Had booked a Corner Suite at the Aria back in January at that time i had requested a higher floor. 

Arrived at hotel about 830 am. Checked in and requested a higher floor and that I had no time frame as to when I wanted the room by. (as I was busy the entire day so getting into a room early was not a priority) 

About 1230 I get a call from the Aria to let me know our room was ready. I check in and the woman at the front desk says we have a room on the 6th floor. I told her that I had requested a higher floor. She proceeded to give me the whole we give rooms out as they become available. She than offered me a 9th floor room. I said fine if that's the best you can do I will take it. 

After the long trek to our room (corner suites are at the very end of all the floors) Our door is open. We crack open the door and one of the technicians is in the room trying to get the curtains to work. He is in there for about 30 minutes. Finally completes his work and he leaves and tells us to have a great stay..very friendly person but i found it odd they would give us a room when it was still being worked on. 

We inspect the room and were impressed with the view and features of the room. Unfortunately the stains on the couch and on the top covers of the bed ruined all that. 

We called the front desk to complain and they said they would send someone to clean the room and replace the sheets. Well we left for the day and came back about 6PM to change and get ready for dinner at Delmonico steak house. Well guess what the stains were still there No one ever bothered to come clean. So as we leave the hotel I stop in front to let them know our room has still not been attended too.

1.cool technology

Probably one of the nicest in Vegas with everything in the room being controlled by computer.  Pretty cool being able to open the curtains to look at the view from your bed.  Speaking of the bed...incredible....haven't slept so well in Vegas ever.

So why the two stars?  Price gouging everywhere.  Our plane was delayed so we ended up getting in really late...to late to go looking for restaurants so we ended up eating at LemonGrass.  Food was okay but not worth the price. Great service but the food tasted like PF Chang's....sorry but true.  We walked out 100.00 later and not super impressed (do not mind paying for a good meal).

Next day we went to spend the day at the pool.  There are 3 pools so we did not have a problem finding a chair and it was reasonably quiet (it is vegas) but when I asked for a pool menu I about lost it at the prices.....Most inexpensive sandwich was 18.00 without anything with it....drinks were out of control as well.  I know when you stay nice places food\/drinks are expensive but to me the prices they ask are not in-line with the experience you get.

It was a Saturday so as the day went on the pool behavior was enough to make this red-head blush! I know it's Vegas but there are some things I just do not need to see in daylight (especially if I am sober because their drink prices are ridiculous).  Decided to go up to our room about 4 before I saw things my eyes could not unsee....and seriously questioned if I wanted to get into the pool the next day remembering what I had just witnessed.  We were on the 23rd floor pool-side and I could not take a nap (it was going to be a long night) because the pool noise was so loud.

We didn't eat there any other nights after the first night but had some cocktails in the lobby and again WAY overpriced.

I ignored it and just wanted to get to my room.  We get our keys and go to the room and our room was already booked.  Someone was inside our room (30159).

On the first day, we visited the Alibi Lounge in the afternoon and had a wonderful time. We just had two drinks at the lounge - one being my favorite - a Rum Runner. They made it very special, with fresh squeezed blackberry juice and a frothy top - none like I ever had before. It was the best Rum Runner I ever had.

Returned on Day 2 for the same. About 6:00, right after dinner. The service this time sucked - we sat there over 15 minutes watching the server walk by repeatedly, looked at us, but ignored us. Frustrated and tired of being ignored by the server, we went to the bar directly to order our drinks. My wife ordered her drink; I asked for the same Rum Runner. This other bartender made a disappointing normal version with grenadine. We asked why it wasn't made the same way as the day before, and he said ""there are many ways to make it"". I tasted it, it was not good. He charged us $30 for two drinks. Yup - 30 friggin dollars for two crappy drinks and over 15 minutes of being ignored. I had much better drinks for half that price at other places.

At one point, a guy that looked like a manger walked by and asked ""everything ok?"" - I said no, as he just kept his pace and walked past, not even stopping to talk with me. 

We finished our drinks rather quickly, and saw a gentleman come sit at the table in front of us. He was there no longer than two minutes when the server showed up and served him immediately. Don't understand why she was too busy to serve us and not too busy for him. I guess they are very selective on who they choose to serve.

This was was a very disappointing and upsetting experience just for a simple drink - rude bartender, server that ignored us, extremely expensive and crappy drink. We won't be back here after learning this expensive lesson - Alibi lounge just plain sucks in service, price and quality. Move on to the Cosmo instead.",0,1,0

We got a king size bed room with a large window that we can easily view the city; bed was very comfy as well. They do provide everything you'll need, from soap to body and hair wash (although I always just bring my own). I also like how I can use the control by the bathroom to open and close the window sheet, as well as the lights in the room; that makes it very convenience. 

When we got the room the first day, we didn't bother to touch the fridge because we weren't planning on using it; the second day, we wanted to store some drinks in the fridge, and when we opened it, there was an opened box of mango and two empty spots. My husband immediately called the front desk, they said they'd charged us $50ish for two empty spots, we were shocked and told them what happened and we did not take anything from the fridge. They then removed the charges and also sent someone to refill everything to make sure the system won't accidentally detect and charge us again.

FYI, if you're staying in the corner suite..you might want to CLOSE YOUR CURTAINS at night! The very first time we stayed here, I thought that the exterior were reflective mirrors and no one could see me when I took a bath or shower. WRONG! We stayed at Cosmopolitan last night and were standing on the terrace looking across from Aria. We saw people walking around their suites naked not knowing that onlookers can see them from Cosmo. So yeah, close your curtains or turn off the lights at night unless you want to give people a free peep show. Never leaving the curtains open again when I stay here.

The housekeeper also left slippers and chocolate, which was a nice touch.  I tipped her since the day housekeeper failed to do the job.

The room is cozy and modern. You have a tablet device that controls everything from the room temp to tv and alarms.

They do have small switches all around the room where you can manually turn things off, so no big deal. Great view of the strip, and the casino downstairs is fun but be sure to bring plenty of cash since the cheapest table I found was $25 to start. 

All in all it's a really nice hotel. It's right next to Cosmo and across the street from Planet Hollywood so the location is pretty convenient.

No, you don't have a light beam a la Luxor to protect you from extraterrestrial attacks but that's how bold you are. And now, I can tell everybody that I've been inside you.

Ew, guys...such perverted minds. Aria has been my must-try LV spot for the past couple of years; unfortunately, I haven't had the chance till a couple of weeks ago due to comps and too-good-to-pass-up offers at other mid-tier places. In retrospect, that's not such a bad problem to have #humblebrag #notreally #hashtagsinyelpreviews #lol

I'm really racking my brain trying to find a flaw in our stay but I simply can't. True, it's a bit more expensive but really, there's no better way to do a Vegas trip than the right way which unfortunately means you gotta pay to play, literally. I'd like to note that's how you properly use 'literally.' Location matters in Vegas, especially if you're carless and don't wanna taxi all over the place. Aria is smack dab in the middle of it all. Trams to Monte Carlo, VDara, Bellagio with easy access to the Palace and Mirage; PH is right across the street. All the good shopping centers (Forum, Miracle Mile, Crystals) are within spitting distance (but don't do that because spitting is gross). It's pretty much prime real estate for the Vegas vet.

I can see why design and layout might not appeal to everyone -- I love contemporary crap so Aria suits me just fine. Decor is sharp and modern without trying too hard or intruding on the experience, everything is clean and well-kept. The floor layout is incredibly well-thought out: all the eateries are on the back wall next to Elements (gift shop), pool and Starbucks are upstairs.

We love the pool and getting a cabana here is a must. Our party did it two days straight and I don't know if I can do without one if making the pool is a whole day affair. Cabanas are extremely well furnished (misters? high-five!) and stocked with treats, plus you get your own private server that checks in on you from time to time to bring you food or drinks off the menu. Not to mention the privacy -- easily the best part knowing you have your own lounging space all to yourselves and won't pass out next to a group of lovely ladies in a drunken stupor, only to wake up next to a hairy old dude in a Speedo smoking a crappy, nasty cigar. The pools themselves are clean from what I saw and temp is just right.

Rooms are 4-5 star quality and super plush and lush. Entire room controlled on a remote, badass bathrooms (one of the sweetest showers EVER) and the beds...my god, the beds. I'm seriously gonna get one when my current one kicks the bucket *note to self: set bed on fire after dinner* Extremely clean, all items were in excellent condition and working order -- zero complaints. By the way, stop housekeeping on your way out so you can stock up on some of those ridiculously divine chocolate packets. Staff is great: bellhops were perfect and efficient, concierge was helpful, pool staff is accommodating -- they even have guys standing around the hotel to help direct you to your destination or if you have a question.

This is by far one of my fav casinos -- offer the best Strip odds for a big hotel in blackjack and craps, circulation system is from another world because you can't smell any smoke (you can however, easily smell the pleasant signature vanilla scent), dealers\/boxmen\/stickmen are for the most part fun to play with. Loads of craps tables and usually have $10 min so I'm always there. I do hate the stupid electronic craps machine...god, how I hate that girl's voice. EVILLLL.

It started off with getting picked up at the airport by limo and we were on our way. The driver took us to the hotel from the I-15 and got off at a private driveway specifically for the Aria Sky Suites. So you get in through the private entrance and then you walk through a long hallway to reach the private lobby. The private lobby is stocked with all sorts of fun goodies from fruit, to pastries, to cheese, and other delectable assortments. The bottom refrigerators are stocked with Fiji bottled water, small GLASS bottles of Coke (you don't see those around anymore), ginger ale, Perrier, and other beverages. How does it get better? Well, let's talk about our room.

The room we stayed in was massive! We don't know how it happened but our friend who checked in for us -- well, it was under his name -- somehow got an upgrade. Magically. I say magically because we stayed here around the end of January and the hotel had only been open for about two to three weeks prior. How is it possible that he qualified for an upgrade without us even stepping foot inside the hotel and gambling one red cent? How? Magic, that's how. So yes, the lady at the front desk upgraded our two bedroom Aria Sky Suite to a two bedroom Aria Penthouse. Yeah, I said it. A fucking two bedroom penthouse! The penthouse was HELLA huge! It had a living room with a 52"" LCD tv, dining room, mini kitchen, a powder room, and two huge bedrooms both with 42""LCD tv's complete with the most stunning view ever! 

The only complaint that we did have was that the bathtub in one of the bathrooms somehow kept turning itself on and off. The bathtub doesn't use a knob to turn on the faucet. It has a sensor so water is only supposed to come out when you wave your hand in front of it. Oddly enough, the water kept coming out during various points through our stay. We called the front desk to have maintenance come and check on it but it didn't really help as the problem was never really fixed. But we didn't care because we were having such a good time in our penthouse! 

 I have recurring dreams of our stay at the Aria Sky Suites and am definitely looking forward to going back there once CityCenter has everything up and running. It's all still a work in progress and some places are open and some are not but it will definitely be something to behold once everything finally comes together.

That information would have been nice before I booked the room. 

The pool area was ok. It was pretty relaxing but also a little boring. The casino was just OK. It didn't seem that big. The sports betting area seemed small too.

Check-in: I noticed the addition of  velvet ropes in the lobby check-in area. There was never a need for these before. I never stood in line to check-in in the past; just walked up to an available desk. The wait wasn't long the day I checked in (maybe 7 minutes) but it was unusual for what I was accustomed to. The lady who checked me in was unfriendly, spoke barely loud enough for me to hear her, didn't smile, didn't seem to enjoy her job, and her attire was about as ""unfitting"" as could be for working the desk. She wasn't rude, but it was hardly a pleasant, welcoming experience. 

Room: Generally speaking, Aria rooms are the upper echelon of elegance, comfort, and design. I've never seen this particular side of the hotel. We were given a room on the 3rd floor (the first floor with guest rooms) which sits immediately over the air conditioning system and the roof of something.  Interesting.  My sister noticed a large ball of tangled up red hair on her bedspread. And the edges of both our sheets were ripped. Also, the tissue dispenser in the restroom was empty...not empty, as in the box had run out, but empty as in, the box had run out, someone threw it away and no one replaced it with a new box. The bathrobe had green (toothpaste colored) stains on the sleeve and brown stains across the front.  I'm also pretty sure our mini bar was not turned on at all. Other than that, yes, the Aria rooms are the upper echelon of elegance, comfort, and design. The room greets me by name (via the TV) and seems to warmly welcome me where the humans didn't. 

Concierge: Always helpful. Always smiling. Does exactly as they should be...helping make the guest experience easier, better, and milk a client for more money into the MGM system while doing so.  One day I saw a looooong line there so I opted not to pick up my Blue Man Group tix that day. The next day when I passed by, there was no line so I was in and out in a jiffy. Also very helpful with dining res over the phone. 

Valet: The valet driveway is a clusterfck. I swear there are two, maybe three lanes that say Valet. Maybe it's because I'm a short Asian, but the tall white people ALWAYS get serviced before me. I think its ridiculous to have to sit in the driveway for more than 5 minutes to wait for someone to acknowledge me and give me my ticket, but its a regular occurrence here...and that's just the drop off side of things. The pick up end is just as bad.  To pick up your car, you have to walk a few feet shy of the self park garage to a window to hand your ticket over. And then wait. Another 5 to 15 minutes. The amount of walking and waiting time just doesn't justify using the valet service AT ALL here especially since all but one valet attendant that I encountered had the personality of a pencil. 

Bell Desk: The highlight of my trip. I called the bell desk at 6:39 the morning of my departure and asked how long it would be for a pick up. Denise said ""7 to 10 minutes."" I was in a bit of a rush but had a couple of heavy suitcases and several carry ons so I could use the help.  I wanted to be out of the hotel BY 7, no later, so her 7 to 10 minutes should be fine.  I asked her if Valet could also pull my car up at the same time and gave her the ticket number.  Fast forward 20 minutes later: stressed out, I call again.  Isabel answers and I ask if the assistance I requested had left yet.  ""Yes, he is on his way, it will be 7 to 10 minutes."" Ahem. Excusé moi? ""I was told ""seven to ten minutes"" 20 minutes ago."" 
""Well, I just got here, so I don't know what to tell you but he is on his way and it will be 7 to 10 minutes. You can leave if you want but if you leave, he won't be able to get your bags."" 
""If I leave, you're right, he won't be able to get my bags because I'm taking them myself!""
...and then I left. Screw waiting for the bell man.  I waited enough and she seriously just made my blood boil with her shit attitude.  I'm over it, Aria. 

Your snobby employees can deal with drunken frat kids and spoiled rich kids.

There is so much to look at, just walking around on the first floor which is the size of a small shopping mall (it was more than a quarter mile walk from my hotel room to the convention center, according to my fitbit). 

I thought the room was very cozy and nice-- I loved the walk-in shower\/tub. Housekeeping kept me well-supplied with little shampoos\/lotions. Wifi is free for the basic level, or you can pay $49 (!!!) to double the speed for 48 hours.
I wasn't much a fan of the touch-screen remote to control all of the lights, TV, curtains, etc. because the touch pad was sensitive and would sometimes skip past the channel I was trying to get to, and the lighting setup was confusing. Go to turn off some lights and it ends up turning off EVERYTHING and shutting the curtains. 

The pool is decent, but definitely more adult-oriented (no slides or fun stuff for kids). 
The gym was great -- they provide towels and free water bottles. It's a large gym so there are plenty of machines available. 

The convention center was gorgeous and, I'm not sure if this is a reflection on the hotel or the convention I attended, but they provided refreshments and snacks at every break (so every hour) and the breakfasts and lunches were the same food you would get in The Buffet (AKA super yummy without having to fork out $$$).",8,2,2

The hotel had a modern classy atmosphere.   The rooms are large and spacious with advance technology.   Besides watching TV on the TV, you could control all your lighting in the room, open\/close curtains, and order room service with your TV.    We stayed in the deluxe room with a king bed in the Sky Suites.   I liked the bathroom layout and enjoyed the nice size tub.   Our view was fantastic and I loved how much natural lighting the room had.   At night, with one touch of a button the room was pitch black.   

We were connected to my future mother in law's suite and that was amazing!  The connecting doors led us into the spacious living room and dining area.   Her bathroom had a tub in the center with fabulous panoramic view of the strip.   

Food: I enjoyed the Patisserie and the Thai restaurant Lemongrass.   The breakfast buffet was not good.  We walked through the buffet Friday night and was not that excited about it, so we ate some where else.

Other:  The spa was nice and relaxing.

It is obvious they started out with quality beds, but never turned them, as some spots are still comfortable, while other parts are higher or lower.  The casino was very smokey for a newer building and my son put his sweatshirt over his face every time we walked into or out of our room and still felt sick.  The final straw for us was the extremely loud and obnoxious alarm that went off not once but twice in the middle of the night so we could not sleep.  To pay this much money to get lousy sleep was not worth it!  

I contacted guest services and got an auto reply they were not open until 8:00 am.  At 9:00 I tried again. Still no reason why we had this horrible loud start to our day, no mention of the cause, and obviously no attempt at any kind of compensation for ruining our early morning attempt to sleep.  

When I went to the desk to check out I was told guest services was closed for the holiday but would contact me on Tuesday.  I filled out the form, but no one bothered to contact me.

At first it was very nice...automated controls in the room are a nice idea but , not unlike automobiles, the room-automation technology was old when it was launched and now it is just a sad retro feel for what was once 'cutting edge'.

A big complaint for me (from the beginning really) ...the beds are ""domed""...that is, the bed is crowned in the middle...so no matter how you lay you are 'curved'.  bizarre.
Not sure why they do this (water run off...drainage?  it is LV after all), but it is hard to sleep.  Also..pillows are mushy..but two are too much...for a princess like myself these are major issues.
...otherwise I am comfortable with the hotel...

Re: gambling...$25 table minimums were the norm and even when we had a full table's worth of players they refused to open a $15 table for us...they lost hours of play that night with that attitude.

Overall this hotel peaked some time ago from an 'eager to please' perspective...now they are past prime and slowly slipping  (were they acquired in the last few years?  that is usually the death knell for a once decent hotel).

They were offering an online deal that helped us make our decision when we were planning our vacation.  Aria is convenient to the airport and easy to get in and out of the property.  The location of the hotel is convenient to a lot of other casinos so it was easy enough to go wandering on foot.
We didn't have to wait forever to check in and they let us into our room at 10:00 a.m., which saved the hassle of having to check our bags with the bell desk and then occupy ourselves until check-in time.  
The resort is new and beautiful with modern luxurious decor.  
 The room was modern with drapes and lights automated.  Also, we had a great view of the strip, even though it wasn't advertised to have one.  The bathroom set up was great with the toilet separated from the vanity area and the tub\/shower also separate from the vanity.  There is NO in room coffee maker, which forced us to schlep down every morning for coffee to the tune of 15-20 dollars a day.
The workout room has plenty of equipment and is included in the resort fee.  Wifi is also included in the resort fee which makes the fee not so outrageous.  
We went to the Viva Elvis show and loved it.  It was a tribute to his life with a good mix of Cirque, dancing and awesome video footage throughout his life.  If you can't get your partner to Mystere or Zumanity because it's too strange, Elvis is a good compromise.
The downside to the Aria is the overpriced everything in the entire resort - and I am comparing this to other Vegas hotels, not my hometown.  The room rate is reasonable for the caliber of hotel it is, but they make up for it on the consumables.  Expect to pay 20$ for a burger and 6$ for a bottle of water.  The slots are tight and minimums are high.  Go gamble elsewhere.  Also, the Aria is the only gaming hotel in CityCenter, so the casino gets really crowded.

As a result we were ""stuck"" for a couple of (fabulous) days in Chicago, and got in to Las Vegas late in the afternoon on a Thursday. We had to leave Saturday morning. What was supposed to be 4 full days and nights turned into 1 1\/2 days and 2 nights...but we made the best of it.

Our room was gorgeous. We were on the 19th floor and looked out onto the traffic circle with Vdara and The Cosmopolitan. The furnishings were contemporary and plush. I slept so well on that big bed! The bathroom was beautifully designed. I really liked how the key cards worked - you just hold it up against a circular reader above the door handle to unlock the door. No more sliding the key card into a slot and waiting for a green light.

In fact, everything about Aria was gorgeous, well designed and tastefully decorated. 

We enjoyed the café and the buffet (those are reviewed separately), and had a very nice time at the Lift Bar on the casino floor, sampling cocktails with silly names (a ""Monkey Gland"") and watching people go by.

We really enjoyed playing the slots. Lady Luck smiled down on us, but then Mr. Greed showed up and made us pour those winning into another machine. Oh well. Still, we had a good time.

I'm shocked by some of the other reviews that complain about the service. I have no doubt that they had issues, but we didn't. Everyone we encountered was helpful and pleasant and there weren't any screw-ups like some others have had.

He took the time to walk us inside and show us around and to the check in desk. 
Once at check in, ashley checked us in and she was very personable. She chatted with us about where we were from and she was very nice and smiley. She explained everything and then walked us to the elevator. 
After we went down stairs we sat at a bar and played a few games right there at the bar. Everything is super clean and pristine. There was a comment saying the casino was not air filtered great and it smelled like smoke. That is not true. I HATE the smell of cigarettes and unless I saw someone smoking, I really didn't think much about them because it really doesn't smell at all. 
Before every elevator up to the rooms there are security people making sure that whomever goes up, belongs. That made me feel secure in knowing there weren't random people trying to go up. 
Our room is beautiful, specious, clean and comfortable. The cleaning service came twice a day, and both tv's worked. 
I saw a few comments on the hotel not providing basic amenities, but it does. Maybe they just didn't look hard enough? On the dresser, there is a paper explaining that if certain items are forgotten, they will provide it free of charge. I really thought that since we were in Vegas and people party late, that I would hear a lot of noise while in my room. Nothing. Silence. Amazing. 
Javier's and the buffet are amazing, I highly recommend  them. 
One of the days we rented a cabana by the pool. We are staying in the sky suits, which means there is a pool you can only enter if staying in there. The cabana was big enough to comfortably hold mine and my husbands 6 friends (8 of us all together), it was clean and comfortable. Zackary was our waiter and he was pretty damn amazing. He was prompt, kind, knowledgeable and didn't bat an eyelash at any of our shenanigans. They also had people from the spa walking around giving poolside messages! It was amazing that I never had to leave the pool to get a spa treatment. 
I literally had no reason to leave the hotel. No joke. 
On our last night we had a nice dinner at Jean Georges and it was seriously amazing. I ate entirely too much food because I had no self control. 
Check out was a breeze and our ride to the airport was patiently waiting for us. The driver was a women, and I didn't catch her name, but she got us to the airport and was friendly.

The service was fantastic, the rooms were clean and the design was upscale. It is a perfect distance from the strip, with easy access to a free tram to Bellagio although I don't believe it saved you any steps if you wanted to straight to the Strip.

Our arrival was met by the bellman, who was happy to tell us what where we needed to go, what we needed and how to set up for check out and shuttle home. The front desk was helpful and organized. Housekeeping did a fantastic job. The front desk was helpful and any phone calls to the front desk were greeted with a ""hello Ms. W. how can we assist you?"" Greeting with our names and knowing immediately what room was calling, was a nice touch.

The concierge did a great job helping us set up a guided tour of Hoover Dam. They recommend a wonderful tour company. Thumbs up. 

Our room was fantastic. 24th floor, with a decent view of the strip. I loved the set up of the bathroom and particularly the shower bath area. Nicely tiled with a large soaker tub which was all one contained area. Everything was push button, even the curtains. When it was time for bed, one push of the ""goodnight"" button and it was lights out and curtains drawn. I also have to mention how impressed I was at the soundproofing. We didn't hear a peep from the hallway or adjoining rooms.

My only gripe was the lack of electrical outlets. I would have liked a plug in near the bed to charge my phone and have it near me for easy access when I set my alarm. However, that is extremely minor. 

Room charges were easy and effortless.the 24 hour room service was a godsend. When all the food places were closed for the night, it's 2 am and you are craving the munches after and evening of drunken wandering, it was perfect to be able to order a pizza. And for room service, the prices were more reasonable than I expected. It was still expensive, but nothing to give me coronary.

The in room bar is run on sensors, so if you lift it off, you bought it. Although the price of snacks was expensive, this Canadian thought the price of a bottle of beer wasn't too bad at $6 because in context to Canadian liquor purchases in any old bar, you are looking at approximately that ballpark. 

The buffet was reasonably priced, and had a decent variety of food. If you hit the right time, you pay $16.95 for breakfast and manage to grab the lunch dishes for that price.

Driving up to the front of the Aria is pretty impressive.. kinda reminded me of watching those movies which showed old Las Vegas and its casinos.  The rooms were nice..  all computerized.  But one of the annoying things was there were no outlets next to the beds so you could plug in your phone.  Also, a little strange to me was the tub being in the same area as the shower.. but I guess after you take a bath you could climb out and get your shower before ever leaving the ""wet"" area.  The bed was comfortable for being a fairly firm bed and the pillows were divine for a back and side sleeper like me.

You won't see any garish prints or bright colors here, beyond the slot machine lights. 

Hubs and I scored a really good room rate deal here for Memorial Day weekend. Be aware, however, that when you check in they put a hold on your credit card for an *additional* $130\/$140 per day. This is (I assume) to compensate for incidentals, room service, restaurant bills etc. It's almost entirely too easy to rack up an insane bill with all of the family hotels - it's very cruise like where you can sign your bill to your room. This goes for all of the hotels in the MGM family in Vegas. 

It took me a day or two to become acclimated to the hotel - where to exit, places to visit, etc. Overall, staff was quite friendly and efficient - very helpful when you have no idea where the hell you're going.

For a tech conference, this was the perfect room, it was totally geeked out, with touch screen panel that controlled everything. Even the TV had an entire side panel for any kind of video input you wanted to hook up. Even your IPOD could be hooked up to go over the in room speaker system.
I was warned about the fridgerator. It was all weight sensitive. So if you took something out, it kept track of it. It was crazy!

But as far as the room itself, I was quite satisfied: the bed was soft, the basic room was pretty spacious, I loved the wall-to-wall double curtains with electronic control, and the bathtub\/shower combination was seriously off the charts awesome (seriously, the bathtub was probably the best bathtub I've ever used - it was enormous, and I loved how it melded in with the shower to give you tons of space to stretch out without worrying about getting water all over). 

The hotel as a whole, though, given the choice (and assuming similar price), I'd prefer staying at Cosmopolitan. They felt like they were going for a similar hip-but-classy feel, but Cosmopolitan pulls that *off* way better - more people at checkin so there was no line, less annoying music in the public areas, and of course, way the heck better bars (both in terms of feeling a lot more laid-back and classier, and especially, in terms of cocktail quality\/creativity). Cosmopolitan is also right on the strip, whereas ARIA makes you walk through a bunch of overpriced shops at Crystal to get to\/from the strip. 

So, I totally enjoyed staying here for almost-free, but awesome bathroom or no awesome bathroom, I wouldn't pay $$$ to stay here. I'd totally continue staying here for MyVegas points as long as they'll let me, though (but only if MyVegas doesn't also have Vdara availability when I want to go, as Vdara is totally nicer, in every respect other than the bathtub. Vdara's bath setup is great too, don't get me wrong, and so is Cosmopolitan's, ARIA just does happen to win on that one metric.)",2,0,0

I've stayed at a handful of different resorts on the Strip and the only place I'll stay from now on is The Aria. The rooms we're real nice and simple. The bed was extremely comfortable and lets not forget the mechanical curtains. The bathroom has a walk in shower and a large bathtub. 

One thing I did notice that reminded me of a Ritz-Carlton was how there was always a cleaning crew on the floor.

First, when I made the reservation for two connecting rooms with city views I was assured this would not be a problem.  When we arrived at 4 pm, the time I was given to check-in, we were told that one room was ready but we would need to wait possibly 4 hours for the other room to be ready.  As we had reservations for dinner at 6 pm and everyone wished to take a shower after traveling all day, the possible 4 hour wait was not feasible.  The result was not having two connecting rooms.  Rather, we ended up in rooms six floors apart and with different elevators servicing the respective floors.  When we got to the rooms, the view was nice for me but not as good for my best friend.  Her ""city view"" was staring at the Monte Carlo sign.  Moreover, the rooms are more expensive and not as nice as at the Venetian.  
Second, when it comes time for you to printout your boarding pass, you must have the concierge do it for you.  Be prepared to wait must an absurdly long time.  They had only two people servicing the desk.  I was waiting at least 30 minutes and there were several other people behind me.  
Finally, the best was when I attempted to check-out.  The check-out on the television did not work.  I called the concierge desk and had to wait a few minutes before I was transferred to ""Peter"" at the front desk.  Unfortunately, ""Peter"" never spoke and it appears the concierge inadvertently disconnected me.  When I called both the concierge and the front desk no own answered.  After 40 minutes of this frustration, I gave up and walked out of the room.  A utility man for the Aria, Franz, saw that I was visibly upset and asked me what was wrong.  I told him the difficulty I was having checking out.  He gave me the best service of anyone at Aria by getting on the hallway phone, trying to reach the front desk.  They were not much better with him and he had to get them by calling housekeeping.  Eventually, Franz got me a live body at the front desk who assured me that I could leave and they would email me my bill.  Low and behold, they emailed me two separate bills for two separate rooms, despite the lengthy time we spent at check-in making certain my best friend and I were paying separately.  Did I mention there are also charges for items in the refrigerator?  We did not touch, let alone consume, one item from the refrigerator.  I will never, ever go back despite nice Franz.  I will not bore you with the hell I am going through trying to straighten out the bill(s).",1,0,0

Not sure what the smell is, it's sweet and isn't an overpowering flower smell. Everywhere you walk, even in the hallways of the rooms the hotel smells really clean!

Aria is definitely very modern. I like it because every part of the hotel has such high ceilings, it's very open and airy.

I like their setup of the casino. There is no need to weave around from section to section. It's straight forward, you have your tables in the center lanes and slot machines all around. I especially like their ventilation in the casino, you never really smell too much smoke. The air conditioner is on full blast, so if you are usually one to get cold bring a light sweater, or get drunk so you won't notice the cool breeze!

The rooms are spacious and very clean. I loved the setup of the shower\/bathtub, all showers should really be setup this way. We had a great view of the strip from our room. The bed is big and comfy. It was cool how everything in the room was controlled by a remote. Watch out for the one button that turns everything off.... it even closes all of your curtains. The room gets pretty damn dark! Ha! 

All hotels in Vegas have long ass hallways! It's cool that Aria figured out to curve them a little bit so you don't feel like you are walking a mile to your room. I suggest asking for a room near the elevator.

The only thing that I can complain about is their valet in the main entrance. It's pretty hectic trying to navigate across 3 lanes of taxi cabs and through traffic. It's dangerous because they do not have any pathways marked for pedestrians in this valet area. 

I would definitely stay here again.",2,0,0

We travel extensively (and have spent many nights in 5 star hotels) and found this experience to be most excellent. The check-in process was efficient. Era was attentive and made sure that she assisted in making this stay memorable by offering a complimentary upgrade and other tips - she was just wonderful! Our suite was quite well appointed and modern. We were on the 50th floor and had a fantastic view of the strip and airport. One of the best aspects of this hotel was housekeeping - this is something that I don't often comment about, but the housekeeping staff was so friendly and attentive. The room was serviced each morning and night and it was quite apparent that careful attention was paid to ensure that the room was in pristine condition. The staff would even ensure that my iPhone charger was neatly placed near the bed. They were always friendly and engaged with the hotel guests. 

We have visited the spa in the past and highly recommend a Spa Suite. We dined at Aria Cafe and had a very average experience. The dinner menu was limited and the service was a bit slow, but the food was good. We took advantage of the lounge and refreshments that are offered to the Sky Suite guests on a few occasions and enjoyed this. We had a car while in town and parked in the self park garage. We were always able to find a parking space and the walk into hotel wasn't excessive. WiFi was included and was fast enough that I could work efficiently.

Overall, our stay was most excellent. We have stayed at several of the 5 star hotels on the strip and plan to return to the Aria for subsequent visits to Las Vegas because the accommodations, service, amenities and location simply can't compare with other hotel options on the strip.",1,0,0

I wanted to self park & the valets were very rude, I wanted to drop my luggage off with a bellhop, then park and go check in. But the valet said if you self park you can't use the bellhop service. What!? So I just pulled up in front anyway, parked, flagged down a bellhop and he was happy to take my luggage for me. Valets\/parking employees said to move my car or they'd charge $40, whatever, I was done anyway so went down to self parking. Had to walk what seemed close to a mile from there to the lobby. It's a good thing I didn't have to carry all my luggage!

The first room I got had not been cleaned, so ended up in a nice room with a view. Negatives:

1.Dirty Windows
2.Extremely soft mattresses-some may like this, but I'm very sore after 1 night.
3.No coffee maker in room
4. You can't open the mini fridge without a code, which we were not told, and don't have the code to.
4.If you pick up any food\/drink items in the room including the bottled water, you have 30 seconds to put it back where it was, otherwise you are automatically charged for it.
5. The lobby\/casino area reeks of a strong vanilla mixed with cigarette smoke. I was literally choking over the vanilla-yuck!
6.Wifi is free but doesn't always work
7.Parking is very far from check in
8. Long check in lines
9. Our room was hot. I set the AC at 61 degrees in an attempt to cool it down, it never got below 71 degrees. 
10. Room is very dark

Positives:

1. Nice size room
2. Great view from the rooms with a view

I think I could have had a seizure in the middle of the foyer and no one would have noticed. It's a shame, because they place had potential... but sadly you cannot polish a turd. 

The general smell of the lobby is nice. It doesn't smell like an ash tray. But the concierge desk closes at 9pm on weekends.. in Vegas. REALLY? 

There was no line for check in and the girl was fast. But she was a bitch. Really. I had called to request a city view and the person had never made that reservation note... so when I checked in the girl was like, ""You've been upgraded to a city view..""

The room itself was pretty.. and the automation is swell.. But seriously if you press the wrong button, you're screwed. Also, I imagine that the bathroom was designed to torture their house cleaning staff as the tub is behind the shower with no separation. Therefore, even if you don't take a bath, the huge tub is getting your shower spray all over it. The beds were nice enough, comfortable.. but it was not the Four Seasons.

Also, reservations for things were a headache... Everything was a headache. The spa was unaccommodating...  when they finally answered the phone, which had to be routed through the front desk.

I was excited when my company switched our conference from The Wynn to Aria as I thought I could play my Hell's Bells slot. However, it was nowhere to be found. I think they realized people won too easily on that machine and decided to ban the hell's bells to hell. Dammit!!!!!!

I still love Aria though even without the jingling of the hell's bells. It is truly one of the nicest resorts and casinos in Vegas. First off, it's new and the outside façade with the waterfall makes it so cool in the Vegas heat. The whole skyline of Aria at night seems to create an illusion that the place is massive.

It's no illusion. It is massive. Our conference has gotten so big that there are only a handful of places that is big enough to host it now. We have had it two years in a row here and we're going back next year! Yes!

For one, I like that we're coming back as I knew my way around there now. To take a wrong turn and get lost inside a Vegas resort only means that you have to walk more and develop extra blisters on your feet.

Room wise, it's pretty nice. As you came in, the blind would open revealing the Vegas strip and the TV would turn on with a welcome message. The bed and furnitures are modern and comfy. The bed at first felt too soft for me. However, I had the best sleep there! I had six nights of solid sleep because of the bed and that darkening blind. I could sleep for days! 

The bathroom is also luxurious completed with marble floor. I loved showering there and the toiletries were pretty good with citrus smell. The service is pretty cool and consistent daily. They take the time to rearrange your mess and put a liner beneath every mess. They also roll your cables nice and neat. When I called for room service, the person on the other line sounded so perfect! Wow, they really got everything right. The operator for room service made you feel so important and awesome.

The food offerings inside the hotel are also fantastic. From Masa, Javier, Lemon Grass, Blossoms, Michael Mina's Bardot, Julian Serrano Tapas, the buffet, and Jean Georges Steakhouse, you won't go hungry. Broke maybe...but not hungry. The bars are also adequate. Yes, the prices at Lift Bar and Alibi are ridiculous year after year but it is close to your room.

It's also close to Crystal, the shopping mall that has the express tram to Bellagio and Monte Carlo. There are nearby CVS and Walgreens to grab any essentials and several Starbucks if you didn't want to spend big bucks for coffee and pastries at Jean Philippe. 

The gym, spa, and pool... I love the gym! It's huge with tons of equipment. It also has towel service and bottled water provided for your convenience. The pools are huge and always packed. I refrained from the pool during my stay as work people swarmed this place. The spa is beautiful and very very pricy. I got a pedicure for $100 plus $20 tip. Ugh, no thanks.

However, all in all, Aria is awesome. It's new, modern, slick, and gorgeous. It's spendy though!! However, I raked in my Mlife points and Hyatt points from staying here. Maybe someday I get to pearl status so I don't have to stand in line for buffet",17,9,9

They took us through a private gate and into the back of the hotel, where we arrived at our private Sky Suites check-in area, with a VIP lounge.  The lounge offered complimentary drinks, including wine, grey goose, johnny walker black, and other liquor.  They also had chocolate covered strawberries, and cookies, and cheese and crackers, and other hors d'overes.  Once we checked in and had a few beverages, we decided to go up to the suite.

Upon entry to the room, there was supposed to be a mini show, with music, and the lights come on, and the shades open...but this didn't happen, I was upset at that...until I looked around the room...Man, this place was beautiful, and very sleek, and relaxing.

There is also a nice safe where my brother could store his gun (he's a cop), so none of the drunk friends could do anything stupid.  Every detail was something I'd never seen before.  Just beautiful.  There was a bar area with a sink and 2 fridges, one was the mini-bar with everything you could think of, and another fridge for your own use.  There was also an ice maker inside the fridge.  There was a huge LCD tv in the living room which contolled everything (tv, music, drapes, etc.)  The L shaped couch was nice, and the dining room table and chairs were nice as well.  There was an office area with all the internet hookups and computer hookups anyone would need.  
This place is great, and so is the entire hotel...I highly recommend you stay here...You can thank me later.",2,1,2

A large part of our overall satisfaction was because of our stay at the Aria.  It is a beautiful hotel (although a little dark if you ask my wife) on the strip, within proximity of many options for dining and shopping.  Many people don't seem to understand that staying on the strip is expensive so you gotta take what you can get.  The Miracle Mile is just across the street for shopping and some cheap eats.  We also walked leisurely to the Cosmopolitan, Monte Carlo, and New York. New York during our stay.  The MGM and Paris were options we weren't able to get to, but are also within walking distance.

The Aria's modern decor made it feel fresh and open. Some of the more ornately styled hotels feel stuffy to me.......maybe it's all in my head, but the high ceilings in the casino  definitely made things less smokey.

Lots of buttons in the room.  Controls for lights and drapes were so convenient-I really miss them.  The alarm clock has a big well-lit face.  Beside being easy to read, it provided just enough light to get me to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  We did have a small problem connecting to the hotel's Wi-Fi, but a call to the concierge got us connected to their tech support and we were soon in.

The room was clean and spacious.  It was thoughtfully and tastefully furnished.  the bed was soft-the wife loved it, but I like my bed a little more firm.  We both liked having the commode separated from the rest of the bathroom, but there wasn't a place to put my reading material (did I just complain about that?).  Two sinks was very nice as was having his and her closets.  A curious thing was having the shower in the same cubicle as the soaking tub.  I guess you shower and then jump in the tub, but I decided to wait while the wife soaked so as not to splash her.....chivalry is not dead!

Everybody has bad days. and some people do not belong in service industries, but I think if you are nice to people-they ought to be nice back.  I had no problems at the Aria......I wish I could say I'm lucky, but my skinny wallet says different..........",1,1,0

My husband and I had a bad experience at the lounge. When we get in the bar, the waitress saw us but didn't even bother to talk to us. She TOTALLY IGNORE us. We finally found a seat in the sofa, seat there and wait. About 20 mintues later another waitress actually acknowledge we were there and say the other waitress will assist us.  BUT NO when we look over,  the waitress that was suppose to serve us was at the other corner of the bar chatting away with her co-worker and didn't even come to ask what we like to drink. At that point, I was FED up and told my husband to leave and go somewhere else. THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN VEGAS AND I HATE IT SO MUCH.

This was the first time staying at the Aria. I usually stay at the Bellagio or the Venetian, but this time I gave Aria a chance, and boy was I glad that I did. The hotel is amazing in every single way. When I first arrived to the front doors, there was only a few taxi cabs dropping passengers off. It's not like other hotels where there is a long queue that forces your taxi to wait for an additional 5 minutes.

If there was one thing I did not like about this hotel it's the check-in line. I checked in around 11pm on a Sunday night. It took me about a half hour before I made it to the front desk. I can only imagine how bad it is during the day time when a lot of people are trying to check in at the same time. After talking to the gentleman at the front desk, he upgraded me to a City View room. I had only booked a regular room which would have faced the mountains instead of the strip. I got a room with a spectacular view on the 51st floor. (Note: the $20 tip does work here) 

Room: clean, modern, bathroom was very clean (no traces of mold\/mildew), everything in the room is powered by a tablet on the nightstand. The curtains, lights, tv, temperature is all controlled through the tablet. Takes a little bit of time to get used to, but not too difficult. 

Food: There are so many options here to choose from. Each morning I would go to the Jean Philippe pastry shop right by the guest elevators on the casino floor. You can choose from crepes, pastries, coffee, muffins, croissants, sandwiches, panini, and so many other things. There is a Starbucks on the promenade level, but the line is really long in the morning. I suggest you either eat at Jean Philippe or go to Crystals and go to their Starbucks. For fine dining, you have a ton of options. I ate at Sirio and Julian Serrano. Both were really good. Take advantage of their happy hour and pre fixe menus. 

Pool: The pool area has three main pools with lots of fold down chairs. I usually went to the pool around 11am and was able to find a spot easily each day. For the younger crowed into edm, Liquid Dayclub is open I believe at 11am each day. There are promoters scattered around the hotel handing out passes to people for free\/reduced admission into Liquid, so keep an eye out for them if you are interested. 

Fitness Center: So the gym is included in the mandatory resort fee that you have to pay. They have the basics that most people would need: treadmills, bicycles, ellipticals, weight machines, free weights, cable machines, area for stretching and abs. They give out free bottles of water too.

Tram: There is a free tram that connects to the Monte Carlo and Bellagio. You can actually access the trams in two different locations at the Aria. There is a Monte Carlo\/Aria station where you don't actually have to leave the hotel. To reach the Monte Carlo, you just walk a bit through a tunnel and you are right there. Not far at all. 
You can also catch the tram at Crystals on the 3rd floor of that mall. Personally I think the distance to get back to your guest room is the same for both stops. 

Conclusion: I felt very safe at this hotel. The staff is very nice. I actually left my designer jacket at Jean Philippe one night and didn't remember it until the next morning. I was pretty certain the jacket was long gone. After talking to security on the phone. They were able to find it in their lost and found. What were the odds. Check out was a breeze. I did it through the television instead of waiting on that ridiculously long line in the lobby.",10,0,0

The rooms are spacious and very high-tech. I set my ""alarm"" to turn on the TV to CNN and open the curtains to wake me up.

There are 3 pools and none of them are nearly as crowded as the other hotels (e.g. Encore Beach Club or Rehab at Hard Rock) although not nearly in the same league either.

We got in really early from our flight and were told that our room would be ready at 8 am. We got to the hotel around 9 and started to check in. Sadly our room wasnt ready, but they were really accommodating and told us that they would give us a text when it was ready. Another perk we got was access to the Tower Lounge which has snacks and soft drinks plus its own concierge! We came back around 11:30 but no text yet. After waiting in line, we found out that our room was ready. 

When we got there, the drapes opened up automatically! The room was clean and spacious...perfect for my birthday weekend! I was so impressed with the amazing city views of the Aria and part of the strip. The drapes made it easy to block out light during the day if you want to nap. And everything was so high tech - there was an ipad that controlled the lighting and other room controls. The room slippers are SO soft! The rooms come with extra blankets, hair dryer, iron, amenities, etc. I would love to come back next time I'm in Vegas! 

My only complaint was that the mini fridge was already stocked with drinks. If you remove them for more than 60 seconds you would get charged per drink...And if you want your own mini fridge, it would cost $25 per day...Other than that, service was pretty good and every part of the hotel was clean!",0,0,0

City Center has a huge property and there was many different artworks that can be seen throughout the hotel. The room was nicer and bigger than I thought it would be. The beds were comfortable and the heater worked fine to keep the room warm. It was nice that it had two sinks in the bathroom. I wished the toilet room didn't have see-thruish walls and doors though. I had to close the bigger door that led to the bedroom so I could have my privacy. The tub in the shower room was a good size and the faucets didn't run out of hot water. They also had the most fully stocked refrigerator I have ever seen in a hotel! But we didn't eat or drink from it.

It was such a long walk to the elevator from our room location though.
It did suck that we had a walk quite a distance to get to the nearest convenience store for food, alcohol, and water. We actually went to the mall called Miracle Mile shops across the street that had an ABC store.

Service- One of our lamps didn't work and we had an engineer help us to change the lightbulb. We also got to have a later check out time. The original check out time was 12, but we had till 1. Our room was nicely cleaned. The maids here are friendly too and say hi to you.",9,5,4

I think it would be better to label it ""hotel lobby\/casino"" instead to avoid confusion.  Check-in was fine--I used mobile check-in.  The room was comfortable and well-furnished.

I played video poker at the Lift Bar the first evening.  I am a platinum level player in M Life and play $1 or more video poker.  I asked the barman apprentice for a martini and after 2 sips I was told by his supervisor that martinis can't be comped.  they could however, give me a vodka on the rocks which probably has the same amount of alcohol.  This is ridiculously short-sighted on MGM Mirage's part.  Local places comp martinis and this behemoth can't?  They are sure raking in the dough since they have been charging for parking.

Regarding the positives, the housekeeping service was outstanding and the food at Lemongrass  was excellent.  The room service was timely and the food was superb. I had the crab Benedict one day and it was sublime.

We decided our group was going to stay in City Center this year and we chose Aria.  Because of the recent linking of Hyatt & the MGM properties, my Hyatt Platinum status gave me gold status in M-Life which resulted in a better deal than just off the website.  

We chose the lowest level 2 bed queen.  The room had an amazing view of the strip.  We were only on the 10th floor, but we really had a great view.  The window was extremely large and gave us a very picturesque view. The motorized 2 level curtains were a nice touch too.

The beds were so extremely comfortable.  Everyone in my group stated how they need one of those at home because they all slept so well.  

Had some minor complaints about the room. The remote was terrible. Felt like it was not working (checked the batteries and they were good).  The bathtub behind the shower combo was really weird (wish I had taken a picture, but if you get a room there you will know what I mean).  These were nothing big.

The toiletries provided were very nicely scented and of high quality.

The gym was awesome.  I have worked out in multiple of the higher end Vegas hotels and this by far is my favorite one so far.  Plenty of free weights, weight machines, & cardio machines.  I only wish I could have worked out more.  You might as well use it because they are forcing you to pay for it with the $25 + tax\/night charge they sneak in after they give you how much your room total is after tax.

Aria is a big casino\/hotel in Vegas. We had reserved a 3 night stay with them in an average 'Po folks"" room on the 19th floor. Checking in was fine, it didn't take more than 20 minutes.

We got to the room and it was what you'd expect - a king sized bed, carpeting, a large bathroom with a full deep tub and separate shower, a toilet in a fuzzy glass separated area, and a vanity with a pull out mirror for the women who like to stare at their pores. Seeing as how I was sharing the room with my husband, I noticed right away that there was no fan\/vent system in the bathroom. Great.

We left the room for a bit the first day, came back that evening after eating at the buffet, and were preparing to hop into bed. We performed a check of the mattress for insects, and though we were thrilled not to find any of those, we DID find numerous large stains on the mattress top. Gross!!! However, since it was late, we put the sheets back on, spread out a couple towels on top, and went to sleep. We were awaken by a noise a couple hours later.

Was it Santa on the roof with his eight tiny reindeer???? No! It was a police siren zipping by directly under our window, Okay, that's fine. Back to sleep. NO! Another siren 30 minutes later. Then another an hour later, then another 20 minutes later. Speckled in between were ambulance noises and someones loud car alarm that seemed to have been planted directly outside our room's window and took 20 minutes to get turned off. We did not sleep well that night.

The next morning, we went to speak with the front desk to request a room change. They first wanted to get us a new mattress due to the stains, but then we also brought up the noise, admitting that it was NOT the hotels fault and that they cannot control that type of thing. A maid supervisor came to the room and acted appalled at seeing the gross mattress. They decided to honor our request and switched us to another room... directly beneath the room we were already in. Actually, it was 3 floors lower than the previous room, even closer to the nighttime traffic. Ugh!! Luckily, once in the new room, they called us and said the change didn't make sense, and they asked us to cross the hallway to a third room. Fine, done. Stupendous.

Of course, once outside the newest room, our keycards wouldn't work. So we stood in the hallway like dolts (waiting for the keys to switch over) for about 10 minutes until the cleaning ladies became suspicious of us. Soon after, the floor manager appeared asking us what we were doing. We explained and he used his master key card to let us into the room.

Once inside, we were going to nap and watch some cable (we only have antennae TV at home, so cable is exciting to us). We flipped on the TV and.... nothing. PHILLIPS flashed on the screens briefly and then everything went black. We took deep breaths, said prayers, crossed fingers, and tried again. Same result. Soooo, feeling horrible about being whiny guests, we called the front desk. Again. So they sent someone up. Again.

The tech guy came in, re-plugged in a cable, and left. Great! TV worked, super! The front desk gave us a food credit for our troubles.

Shortly thereafter, my husband found a nice gift sitting outside our door. It was a dessert plate of chocolate covered macaroons and strawberries. Being a chocolate lover and feeling warm and fuzzy at this kind gesture, I poured the entire plate onto my face. Kidding. But I did begin to eat the chocolate covered strawberries. I noticed instantly that they tasted fermented, but my husband convinced me it must a be a 'liquor' they were soaked in. I ate 2 of the 3 strawberries before noticing the mold growing on the tops. I froze and dropped the plate on the bed, feeling shameful for being such a Hoover and not noticing the mold beforehand. Disgusting!

My hubby went downstairs to notify the front desk. He didn't want to complain again, but he thought it should be noted that they were giving away moldy food. They acted surprised, but who knows. 

That night, we got into room pretty late after seeing a show. It was around 11p.m., and I was hungry since we hadn't had dinner. I called room service to order a plain cheese pizza. 20 minutes past midnight, it still hadn't arrived and I was getting tired instead of hungry. I had tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but ended up calling them again to inquire about the food, since I'm sure I was charged for it immediately. They said it was on its way. 10 minutes later, it arrived and the delivery guy said he had no explanation, but that it was simply their fault, and he apologized. They did not charge for the pizza, which was gross anyway. I barely touched it, it was so sub-par.

At the buffet, while our waitress was polite, she neglected our water orders a total of 3 times, despite acknowledging that she kept forgetting it. That's all I have to say about that.",6,6,1

But walking around the hotel is a pleasant experience. They've organized the various tables\/slots\/restaurants\/high roller areas in a very nice way in a sense where you can't get lost and it doesn't seem crowded.

Our first room hit the mark for luxury in vegas - Absolutely baller - but the second had a different lay-out, was in a ""forgotton corridor of the hotel"" & there were oversights in the housekeeping (trash under under one of the chairs) & the room smelled a bit like cleaning solution when we walked in though looked a little less manicured than the previous & some of the amenities didn't work like they had in the first room we grabbed (the night prior).  

Overall it was a pretty manageable from an admin point of view (checking-in \/ Free Self-park \/ helpful bell-desk) and far less cumbersome than other casino \/ resorts we've stayed at.  The natural light in the property & the tall vaulted ceilings makes for a less ""Vegas-ey"" type of experience in a really good way.  The dining options overall were okay -  The Tapas place is extraordinary & the POOL is also one of the best amenities.  Avoid the 20 min trek from the room & 30 min line at the Starbucks on the promenade level by ordering a carafe of coffee to your room!",1,1,1

The location is perfect. Situated right in the middle of the Vegas strip action. The newer hotels are close by and you still have your classic older hotels that still make Las Vegas what it is. If you are driving here, the lot is located on the left and they charge you $10 a day. The main entrance has an area where a taxi or a limo can pick you up. As you wait in this area you come to admire how beautiful Aria is from the outside, tall, elegant, clean, and there is an inclined waterfall that makes you feel relaxed. 
If you want to make your way to the strip, there is a bridge that takes you there or you can enter the shops right in front that include all those super expensive stores (it is a nice place to just walk through just to get to the strip). 
We tried out the dinner buffet and it was really good! It will cost you about $40 a person and they have plenty of food and dessert to go around and the restaurant is very large. There are also other restaurants within the hotel if a buffet is not your cup of tea. Plenty of bars all around the casino and the pool is on the second floor. (there is also a bar in one of the pools)
Now for the room! We got a strip view room with 2 queen beds. The beds were very cozy and super comfortable, they felt like you slept on a cloud. Free Wi-Fi too!
So, I definitely recommend this hotel to any one planning their stay in Vegas, whether you are with your family, significant partner, solo or with friends, this is the hotel! The service was excellent! Very friendly staff and professional!

There's a wannabe iPad thing by the bed to control the TV, lights (both in the guestroom AND bathroom), curtains, etc.  You can set the alarm to turn on all the lights and open the curtains too. Now that's something i could get used to! :)

The rooms have this grand entrance when you walk in:  EVERYTHING turns on!  All the lights, the TV, and curtains are all on and open.  Fancy!  The technology in this room can be a bit challenging.. and sometimes the iPad next to the bed lags.  It would've been nice to have an outlet next to the bed to charge my phone.

It has a romantic feel so I'd definitely recommend this place as a couples getaway destination (my king room can fit 2 people comfortably, 4 would be pushing it!)  Personally for me?  It feels so far away from everything happening in Vegas.  It's not as busy as the other casinos, and there's really nowhere to really just grab a bite - everything is sit down.

The neat thing is there's an AV panel in the room - so you can connect your iPod\/iPhone, HDMI, USB, and audio stuff - the catch?  You have to have your own cables (or you can open the weighed box on the counter they'll probably charge you like $50! lol).  So, bring your cables from home if you want to hear your own music - this was a huge disappointment for me because I have so much music on my phone and couldn't play it. 

Oh! .. and wifi is included with the daily resort fee :)  Room service staff is great, everyone was friendly - anyone that passed me in the hall seemed to follow the 10\/5 rule.  The staff at the front counter could've lightened up though - when i checked in and out, they were way too serious... they should smile more :) :)  haha.

They have different entrances for small, big buses and delivery trucks go into the basement.  And you take escalators back to the main floor.  In the front is where the taxis and cars go.

This building and several others in the same area are very new and look amazing.  Once you walk-in it's like brand new everything, clean and you hear the slot machines spinning and making lots of noise.

Like every other hotel should have, they have someone to check to see if you have a key first before they let you go into the elevators.  Some hotels don't do that and who knows can just go up to the hotels.

The rooms look amazing, very clean and high tech.  They have Flat screen on the way comfortable beds and a huge remote that controls everything in the room.  The TV, curtains, lights, and a lot more it can control

Also we visited the pool area and wow it's big and they have different sections.  So my friends ordered the Cabanas. It's an area with chairs, drinks, and a bed you can lay down to get a sun tan.  It's nice and good private area.  The day we went you needed to spend at least $500 minimum total to get the Cabanas.  I would think the weekend would cost more.

Overall this is one of newest and best hotel I have stayed in Vegas so far.  Only thing bad is that this casino is 4 star hotels and it's expensive to stay here.  Not only that the gambling tables are high as well, as people say, ""You pay what you get"", so if you have those big bucks go to Aria Hotel & Casino.

Rooms were super clean, modern, and nicely appointed, rates were on the lower side, the casino actually smelled good, and it was conveniently located right next door to the hotel where the Jabbawockeez show used to be (and which I saw each of the times I stayed at Aria).  Can't forget, it's where I met my favorite makeup artist when she was still working at the hotel's salon!  Fast forward two years later and things have gone downhill.  

We forgot to request a higher floor when we made our reservation and they didn't bother to ask us if we preferred a higher or lower floor upon check-in.  We were given a room on the lowest floor possible with a view of nothing.  Actually we did have a view of a dead bird right outside our window on the last day of our stay :\/

Once we reached our room we weren't sure if there were occupants inside as there was a fruit tart sitting right outside the door and the service light was lit up.  However, once inside we saw that it was unoccupied.  It was disappointing to discover though that there was trash not only outside our room but inside as well.  Next to the night stand was a crumpled up piece of paper or tissue.  Also, on the bathroom counter were a couple of short hairs left behind.  

The casino used to actually smell pretty good but they've changed the ventilation system and on social media sites they boast that the casino smells better than ever with the smoke rising up and out.  In actuality the casino smells smokier than ever so I have no idea what they're talking about!  

Some good things about the hotel:
- They've got the restaurant Javier's which is really good!
- There is a tram that you can use to get to Bellagio.  (For the quickest route walk to Monte Carlo and hop on the tram there to Bellagio)
- Rooms and bathrooms are spacious (plenty of room for my giant-sized toiletries!)

It's sleek and modern and has all the high end stores people with money hope for! The staff was very inviting and welcoming the minute I stepped out of the taxi and offered to take my luggage to the front desk without any hassle. I came here on a Monday afternoon and was immediately checked in. The shape of the hotel rooms is like the shape of a DNA. The hallways are long and extremely clean with six elevator cars in the middle of the helix shaped floors. 

The room itself was great...the minute I walked in, the lights automatically turned on and the shades opened up (only the first time this worked). The room comes with double closets and plenty of dresser drawers to keep your clothes in. Iron and ironing board is available. The mini fridge is completely stocked if you're feeling lazy and don't wanna go down for drinks. The bathroom is big with a bathtub and shower head. The toilet has its own door allowing extra privacy. There's a double vanity for your convenience and enough towels arranged for your liking. The only complaint I have about the room was the TV remote.  Not sure if it was out of battery, but it didn't work well at all. 

Downstairs in the Promenade provides guests with a Starbucks coffee, small shops, the buffet, and the pool and gym area. The pool is clean and well kept and there was waitresses walking around poolside to take your food\/drink orders. The gym is a bit smaller with a view of the pool area. There are plenty of treadmills, elliptical, and weights for people to work out. 

Outside the hotel is The Crystal Shops, which provides your high end stores such as Miu Miu, Gucci, Tiffany & Co, LV, Tom Ford, etc. Along the front of the hotel are the gallery shops for your inner artist. Paintings, sculptures, and other antique collections are available for purchase. 

The hotel is very convenient to access the Vdara, The Cosmopolitan, and the Bellagio resorts. 

I highly recommend new\/old visitors to come back to this hotel. 

One thing I like to mention is the fees the hotel charges if you book through a third party company (i.e. Expedia, Travelocity, hotels.com, etc). It's about $20-30 a night plus about $4 processing fee. Don't be alarmed if you see these charges at the end of your stay when you check out!

The conference center was fine - at least they had climate control and internet access.  Not much to say there.
 
The room itself... meh.   The hallway to get there was incredibly l...o...n...g...   and had recently had the carpets clean, so the hallway smelled musty.  The room itself was lovely to look at, and had a fancy device to control the curtains, lighting, music, and I think the tv.   The annoying thing though is that it's wired, and has a short wire, so it's like the really old days of having to sit on the edge of the bed to make a land-line call.  That side of the bed was seriously indented from people sitting there and presumably playing with the gadget.  Bleh.
 
It's not a bad hotel, it's just too big and overwhelming, and yet lacking in redeeming qualities for my tastes.
 
On the upside, certain suites have fancy Japanese toilets, if that's your thing.  (We had an informal meeting in the suite of the person at our office who organized it, and thus she got the perks.)
 
Also, the mouthwash is fantastic.  I wasn't a connoisseur of mouthwash before, but this didn't sting like the medicine-y stuff, and didn't taste like it had artificial sweetener, since it had organic spearmint oil.

I prepaid over $1000 for our 4 night stay, purchased aquarium and cirque tickets (which it took them an hour to even locate) and was ready to be pampered all week. Check in took forever as they had missed my request for a non smoking room.  They said there were none available; when the concierge finally found one, she didn't apologize or anything for the wait.... I had also called ahead to let them know this trip would be our honeymoon... When we got to the room, there wasn't even a bottle of champ!  The room was fine; not any nicer than the Four Seasons or Mandalay Bay. The buttons and light switches are confusing and my engineer husband nor I couldnt really nail it down the whole week.  I immediately unpacked and realized there was no coffee maker--- REALLY?!?? We called downstairs to have one brought up and they said none of their rooms had one...(we walked to CVS to purchase one....this is obviously a ploy to get us to spend more, but really? This is supposed to be a luxurious hotel). The wireless connection is horrible and the remote control barely worked on the television--- frustrating! We ate dinner at the Mexican restaurant Javiers(the border grill inside Mandalay Bay was waaaay better) and it was pricey with little vegetarian\/health food options.

The 2nd day, I awoke and brewed some of my own coffee, called downstairs for a coffee creamer....literally one TBSP worth...$10. Really? You couldn't offer to go above and beyond for a tiny coffee creamer? Ridiculous.  I thought about buyin a bottle at cvs, and then saw the $50 restocking fee If any items on the minibar are touched.

We were gettin ready to head out for the day- so I opened my special compartment of my wallet that I was keeping all of the cash we received for our wedding in... Wouldn't you know it, $100 was missing.  My husband and I ripped our room
apart to be absolutely sure (even though I KNEW I was certain. I hid that money, so we didn't touch it until our honeymoon.). We called the front desk who sent security up to our room. He was loosely goosey and didn't seem
To give a crap about what was happening. We filled out a statement and he took pictures of my wallet (very SVU.) I've read other reviews about guests having stuff stolen, so I imagine this is common and we probably won't see that $100 again.

Housekeeping was a joke--- all they did was make our beds...
Didn't ever clean upt used coffee mugs or wipe down the bathroom mirrors. They even knocked on our door at 11pm one night. What the heck? The rooms are not sound proof either. Maids work around the clock and we could hear them
Banging around and yelling at eachother at all hours of the night.

The spa was fine. We got a Couple Massage for $500. I thought my mind would be blown- it wasn't.  The gym
Was ok... I worked out about 3 times.... There aren't enough machines but the staff was friendly, and they offered complimentary apples(at this point, anything I didn't have to pay $15-$50 for was great.)

We bought 2 ridiculously expensive lunches at the buffet. It was ok- not very fresh and the salad bar was a joke... Like a sizzler. The dressing was horrific. 

I could go on and on about our stay, like how no one ever answered when you called the front desk for service, or how they have 4 people
Helping with your luggage so you end up tipping all of them; or how the ginger  ale at the pool was $11!!!!!!!

Maybe not ""snob"", but due to work I've honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels, which is more than most people. I've had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests, and I've had lousy stays at expensive places because they don't do these things. Aria falls somewhere in between.

Actually no, Aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.

The non-hotel parts are great. The restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected, the casino is lovely, the shops are overpriced as expected, etc. If I didn't actually stay there, I probably would have given it 4 stars.

However, the room quality was lousy. First off, there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room. Really? Tape or glue would solve that until it could be properly fixed. I'm shocked that a hotel would allow that to be in the guests' sight, especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.

The room itself was ""meh"" at best. The bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke, and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago. It's a slow, laggy system with a lousy user interface, and it's completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the TV or turning the lights on or off. Unfortunately I was stuck using it to change the TV channels because the remote was dead. Speaking of dead, so was the minibar. It was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most. If you're going to use convenience to tempt me with soda, sparkling water, and various alcohols at 500% of retail, they at least need to be nice and cold.

I ordered room service exactly once and the food was absolutely lousy. I would have thought they could manage a decent bowl of ramen (there are world-class ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel, so people around here should know what it's supposed to taste like) and it was beyond disappointing.

The kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didn't cost me a dime. Corporate expense account for the lot of it. Had I been actually paying to stay here, I would have checked out within a couple hours of check-in. I can literally say it's barely worth staying here for free. It seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience, but after this initial experience I'm not going to give them the chance when I come back for pleasure instead of business.

To be fair, the Aria did stand out for me in one area, and one area alone: the staff. Everyone I interacted with, from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets, concierge, casino staff, convention area staff, etc. were all pleasant and professional. The staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one.",10,3,1

Although the building is nice and the rooms are well-appointed, there are a few drawbacks bringing down my rating.  When we checked in, the room wasn't cleaned properly.  It appeared to be clean at first glance, but then we noticed that the floor wasn't vacuumed (we actually found a piece of broken glass on the floor as well as what looked like food crumbs), there was hair in the shower drain, and the mirrors had smudges all over them.  I would expect this from a 2 or 3-star hotel, but not  from a 4 or 5-star one.  We gave the hotel the benefit of the doubt and decided to see if they would clean the room better after our first night.  When we returned to our room the following evening, it looked like they spent 5 minutes in there.  The beds were sloppily made; the floors, mirrors, and bathroom counters weren't cleaned; hair remained in the shower drain and they took the tip I left as if the felt they deserved it.  I wanted it back after seeing the disappointing work they did.

The toiletries they provided were also bad.  First, they come in hideously large, thick plastic bottles that are far from eco-friendly.  Second, the actual product they provide are some of the worst I've experienced.  Luckily I brought my own shampoo and body wash, so all I had to use was their horrible conditioner.

Alas, the reality of being in a thousand room hotel still working out its kinks sets in.

Pros:
Beautiful lobby
Friendly staff
Buffet is outstanding (seriously, AND its not in a casino basement. This is near the pool with giant floor to ceiling windows!)
Bedsheets are so incredibly soft
Bed is very comfortable
Big flat screen tv (expected)

3 pools, easy to find a chair

Cons:
THE BLACKOUT SHADES DO NOT WORK!!!
I REPEAT--
THE BLACKOUT SHADES DO NOT WORK!!
It wasn't just my room. Everyone was complaining that the gap in the curtains where the L shape comes to an end was wide open and the sunlight goes directly onto the head of the bed! Nice 7am wakeup call both days after being out most of the night.
There was a bag of pills-- yes PILLS-- in my bathroom upon arrival, left from a previous guest. Some of you may have enjoyed that extra amenity but I did not enjoy the discovery.
My room was full of crumbs and coffee \/ drink stains on the flat surfaces (bed stand, desk, area between the closets). Do much cleaning?
There was black mold in the shower. For a hotel only a few years old, that says a lot about their housekeeping standards. Ever use a scrubbrush in there? Guess not.
Smoky casino. I expected the air to be more filtered in there, being a new hotel, but it was more smoky than Caesar's or Bellagio.
The ""home"" remote control touchscreen that controlled the electronics in the room didn't work. Very frustrating.

Would I go back, probably not. I have had better stays at Four Seasons, Venetian, Pallazzo, etc. There are simply more than enough hotels to choose from that have better housekeeping and full blackout shades.",2,2,0

We booked the room using Hotwire, which makes it soooo much cheaper. We got to stay at the Aria during father's day weekend for about $100-ish per night? My bf booked it so i'm not sure the exact price, but I just know that it was significantly cheap! :)

The room is veryyyyy nice. Got a nice queen size bed and once you walk in, the curtains automatically open up and you can see your view! We didn't have the best looking view cause we were on the 8th floor, but it's no big deal lol since we didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel anyways.

The bathroom is gorgeous too! The toilet was separated with its own little room next to  the sink area. They have 2 sinks to use and they even had a shower area PLUS a hot tub!!! I'm happy that I got to use the hot tub at least one time :) It was very cozy and super comfortable. They have a fridge but it's packed with their drinks \/ snacks so you don't have any room to put your own stuff in there. If you want to ice your stuff, you can always use the hot tub and fill it up with ice lol.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel :) Everything was very upscale and they even let you check out directly from your room by using the TV or texting to a certain number. It's very easy and efficient so you don't have to waste any time in line downstairs. Also, the self-parking is far away from the front desk, so I would definitely suggest you to check out directly from the room. Makes your life so much easier! Another great thing about this hotel was the ""tablet"" that they have in the room which can control the temperature, curtains, call for room service, and change lighting. The tablet itself wasn't in the best condition and some words were cut off but it still worked! I love using it in the morning to open the curtains and get some light through the room :)

After staying in 2 other hotels over three days, this was the one I was looking forward to the most. Check in on a Saturday morning was busy, yet it all went very smoothly. They had enough lines open and clerks working, which is always a good thing. 

I was totally wowed after entering room 31-131. The curtains open, the TV turns on to some music, and the lighting comes up. 

The room had a view of the back of the CityCenter campus and Vdara. For a standard room, it's VERY roomy. I believe it's around 520 square feet of goodness. The bathroom area was equally as rich, with a BIG shower and tub (they are not combined, but located behind the same door), his and her sinks, and separate toilet area.

I love technology, so Control 4 was definitely a treat. You can literally control everything - the TV, curtains, lighting, temperature, making service requests, and even the Do Not Disturb sign - from the television as well as a small tablet located on the bedside table. Loved the Wake Up scheme, which opens the curtains and turns on the TV at whatever time you set in the morning. I also enjoyed the turndown service at night, since that big bed has a lot of comfortable pillows!!

My offer came with a comped buffet, so I went there for Sunday Brunch. I enjoyed it a lot, and would certainly go back. 

Service around the resort was top-notch. Everyone was very attentive and friendly, from the housekeepers, valet people, bartenders, Front Desk staff. CityCenter is massive and it WILL take a while to get your bearings, but once you do, it'll be easy to get on and off the Strip.

The first time I ever came to Vegas, I was comped Sky Suites at the Aria. That was a pleasant stay, having gambled through a few hundred thousand in bets (not bankroll). I got to gold status in one stay without any purchases and only a few eats ($500). They comped me a second time and I decided to come back to gamble more because of the good experience. They gave me a decent room and I felt welcomed back. I won a fair amount of money the first time and lost a bit the second. This time I'm back and they comp me a floor 3 room. 

Yeah, floor 3 isn't that bad, but what's bad is the fact that the lamp wasn't working and a trash can was toppled over with trash on the floor. I am guessing they were in a rush, because I did pay extra for an early check in. Also, my wife slept on the bed and had a few bites, not sure if it is bed bugs or not. We called the front desk and they only said they have never had a complaint of bed bugs. We decided to just leave it at that. We called back for a room change or upgrade with gold status, but they are apparently fully committed with so many floors here at the hotel. I don't feel very welcome with the mess, let alone the view of the roof\/wall. Literally I don't want to open the curtain.

WHY THEY STAY @ 3 STARS:

1. I very much dislike the over-power scent perfume they use when I first enter the lobby. I sneezed like a mad cow each & every time!

2. Bathroom Amenities - They fill up when I check in, but NEVER refill the next day, unless we request for it! I wonder, what if I check in & out each day as a new guest, they still have to refill it right? This just make them so cheap! This kind of service will never live up to a 5 diamonds Bellagio!

3. Pools - no one ever helps me here, you have to fin your own chair, unlike other hotels, they assist you with chairs, then you tip them! 3 trips already - FAIL!

4.  Work out area only opens till 8 PM & it's $30 to use the spa service.

5. Elevator guests entrance, always traffic here!

6. Room service, they dont' call me by last name?

7.  Even in my suite, full stocked of wines\/Champagne, but no Champagne\/wines glasses? Huh?

Pros-
Room is gorgeous. Spacious, modern, luxury amenities abound.
Bathroom is insane! Full size walk in closet with safe, jacuzzi with over 50 jets at different levels in the tub, sits in the center of the room, wall mounted tv for viewing while soaking, private 2 person shower with frosted glass doors, private toilet and bidet area with frosted glass doors. Toilet seats heat and light up.
Bathroom fully stocked with everything from toothbrushes, tooth paste, mouthwash, soaps, shampoos, hair products, robes, slippers, hair dryers (plural). Lighting, space, upgrades and amenities are amazing!

Bedroom- king size bed that is beyond comfortable. Floor to ceiling Windows with expansive mountain views (note that across the hall the views were of the strip- we preferred the mountains simply as a matter of preference- friends stayed in strip view room across the hall and it was also amazing). Wall mounted 55 in flat screen. One touch blind openings, iPad in the room that controls everything from blinds to tv to room service to check out. It was amazing.

Living room area- comfortable couch, chairs and tables for relaxing. Another wall mounted flat screen. Another iPad for room controls.

Dining area - nice table and chairs to sit and eat or talk or re group.

Fully stocked mini bar with normal size items which was awesome.
Additionally- fully stocked top shelf liquor area on top of counter area.
Nice sized fridge and ice maker in the room in addition to the mini bag fridge.
Second bathroom - just as nice as the one in master bedroom area.
Check in takes place in a private ""Tower Suites"" room separate and apart from regular check in.

The lady who helped us at check-in was very nice and helpful. They have these origami birds hanging from the waiting area, very cool and nice to look at.
Walking through the halls we would see house-keepers and attendants who never failed to say hello or ask how our day was going and to be honest it always seemed genuine!
Now of course, the room was very clean and organized. The sheets were soft and having sensitive skin, I was very pleased that I did not get a rash being in different types of sheets (which I normally would). 
When we first arrived, the TV was working just fine, but a couple minutes later it stopped working and we had to call services to fix it. The man who came was a well-mannered man and finished the job quickly.
There were plenty of towels in the restroom but I did notice a little chipping on the steel of the sinks which took me by surprise because it really did look very off in such a nice room.
We ate at The Buffet, DELICIOUS! Nothing tasted like it has been sitting there for hours and I'm sure it wasn't! We also tried the pizza place, it was amazing! Tasted home-made and so fresh!
We saw Zarkanna, AMAZING!
Now on the rest of our trip we spent it gambling, hitting bars, and walking on the strip.
The bar tenders were definitely not the best.
I asked for ""something fruity"".... I got something spicy! SPICY! My boyfriend couldn't even swallow a sip without coughing. We left that bar and went to another, I got a pina colada and it had HUGE chunks of ice, the bar tender had to see it when he was pouring it into my cup! The bar wasn't even busy for him not to have time to double blend it, or scoop the giant chunks out.
NOW, one night, I left my phone in the casino. I called the hotel, spoke to the sweetest lady who told me they had my phone and I would need to speak to one of the men in a red coat to pick it up. Boy did I choose the wrong guy to talk to! His name was William. William was so rude! I was drinking but I definitely knew what I was saying. He spoke to me, correction, YELLED at me like I was a dumb 7-year old! I understand that it is not fun dealing with people who lose their phones after a night of drinking at 3 in the morning. BUT IT'S LAS VEGAS!! You can't expect anything less than to deal with people who are drinking! I'm the first person to try to justify a persons bad behavior, ""maybe he was having a bad day"" I would have normally said, but when you're getting PAID to stand around and help people every couple minutes or hours, you suck it up and do your job and do it kindly! It was just such a shock after seeing all the kind and courteous people working at the hotel.
Check-out was fast and easy, you either talked to a person at the counter or a lady with an i-pad came to the line and helped you check out.

At the time housekeeping still needed to be tweaked they were missing towels and the soap was gone. I mean the little things right? But of course this is just the beginning they could change by now and very efficient. Especially since the price is in the 2s on even the cheapest nights wtf?

You know for a hotel that big the rooms are tight! For double beds it was cramped. The rooms are modern and tech savvy. First time I can open the curtains automatically.

It's far walk to the front but I like the free train to crystals and Bellagio. The walk to Monte Carlo is not bad too..",0,0,0

This hotel is the bomb.  I was originally supposed to stay here but due to some unforeseen circumstances things changed.  

I must also say that even though, I'm not a big gambler, since it was my birthday I had to play a little something. I decided to spend my bucks and chance my luck at the Aria casino and what do you know...$20 bucks in and $87 bucks later I was a winner :)  YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now the reason for the poor rating. The cleaning service was horrendous. My mom is pretty anal about cleaning and the mirrors were left dirty, we didn't get extra clean glasses we had to clean them ourselves in the sink. I was actually in the room while they were cleaning and they had to ask me to mop the floor???? What is up with that. They should automatically do that. Another reason for the poor rating is because my mom booked a package deal with Southwest Airlines 3 months prior for 2 queen sized beds because I'm a 30 year old woman and don't want to sleep with my mother because I thrash around a lot. Now granted they brought up a cot, but it wasn't until 11:30pm we got in the room at 10pm and I was tired from partying the night before at Bally's (which I absolutely love!) Anyway it's kind of fucked up that I had to sleep on a cot after paying over $300 bucks for a room. We called the front desk (after being on hold for 20 minutes, hung up on and then put on hold for another 10 minutes. We finally got through and they comped us a meal at any of their sister hotels for 75.00 + tax, but it was still not acceptable. I did talk to the front desk at 5am (the only time when there wasn't a huge long line!) and they apologized and gave me a comment card which I still have to fill out. My mother and myself also slipped  on the pool deck (at the quiet pool) 3 different times. Luckily we didn't fall and I informed the lifeguards about it because someone is going to crack their head open and sue. The lifeguards were super friendly and I absolutely loved Alex and Ryan who were very friendly and suggested tattoo shops and local dive bars for me to check out. Again very friendly and helpful staff, but I think they are understaffed. I also had to wait a long time to get my car at 8am on Monday morning (it wasn't even busy) but the valet is obviously understaffed even with the guys running around and working their butts off.  I think that's all I'm going to complain about for now. I had an amazing trip met cute guys won and lost money which is what Vegas is all about. Had wonderful food and enjoyed the beautiful art work and architecture they just need to work the kinks out with some of their under staffing issues.",0,0,0

The architecture, modern art, and decor are definitely feasts for the eyes. While site seeing and picture taking, I felt as if I were standing in the middle of some futuristic city in an anime movie. I stayed here for one night on a Monday, and the price was reasonable for the room i was in. I stayed on the 50th floor, and I swear I could see the whole state of Nevada. The room was amazing and well furbished, the bed was really just one large, overstuffed pillow, and there was a remote that controlled everything in the room, from the TV to the light in the bathroom. I also loved the brown earth tones, chrome accents, and lounge chairs near the gigantic window, but be ware sitting near a window so high up can cause vertigo. 

The pool area is large and contains multiple pools, as well as a completely hidden and sectioned area for the pool club, which is nice because sometimes you just want to sunbathe without listening to European dance music and being hit on by the drunk men in speedos. 

I highly recommend visiting the blown glass art galley and strolling the mall's designer pathways, you will see what I mean. There is a great ice cream parlor in the very front of the city center, and a sweet desert bar in the casino. I do have to say, the smell of cigarettes was at a minimum, as well as the amount of slutty Vegas girls wearing dresses 2 sizes too small.",1,3,1

As soon as we popped out of our cab, everyone greeted us so warmly! I have a soft spot in my heart for the tiniest details, but I really do believe paying a bit more and getting that extra friendly service is worth it. The minute you walk in, you will notice that Aria smells AMAZING. Literally. An old coworker of mine that stayed here said they pump that scent through EVERYTHING. It smells so heavenly and not the kind where it's heavenly until you start getting a headache and want to pass out, but just pure heaven.  

The hotel is quite chic and modern. Very classy and pretty! Everything is aesthetically pleasing. I can say the same for the rooms. Lovely rooms with soft beds and automatic everything. (As much as I loved it, it would get annoying when the touch screen control pad was not responsive) Bathroom is easy on the eyes as well. There's a large tub next to the shower (no jets) for you to relax in after a long night of partying. Their toiletries smell divine! I think they have green tea in them..?

The location isn't too shabby. We walked to Monte Carlo to see the Jabbawockeez show without a problem. You can walk across to Vdara to try out their spa as well.

The vast casino floor is elegantly decorated and interpersed with classy lounges (Bar Moderno) and even classier restaurants like Sage.  On the second floor, you've got a Jean Georges steakhouse, a Michael Mina restaurant and The Buffet. (I'd dine elsewhere if you're looking for more affordable options)

Service is so professional, especially at front desk! The staff at poolside are all efficient, I love that!

Our room is spacious enough to hold a seating area and the massive closets. The safe is secretly tucked into one of the night stand drawers.  The technology in this room is controlled by the T.V. -- curtains, temperatures, etc. The bathroom is great: his and hers sinks on a granite countertop, separate water closet, rain forest head shower and sunken tub. 

The pool area is well thought of and sizable with three separate swimming pools, plenty of comfortable lounges to hang out in all day and plush, white towels. The gorgeous palm trees just add to the more ""summer"" feel of the place.

The beautiful surroundings can't be beat and with a green hotel like this in the heart of City Center, I can't help but get butterflies whenever I go here. If I can find another sweet deal for my next summer getaway, Aria will be my first choice for staying in the center of the strip.",15,14,13

So I finally get to the room, swipe my room key, turned the handle, the door is stuck. I had to use my shoulder and push it open. I reported it, no apology, no offer for a room with a properly working door. Ok not the end of world, right ?

So later that night I return with my wife, and now we both have to lean on the door to push it open.

5 stars for the architecture for sure. The glass windows, lights, water fountain in the front, its very visually stimulating compared to its counterparts on the strip. 

Front Desk - 4 stars Thank you, you actually had your VIP windows filled this time. The other check in line was quite long and I could not speak for that line, but for the hotel invited guests, it was brief and painless.

Casino- 4 stars I thought the service greatly improved. 
 - A cocktail waitress came by much more frequently than they have in the past. 
- The dealers, as usually just depend on a case by case basis. We had some good ones. One in particular stood out, but not in a good way. He had this joke where they changed the gambling limit to 25. After my friend fell for it, (she's quite gullible) he continued with these types of jokes, which are haha funny at first, but got annoying quick. He also told my friend to stop plying after she won $100 after starting with $40, but she won so fast, that she was miserable the rest of the time. we obviously came down with a limit to win or lose, please don't tell us what to do.

Room - 4 stars
-  The all in 1 touch screen is very advanced, but it would not be responsive and not all features were working properly. 
- They need to change the music for lovers button for sure because that channel was top 40 w\/o a doubt.
- lots of pillows and really comfortable bed, best one I've slept on in Vegas

Room Bathroom - 4 stars
-So for the younger Vegas goers who go in groups I feel bathroom functionality is essential in a good hotel room. Which means, tub-shower-sink-toilet can all be used simultaneously. Girls stand in the mirror for a while, it would be nice if we could shower or something while they did that.  Aria, at least for the base room, did separate all 3, however the shower does not have the fog glass, so that just depends on how comfortable you are around your friends. also, the tub was not as wide as I would liked it and it is connected to the shower, so you can't really use both. 

Misc
-Bell desk is on the other side of the Casino away from the front desk
-crystals, the mall, looks a lot like a museum, def can have a field day with the camera there. 
-room service is really nice. They get my your stuff really quick and call you to make sure you received it.
-timing is not always great. - front desk called at 4am to check if we received our request. thank you for checking, but that telephone was so loud, it sounded like an alarm. 
-def need another set of elevators if at all possible, if you are unlucky with the room, good luck with the long walk in heels, or dragging a friend to the room. 
-Valets are super nice, and everyone is more than willing to help with directions.
-if you want something cheap and quick, I suggest walking to monte carlo food court next door.",1,0,0

Check-in was very smooth.  I got in at quarter to two o'clock and the check-in lady found my reservation and got me a City View room that was ""optional"" but she did find me one so that was awesome.  She did mention that she was putting a $130 incidentals pre-charge on my credit card  for any of the stuff inside the room like the water bottles, snacks, and stuff from the mini-bar.  I've never heard of any hotel pre-charging for this but I made extra careful not to put any of my stuff near the mini-bar items as they were removing the charge after I check out.

To summarize my pluses and minuses for the room:

Pluses: automated controls, bed, TV channel selection, view(City View room), granite floor and counters in bathroom, fancy robes in the closet, Privacy\/Service for housekeeping selected by a button and not the door hanging plastic thing

Minuses: weak shower head pressure, desk chair not comfy when sitting for long periods, and curtains didn't black out all the light from the morning sun, enough light leaked in that woke me up at sunrise.

Other pluses that I liked included the valet parking who I could call in advance to have my car ready to pick up, the proximity to the CityCenter mall, and the ample food options here(fine-dining and casual) including a bunch for dessert and coffee too.  I passed by and saw maybe over 20 flavors of gelato in their case.  The pool gets a pass for now because the day I went...there were super high winds so the pool had to close early and I also skipped the retail stores and the Cirque Elvis show.  The fitness center was very nicely equipped though.

There is a lot walking involved if you stay here, especially walking from the self parking lot to the casino itself.  Make sure to take the tram or use the walkaway into Monte Carlo for easier access to the other casinos off the Strip.  If interested, make sure to pass near the Deuce Lounge which has a bunch of painted Christopher Walken pictures hung on the wall nearby.

The room was incredible, with a comfortable bed, great views, and very quiet (the corner suites are at the end of the hall).  I loved the modern architecture, modern art, and all the natural light.  The control-4 remote system is pretty cool but a little confusing and slow.  The spa and workout facility is one of the nicest I've ever seen and was well worth the $30\/day use fee.  All of the staff, dealers, housekeepers, etc that we talked to were extremely friendly.

A couple of complaints: The black out curtains let too much light in (important in Vegas). The room was missing one tv remote and the other didn't have batteries (it took two calls to maintenance to get this corrected).  For some reason the corner suite does not have a connectivity panel like the other rooms, so there was no easy way to plug in an mp3 player.  They advertise twice daily housekeeping, but you are lucky to see them once (I would expect this to get worked out over time).

All in all, we had a great stay here and would definitely go back.  They still have a few glitches to work out, but that's to be expected in a brand new hotel.  Especially with the deals that are out there right now, I would definitely recommend staying here!",3,0,0

Next we got to our room and it was quite small not what I expected. It looked like it was originally one room that they cut in half to make two. Next issue housekeeping is the worst. Don't get me wrong they are very friendly and apologetic but they do not do their job. We spent our weekend calling them  for numerous issues. Room towels were dirty upon arrival note pads were used and written on. 3 of our lights (one in  the entrance, one in the closet and the  lamp next to the  bed were all out. We scheduled a time for them  to  come , didn't show up. CAUTION:  be very  careful  the floors are very slippery! even  the maintenance guy who finally came to  change our lights almost slipped! Now that leads  me to the worst part of my weekend upon entering my half lit room my husband dropped a bottle and I slipped and  lacerated my  left leg. I was  transported  to the nearest ER and had 30 stiches done. Yes I'm ok  now  but tell me the rest of the  weekend they did not  clean up the glass in my  room  nor the blood stains on the carpet nor change my  bloody  sheets as I  requested  about  a 1000 times, the best they  could  do  was comp us two  meals ..so  my  suggestion to  you  is if you want a true 5 star experience don't stay  here.

This hotel really made the difference on my trip to las vegas last week. It was beautiful inside and the rooms were spacious. although i should note that they DO NOT provide any water or coffee free of charge whereas many hotels in Las vegas does that. I mean we are paying a pretty considerate amount. higher than most of the hotels on the strip.

I really wanted to upgrade my room and was willing to pay for it. Since i was staying two nights i called the very morning of the next day and asked them about it and they said they do have one room free. After discussing with my family I LITERALLY called 1 minute (not even) later and they say oh we do not have a room. note that i was willing to pay and it wasn't like i was asking for an upgrade no charge. 

The check in line was really long. Thank god we did the mobile check in.

I like the ambience but they really could spend more time in being more customer friendly as they had thursdays where guests could get into the jewel nightclub and it was complimentary but they had booked it for a private event and i called them and all they said was yes it was complimentary and we could get in. but later we found out it was booked for a private event.",1,0,0

She wanted to stay in one of the new hotels that her friends were going to stay in so they can hang out more frequent over the period of our stay. Staying in a new hotel can have it's perks and can also be totally opposite. Since it is new there can be many different types of promotions that they hotel will allow you to take advantage and on the other hand can be very pricey. 

As we arrived to the hotel, I must say that it was very confusing to find the actual  driveway for this place. Since the hotel is located in the center of a plaza of hotels (and a shopping mall) coordinating (without acting reckless at least once) to get into the parking garage for the proper hotel was a little difficult. Since I am a current candidate of a temporary handicap placard I wanted to park as close as I could to minimize the walking distance. We found out that parking on level 1 did not leave you on the casino floor. I was also confused about the parking spaces as well. Why are there car length spaces in between each actual sparking space?

Upon arrival, our check in time was at 3pm. We had arrived on time and went directly to the front desk to check in. While walking from the parking lot to the front desk we have noticed the artsy architecture and admired the different types through out the inside and outside portions of the casino. The front desk did not have a specific one single line waiting for the next available representative but had many lines. This made the wait time a little more short so that was great. When it was my turn to talk to a rep, I presented my confirmation number along with the CC and ID. I was told that the only room available was going to be with one king bed. Since I had requested 2 queens over the internet that is what we wanted. I was told that I would have to come back and check in at a later time but it was not guaranteed. 30mins later I came back to talk to a different person. I almost was fed up from the wait that I was going to accept a smoking room just to see if there was an opening for a room with 2 queen beds. The rep mentioned that my previous request was put on hold and when the next available room opened I would be the first to claim it. I was a little content about that information so I didnt ask about the smoking room. The person at the front desk asked for my cell number so they can contact me when the room was ready. An hour passed by and no call. My gf started to have a headache and really wanted to lay in bed of our rooms when we arrived but it didn't happen. I went back to the front desk to find out again if the room was ready. Now I don't know if it is me or not but most of the hotels will give a coupon book to use during your stay at their hotel. We didn't get anything during our stay at Aria. Not that I am being greedy but I felt that there should have been something.

So about a little over an hour has passed by, we finally got our room...

The room: was very nice, everything was controlled by the main controller (which looked like a picture frame). It had a touch screen interface and controlled the curtains, tv, all the lighting (even in the bathroom), and powered everything off all at the same time. Our view overlooked the front drive way of the City Center and was nice during the evenings. Too bad our window had a lot of dried water marks everywhere. 

After settling in we called our friends that stayed in the hotel to come down and enjoy some champagne that was brought from room service (thanks to Leslie how surprised us with a nice gift). We chatted about our already generated bad experiences and they had to share theirs as well. Their bad experience was that they found a pubic hair in their bed sheets. As far as our room goes, it was a bit dusty but I didn't want to complain. 

The service from the staff of the hotel was not up to our standard and to be totally honest, the house keeping staff were probably was most attentive even if they were not around as frequent as needed. I personally do not care to return to this hotel to gamble, eat, or stay during my next trip to Vegas.

One last comment before I end this review. Something that makes Aria inconvenient was, since it was in a plaza style setting there was a long driveway to get to the main area. This also brought some inconvenience to accessing the strip by foot. There around some great casinos in the vicinity to explore but it was difficult to just walk out and visit. Of course there is a free tram that took you to Belagio (I think) but having the aspect of walking outside of your hotel\/casino and just walking to the next casino was somewhat out of the question.",2,0,0

BTW, if you do not want to wade through the whole review, I understand, but please read the Spa section.  I would probably give the hotel a good review just for that.  Here are the particulars:

Rooms
The rooms at Aria are nice but the electronics in them, while cool, present kind of a challenge.  Everything in the room from the TV to the lights to the curtains is controlled by a remote control on the bedside table.  At first, this looked really neat, but I soon realized that the complexity of the device made it somewhat difficult to operate.  There were several times when I accidentally hit the wrong buttons and turned off Milady's lights (once while she was in the bathroom which was actually kind of funny).  The other odd thing is that the bathtub and the shower are separate but co-located behind glass.  It's not really a problem, but it is an odd layout that makes using the tub a little claustrophobic.  Bed was good.  Halls, while unbelievably long, were clean and quiet and we had plenty of space.

Casino
We don't really gamble anymore but the casino was very nice.  A couple of things I liked about it is it did not have the overwhelming noise a lot of casinos have and the aisles were wide enough so that walking without getting jostled was not a problem.  Part of the reason for all of this is that the table limits are higher than in most places in Vegas which tends to keep the crowds down.  It is obviously up to you as to whether you view that as a positive or a negative.

Restaurants
We ate at several of the restaurants and they went from very good (Seranno's) to very bad (the buffet). We went to Seranno's for dinner our first evening, were seated promptly, had good service and thought the food was good.  After the Empress left on Sunday, I decided to try the buffet and was very disappointed.  It was very expensive, had a long line to get into, and I found most of the food to be very bland and disappointing.  There is a little café downstairs called Jean Phillipe that has really good food, but again, is very expensive.  The biggest surprise we had was how difficult it was to get breakfast.  There are only two restaurants open for breakfast with one being the buffet and there are very long lines at both.  Had we known that before we went downstairs, we probably would have stayed in our room and ordered room service.

Spa
All I can say here is wow.  We decided to do a spa day and booked one of their spa suites.  Along with the suite, we setup a hot stone massage and facial for The Empress and an exfoliating sugar scrub and Fijian massage for me.  I won't say much about the services other than to say that they were quite good and we would happily do them again.  What really blew us away was the spa suite itself which is a self contained room with hot tub, living room area, a treatment area with a couple of tables, and a large bathroom for changing with a very nice steam shower.  This place was huge and beautiful but even better was that, once we reserved the room, we were assigned a spa hostess who coordinated bringing all of our services in to us, had drinks and food brought in when we asked and generally took excellent care of us.  I also have to mention that it had one of the neatest toilets we have ever seen.  Heated seat, raises and lowers its own lid, flushes on its own, not only allows you to do your business but cleans you with warm water jets afterward and probably several other things I did not even try.  I have been told that our bathroom remodel project planned for next year just got more expensive because we are apparently buying one of these things.  C'est la vie.  Best spa experience either of us have had in a long time and highly recommended.

Overall
Overall we like Aria and will probably stay here again and we absolutely adore their spa.  It is a very nice, modern, elegant hotel with an upscale, somewhat subdued crowd.  If you like the Bellagio, I'm guessing you will also like Aria.  It is definitely not the place to come if you are budget conscious, however.",0,0,0

For example, the hallway on the 24th floor looked beat-to-hell (scuffs all over the doors and walls, dirty ripped carpet) to the point I had to look Aria up to confirm it's only six years old. 

I booked through a luxury hotel collection that included a bunch of perks including daily breakfast credits, food & beverage credit, room upgrade and late checkout. For what we paid and the included perks, it was a good value. 

Now, I'm not sure how great the ""upgrade"" that we got really was. We still had the smallest room available (king deluxe) on the 24th floor, which was less than halfway to the top, but it did face the strip and I supposed it was better than being on the 10th floor facing the freeway, so I guess that's the upgrade. The tablet that controlled the room was a fun gimmick but the battery life was crap and it was dead after an hour off of its dock. I could see them phasing these out eventually. 

Breakfast was a $60 per day credit we could use at Aria Cafe, the Buffet or room service. This was a great perk and saved us a ton of money (I have other Yelp reviews of these places). 

We also had a $100 food & beverage credit that could be applied to any restaurant in Aria. I do like that Aria has a large number of restaurants on-site. We spent most of the credit at Lemongrass and the rest at the pool. 

One big annoyance was that on the last day I called down to the front desk around 9am to confirm we'd be taking advantage of the complimentary late checkout and would be departing at 3pm. Even so, someone knocked on the door at noon under the guise of a ""quality check"" which was actually just asking us why we were still in the room. It's details like this that make me question Aria's 5-diamond status.

Overall solid property in a great location with forgivable problems. It's not perfect but I'd stay here again.",5,0,0

Drying off with these towels was a form of exfoliation torture which I am sure the hotel charged for as there were multiple hidden fees throughout our stay.  Everything we did had a fee attached to it.  
Additionally, my friend's boyfriend paid for champagne to be sent to our room for her birthday weekend.  However, whoever took down the order at the hotel, didn't include who it was from on the card which ruined the entire surprise.
The staff at the Liquid pool party was extremely rude, unorganized, and unaccommodating. 
Room service was consistently late.  On the morning we were to depart for the airport, it took over an hour to arrive despite being quoted 30 minutes.

I did enjoy the British bar (with a good draught selection) and the open bar in the casino area is decent. However, I do have a major beef that you get no break to get into their nightclub Haze for staying here like other hotels on the strip.

-Maid service was poor, several nights they didn't even service our room, we had to call for towels and wait 2+ hrs, we had to call for a blow dryer --what woman in Vegas doesn't need a blow dryer.

I would still recommend it to friends and family. I have stayed at the Aria a few times and I am actually here at the Aria, in my room as I write this. 

Because I'm new to Yelp, my review has a lot to do with my current stay. Before this stay, I would give Aria 5 stars without any hesitation. 

My wife and I arrived on Tuesday and we will be checking out tomorrow (Sunday). On Wednesday, I wanted to do something special for my wife as this is her first time traveling or actually being and able to do anything since she had surgery in April. Wednesday was also a special day for her and I had already booked a show and dinner, but wanted to do a little more. I ordered flower arrangements for later that night -  which included rose pedals on the bed in the shape of a heart, candles and balloons. I used the tablet(will get to that later) to place the order. It took around 30 mins to place the order on the tablet because it kept rebooting. After I was able to finally place my order, I get a phone call from Stephanie in concierge. It was rather difficult to talk to her since my wife was next to me getting ready to go out to the show. Stephanie said that the shop was closed so we couldn't get balloons. I didn't have a problem with that. Then she asked me what I would like the message to say and I had to reply letting her know that I put it on the tablet and if she can find it. I had to be as coy as possible. She found it and read it back. So far so good. Then she asked when I would like this to be delivered. I asked if she can have it done anytime after 9:30pm. That wasn't an option since the last available time is at 8pm. I specifically told her twice that my wife and I were going to a show at 7pm and that we had dinner reservations at 9:30, so if we are going to do it, it would have to be done while at the show. So I told her 8pm. Everything seems to be moving along. My wife and I went to KA at the MGM. We got back to the Aria around 8:45pm and went up to the room. As we were walking to the room, the only thing on my mind was that I hope no one is in the room putting the flower arrangement together..... That probably would have been better, since no one showed up! Then all of a sudden, a little after 9pm, there is a knock at the door. I opened up the door and told Priya (although it was no fault of hers)it's too late. I told her that I asked for a specific time and they were over 1 hour later. I let her know my wife is in the room so the surprise won't be happening. She told me there is a two hour window from the time I request. Stephanie in concierge NEVER told me that!! Priya asked if I would like to do it for another day, and I told her no. Big time fail!

Back to the tablet in the room. Overall a great concept to have. It's actually better than the last one they had. Better, but only when it works. And more often than not, it doesn't work. In fact I had call the front desk to let them know and they were going to send someone up. Whether they came or not, I don't know because as I sit here writing this review it still keeps rebooting. I gave up calling the front desk about this problem. I would suggest to find another software instead of Crave. 

Today (Saturday), we went to the pool at 8am. When the waitresses came by we asked for a menu so we can see what they had. The girl said she will come back. She never did! In fact, no one came to ask us for our order. And trust me, there weren't that many people around, plus because I've been at the pool before, I know the waitresses come by every 5mins or so asking if we want anything. We left and decided to order room service..... Another mistake because not only did they forgot to add cheese, my wife got sick. I called room service and told them to take the extra charge off. Sara, who came by earlier to drop the food off came back again with a new sandwich that has cheese plus chocolate covered strawberries. Kudos to Sara as she took responsibility for not double checking the first time. I can definitely respect her for that. She is the type of employee any employer would love to have. 

I really like the Aria and I know we will stay again. I write this review because although things can not always go according to the way we want it to go, I just felt that there were too many mishaps (more than what I'd mentioned) going on.",1,1,1

The waterfall was amazing and I felt like a queen. The lobby is gorgeous with their high ceilings and the front desk staff was very polite. 
They gave us a free upgrade with a city view instead of the bathtub in the bathroom. We were on the 23rd floor right in the middle of the hotel and the view was unbelievable, a low floor because my boyfriend wanted a smoking room. (jerk) 
When we walked in , the curtains opened up and all the controls are touch screen. Our room was a bit smaller than the rest of the groups but the bathroom was enormous! I absolutely loved the shower and our king bed was very comfortable.

The pool in the aria was great, only tow were open at the time because it was off season and the waitresses walking around are very nice. The hot tub was huge and at a very good temperature. 

I didn't give it five stars because i ordered champagne and strawberries as a surprise and they told me it should be there within the hour, it took a lot longer than that and I was a little upset but I did love everything else about the hotel so I didn't complain, things happen. 

Overall it's great and if you like the modern look, definitely stay at this hotel and you can get some great prices!",0,0,0

First night we check in, room looks nice, granted it is super dark in there and the best you are going to get light wise is Just barely enough that you dont walk into a wall, but not enough to prevent you from poking yourself with a mascara wand if youre trying to do your makeup in the bedroom. Everything is handled by a fancy shmancy digital device that tells your room to close the curtains or turn on the lights! Woooow ... It would be pretty cool if it functioned correctly and we did not spend 2 hours like crazy people pressing different buttons trying to shut off the guy playing Jazz on the TV every time we pressed the Goodnight button on the machine. Ok, so fast forward to somewhere around 4 am I wake up and its HOT, not just a little bit warm turn the air down and go back to sleep, but like dude who turned the heat on, I feel like menopause came too early I want to crawl into a tub of ice hot. I sleepily stumble over to the thermostat and it reads 65! You filthy liar, it was not 65..... I mash the buttons until it sounds like the cool air is blowing again and make my way back to bed. 

Wake up in the morning and its still HOT. The AC is now making grumbling noises but nothing is coming out of the vent. Lovely, I will call the maintenance people and they will fix it! I call down and let them know of the problem and the lady assures me maintenance will call me asap, please wait in the room! 1 hour later a lady name Trish, tish, Something like that calls me and says you needed someone for the AC, Yes Ma'am I did .. so I am sending someone to you, great I will be here! I wait patiently .. I want to take a bath and get ready, but Trish has told me someone is on there way and I did not want to be in the middle of a bath while someone is coming to fix it. So I wait, watch some tv .. flip through the magazines .. tick tock, tick tock, its been 3 hours, in vacation time, thats Forever. I call back and as I am on hold I hear Knock Knock on the door! Hallelujah, hes here! 

I open the door and Surprise .. its the phone repair guy!! You must be thinking what is he going to do with your AC, right?! Me too! He says HI I am here to fix your phone .. and I am like great, but uh can you fix my Air conditioning cause That is the problem?   Nope .. so he leaves and I call back down and explain that I have been waiting for 3 hours for someone to fix our AC and not getting ready and wasting my awesome vacation, the lady gives me the usual I am so sorry, I will call maintenance now personally and then they will call you asap, please wait! After another 30 minutes or so, I call back and ask so when were they suppose to call me? She says oh no, did Trish not contact you?? Clearly not lady, now she reassures me a second time she will call her directly! At this point it is about 4 in the afternoon and our whole day has been wasted waiting, I just tell them to cancel it, we want to get ready and go out and will deal with it later. 

Get back at night, still HOT, call and ask to change rooms, much to their huffing and puffing, they assign us a new room, awesomeness! He tells us its a ""wedge"" room.. unsure what that means we just nod and go. We get to said wedge room and this is basically a tinier oddly shaped version of the regular room. The biggest difference is that if you want to wind down and watch some TV as we did, you had to stand in the middle of the room! The TV was mounted in a way that you could not see it from the bed nor the sitting area, so the only way to watch was to stupidly stand in the middle of the room gawking at it, wondering why no one thought to put the seating there. Well I love to watch TV at hotels, it is a thing. I do not have cable at home because infomercials are my weakness. I could watch them all day long, true story, so when I go to a hotel, I like to get my fix of those horrible goodies. I call the front desk again and explain that I cannot get my fix, So we upgraded to a city view room! Awesome, which meant, having to drag ourselves, food and luggage down the elevators Again and switch elevator banks and go back up, is the 3rd time going to be the charm? I hope so! 

We walk in, its hot, so I go and click the AC on and Bam it sounds like a SUPER loud motor .. I groan and grumble and think omg are you serious!?! Call the front desk and thank them for the upgrade, but could they take back the complimentary noise please, it sounded like a machine from the 80's cranking out air on its last leg of life. I was so tired at this point I said can I just have ear plugs .. well No ear plugs in housekeeping or a gift shop! 

TL;DR -- Just don't do it, unless you are too drunk to notice anything or enjoy waking up in a sauna.",2,1,1

They're really nice spacious rooms with all the amenities you need.  The robes were fun to lounge in, the beds were soft (a bit too soft for me - and their comforters are ridiculously heavy and thick), the bathroom was pretty and set up well, and the fact that you can turn on\/ off the tv and lights and open\/ close the curtains with just a touch of a button was cool.  

Not cool was the $50 they charge you just for rearranging the stuff in the mini bar.  A coke is $5.  The cost of drinking that coke would be $55.

Ordered room service.  They forgot the fries that came with BD's steak, and my Asian chicken salad was missing dressing.  The mashed potatoes were sweeter than I've ever tasted but BD's onion soup was good.

The hotel is HUGE.  It's a long walk anywhere (to get ice, to go to the elevators, to get out of the hotel without a taxi) but it's nice.  The gelatos by the guest elevator were delicious.  People are friendly and helpful, everyone's dressed to impress, so on and so on.  Free wi-fi, free shuttles to certain other hotel\/ casinos, free ride to the parking lot where they store oversized vehicles, super close to shopping, one block from the Strip.

I don't think I would ever stay here again unless it was cheap like under $110\/night. Customer service here was terrible, concierge couldn't help us with club hookups or guestlists or anything of that sort. We tried tipping the customer service person when we first checked in and she wouldn't upgrade us to a larger room or a nicer room, even though she kept our $20 tip. Lame. 

I just think this hotel is very over-hyped and just glamorous looking without the proper staff. The rooms are very high tech with everything controlled by a remote control on the nightstand which was very cool. However it still would do quirky things like turn on the lights when we didn't want it to or open our blinds at odd hours. We had to call repair service to get it fixed. Also it is a little odd that the toilet is in a closet room but with clear but frosted glass doors, so you can see someone on the toilet while at the sink... it was almost pointless to have a door to the toilet if it's going to be clear yet frosted. Lame once again. But the tub was a good size, can fit two people a little tight. It was just a little oddly placed. But it was enjoyable. 

We also tried the buffet here and it was nothing to rave about, I hardly even remember it. Nothing extraordinary. 

The only plus side to this hotel is that it's walking distance to the other hotels in City Center like the Cosmopolitan and the mall which has super high end shops that I can't even afford to look inside of. But the bonus would be if Marquee was open at the time it was definitely walking distance, but unfortunately the Cosmo wasn't finished being built at the time. 

The only club we did get to go to in this area as Eve and it was lack-luster unfortunately. Even though I really wanted to love it since it is Eva Langoria's club. Also, we were able to go to Haze from here and that was also lack-luster. I wouldn't go back to either of these clubs. Too bad.",2,0,0

If you're looking for a great location, this is it--smack-dab in the middle of the strip. It's a quick walk to Cosmopolitan, Planet hollywood, Paris, and Bellagio. It's right next to the Crystals Shopping Center--too rich for my blood but it's still inviting to walk through it to get out onto the strip. 

The facilities are great. (See my other review on the spa and pool.) Plenty of eateries to choose from plus a convenience store and starbucks.

The room is well-appointed. You have everything you need. The bathrooms are spacious with a separate tub and shower. Plenty of closet space. Comfy bed. One of the things they really try to emphasize is how high-tech the room is--the lights, curtains, music, tv, etc can be controlled via one digital console. I just wish they had a separate fridge--instead of stocking it with all their mini-bar items. 

This is a huge hotel--so it's easy to get lost in. 

I went during Memorial Day Weekend--having only been to Vegas in the off-season before, I was overwhelmed by the number of people there. The check-in process takes a while if there are long lines but the friendly staff make it a little easier to get through. 

And the Aria is a high traffic hotel during these busy weekends...so be prepared for the crowds in the lobby--most of these people aren't even staying at the hotel--they're just walking through. I didn't want to dock points for having trashy people in the lobby--but when you're paying over $200 for one night at the Aria---you expect a certain level of luxury. 

The one biggest pet peeve I had was their internet station (even more frustrating because the everything is supposedly so high-tech)--it was clumsy, hard to use, and after paying for internet access and print fee, we weren't able to print our tickets and boarding passes because the printer ran out of ink. I immediately stormed up to the lobby and complained to the front desk and they took care of it immediately. I just wanted my $5 back that I paid for internet\/printer access--out of sheer principle--but the credited my resort fee for one night--which was over $20--so i was pretty pleased with how it was handled.

We had the luxury sky suite which was very spacious. There was a beautiful view of Rio and neighboring hotels. A large couch that can sleep two easily, remote control everything that open and closed our curtains and fascinating, very inviting bidet that we all stood in line for as it offered front and rear cleaning, seat warming, and drying when finished. A tub right in the middle of the bathroom with lots mirrors so getting ready made life in vegas that much simpler. The bedroom was big enough to store 9 suitcases, sleep 4 girls and manage to still have floor space. Throughout the day, the hotel offered baked goods and assorted breads downstairs, coffee, tea and refreshments like fancy fiji water.  Let me reiterate, fancy overpriced fiji water?  that's an automatic 1 star!  

The bad: I was irritated with the lack of outlets because trying to charge my phone or iron my clothes was challenging. Housekeeping. Don't know if this is a proper correlation but one of the girls lost her brand spanking new sunglasses from the time we went to the pool and came back up to see housekeeping cleaning up our already clean room. They also were not detailed orientated as they tossed a personal towel in their pile of dirty hotel towels, and have not heard any news of the towel or sunglasses since our stay.

Each room comes with a tablet to control the features (but, of course, no instructions). Most rooms offer spectacular views of the city - provided you can find the command to open the curtains and that it works (you can't just open them by hand).  ALL the lights are controlled by the computer, as are the heat and air conditioning.  When everything works right, this is great - during our group's stay at the Aria most of our rooms had various problems with the computer controlled lights and room temperature - always problems that the hotel staff were completely unable to resolve because they don't have any software technicians working at night.   Even with the myriad of admittedly small problems (like the lights coming on in the middle of the night) the Aria's rooms are palatial.  In fact, everything about the Aria is palatial -- especially the prices.  First of all, forget the room rates published on all the websites because like nearly all hotels in Las Vegas they quote an astonishingly low room rate, but tack on a mandatory ""Resort Charge"" that isn't included in the listed room rate.  The hotel has several excellent restaurants - expect to pay at least $50 per person per meal (not per day) to eat anywhere at the Aria.  Like any tourist hotel has a couple of gift shops where you can pick up something for the folks back home -- and at all such shops in Las Vegas, the prices are high - but at the Aria, the closest thing to gift shops sell only designer label clothes.

My boyfriend was not a fan of having to literally walk a marathon to just eat at a restaurant...this place is HUGE even for Vegas standards. 

One cool thing about it though are the monorails that take you from the Cosmopolitan to the Bellagio to the Vdara. They come every 5 minutes and can be handy to beat the hot Vegas heat whilst travelling to and from casinos. 

I will say this though, I made a booking through the Aria for a weekend package which included VIP access to Haze nightclub, the Liquid Lounge and 2 for 1 offer at the Deuce Lounge. I feel I may have been taken for a ride when I saw promoters handing out free VIP passes to Haze nightclub and the Liquid Lounge. When I started to receive no less than 5 free 2 for 1 offers at the Deuce Lounge, I knew I had been taken for a ride with this so called ""weekend package"".

The fact that the VIP for Haze Nightclub was only valid for Saturday night and could not even guarantee access to the club, made me even more angrier.  

All in all, I probably would not recommend to stay in the Aria for longer than a few days. I mean I only booked it because the cast of Shahs of Sunset stayed there for Reza's birthday...last time I listen to the Persians...lol jokes i'm half persian...in all seriousness whilst the rooms were nice, I would probably not stay at the Aria ever again.

It is absolutely amazing that a brand new hotel will go through such great lengths to undermine any hopes you had of having a good time.  You would think that they would have better service than all of the greats along the strip just to steal customers but, although this defies logic, this was simply untrue. 

So, I missed out on the argument...yes argument that the staff had with my friends in assigning a room to us because I got into Vegas late, so lucky for Aria.  But my friends told me that this entire ordeal took quite a while and the end result?  The manager miraculously was able to find a room with two queen beds.   It is absolutely amazing the magic tricks that hotel managers can pull, isn't it?  They should have a Vegas show of their own.  Let's all try to get people to upgrade to a suite for $400 a night but if they don't agree, thennnnn we'll give them what they booked.  

Then my friends attempted to get into Haze...mind you it was pretty late already.  So the girls got swept through a fast line but had to pay $20 each to get in.  The boys on the other hand, were much luckier.  They got to stand in line for an hour at the very front of the line before they were told that the rest of the line would not be getting in the club.  And they didnt' even have to pay to stand in line for an hour, how about that.  Oh but wait a minute, you COULD get in!!!  For the right price!  The Haze people began to ask each party whether they would want VIP passes to get in the club.  When my friends asked how much the VIP passes are, they replied, you name a price and we'll tell you if it's too high or too low.  My question to them would be....is $1000 too high?  I mean is there really going to be a number that's too high?  The girls inside the club were experiencing something similar.  The go-go dancers were straight holding up dollar bills and pointing at them, asking guys to tip them. I understand that City Center was going through tough times and was almost unable to be completed but this is going a little far.  

After this amazing experience, my friends went to speak to the management at the hotel and expressed their dissatisfaction in the club.  The management insisted that the club had nothing to do with the hotel and that they were unable to control the way Haze was run.  Understandable.  Nonetheless, Haze is the primary club in Aria and yes, people do associate clubs with hotels.  XS -- Wynn\/Encore, Tao -- Venetian.  Amazing -- Amazing.  So they offered first round of drinks at Gold Lounge.  I mean at this point it was 1 AM and I'm sorry a round of drinks just wouldn't do to alleviate the anger of standing in line for an hour with no avail.  Finally, after much persuasion, they gave buffet comps.  We were able to end the night on a much happier note after that.  

Other than that, the staff there was quite poorly trained.  They all have attitude when addressing customers.  This started with the valet, who just stared at us when we drove up.  We had to say hi to them to get service.  Amazing.  I was asking for directions from one of the staff members.  He had to finish listening to his earpiece before he said to me, ""Go ahead.""  Like...WOW.  Okay thank you for letting me wait my turn and allowing me to go ahead with my question now.  Nothing like, ""how may I help you, miss.""  

The hotel was absolutely gorgeous though.  It was like....going to Hong Kong or somewhere in Asia.  Looming skyscrapers and glass everywhere.  The lobby was a modernistic look along with the casino.  Everything smelled very new.  The hallways smelled like new carpet, not necessarily a good thing.  Our room was very well put together and the room service provided turn down service without request.  Everything can be controlled with a touch of the controls on the nightstand so that was pretty fun. I mean this included turning on and off the lights in the bathroom while your friends were in there.  The alarm clock was very fun also! As we discovered at 10:45 AM when our curtains started opening, all the lights turned on and the TV turned on to the jazz channel. 
After gambling, we went to the City Cafe.  I had the corn chowder, delicious with a kick to it!  I also had steak and eggs which was pretty good.  My boyfriend had mac & cheese.  All quite delicious. We had four people and the bill totalled $100, no drinks.  But, it still was quite delicious.  
Aria's buffet...was quite tasty.  With $5 extra, there is unlimited champagne.  The staff dropped two plates while we were there and they were quite responsible.  They had security come over immediately to make sure no one was walking through the area and they cleaned it up immediately.  

Aria needs to step up its game if it wants to compete with the big boys.  Customer service...let's say gets a 0. If you don't have to interact with the hotel staff, then I'd say it's a 3.5.",5,8,4

I was driving in from Henderson, so the easiest way to really access the hotel is to take the airport connector to Harmon, turn left on LVB and then turn right into the main driveway of the hotel. I had decided ahead of time to park in valet, since I was unsure where in the hotel the showroom was located and I knew the parking garage is HUGE.  This ended up being the best choice.  The valet was super friendly and used my name as soon as we stepped out of the car.  He gave me clear directions to the Zarkana showroom and also said there were restaurants nearby.  And so we were off.

The place was super busy for a Monday night. Wow.  We saw signs for the Zarkana theater and some restaurants and headed up the escalator.  (This review continues in my reviews for American Fish and for Zarakana)

Previously I have stayed in a regular room in the Sky Suites tower of Aria.  The rooms are very nice and modern.  I loved the crestron remote and how it remembers all of your preferences (I like my hotel rooms frigid cold).  The bathrooms are super nice.  This wasn't long after the hotel opened, so I would be interested to see how they have held up now.  I also like that you just have to flash your key in front of the door instead of inserting it, but I bet this causes a lot of confusion for guests.

The casino floor is HUGE.  I am SO glad that they put the theater where they did and designed the valet area the way they did, so that I didn't have to walk 5 miles through the casino floor to get to my show.  That is always so annoying (looking at you, Planet Hollywood).

The only downside is that it was a cold night, and although it didn't take too long for my car to be pulled back up, the space heater outside wasn't even turned on, so everyone waiting outside in valet was complaining about the cold.  Of course, in Vegas, nobody had on jackets yet (I wasn't one of the people complaining).

Everything in the room from the curtains, lights, clock, etc controlled electronically, which was cool. REALLY comfy bed that I immediately fell asleep on. I rarely fall asleep that early. 4-star because the ""City View"" room was NOT exactly a ""city-view"". In fact, the view sucked but at least it was a free upgrade. To elaborate, the upgrade didn't exactly feel like an upgrade unfortunately. Other than that, I would definitely return to this hotel next time.",0,0,0

Got settled in and finally laid on the bed to take a nap.  Noticed some stains on the white pillow case but shrugged it off... no big deal.  Pulled the throw blanket up from the foot of the bed and... 

Well HELLOOOO big white stain that looks like the crust of another human's DNA.  Sick!!  I was sooooo disgusted and was not going to tolerate it.  Called downstairs to report it and they offered to come up and replace the blanket.  Ughhh... NO... we're going to need another room.  If that thing isn't clean, who knows what else isn't.  They moved us to another room.  Cool, right?

Got to the other room and noticed that the carpet had not been vaccuumed.  Crumbs and crusts all over... looked like toddlers had been in there eating crackers unsupervised.  I told myself over and over that I'm just being picky and that it will be okay... its only one night.  Noticed blonde hair all over the bed and I knew it wasn't mine or my Husband's... we have black hair.  Pretty disgusting.  I shed my hair too, but that hair was not MY hair so it was not okay.  Rolled the sham over and HELLO, thick wet stain that looks like sweet and sour sauce with small little white chunks inside.  WTF?  OH HELL NO!!!

Called downstairs and INSISTED that a manager come see the mess.  She came up and was kind of rude when she got there... asking if there was a problem.  Uhmmm... YES.  I showed her the mess and the stain and she had no words.  I mean... what can she possibly say, right?  She offered to change our room AGAIN.  By this time, it was late and we only had an hour to rest up before dinner.  I told her that we will take a different room, but we really need to get settled in and going because we had plans.  She found us a room and said that the room is clean, but she is going to have her top housekeeping lady go through it to make sure its up to par.  At this time, it was about 4:30pm.  She told us that it would take about 15 minutes and they will bring us the key to the other room and we can move our stuff there.  Waited around and yes, the key came in 15 minutes.  Great.  By that time, I moved my stuff over to that room assuming that the room was ready.  Went over there and the lady said that she needs about 5 more minutes because she is fixing up the bed and she will come get us once its ready.  FINE.  Went back to the dirty room and made sure not to touch the disgusting yucks around the room and sat on the chair looking out the window... just waiting.  5:45pm... an hour later and I went to check again to see what's the hold up... we have to get going.  A different manager stopped me at the door and said that the room didn't look good enough to her so they are doing it over again.  WTF?  Are all of your rooms filthy or something?  She asked for us to give her 5 more minutes.  Ugh... fine... but we really gotta go and haven't even settled in yet.  This is ridiculous.  6:30pm rolled around and I wanted to see when they'd finally be done.  Two hours later, they are done.  REALLY?  Two hours?  

What a waste of our time!  Sure, the room finally looked great but typically in a 5 star hotel, you shouldn't have to go through all of that trouble.  Ugh!!

WORST customer service I've ever experienced in such a pricey hotel.  

Yes, the hotel is gorgeous and the room is nice (if you don't see and think about the nasty dirtyness of it all).

I would NEVER want to stay here again because:

-Its dirty... grimey.  Housekeeping?  What housekeeping?
-Customer service sucks and will give you the run around before they get anything right.
-Although its on the strip, its a far walk from the actual hotel through the shopping center and casino to actually get back on the strip.
-Again, NASTY.

But hey... at least you get two complimentary drink vouchers (which we didn't even get to use because all of our time was spent running around trying to find a decently clean room).",16,9,7

I could gloat over and over about the Aria but what I greatly appreciate and have observed is their consistent service throughout all their departments and even during the high season (April to Sept).

Rooms - uber high tech and clean. I mean clean! Pillows and bed is nothing like I've slept on before. What I appreciate the most is it's so clean and personalized that it feels like your own place. They even have turn down service for when you return to your room after a long rager or shopping at the Crystals. 

Restaurants - yummy and expensive. But ""when in Vegas..."" 
Spa - save your dime and enjoy the day use of the facilities. Your stay includes the nice up to date gym. The staff their are great and knowledgable. 

Concierge - helpful and friendly. En pointe with many of their recommendations (even those outside of the Aria).
Shops @ Crystals - a hop, skip, and a jump away! Nice free tram that takes you to Bellagio too!

Our room was modern and clean and fit the two of us comfortably. I wouldn't suggest splitting between more than three people, though, just because the room is small. The beds are soo comfortable! I wish I could lug one back to my place in LA. There's a little touchscreen\/control panel where you can control the lighting, curtains, tv, etc. It's a cool concept but in reality the touchscreen isn't very sensitive. Also, for whatever reason, neither I nor my friends in other rooms could check out on the TV. You would think that a hotel trying to be high tech would have that figured out...

The bathroom is nice but small. If you're trying to fit a bunch of girls into one of these room, you might want to consider upgrading to a suite or looking into other options because counter space is extremely limited. Also, the toilet is separated off by a frosted door but isn't completely private. 

Food choices are fairly limited in the hotel unless you like eating expensively at every meal, but there is one cafe (Cafe Vettro) on the first floor that's open 24\/7 and offers sandwiches (15-17), pizza, etc. We tried this for dinner one night because we were in a rush and thought the food was mediocre.

Personally I prefer staying near the Wynn (Venetian\/Palazzo or TI) because pretty much the only club I go to in Vegas now is XS. There are also more food\/shopping\/entertainment choices over there. But I definitely wouldn't mind staying here again.",2,1,1

Our Room - There were stains on the pillow sham and bedspread; what kind - I don't want to know. The bedside lamp had a burnt out light bulb, the universal remote didn't work. Consequently, our curtains were stuck open for hours. I do hope the guests across from us at the Cosmopolitan enjoyed their free, unintentional peep show...Remote also affected every other function in the room. 

Room Service - noticed the burnt out light bulb immediately upon check-in. Got a room attendant who was in the hallway and told her. She told us to ""flick it"" (""flick this!"") Took hours before we got a replacement bulb as well as someone to close our curtains that were stuck open (see above explanation). Had to ask for an extra roll of TP as well as soap. Come on people; you're charging $400 a night and can't give it up. 

Cocktail servers - the absolute worst!!!! Went to 3 different bars in the Hotel. one would think for $20 a cocktail you would get top of the line service. After the initial drink service it appears as all the servers were sucked into some type of vortex, never to return again.... 

The only saving grace (excellent food, value and service) was ""The Buffet"" restaurant. Went there every morning and were fortunate enough to hit their weekend shrimp\/crab leg brunch. Outstanding!! 

The true colors of the Hotel is there questionnaire they email to you asking if there were problems with stay, etc. feigning some sort of concern.

As soon as we pulled up to the front, this hotel definitely has that WOW factor. As we stood inline, we couldn't help but over hear some people getting checked-in really quick, and a couple other people complaining about something and wanting upgrades during the time of check-in. No clue what that was all about but we were waiting for these people for a good 15 minutes. Luckily for us, the process only took less than 5 minutes. We had a friend who got there the night before and was able to upgrade us to a strip view and two adjoining rooms next to his...FREE of charge!!

The view was freakin AWESOME! I paid close attention to the decor and little details, and everything was on point design\/function wise. The touch screen user panel was easy to use, but a slight inconvenience when you wanted to do a simple thing, such as turn off the tv! The highlight of the room is the bed! Super soft and plush with lots of pillows to hug your body.

We tried out their room service at 3:30am...pretty quick, convenient, and the food was surprisingly good (but a bit pricey)! I'm not sure if being drunk had to do with it, but we cleaned the plate up! What's nice is that they wheel in a table in your room and set it all up...then when you're done, you can roll it into the hall way and call the number for them to come pick it back up.

As far as the rest of the hotel, restaurants, casino floor... decor and attention to detail is pretty nice. Service and staff is helpful and friendly. One of the dealers was patient with us and taught my wife and I how to play one of the games. Lots of different restaurants to choose from, but I'll leave a review for one of those restaurants later! The tram is VERY convenient...getting to the Belagio and Monte Carlo is nice since you really don't have to go outside.

Our suite was pretty spacious - two rooms, Cal King beds each with its own master bath, tub, tv in bath, and 42in TV's in each room. The common room was stocked with a 52in lcd tv and we were able to hook our iPhones to the stereo and play music. We also found the remote for both rooms to be quite entertaining, in terms of opening\/closing the other room's curtains and powering lights on and off.

I chose to book at Aria because it's relatively new, and we've never stayed there before.  

When trying to find Aria's self-park garage, use the Mandarin Hotel as your landmark.  Once you turn in that corner, you will see the signs to Aria's parking.  We were able to park close to the elevators but the walk to the check-in desk was really loooong....it was on the opposite side of the parking garage hotel entrance.   Upon entering the hotel from the parking garage, walk to your right to reach the lobby...it's a relatively shorter walk.  There was a long line at the check-in desk but it moved pretty quickly.  We were assigned a room on the seventh floor.

The website claims the hotel room greets you as you enter the door -- the lighting and the window shade open, the music starts playing.  Unfortunately, none of those happened when we entered our room.  And it truly was unfortunate because we didn't realize the blackout drapes didn't work until we were getting ready for bed at 2am.  We called for service and were told somebody will come shortly.  We fell asleep waiting for service that never came.  Come morning, I couldn't go back to sleep because it was too freakin' bright!  We called for service again.  Someone from the service department immediately called us back and apparently, it was the first time they received the work order!  A technician came a few minutes later.  He was unable to repair the broken mechanism on the spot, but he offered to manually close the blackout drapes so we were still able to sleep some more.  He also arranged a time when they would come back to fix whatever needed to be fixed.  To his credit, he was very polite and professional.  And they did repair it as promised.  They even gave a courtesy call to make sure we were still amenable to the scheduled time.

The room itself was spacious. There was a mini fridge which we couldn't use for our personal stuff (unless we pay extra!) because everything in it had a sensor that if you so much move an item, it automatically charges your account.  They had plush robes provided but it would have been better if they provided slippers as well (especially since my bro-in-law forgot to bring his own!).  We brought our own toiletries so it didn't bother us that they didn't have toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom.  I was surprised that they didn't have a coffeemaker available in the room.  I guess they wanted people to buy coffee from the in-house Starbucks where the line was always loooong.  The beds were comfortable, and I totally loved the pillows!  

My husband's hip injury got worse with all the walking we did in Vegas so he called the Fitness Center to inquire if they had foam rollers.  They had them so he went there to do some floor stretching using those rollers.  He didn't bring any workout shoes but I appreciated the staff's flexibility in still allowing him to stay when he indicated he just planned on doing some floor exercises.  
  
We were also able to use Aria's pool facilities.  We were surprised they didn't have shower facilities in the pool area.  There were plenty of available poolside lounge chairs.  I wasn't happy with the poolside food and drink service though because come lunch time, I only saw 2 servers serving the entire pool area, one on each side.  It took me over 30minutes just to flag someone down.  My husband said earlier in the morning he was approached a number of times just to ask if he needed anything. I think they should assign more staff during peak hours. 

I was able to print our boarding passes through the Concierge.  I had to wait in line a bit because there were only a couple of staff members available, but the person who assisted me was genuinely nice that I couldn't help but not be mad.  

I wanted to try checking out by text but I remembered we had some resort credit so I opted to check-out over the phone to ensure all charges and credits were accounted for.  We didn't encounter any problems with check-out. 

Overall, our stay at Aria was just okay because it fell short of my expectations.  With so many hotels to choose from, Aria needs to get things right the first time every single time if they want repeat customers.  And since they didn't quite get it right, I'll be looking else where on my next visit to Vegas....unless they have an unbeatable deal price-wise.",1,0,0

I have decided that my ridiculously unprofessional experience at this hotel\/casino deserves my effort to sign up for this website to share my experinces.

Lets start with the hotel room. I believe I was one of the ones (or many, according to past reviewers) that have received a ""reject"" room. I did not get the auto-curtain-opening feature along with any ""welcoming"" in any way, shape, or form upon entering.The shower\/bath smelled like urine from check-in to check-out.  One of the serving trays did not work (fold out) properly for an in-room dining service I ordered totaling over $100 for two.

Now onto the casino. The minimums are abnormally high for table games. There is little variety of slots compared to any other major casino. And for the icing on the cake - one of the ladies (the heavyset lady, I would think of a nicer description, but she's not, so...) behind the M Life (the casino's player's club) counter, seemed very irritated and upset that I even dared to walk up to her to ask questions... and when I did approach her, no ""hi"" or ""how can I help you"", just a blank, empty stare. The answer to my question was then met with a very rude tone of voice. I felt that she was about to go all-out ghetto on me, complete with the whipping of the head back and forth, but refraining from doing so only because she remembers that there are cameras watching her as well.

Finally, for the cherry on top, this is supposed to be a 5-star resort.

Pro's? The location.

Rooms are really cool, very modern feel as well.  Everything is very high tech whereas you can control almost everything from an electronic control panel.    Great view of the strip and the Cosmopolitan.  The walk to every place on the strip was really no big deal even in 4"" heels!  A lot of fun places to dine, nice bar selections and restaurants as well.   Pools were crowded by 10am so get there early!

My husband and I booked a room online at Aria to celebrate our two night staycation on the Strip. While making small chat at the Registration Desk, we told the woman that we were there to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. Low and behold, we received our key after receiving very friendly customer service, and were on our way. 

After a long, long walk, we finally came to our room. Looking at our room, we were at the end of the very long hallway in the corner of the building looking at a gorgeous view of the Strip. Well, then we walked into the room.

I'm a suck for technology, especially sexy technology that turns on your room when you walk in after a very long walk. The curtains slowly opened as sensual mood lighting raises in the background, smooth jazz starts to play on the television and I dropped my bags in awe. The sights, sounds and utter zen-like feeling I experienced within the first 15 minutes was exactly what I would expect from the Aria and then some. Who needs to walk around the Strip when you have that kind of view and all the luxuries of the Aria at your finger tips?

However, if you do want to leave your room there is a tram that goes from the Aria to Crystals (which exits right near a Starbucks), Monte Carlo and Bellagio if you want to spare yourself a little walking. We use this tram often when we are on that part of the Strip, and when it's free there is very little to complain about. 

The restaurants at the Aria offer their guests a wide variety of cuisines, and each one we've tried has been delicious in every way. Many of the restaurants have Happy Hour menus which offer a more affordable price for customers that may not want to spend their food budget on one meal like myself. I would suggest trying Lemongrass or Julian Serrano for a meal and the Patisserie for Straciatella Gelato. So good, and definitely worth the price. 

The quality of this hotel is high, the customer service has always been impressive, and even their basic rooms are still beautiful and offer their guests quality accommodations  for a reasonable price. If you're looking or a little bit of luxury, I suggest staying at the Aria!",3,1,2

I really like how this hotel is part of M Life. M Life consists of several Vegas hotels like MGM Grand, Aria, Bellagio, Luxor, and Mirage. If you go to any of these hotels, you can charge things to your room. For example, we ate at the Bellagio buffet and charged the bill to our room at Aria. Also, if you gamble at one of these hotels, sometimes you'll receive room comps for another M Life hotel.

This hotel is very modern, but it doesn't have much character to it. Also, there's not much night life here except for Haze. I didn't check out the pool area so I can't comment on that. Don't order room service here.... way overpriced, took 45 minutes, the food sucked. Overall, not a bad hotel, but also not a fan.


Pros:
- Part of M Life
- Decent buffet
- Rooms have blowers in the bathrooms 
- Walgreens within walking distance
- Casino area has high ceilings
- Technologically advanced rooms
- Lots of closet space
- Taxi lines are small
- Connected to a mall...although the mall seemed kinda dead

Cons:
- Toilet area in the rooms have glass doors so it's not that private
- Doesn't have a good view of the strip
- Sterile environment
- Not much to do there
- No iPod deck in the rooms
- Curtains don't hide all the light in the morning
- Crappy room service
- Their 24 hour restaurant doesn't have that many late night options.
- Only place to do makeup is in the bathroom. Makeup mirror is attached to the wall. The rest of the room has bad lighting.",3,0,0

We stayed in a city view regular room.  I found the bathroom counter space limited, and the shower floor extremely slippery, I recommend putting down a towel so you don't fall.  
We ate in the Aria Café and ordered shortly after being seated.  After about ten to fifteen minutes, the waitress had to re-ask my companion what he had ordered, claiming the ""ticket got stuck""?

Resort fee is about $32 a night additional with a $150 security deposit on the credit card.
When I got to the room, I was blown away by the view.  The curtains were controlled by either the tablet provided by the hotel, or the switch near the restroom door.  I had a pretty good view of the vegas highway(spotted the In and Out burger in the distance), tmobile arena, the pools, and the monte carlo.
I like how the restroom has BOTH a tub and a shower.
I had the king bed which was VERY comfortable and the two chairs, perfect for just taking in the view.  

Going back to the tablet, It was very handy for shutting the curtains without getting up, setting alarms, and ordering room service if you wanted.

 It was nice too that the Vdara is like a two minute walk from this hotel since I had friends staying there, literally connected by a walk way.
The strip is easily accessed from the lobby and at the Casino is what I'd expect, but nothing stood out.

First, I am deeply impressed with the main bathroom. It is every girl's dream! The lighting was perfect for girls to get ready and perfect their look for a big night and also spacious to fit many girls at once. The half bath is also great too!

The bedroom was blocked from the living room with a sliding door and had an amazing view of the city. You could control lights, curtains, tv, music, and room privacy with just a push of a button (same goes for the living room)! I have never slept on such a comfortable bed. After a night of partying, 3 friends and I were chilling on the bed and we all knocked out within minutes because it was ridiculously too comfortable. There is a closet with an iron\/board as well!

The living room was small in my opinion but still cozy. The TV was nice to relax to and also gives you options to bump up the music for your pregame! There is a small bar and fridge, but no coffee maker? Or it was hidden somewhere. That loss made my mornings rough. 

The location was golden though. To get to Marquee, you just walk across the bridge. To go shopping in Planet Hollywood or eat at Earls, just another bridge again! Partying to eating to sleeping was within a 10-15 min walking distance from each other.

Pros: 

-- The room are large, REALLY clean, everything in the room is new and in great condition. 
-- So much storage space in the room - 2 closets, plenty of hangers and an extra drawer in the bathroom to keep all your cosmetics. Love! 
-- The bathrooms are fantastic with 3 well defined spaces and the restroom and bathtub and shower have separate enclosures. 
-- Very comfortable beds. 
-- Zarkana - when you have a Cirque show in your hotel, makes it very convenient to catch a late night show. Also, a special mention of Priya at the concierge who was  wonderful and helpful.

Cons:
-- I liked that everything in the room was controlled by a tablet, specially the wall-to-wall curtains, however it was not very practical if you wanted to turn on the lights in the middle of the night.
-- I was staying at Aria during CES which is madness in general in Vegas, and I thought the staff could have been better prepared to deal with the large volume of humanity -especially room service which took forever, at least 60-70 minutes at a bare minimum. 
-- Hardly any vegetarian items on the menu (a common complaint from me) and they delivered the wrong dish which I noticed only after they had left. When I mentioned it to the staff during check out, Kyona at the front desk was kind enough to knock it off my bill. 
-- Really long taxi lines.
-- Only one Starbucks and 20 minute long wait for a cup of coffee early in the morning before heading to work!",4,0,1

Good shopping and fun people watching. This whole end of the strip just rox. 

Cafe Vettro, Jean Philippe Patisserie, Union Steakhouse and American Fish, Julian Serrano Tapas....all super for different reasons. Yeah , there was the $8 latte and a $40 bottle of basic table wine- but that's just Vegas. 

From here, The Marquee is high heel friendly! AKA walking distance for the most part depending on how long you danced before you call it a night. 

If the sun is out- Liquid can be a lot of fun. This pool party is not as wild as ""Rehab"" which is actually a relief. You know what I mean. 

Watch out for expensive Black Jack tables. 

Take your iTunes, there is a jack in the room. But don't even thing about touching the mini fridge- every item is on a sensor for automatic charge to the room.

The footprint of the property is large and well laid out, and everything about this hotel is absolutely beautiful inside and out. However, because of the size of the hotel and it's unique shape, the guest rooms are a bit of a hike from the elevators (and can be hard to find with the hallways that fork off in each direction) so you may want to ask a bell hop to bring your bags up for you.  That being said, the rooms are clean, sleek and modern while still being very comfortable, and have great technological features. My husband loved the touch screen control center, but it confused the hell out of me. There are 3 beautiful pool areas with plenty of chairs to go around and an unexpected bonus for non-smokers (like myself) is that the casino is filtered really well so you're not hit with a wall of smoke upon entering the building. I am also going to rave about the food because it's fabulous no matter where you go inside the hotel, although being honest, it's on the pricey side. The staff is friendly and professional and made us feel welcome and comfortable throughout our entire stay. And because the Aria is located right in the middle of the strip, we never needed to take our car out of valet.  Everything was in walking distance and was super convenient, including a shopping mall (Crystals at CityCenter) filled with designer stores and wonderful restaurants just steps away from the hotel...literally like 10 steps from the main entrance of the hotel.

$129\/night got me a deluxe room (king bed, non-smoking and clean) with a huge bathroom, nice toiletries, a beautiful TV, a decent west LV and mountain view, and a $100 resort credit, which bought 3 great meals for me.  The room was comfortable, the linens soft, and the ability to control the room from either the TV remote or the touch-screen remote at bed side made for a lazy evenings and effective mornings.  I programmed the curtains to open, the lights to come on, and the TV to show re-runs of Roxanne every morning to make sure I'd jump out of bed!

Parking was much better than expected.  With such a huge development, I figured that I'd have to walk 3 or 4 nautical miles to reach my room.  However, I typically parked on the walkway floor and was in my room 10 minutes after parking.  The fact that most parking spots are greatly spaced out seemed wasteful, but then again, it made for worry-free, comfortable parking.

I adore the bedside 'computer' operated room functions. Waking up to curtains opening and the tv tuning into your favorite station always beats a blaring alarm clock. 

As the years have progressed since opening, they've done a good job of adding more bars to accommodate the endless drinking enthusiasts. Smart move. There are plenty of restaurant options, although perhaps the smartest addition is the pizza joint in the back, that offers pizza by the slice late night. This is some life saving sh*t right here!

It's always nice to be smack in the middle of all the action plus they have a free tram that runs between the Bellagio and other casinos.  The hotel room welcomes you when you come in with the automatic opening of the shades.  The rooms themselves are smaller than the Venetian suites I've stayed in or even the ones at the MGM Grand.

Room - I've stayed in the standard deluxe room twice and the 2 bedroom penthouse.The rooms were always clean and tidy, contain alot of mod cons (an ipad style control for the curtains, lights and tv). The rooms are plenty big enough and the decor is nice and neutral. 

Lobby - mixed bag here really, depends when your staying. The queues can be long and slow moving at both check in and the concierge desk which was the case over spring break and summer, of they can be just a few people deep. They have plenty of desks though and the staff are always pleasant enough.

Casino - all the usual table games are accounted for here as well as a huge number of bandits, there's a partially secluded poker room and a number of bars and eateries along the outer walls. Again, the casino is tidy and not tacky like alot of other casino floors on the strip. It's also well lit and not as much as a labrynth like the Bellagio or the Venetian.

Pool - the pool area is great, three seperate pools and  numerous jacuzzi's mean there's plenty of room to have a dip, even at peak times. Food and drink can be expensive but it's a great spacious place to chill in the Sun until it closes at 6pm.

I recommend this hotel to everyone I know if they go to Vegas, I'm yet to encounter any problems and the hotel is situated in a great location, it's basically shifted the centre of the strip to where it stands. I saw the Elvis Cirque show here too, I'd rate it 3\/5 and would recommend seeing 'O' or 'Mystere' instead.

To start, we arrived around 12:30 with two of our friends and my father. Check in went quickly and smoothly for them. However, they did not have a room ready for us. We had paid extra for the 'deluxe city view' room and they simply did not have any clean yet. They told us that it could take up to three hours to have a room ready and that they'd call our cell phone when one was. So, we went and had lunch and beer at Todd English while waiting. Three o'clock comes around and we go back to the desk to ask if any rooms are ready yet as we have not received a call. We're told that none are ready and it could take an ADDITIONAL two to three hours before one is. At this point I was developing a terrible migraine and just wanted to lay down. The guy at the desk magically finds a room but explains that it's a 'wedge room'. He says that this means that the windows are just a little bit smaller then in the normal rooms but everything else is the same. Seems fine except that when we get up to the room we discover that just a 'little bit smaller' means that the windows are only about two feet wide. Also, the privacy button on the door was stuck on the 'privacy' setting (meaning that until it was fixed the room wouldn't get serviced). At that point I didn't even care and just needed a nap.

They definitely get a star for the beds and the rooms in general. The beds are the most comfortable I've EVER slept on. Even the pillows are great. I enjoy being able to control everything remotely and the bathrooms are very nice.

Later that night we stopped at the desk and asked if it would be possible for us to get the room style that we had booked (and paid for) the next day. They assured us that it was no problem and that they'd call us the next day between 6am and noon to let us know when the room was ready. Of course we never received a call so we had to stop at the desk AGAIN on our way out to explore the strip. We were told that they'd call our cell phone to let us know when it was ready and that if we didn't take the new room between 8 and 9 we'd lose it. During this time we had brunch at the Cafe Vettro. We were seated immediately but the service was TERRIBLE. Our waiter would walk by us and look right through us when we said his name and waved. The food itself was fairly bland. We also frequented the Moderna bar and had almost the same problem. The waitresses were EXTREMELY unfriendly and you practically had to tackle one to get her attention. 

Fast forward to 6pm and the hotel STILL hadn't called us to tell us that our new room was ready. My husband called them to see what was up and was on the phone for over a half hour trying to work it out. He had to fight with them to get them to hold the room till 11 since they hadn't called us earlier. At least when we FINALLY got the right room it was wonderful and everything was working.

My husband's parents experienced a similar situation. They didn't even HAVE the room that they booked. The manager at the desk informed them that it didn't MATTER if they had paid for an upgraded room because nothing was guaranteed. Even when they finally did get a room almost none of the lights or electronics worked. Eventually they got the room they wanted but it took a lot of complaining to various levels of management.

All in all the Aria is a very pretty and fun hotel. However, their customer service is absolute crap. Good luck finding an employee that will even smile at you. They just want your money and could care less about you as a person. We'll definitely not be coming back.",3,0,0

The hotel is clean and I like all the restaurants that are located inside of the casino. The pool area also is nice. The Aria is located in a perfect spot on the strip, right in the middle. 

One thing I did not like was the snack bar! It has sensors on it and if you move anything you get charged. I guess something got moved and I don't know what it was and I got charged like $20! They need to put everything in some kind of drawer so that guest will not accidentally knock anything over. 

If you want a fridge, you will have to pay an extra $25 a day! Absurd! Shouldn't that be included in the resort fee? I have never had to pay to use a fridge. Just crazy to me.

As a side note - LIQUID pool was not impressive to me. Looked like a bunch of Jersey Shore wanna be's and not my cup of tea. If you are looking for a chair to sit on, be prepared to drop at least $150.

However, I did not like how we did not have a fridge to use to store drinks as the mini bar items were charged by weight and there was also a charge to store items in the fridge.

I also had higher expectations on some of the bathroom amenities since this was a nicer hotel.   I was expecting good quality  shampoos and conditioners (especially since I didn't bring my own). The shampoo was gross and definitely did not clean my hair, so I would recommend bringing your own travel size one.

The location of the hotel was okay, although it is on the centre of the strip, you literally have to walk 15 minutes to get anywhere (even across the street). There is also no cheap food options around here at all.

The hotel lobby offered complimentary water bottles which was an nice touch. I also had a chance to visit the spa and it was nice, with a salt room, suana, steam room, hot tubs, hot stone room. All the staff were very friendly at Aria, and always made an effort to stop and say hello.",1,1,0

And then there's another car slot and another space big enough for another car.  That's wasted space...  You could have twice as many cars by making their garage this way.  So, we finally get a space, and go in to the hotel.  Pretty nice, and an interesting sculpture as you enter the hotel.  It's a chrome like sculpture resembling The Terminator...  The hotel overall is pretty nice.  Lots of slots and center of hotel are all the tables.  You also need to show your card key to get up to your room, which is good for safety reasons.  

Checking in was a tad bit slow, which was what some people had mentioned here on Yelp.  But what a lot of people were wrong about was the room.  I was defintely pleased with the room, although my mom kept messing with the controls and kept turning off the lights.  But once you get used to the control panel on your night stand, it was easy.  The actual remote control for the tv was useless though.  The room was defintely comfy, and I had plenty of room to move around.  I'm petite but I love having lots of space.  Bathroom is pretty roomy too.  Shower and tub is separate but together, if you understand that.  See other peoples photos...  

Also got the chance to eat at the Buffet...  To me, the interior reminded me of a cafeteria, food was okay, sushi was dried out, and althought I ate a couple of pieces, I actually steered away from it...

Well, I was bound to find out during SEMA week and was excited about it because 1. it wasn't going to hurt my pockets (invited to go with an affiliate\/client's company to help for SEMA) 2. haven't been to vegas for awhile now. 3. it's Aria - everybody's been talking about it! So I'm about to dust off my yelp skills (yes, I haven't been here for a year or so...Elite Alumni from Yelp of '06!) and show you what's the deal with Aria (or lack thereof)!
After arriving in Sin City in the wee early hours of the morn we made a stop at Marie Calenders to load up on some carbs for a full day of setup for SEMA! Parting ways with the show car and drivers we headed to Aria to check-in. Once turning the corner to where area is located you notice the modern beams and metal that this whole ""Aria"" is made of! Silver everywhere and tons of glass shimmering down on you in the drop-off center. The Valet is quite polite and immediately greet you and open the doors and ask you if you're checking in and help immediately with your bags by calling out to the bell boy.
Upon walking in you notice the smell of chocolate...or is it vanilla...or baking? Hmmm, whatever it is it is aromatic AND is one of the details that makes this place stand out and stay in your memory. Yes, that smell mmmm. The check-in process is like anywhere else however during this week check-in wasn't until 1pm BUT they were able to accommodate us since we were getting multiple rooms. ""My room"" was still being cleaned out but we were able to check in with one room so we were able to rest a bit and clean up.
Walking the casino floor you notice the lingerie-clad waitress passing out drinks at tables and slots and they are young beautiful girls! 1 Star for that! You should have young ones because the place IS new and you want to maintain a classy place...not saying older ladies are bad but you don't want your drinks served up by someone who looks like your grandma, right? 
Minimum bets look adequate and fair at the tables $10 - score! Low budget gambling possible, although I'm not a gambler! I just notice these things because at the Wynn minimums used to be so high when they first opened!
Eateries you ask? Yes, I notce them too - one of which is the great dessert station dubbed ""Jean Phillipe Patisserie"" which I swear is where the great smell is coming from. But one of my buddies says they're pumping it through the air conditioning? Nonetheless, it smells great and I don't care. BUT this place has some great sweets to feed the needs of any sweet tooth fanatic! There is also a cafe which I was able to enjoy some breakfast\/lunch at Cafe Vettro! The food there is quite good BUT the service is slow - even when the joint is not packed...we waited for simple eggs and hash dish for over 30 minutes! (thus, the -1 star!)
There's also a few other grills and restaurants that look great which should be enough for the visitor who doesn't want to leave the place! And PLENTY of watering holes for you border-line alcoholics! Quite a few nice ones for you to sit and relax to have a few convos with a a lovely lady of choice (which seems to be an abundance of here since it's so new) or with clients! 
""THE BUFFET"" here...it's ""okay"" - really! For such a great place, so well designed and modern\/contemporary. You'd think they'd put some thought into there buffet. But you'd be disappointed! I've been to some places MUCH less that had more options on foods! It's about $30 for the buffet which is not pricey. You have your choices of Sushi (which is ok), Seafood station which had crab legs, fish, and some other dishes. A Carving station was there of course - Prime Rib and Turkey which were both moist and great (which made up for the small variety of foods). Salad Bar was not so bad as it had the basics. Chinese food was available along with some Italian\/Pasta bar. Everything else was dessert and soup. Nothing major to rave about but it was ""ok"" but not worth the $30 really. I think you're better off at Zen Buffet or Hometown Buffet!
Okay so onto the Casino itself - great modern\/contemporary interior! The exterior for sure is modern with all the beams, a side waterfall on the main valet parking area. There is also a nice waterfall which gives a great fountain\/light show at night! The valet area also has a built-in Hertz rental car area which is great for travelers! Interior is simple but trendy. Glass, Black, Brown, and Wood is best way to describe it! I however would have recommended them to make the waiting seats to have some kind of cushion because it's just wood. Your a** will be hurting here if the wait is long for checking in or out for sure!
The rooms - nothing fancy except for the ALL-IN-ONE touch screen remote! Restroom has a shower AND bathtub! Score! View was great from our 10th floor facing strip! Normal HIGH PRICED snacks\/drinks! Flat screen TV..like other new Casinos! All in all 4 stars! Def place to check!",0,0,0

Wanted to get a big suite and decided on the Tower Suites Executive Hospitality Suite. It's 2,000 sq ft has a nice master bedroom with a 2 sink bathroom, jetted hot tub, steam room\/shower and a bidet toilet! The living room is huge and is connected to the bar area. It also has a conference room with a 12 seat conference table. The view is amazing and wraps around the entire suite!

I really enjoyed all the space we had and what is also great at staying at a suite like this is the customer service is even more phenomenal then it already is! Aria had a chauffeur pick us up at the airport in an SUV and immediately helped us with our luggage and brought us to our hotel. 

Check in was also fast and easy. They have a special check in desk assigned to guests staying in the tower suites which is behind a private door. This was very convenient with the lines for the regular rooms being outrageously long! They had a nice quiet waiting area with multiple seating and complimentary beverages and delicious treats. This consisted of a fully stocked fridge with anywhere from bottled Coca Cola to orange juice, hot coffee and tea dispensers, cookies, lemon tarts, mini pretzel bread loaves and spread, and fruit. It was very impressive.

Their 24 hr room service is amazing and they have a very extensive menu but what is also great is the amazing restaurants they have at the Aria such as Julian Serrano, Javier's and the list goes on. The Casino there is fun and upbeat and they are opening a new club. 

We usually stay at a quiet hotel stay for sleep but we would definitely stay at the Aria again. It's nice and a lot of easy access to all the fun!",13,5,12

Let me tell you, I have a very comfortable bed, but I already miss the one at Aria.  You just melt into this bed and pillows.  And yes, you can buy it for the price of $2,000.

So, no problems with check-in, upgraded to a suite.  One of the best views of Vegas I have ever had.  Love the floor to ceiling windows in the bathroom.  Another note on the bathroom- the toilet seat is heated.  Had no problems working the gadgets in the room as others have mentioned (really now??).  The only negative I have to say on the room is the lack of TV from the bed.  You had to go sit in the ""living room""  to watch TV.  Not sure if that was the plan, or just ran out of cash.  Also, we had a empty fridge for our drinks, but it didn't really work.  Should have called someone to fix it, but it wasn't that big a deal.

Loved the pool area.  Very relaxing.  What I liked about this pool is the umbrellas.  I love to sunbathe as much as the next person, but sometimes you need a break.  Other Vegas pools there is no shade to be had anywhere. 

The property is huge.  There is alot to do here.  I didn't mind the dim lighting in the casino, everywhere else is super bright. The tram to the Bellagio is great.  Used that several times.  So we were very happy with our stay.  I would go back with a great rate.",0,1,0

My wife absolutely loves this hotel and I would say it is definitely setting a new standard.  Located in City Center in the heart of the Vegas Strip pulling up to the flag ship hotel (among 5 others) is breath taking.  Everything is on the Grand Scale here in terms of size, design, and height.  

When you walk into the Aria you discover huge open spaces where the ceiling doesn't seem to exist.  I was upgraded to the Sky Suites which has a concierge floor and separate private entrance.  All of the hotels have since copied the rooms from the Aria in design and layout not to mention decor.  If you appreciate architecture this Aria Hotel takes the cake.  Completely modern, it reminds me of staying in a luxury sky rise condo.  Looking out from the bedroom window you will notice it slants outward and you are actually suspended over looking the valet which is very cool.

They have some of the most famous chefs and their flagship restaurants here as well as the Crystal Mall which rivals Michigan Ave in Chicago, 5th Ave in NY, or Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.  The tree house Mastro's was phenomenal in design and food.  The Louis Vuitton store is the largest LV boutique store in North America.

Casino-wise I played a lot here and it lacks the table action of Caesars\/Mirage but plenty of slots and a beautiful layout.  It should be noted this is the only hotel in City Center with a Casino.  The Buffet needs to be AVOIDED but the Cafe is fairly good.  Monorail takes you to the Bellagio or the Monte Carlo.  During my stay the pool was not completed.  Solid 5 star Hotel\/Resort geared toward the business class person and upper middle class to ultra rich.  Even with this glowing review it is not on par with the Wynn\/Encore\/Bellagio.",1,0,1

I'm furious and locked out of my house!!! I hang up John or Sean calls after five more minutes or so tells me to call security and lost & found blah blah blah before I lose my mind and scream why can't you just have radioed North Valet 30 minutes ago to find my keys?!

There are a variety of restaurants to choose from. Julio Serrano specialized for TAPAS. Great food but quite pricy. Gambling are was okay... Which I did not care very much anyway.  The hallway decors for x-MAS was not very impressive... Very casual... Not eye catching compared to the other hotels...
Service was not that great... We used toiletries on our first day and left the in the bathroom. When they cleaned them, the dried and place the same ones on the bathroom counter. The gel and shampoo was almost empty therefore we did not have enough to use when we took a shower. What is up with giving a new set of toiletries? 
We had requested 2 non- smoking rooms next to each other. My kids rooms stink and smells cigarettes smoke. Called and complained and they said they will deodorized it and will take an hour. 5 hours later nothing was done. They finally moved them after I was so upset...

Even though slightly set back, Aria is still a great central location on the strip. I should mention I love to walk, so a ten minute walk to another hotel on the strip is no biggie. Lazy folks may find this a little too set back, perhaps.

Very modern, clean, updated, and a ""calmer"" hotel compared to many on the strip. This was the perfect stay for my business trip. Aria still has all the great things to encompass Vegas: great pools, nice non-smokey casino, top-notch restaurants (my faves are Julian Serrano tapas & the buffet for brunch- both are a MUST!!), and clean comfortable rooms.

The rooms are high-tec and nice all around. They aren't a spectacular Vegas room (nothing entirely out of the ordinary or above and beyond) but just generically nice. I do feel that Aria is more attractive to the Las Vegas business visitors than the large party crowds. 

My only complaint is the walls seemed thin, and I was woken up all night long by rowdy drunks in the hall (ok ok it's not ALL business travelers), and Marquee in Cosmo was bumpin late into the night across from my room.

All in all, negatives were more than minor, and I got an extremely good rate for such a high class hotel on Expedia.

I would definitely stay here again.

I was in Vegas for 5 days for work and fun. 
Decided to check out Aria since it was new and seemed very modern. 

Rooms are average size but definitely modern and hip compared to most rooms in Vegas. 
The remote control system that worked the curtains, lighting, TV, and music was cool and very easy to use and understand. 
The first room they gave me had a view of another tower and construction below. I paid $15 to upgrade to a strip view and it was worth every penny. 
Ended up with an awesome view from the 35 floor. The floor to ceiling windows were awesome! 
I love the frosted glass in the bathroom and the way the tub and shower were together. Very fun! 

The bed was incredible. Very comfortable.

We had good service everywhere we went in the resort\/ casino. 

The textures and design of the casino is very cool. No gold fixtures or flower prints at this place. Everything is brown tones, dark, edgy and modern! This place has a really good vibe to it. 

On the downside... the floor to ceiling windows in the room were really super dirty. That was a bummer when you have a great view. The need to keep the windows clean!! 

The food bar in the room is lame. WAY overpriced and everything is sensored so you can't even pick up an item to look at it or you get charged for it whether you want it or not! 

If you park in self-park, you will find it is a 2 mile hike to get to the check in area!! You actually need to follow the signs and go outside to get to the front desk rather than go inside through the casino. It's kinda weird.

Where to begin? 
The first night we checked in, Aria charged my friends debit card for the full stay of 4 nights, no it didn't pend- they charged it & she wasn't told nor given a receipt. When in fact they were suppose to use my debit card, because that was the original plan. Another issue was that the amount that was taken, didn't match the price I was given. In the meantime, my friend & I are trying to get her money refunded  and the permission from Aria to release the funds back to her bank account, which took forever because they (aria) kept transferring us to different workers and saying they were going to call the bank and they didn't even do it right away. Finally, the bank called her after hours of waiting, saying they got permission from aria to return my friends money. The worst part was that my friend wouldn't even receive her money right away.. it would be between 1-3 days before she saw her money again. That would basically be our whole stay in Las Vegas. I felt so bad for my friend, but there was really nothing I could do for her.

Aside from that. We got a weak room on the third floor which is a non smoking floor, but people were smoking anyway--even smoking weed. We had a view of the roof entrance which was crap & even had workers walking on the roof, which caught us by surprise because we were getting ready. We requested a different room, but of course that didn't happen.

They didn't even clean our room one day, even after we requested turn down service by calling. 
But one day we did come back and our room door was OPEN for some reason! WTF! Luckily nothing was stolen or missing.

We ate at the CAFE which was crap or at least the philly cheese steak I ordered was. It tasted like cardboard without salt or pepper, but the service at the CAFE was great, just NOT the food.

Another night we were getting ready for bed and an employee entered our room, we didn't request anything and they said they were just checking to see if we needed our room cleaned. Why would we need our room cleaned in the middle of the night? When my friend look outside of our door there was no cleaning cart, so i don't know why that employee went into our room, that was bizarre.

I do not wish for anyone to waste their time, money, thoughts on Aria. Maybe in a few years the service will be better.I hope they hire a manager that knows the basics of customer service, because Johnny (who is a woman) doesn't contain the skills required to run a Las Vegas hotel.",1,1,0

We had hallway lights not working, a bathroom lock not working, a service person leaving nails and screws on the floor after attempting to fix the door, a touchpad for literally EVERYTHING in the room not work for a good 4 hours and not to mention the 45 minute wait we had for our luggage from the bell desk. Mind you these are all separate entities and issues, but overall, the star had to come off.

Four stars because I got 3 rooms all next to each other with 2 of them connecting. We ordered a friend for our diabetic friend(free), otherwise $25 a night, and an extra mattress, as well as a little birthday surprise for my friend and his first trip to Las Vegas. Concierge, check-in, valet = all superior.

The casino area throws me off a little bit because it's too casual. Not smokey or dirty enough. I dont know what it is. I love the casino in planet hollywood or ballys better.

It was the last weekend in June.  We arrived about 3:45 in the afternoon and of course check in was busy!  However, unlike other reviews I read we only waited in line about 15 mins!  The hotel did not have that stuffy cigarette smell like most hotels in Vegas!  When you enter the lobby there is a faint floral scent which is quite nice!  The lobby is beautiful with these huge colorful butterflies hanging from the ceiling! 

The hotel staff was very accommodating as I requested a room near the elevators to due a leg injury!! Entering the room was really cool since the curtains open automatically!  By the way, we had no problem with operating curtains, light etc. as some reviewers stated!  It was actually quite simple and self explanatory!  Trust me I'm not all that into gadgets!  

Our room was on the 8th floor and the view was lovely, especially at night!  We could see the Vdara, Cosmopolitan and a partial view of the Bellagio!  I was concerned there may be mechanical noise since we were near the elevators but there was not!  The only problem we had in the room was one of the lightbulbs in a lamp wasn't working! The gentleman that brought up our luggage called for it to be taken care of and someone from maintenance came right away!  The bed was immaculately clean and very comfortable!  In fact, the room itself was nicely furnished and very nice!

Do be warned, you do not want to move anything on the minibar or in the refrigerator! You're better off having a little cooler of your own to store your refreshments, as we did!  You can request a mini frig but you will be charged for it! Everything is weight censored and your room will be charged for these high priced items should you move them!  Save yourself some money and pick up your goodies at any supermarket! 

I can't review any of the restaurants other than the Aria Cafe as we grabbed a bite to eat there before we headed to our room!! It was very busy but we were seated and served quickly!!  The food was quite tasty!  Staff was friendly!

This hotel is very beautiful and quite pricey!  It's setup is such that you really don't have to leave for anything!! You have beautiful pools, fitness center, spa, restaurants, nightclubs, lots of high end shopping and of course the casino!!  I don't know how the air has been filtered in the casino area but the smell of smoke is fairly minimal!!

We went to check out on Sunday about 11:45 a.m. and of course the lobby was busy but there was no confusion or long waits!! Signage pointed you a line if you were checking in or out!! There was plenty staff on hand to handle guests and it moved very quickly.  There are greeters and\/or hostesses to assist you and make sure you are being cared for!! Very nice touch!!! We only waited 4-5 mins max to check out!

Oh, just a quick note!! I suggest valet parking due to there's a little walk from self parking to the hotel lobby!  Valet does get busy but they're pretty efficient for the most part!

Overall, I would say give Aria a try!! You won't regret it!  We had friends staying at the Cosmopolitan and they loved it!  Perhaps we'll try there the next time we decide to splurge but I would definitely return to Aria!!!!!! It was a wonderful experience!!",0,0,0

Refer to my pics.  I  called for the Executive Manager of Housekeeping, who arrived with two other staff members.  It took no fewer than seven phone calls because apparently there was also a technical difficulty with my telephone.  Read:  my phone was busted.  

Upon their arrival, I showed them the disaster zone and  they agreed that the wet bar was filthy and in a whispered conference in the bedroom made the decision to change my room.  

Brilliant.  

I then had to wait around for Bell Service to transfer my luggage (and by now, the germaphobia and revulsion for the state of my room was joined by frust-arvation).  

Housekeeping professionals tsk-tsked and continued their hushed conference in the bedroom area, while I paced.  They advised that had I any further concerns, I should contact Casino Services.  Which I did.

FD:  ""Front Desk, how may I be of service?""
KD:  ""Hi.  I have to change rooms because of unsanitary conditions and I would like to know what your protocol is to accommodate guests for the inconvenience.""
FD:  ""We change you to another room.""
KD:  ""Okaaay... My particular situation was extreme, and I'm just following up as Housekeeping suggested-""
FD:  ""Ma'am, are you looking for compensation?""
KD:  ""What?""
FD:  ""I can offer you a $50 food credit.""
KD:  ""Uh, I'm pretty sure there was more than $50 worth of food scattered about my wet bar when I checked in.  If this is how you keep the rooms, where I can see everything, what makes you think I want to eat in your restaurants?""
FD:  ""Ma'am, I can give you the $50 food credit, take it or leave it.""
KD:  ""Alrighteee, then.  Thanks.""

I did speak to Ms. Shum, Assistant Front Desk Manager who was attentive, gracious, and glanced at the pictures I'd taken before settling on a more appropriate gesture for the inconvenience caused by the negligent Housekeeping Staff.

She gave me her card and was rather professional about the incident.

I continue to have requests to engineering get ""lost in the ether"" for an hour... my follow up call resulted in me holding in excess of five minutes and then being asked to hold again.  I told the Front Desk Rep that 90 seconds is the ceiling in a Hospitality Setting where you can respectfully ask for your guest to wait.  Beyond that, you get back on the line, inform them that you will track down the answer and contact them.  

I'm stranded on Incompetence Island in a 950 sqft Suite of Despair.

We go to Vegas often and Aria is definitely the most up to date with their gadgets. It's pretty neat how you can control almost every single thing in your room (maybe they'll add in an remote-controlled flush someday) from the curtains to the lights, tv, room temperature, and you can even put everything on timer or have it wake you up at a certain time by opening all the lights, the curtains, and turning the tv on at max. volume. And room service doesn't knock on your door, they call you to tell you they're outside your door which you makes you feel 10000x worst if you don't provide a tip. They also had the MOST comfortable bed (they sell it too! from the pillows to the mattress!) 

The only thing I didn't like was the layout of every floor. If I was being chased by a serial killer in one of the floors, there is no doubt I'll survive because the serial killer could easily get lost!

With that said, I will not stay at Aria next trip and will go across the street to the Cosmopolitan.

Also, by all means AVOID the Buffet at Aria. We unfortunately ran out of time on the days we were last in Vegas and missed the Bellagio buffet and reluctantly had to go to the overpriced Aria buffet.

The first thing that struck me was how comfortable the bed and pillows were. It is the most comfortable bed I have slept in away from home. 

Staying at this hotel was a treat, with the one-touch control room features, although it did take a little while to figure out, it was cool to control the entire room from your bed if you wanted. It even smelled great, probably something in the room filter, but I enjoyed it. 

I felt very comfortable. The staff was extremely friendly, a good sign that they are being treated well. We were greeted often, which made me feel welcome in the hotel. 

I loved the sizable HD television, the available channel selection, the clean, sleek, classy look of the room, and the convenient console to plug in electronic devices. 

I liked the way the bathtub and the shower are positioned together in the same room, but separate.

I loved their Cirque Elvis show. Lots of fun! Amazing, soft love seats, and the performance was true to the Cirque du Soleil style. It captured the essence of Elvis and Las Vegas. 

I also enjoyed their relaxing spas down at the pool area. There are a few, and they are nicely positioned to give you the feeling of privacy, away from the larger pool area. Staff was also very friendly and helpful in this area as well. 

Awesome location on the strip! Plus they have a tram service that runs to Bellagio, Vdara, and Monte Carlo.  

The only criticisms I have are:
1. That the one-touch controller was a little intimidating and not always responsive, however, most things controlled by the one-touch pad also have an alternate button elsewhere in the room that can be controlled.  

2. That you are forced to walk through the casino gaming floor to get to your room elevator (although for business reasons, I get why)...it just takes a long time to get from the parking garage to your room elevator, as with many casinos. 

3. I loved the jean philippe patisserie in the Bellagio, but when I tried it here, the service did not match with the rest of the hotel, the red velvet cupcake I ordered, the server smashed and then pretended it didn't happen, shoving it in the box-so I was a little disappointed. 

If you decide to go, I hope your experience with the hotel was as good as mine. I will definitely be returning.

When I was talking to the cab drivers, they mentioned that they also had heard the same complaint about Aria from multiple travelers.

Aria is by far the worse place I have stayed when I look at my list. The service is absolutely terrible. We got there and we waited for an 1 hr to check in. When we finally go to the receptionist, we were promised 2 double beds and the hotel then decided to let us know that they don't have any rooms with doubles left. Simple requests were just completely ignored by the staff. Once we got to the room, we asked for luggage to be sent up and 1.5 hrs later the luggage finally came to our room. When we went to eat at the local restaurant in the hotel, elements (i think), the waiter was just plain rude. For example, one of us asked for more ranch dressing and he pointed to the fact that I had some dressing for my salad and that my friend should just use that. What kind of waiter does that - the waiter's name was Angel.

Anyways, we ordered room service and the food showed up 2 hrs later. I don't understand how food can show up that late and then once again we had issues at checkout where the hotel tried nickel and diming us.

The rooms are very modern and sleek. They are smaller rooms compared to the Venetian or Palazzo, but I love the furnishings, especially that comfy bed so I would much rather stay at the Aria.

We had a Aria Suite on the 54th Floor with a view over the pool looking towards Red Rock Canyon.  The layout, size, decor and technology in the suite was awesome.  Lots of automated lights and curtains for the floor to ceiling glass.  The bathroom was easily the nicest bathroom I have had in a hotel room.

The restaurants in the hotel that we tried (bar Masa, American Fish, and Javier's) were all excellent (I highly recommend the happy hour bar menu at American Fish).

The casino is a little cramped, but I never had a problem finding a table to play blackjack at, so it wasn't an issue.

We spent two days by the pools, which are very cool, quiet and laid out nicely.  No complaints there.

Here's where we get to the fatal flaw with this hotel, and why I almost certainly will never stay here again.  Service.  Like I said, we stayed at Sky Suites, which is like a hotel within the hotel.  It has a private driveway, private check-in, and private bars and elevator access.  You have a personal concierge, so the expectation is that you are paying for access and impeccable service.  Unfotunately, none of that is delivered.

I booked dinner and brunch and car transport reservations a month in advance on the phone with the concierge to ensure all was perfect (anniversary trip).

Upon arrival at McCarran, our driver that was supposed to meet us was nowhere to be found.  After three calls to the concierge, who each time swore he was right there, we finally met up with the driver, who proceeded to grunt at us, not offer to take our bags and trudged like a 10 minute walk to where he was parked.

At check-in, the bellman took our bags and disappeared, not giving us a claim ticket, so our bags were AWOL for an hour and a half, requiring two calls to the desk to get our bags so we could changed to go out.

I had ordered flowers and champagne to be in the room at check-in for my wife, they were there, they were beautiful, and the card was made out to me; not my wife...

I had made specific reservations with the concierge to have brunch at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris and I wanted a outdoor table guaranteed.  I was told; done; taken care of.  When we got to our reservation; no reserved table outside.

During the stay, every place in the hotel felt understaffed.  Long lines at everything.  Two days by the pool for several hours each day, and we not once could get a cocktail waitress when we needed one, instead needing to get up to go the bar every time.

Lastly, and to me, most annoyingly was our experience at the end.  We reserved the car to take us to the airport.  We make a point to get In and Out Burger drive through on our way to the airport when we go to Vegas.  It's literally 1\/4 mile from Aria and on the way to the airport.  The transport captain refused to let the driver stop, and told me the only way he'd approve it is if I had a casino host approve it.

Flawless service and politeness the whole entire time! We had a room service for a pot of coffee every morning and the ladies were very personable.These gestures made my days. :)

The gym. We used this facility on Saturday and Sunday mornings. My tip: Do not go after 0900 or your wait time for a treadmill will be longer. When we went before 0800,it was just perfect. It is super clean with new machines,water and fresh white towels were offered at the check in counter. Right in front of the gym is a fireplace with cozy sofas. Btw,people clean up the machines after each use. Thumbs up!

Aria is huge so prepare to walk if you wanted to discover and tour the area. We have seen most of the amenities and shopping area and the long walks could be very exhausting especially when you're on your 4"" stiletto heels. There is also a tram so hotel hopping experience will be less tiring.

It is centrally located and neighbors the Crystals complex and the Monte Carlo. There is also an inter-casino tram that you can take from the Bellagio and Vdara to get here.

It is a bit like the Cosmopolitan in that it is very modern and cityesque. Though it is not as edgy. It seems to be in competition with the big casinos, though there is a youthness about this hotel\/casino.

The casino floor is large, though not as crowded as a place like MGM. They have a great mix of innovative restaurants here. They are upscale, but they don't seem stodgy. I think it is good when a casino can attract visitors who are staying elsewhere.

The Aria is worth visiting just to see how it compares to the veteran casinos on the Strip.",3,0,4

Clean, big, and beautiful--that's how I'd describe it.  There's lots of places to eat and gamble.  They even have an area just for Michael Jackson games.  Do make sure you have money a plenty as food alone will kill your wallet.

I was surprised how much space was used to market Zarkana--a whole store?  Exit through the gift shop, oh yes!

In full disclosure, I was at the Aria for a conference and spent a lot of time walking through the building and when I say ""walking"", you really need to be wearing your walking shoes.

Aria is one of the newer hotels on the strip. It is very modern looking, contains a casino and a bunch of restaurants and it is clean. Their pool area is pretty spacious, I believe they had a total of 3 full sized pools with a jacuzzi. One of the pools has an area where it is very shallow and it slightly deepens so you can lay and have half your body in the water and relax. It's also good for kids cause the water doesn't get too deep. 

The rooms are very modern and classy. We stayed in the deluxe room with a strip view. If you've been to aria is it a little pulled back off the strip however you still get a pretty view of the strip at night with all the beautiful lights. What I liked most about the hotel is how you have all your controls through a little tablet. It controls the blackout curtains, all the lights, the TV, the radio, and you can even order room service. I think I had too much fun with it. 

Service was good. We had priority check in so we didn't have to wait in line for anything which was very convenient. All the hotels in Vegas charge for parking now (which sucks cause it all used to be free). At this hotel it is $15\/night for guests and the parking runs out at 11:59pm the day you check out. Which is pretty cool because you could hang around even after you check out of your hotel. Your parking pass is also valid at other MGM resorts as well. 

I don't know if this is standard at all hotels in Vegas but I would say one negative thing about this hotel is that they charge for multiple fees. You get a resort fee, hotel tax which is about 13%, and you even get taxed on your resort fee. So when we thought our hotel room was 184 at night it really came out to about 250 with all the fees which is such a big difference.",2,0,0

After a stop at the concierge to make dinner reservations, I headed up to my room. Now, let me say that the hallways are lovely...modern, dark, mysterious, but MY GOD, I think there is only one bank of elevators and the walk to your room could potentially be a LONG one (as mine was). You're walking and walking and walking along a curved hallway that at times branches off in one direction or another. It took me a good while to figure out and get to my room. That being said, once I unlocked my door and stepped inside, I was very pleasantly surprised. The curtains (that had been drawn) automatically opened, revealing a floor-to-ceiling window with a pretty decent view of the Cosmopolitan hotel & rooftop, some of the strip to the right and a mountain view to the left.  The bed was comfortable and the room tastefully decorated. The bathroom was nice but I love to take a bubble bath and the bath was enclosed in the shower stall. Very roomy but it felt weird. And no TV in the bathroom either (not a big deal, but something I've come to expect in hotels nowadays). The double sinks are nice (if you are rooming with someone) but as a single, I found that there was not enough counter room for all my stuff.

The three times I went to the check in\/check out desk, the employees who helped me were very nice. Deborah, Victor, and Fias (I don't think I'm spelling it right; I'm sorry I might not have seen the name tag right!) at the front desk were all very friendly!

The Aria is beautiful! I was supposed to get a room with a king-sized bed but they asked if I would be okay with one with two queens so I opted for that. No big deal, I wasn't paying for it anyway. Also, I asked if there was a view and Deborah said there was a mountain range view. Hint: This basically means the view of the other side that's not facing the Strip. I had a view of the Vdara and freeway but lots of city lights to look at. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my room. The curtains and lights took some getting used to but it didn't take long to get used to that nice tub paired with a robe!! It took me forever to find the safe which is in one of the nightstand drawers and I was bummed I couldn't use the fridge to put one water bottle in. I wasn't going to request a whole mini fridge just to cool down one bottle of water. I also walked around the pool area and there are plenty of places to sit.

Anyway, if you stay here with a conference in the Promenade\/2nd floor like I did, prepare yourself for the long walks back and forth to\/from the elevators. Actually, anywhere to the elevators besides the casino starts feeling far away. Front desk to elevators, business center\/conference rooms to elevators. At least the pool isn't too bad of a walk.

We had to take an elevator to a long walkway, down an escalator, through the casino, walk past all of the restaurants and slot machines, make a few turns and then we finally got to the check in desk. This was especially rough since we drove into town late and were running late to see a show.

Other than that the place is amazing! When we walked yet another 50 miles from the guest elevators to our room, the lights automatically turned on and the automatic shades opened to reveal a great view of the hotels on the left and the mountains on the right. This made for a great ""TA-DA!"" moment. We dropped our bags and then speed walked back to the car to drive to our show.

When we returned after the show and dinner, we took our time to walk through the lobby and casino and got back to our room at a more leisurely pace.

The full story: My husband and I went to Aria for his birthday weekend. We chose Aria because it was one of the top rated new hotels. The interior of the hotel itself was very modern, which was the one thing that we actually liked. We did have fun at club Haze on our first night (Thursday). The next day, we decided to order room service. The room service menu seemed like they had very upscale items, and since it was my husband's birthday weekend, we decided to splurge... BAD DECISION! He ended up getting steak and eggs and I got the Gruyère cheese and ham omelet. Our bill was around $90 so you would think that it would be very high quality food.  We felt fine most of the day but never ended up getting an appetite at all, which is odd for us because we love to eat. We had two shows that we purchased tickets for that night, and were extremely excited about them, since I had never been to a Vegas show. After walking the strip we returned to our room to get ready for the shows...  That is when I started to feel excruciating stomach pain. I kept trying to pull through because it was my husband's birthday weekend, and we had the two shows to go to that we had already paid for. The pain only got worse and I couldn't even leave the bathroom. I finally pushed myself get out of there and attempt to go to the show, but as we were walking down the hallway I had to run back to the bathroom. That is when my husband started feeling the pain in his stomach. We both took turns back and forth in the bathroom. He could not stop throwing up and I was lying on the bathroom floor with the worst stomach pain I had ever had. I can't begin to describe how upset I was because it was obviously food poisoning from the room service we had earlier that day. We narrowed it down to being the eggs or orange juice since those was the items we had in common. I called the front desk and asked to speak to the Manager. She, of course, apologized and said that they needed to send security up to have us fill out some paper work. I explained to them the whole situation. After completing the paperwork and writing our statements you would think they would have removed our room service bill and given us some other type of comp (missed over $400 in shows), but nope they did not offer to do anything. I called the front desk again and was pretty livid so they finally removed the room service bill. It amazes me that a new hotel with high ratings wouldn't be more accommodating to guests that were poisoned by their food. The rest of our trip we felt ill and didn't eat much because our stomachs still hurt from all of the sickness and throwing up.  Needless to say, our Vegas trip was a bust. We spent most of our time in the room trying to get better with drunks screaming in the hallway until almost 7am.  Our time at Aria was a HORRIBLE experience. We will NEVER go back! Our last day in Vegas we stayed at the Mandarin hotel which was amazing, but again we were still recovering from our food poisoning, so we were stuck in the room.",5,2,1

Aria offers the smallest rooms for the 5 star price, but I already knew what I was getting into.

Vegas was relatively empty right up until Thanksgiving Day, which was kind of nice. (The cab drivers however will tell you otherwise.)

Every employee at the Aria seemed as if they were going out of their way to be courteous. And the Concierge was great when I wanted a floral display to surprise my girlfriend, suggesting a rose petal arrangement. And I was in awe when it didn't cost me an arm & a leg. The Aria is a bit pricier when it comes to their restaurants & casual eateries, but that's to be expected. For those on a budget, I would still suggest staying at the Aria & getting food elsewhere. Next door the Monte Carlo has a food court & more modestly priced casual dining. The Buffet was closed when I went, but I've eaten there before & I hope the renovations mean it's only getting better, because it was pretty good when I went in 2010.

We stayed in a king room on the 22nd floor. Not the greatest view as we faced west away from the strip (and towards the Vdara & I-15). But the truth is when you're in Vegas how much time are you sitting in your room anyway. The room is very modern, with plugs to just about every type of electronic device you may have. There's also a bedside tablet that controls lighting, the TV, the blinds in the room, alarms, etc.

Housekeeping was amazingly accommodating, always asking us exactly what we wanted switched out, leaving extra pillows without us asking (I assure you was going to ask), and even organizing our toiletries.

What the Aria does is create an atmosphere of an entire staff being on the same page trying to create a unique & memorable experience while in Vegas. At least more so than any other hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. It is a little pricier than some of the other hotels on the strip, but it's absolutely worth it. If you can get a deal on the rooms, I highly recommend the Aria.

I've stayed at cheaper hotels on the strip for a long time now and I've been wanting to stay at a really nice place like Aria so when M Life emailed me a couple months ago of an upcoming stay with free play and free food I wanted to experience this place for myself.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the complimentary nights that were offered since I requested a room with 2 beds and the week I wanted to go to was fully booked so my offer was $99 a night which is still a great deal compared to other resorts.

When I went to check in on 10\/11, a woman named Astid I believe or Astrid (I apologize if I didn't spell it right) helped me check in and told me all the things they had to offer. She then asks me if I brought my parking ticket to which I said no because I didn't think much of it until I leave and go pay at the machine. She tells me no worries and then adds the parking fee to my room.

After thanking her and proceeding to my room as soon as I opened the door all the lights turned on, the curtains opened automatically and the TV went on as well. Very surprised at this feature but very nice at the same time. I saw the control tablet by the bed and saw it had everything this hotel has to offer listed. You can change the temperature of the room, dim the lights in the room and bathroom, order room service, look at the menus of all their restaurants and much more.

They have a mini fridge but I noticed the drinks weren't cold at all so the fridge in my room might've been broken. They also had a snack bar setup but I already knew about the sensors if you pick it up so I never bothered with any of those. It would've been nice if there was an empty mini fridge provided so you can chill your own drinks but we had a cooler with us.

I had a minor issue with the thermostat. I wanted it to be more cooler so I was lowering the temperature and had the fan speed on the highest setting but it didn't feel pleasant at all. It wasn't hot inside the room but it was to the point where it was barely cool.

The bathroom itself was ok. The shower and hot tub are connected to the same door so it's the showerhead first then the tub is behind it. Kind of a strange setting if you ask me. I got to use the tub once but it was kinda small for me. The toilet has a separate door as well but they have a see through wall so it's not much privacy if you have others staying with you. Double sinks are provided so that was a nice thing.

My room view wasn't spectacular since it wasn't the view of the strip but it wasn't that bad either. We could see several hotels along with planes taking off from McCarrin airport. I was glad in a way we didn't get the noisy side since that would've made our stay less desirable. I had that issue with the Paris hotel last year.

I did notice that this hotel does not have a coffee maker here. I wonder why that is and who's idea it was to not implement this. Not a good move.

Casino aspect this place is huge. Lots of games to play. I'm a slot player so I never bothered with the table games although it would be fun too. I loved the wide variety of slots this place has but I noticed one slot company this place doesn't have are slots from Multimedia Games. Other casinos had a few of them but I'm not knocking on this place for that. I would've loved to see some more WMS slots that have the 2 progressives on top. I was sad this place removed the Monopoly Bonus City slots since I've watched them on YouTube and couldn't find it at other casinos. One slot I noticed they have a ton of are those Asian themed ones like 88 Fortunes, Fu Dao Le where the max bet is $8.88.

Check out was quick and painless. I don't remember her name but she was tall, blond and had an English accent. She helped me prevent getting double charged for parking since I was gonna pay at the machine and she said it was already added to my room charge so there was no need. She was very professional and I loved the conversation with her.

Overall I did enjoy my stay here. Much more than my past trips to Vegas. Unfortunately I didn't win big but I got to play a lot of the latest games so I left satisified. I would stay at this place again for sure.",0,0,1

From the automatic curtains, heater, TV, lights, everything is controlled by a remote, welcome to the future. The bathrooms are very clean and nice, with huge glass doors, and a tub next to the shower, and two sinks. Dont bother ordering room service on a busy day, it takes up to an hour to get service. Getting to the rooms can be a little confusing, they have 4 separate elevator sections with each section taking you up to certain floors. Walls are a little thin, because sometimes you can hear noises through the walls.

I got a 100 credit for staying 3 nights, which is pretty nice. They have a really good dessert cafe, and crepes\/sorbet is a must try. We also watching Zarkana cirque du soleil, featuring all the acrobatic performances, from juggling, to cage walking, walking on ropes, etc. Its very easy to get lost in here.

Aria is still overall a gem, in my opinion. Self parking is relatively easy (for now), and the many dining\/drinking options are top notch. The updated casino bars still look brand new! They have quite the cocktail program, and I had a very good orange something cocktail at Alibi lounge shortly after it opened.

I don't think any good can come out of staying in Vegas more than 2 nights, but I was actually sad to say ta ta to Aria and Sin City after the long weekend.

Like most hotels on the strip Aria is HUGE. When I FINALLY made it up to my room I was exhausted, but one look my clean, modern surroundings put a big smile on my face. I especially liked the blackout curtains and admit to pressing the button about 80 times.

I visited the uh-mazing gym a few times as well and wish I had more time (and $) to indulge in a spa day. There's lot of food options throughout the hotel. Chill (located near the gym) makes a mean iced latte and I enjoyed a tasty breakfast at Cafe Vettro. My husband and I were going to check out the sushi restaurant, but opted to go elsewhere after checking out the menu and realizing we'd be spending a month's worth of diapers (sorry Baby R) on just a few sushi rolls.

While I was in Las Vegas for work I did get a few hours of glorious downtime at the pool the last day. It was super packed, but we did manage to find some lounge chairs together. The pool waitress assigned to our area had a bit of 'tude and told us she didn't have time to take our order so we picked up some chicken ceasar wraps at the pool instead.

When he got out he was saying how much power the had. She just drove it off, but when she  looked at the gauges after driving off, she noticed the traction control had been turned off by the valet. That piece of crap was racing the car in the garage. The only reason to turn off the traction control would be to spin the tires. The only way to turn it off is manually. It cannot be done by accident. What an idiot, first to abuse a car that is not yours and then to forget to get rid of the evidence.

When we asked the surly woman at checkout why a $20 per day ""resort fee"" had been added to our bill, she replied ""all guests pay it"".  Oh really? Why don't you disclose that fee at check-in?

Later on, I did find a slip of paper inside the original envelope, saying the fee would be added, but not how much it was. Why isn't that simply added to the room fee?  Sleazy.

The inside of the hotel is nice enough, until they force you to walk through the smoke filled casino just to get to the elevators. Ouch!  We stayed on the 50th floor in a nice sized room, but their approach is ""low light"", which is ok except two of the lightbulbs didn't work, so we should have brought our own flashlight.

Nice bathroom, but layout a bit odd with the bathtub behind the shower.  Have never seen that before. 

Best feature are the floor to ceiling windows, which offer a great view of the mountains.  The sight of the sun hitting the mountains at dawn, is one of the best things about Vegas.

After we checked out we stopped for a drink at the sports bar, where a surly bartender named Tyrone, reluctantly gave us two drinks. I thanked him but he said nothing. Drinks tasted watered down. I gave him a respectable tip and he just stared into space. Hello??

My negative review is largely because we stayed at the Cosmopolitan last year, which was much better. The hotel staff were much friendlier, the hotel is clearly the top property in LV - a step above the Aria - and they did not slip in a slimy resort fee..

Finally, the Mlife rewards program is really poor compared to the Cosmopolitan's.  The Cosmo welcomed us back with weekend brunch at the Wicked Spoon, including unlimited Bellinis\/Bloody Marys.

Pros:
- Luxurious, high-tech rooms
- Gorgeous view (depending on your room; we were on the 53rd floor)
- Great location in the middle of the Strip
- Great restaurants on the casino floor
- Plenty of super-fast elevators organized by floor (never wait more than 15 seconds for one)
- Tons of free parking available even during busiest times (unlike, say, Caesars)
- Well-insulated quiet rooms, we barely heard our neighbors anytime during our stay
- Prompt housekeeping service

Cons:
- Huge line for check-in (fortunately we were in the invited guest list, but the regular check-in line was ridiculous, especially since nearby Cosmopolitan and Vdara had almost no line)
- Calling the front desk from your room or cell puts you on hold for a long time
- Long, inefficient walk to ANYWHERE, even adjacent properties like Cosmopolitan and Monte Carlo
- We got a wake-up call at 6 AM when we most certainly did not ask for one
- In-room TVs could be better",0,0,1

Aria is indeed a 3.5 star establishment.  I look at it as an overall positive experience, so I rounded up.  It's clean, modern, sleek, but not sterile.  I would consider staying here again given a good rate.

Keeping it to the point with a list:

-- Love the smell.  No nasty cigarette odor here.
-- For the quality of room, I got a steal at $400 for two nights in a King Suite and two tickets to a Cirque show.  Late check out was added to my package for no additional cost.
-- Super fast North Valet.  North Valet is close to guest elevators but far from main desk.
-- Super fast check in.  In and out in less than a few minutes.
-- Complimentary wifi (decent speed).
-- Rooms are excellent.  Furniture is modern, colors are warm, layout is classy.  Down feather bed with smooth cotton sheeting.  Equipped with numerous ""one touch"" light settings, and automatic black out drapes.  

-- Didn't think of everything though.  No iPod hook up.  Must use their TV for music and movies.  Sorta lame.
-- As others have stated, extra tall shower and oval Roman tub share their own ""mega stall"" behind glass doors.  The tub is just for soaking, no jets.  So sort of useless.  I'm too short and couldn't adjust the showerhead.  o_O
-- Bath products are subpar at best.  Robes are thin.  No slippers.
-- Location is off the Strip.  Don't be fooled.  Yes, it's about 20 min just to get to the Cosmopolitan.  It's 10 minutes by tram plus a 5 min walk to get to the Bellagio.  And it's 25 minutes to get to the Paris. I don't mind the walk, but don't want people to think this location is ""convenient"" and close to anything.  It's not.
-- Charges a resort fee of $25 a night + 12% tax on check out.

__________

-- Pools are spacious, non crowded, and clean.  Favorite: 32 oz dragonberry mojito.
-- View Bar.  The best drinks I had in Vegas.  The signature cocktails are delicious.  Locals ask for Manny.  ""Best bartender in Vegas"" apparently.
-- Jean Phillippe Patisserie is a chain that's scattered around other Vegas hotels.  Nothing special.  No macarons, lame.  Except the large $4 raspberry macaron sandwich.  Yumyum.",4,1,0

Its City Center location is really convenient. I know that everyone has their own favorite area of the strip and this resort is in one of our favorite sections. Additionally, there are trams that will take you in either direction, which is very welcome.

The casino at the Aria is pretty good. Much better than a lot of others. It does not smell heavily of smoke, which I really appreciate.

In terms of food, I have only been to the SkyBox for lunch and that was okay, nothing special, but it was a relatively cheap meal. We've been meaning to try their other eateries and the patisserie, but we always end up eating elsewhere.",1,0,0

We basicly just followed the throng through the casino till we found some video poker to slide into. I actually did alright but both of them lost. That was the good part. Now the bad. 
    We have been staying all week long at the Pallazo but thought it would be exciting to spend the first ever night in a new place, so we booked the last night in town here. Got here around 9am to check in and found out our reservation had been booked with a card that we had voided, so it took a half- hour combined brainpower of the receptionest and manager to figure it out. Also some computer glitches weren't helping, but finally got it squared away. So when we got to the door and swung it open, I was prepared to be floored, but was underwhelmed. Room not that big; dirty windows for a new place; soiled carpets from construction, I believe. Safe is in nightstand, but was covered withdust. Also dust on shelves. Went to check out the flat panel TV and it does not work at all. It is hooked to the Controll4 unit, butcould'nt make it work, even pushing buttons on side of TV itself. Two of the lights worked backward with control4. Looked for guest info in guest services binders, but they were empty. Also no stationary in desk drawer. Shower looks kinda cool, with tub and shower seperate but in same stall. Haven't showered yet with their low flow nozzle so hope I canrinse shampoo out of my hair. Also it is suppose to be a "" smart"" room key that remembers your temp, light settings, etc whenever you return to your room, even if it is months away. 
    All in all, palazzo is much nicer ( and cheaper- we were comped there, $300 here) and as a previous reviewer said, they weren't quite ready to open",3,0,0

The BAD:
Parking. I understand that this hotel was probably trying to cater to the handicapped and I have nothing against them, but when every other parking space is blocked off and you have to keep climbing higher and higher into the lot to get parking, it really gets annoying! 

Lack of Staff training. The staff was very attentive and friendly, but I'm sorry to say that from our very first experience with check-in, we had every staff screw up. Front desk over charged our credit card without approval, we had to go through hoops to get our $75 voucher, was completely ignored when we requested pool service, and the bell peppers on our pizza tasted like it had never been washed (i could taste bits of soil!). 

The GOOD:
Modern design, spacious rooms with beautiful views, very technological! From the moment we stepped in, we were welcomed by automated curtains and a beautiful view of the city. A quick tour of the room quickly showed us that almost everything in the room was automated by a quick touch of a button. The panel below the tv and next to the desk had all the input\/output that you could possibly need for your entertainment needs including an audio input for your iPod or mp3 player.

The bathroom was very spacious. We had his and her sinks and a separate shower stall next to a jacuzzi enclosed by glass doors.

Overall, for the amount of money we paid ($129\/night with a $75 credit voucher), we were very satisfied with our stay. Sure, there were hiccups with staff and parking was terrible, but we understand that the hotel just opened up and is probably still trying to get situated. Also, we appreciate that the staff was really trying to make every effort to make our stay as nice and convenient as possible.",1,1,0

 All the good first.  My wife and I were invited out for 4 night stay at the Aria by Xavier a Casino Host for Aria. They will offer a few days at a comp rate and you must gamble daily earning comps that cover the gift of a room, dining and spa use. If you are an established i.e. Rated player, they will offer rooms, food and casino cash no strings attached. They are taking all the risks up front that you will fly out stay and gamble as in the past. We had a Tower Suite with city view not strip view. I'll start by saying this tower suite is an amazing room~ A+. The city view (B) is not as good as strip view (A+). Xavier our casino host suggested the Tower Deluxe room with strip view which was less expensive and would allow him to cover more food and spa expenses but I just had to try the Tower suite. Before departing on 15th we checked out the Deluxe room and he was right, we could have saved 1\/2 off room rate. Our next visit I would now request the deluxe room King bed strip view. Every Room and entire hotel are beautiful, A+++. Food throughout hotel is amazing, definitely geared for a higher level experience which we enjoy. I've enjoyed multiple stays with Bellagio, Paris, MGM, Borgata Atlantic City, Atlantis Bahamas. Aria is a true 5 star experience. The Spa in Aria hotel was A+++. The Pool is also amazing, palm trees, plenty of seating, individual hidden private pools peppered about.  The shopping next to Aria is the best in Vegas, Crystals is connected and has every store.
 The Bad- casino table staff were hit and miss during stay. I did meet and have many good conversations at gaming tables. Those in hospitality know it only takes one bad experience to over shadow 10 great moments. I have always thought Gaming Table Supervisors tend to be sloppy keeping track of active play for comps everywhere. Players Clubs, Hosts, mLife, Total Rewards. will all tell you that slots generate more comps, but more losses also. This is why being rated correctly at tables is so important. I had an experience that would force me to look at being rated correctly and accurately at table games. After someone being rude and lying I was forced to  compare electronic versions of craps roulette and black jack to live table versions.  Times are changing and other options with better service are becoming available. Live table staff tend to enforce rules at times,  ignore the same rules other times which is not ever a good thing, (this was my experience).  I questioned a floor staff about rule fluctuation and I was immediately attacked with rude behavior. I was instructed about a rule, but then I questioned why enforce the rule now when  for days prior, 3 current shift changes of floor people, these same rules didn't apply. It was to late, staff and floor manager were trapped. Floor Supervisor became embarrassed and as most people do they became rude and deflect, even lie to protect a bad decision. He embarrassed himself and ruined an excellent experience at such a wonderful Hotel and Casino. What I will share with future gamblers is this... live table games are becoming obsolete due to new electronic versions. I recall 5 years ago speaking the same way in a  DVD rental store. They just can't believe Video Streaming would replace them. Refused how important good relations would effect a growing obsolescent business. No need mention those store names (Bb,Fv) because those stores went under being rude and charging late fees\/rewind fees, consumers fled to the future.  An electronic roulette or craps machine will track every dollar, every bet and every comp point. If you step away a spouse can make your bets. When you lay the big bets the electronic machine records every wager. All those $10-$20-$50 tips no longer need be made. That simple error by a shift change- table worker, supported by new shift Gaming Table Floor Manager did me a huge favor last night... opened my eyes again to why we shop online rent online and now game without the personnel interaction from rude misinformed workers.  When employees only act as employees good businesses suffer. The customer is always right and when your job is becoming obsolete I suggest you act that way right now. Funny how they figure out how true that is when it's to late.",4,0,0

I don't gamble, I'm not into clubs, I don't really go to shows, and although I love booze paying $15 for a drink makes me sad. So basically, Vegas should be pointless to me in theory. Although I can't compare it to other Strip hotels I liked Aria for my quick weekend trip. Aria doesn't have tigers, canals, volcanos, the Eiffel Tower, or ginormous water fountains like some of the other guys do, but, that's what cruising the Strip is for. Aria is just a straight up a modern and sleek place and it's not too far from all the over the top hotels that are fun to check out. 

I arrived on a Friday night around 11:30, after my flight was delayed for an hour (THANKS OBAMA! He was literally the reason why my flight was delayed as he was leaving where my flight originated from, so all air traffic was grounded for a 100 mile radius until he left). Although there was a line, check in was a breeze and I was on my way to my room within 10 minutes. I was only on the 8th floor, but, I still had a pretty decent partial view of the Strip and the mountains off in the distance. My room was clean, the floor I was on was quiet, the robes were soft, and the bed was super comfy with a mountain of pillows to nestle in. 

The only things I didn't like about my room was the crazy motion sensitive mini bar\/fridge. It detects when things are moved and will charge you for the item, meaning, you can't refrigerate any leftovers or snacks you brought on your own. I also disliked the terrible ironing board as mentioned by another reviewer. I spent 45 minutes attempting to iron my tea length bridesmaid dress, the built in iron holder was a huge pain in the ass to work around. 

Here are my tips:

Be sure to turn on the privacy light when you're in your room even if you think you'll be out of your room early. Housekeeping comes earlier! With my room being so blissfully quiet I was scared awake by them ringing my doorbell in the morning and it was definitely before 9 am. That was pretty much the only sound I heard in my room during my entire stay.

Aria is on a huge property that is part of the City Center. Expect for it to take a million years to get across the property. If you're lazy or easily disorientated, maybe stick to hanging out at the Lift Bar. It's right next to the guest elevator banks that go to the rooms. Lift Bar has a lounge singer, it's a prime spot for people watching and it's open 24 hours. Within the hotel there is a little convenience\/gift store that sells a variety of items. With that being said, there is a CVS outside the hotel which surprisingly has normal prices and is probably an equal walking distance away if you're leaving from your room. Go to CVS, buy several bottles of water that don't cost $8 each, you'll need them (the tap water tastes weird). 

Also, since it takes awhile to get around if you find it's 10:57 am and check out is 11:00 am you can conveniently check out using your phone. I did that so I could take advantage of the buffet voucher I had enabling me to enjoy brunch without worrying about making the check out time. This option was simple and I didn't experience any problems with it.",7,3,2

Aria is by far one of the best hotels I've stayed at on the strip. It's centrally located, easy to navigate, and the rooms are UHHHHHMAAAAAAZING. Honestly, if I was restricted to highlighting one thing I loved about our stay at Aria, it's the bathrooms in the rooms. Absolutely gorgeous. The shower\/tub combo steam room makes me want to blow my savings and remodel my bathroom in a similar fashion. What a genius idea--make every room a semi-suite, and every guest feels like a king or queen. 

My main inspiration for writing this review, was the customer service we had from every single employee that we encountered. EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE. And I don't just mean great customer service. I mean that every single person was genuinely happy, inspired, and stoked to be a part of Aria. Our questions were answered effortlessly, we received a free room upgrade on Super Bowl weekend, and the Concierge was particularly cheeky and friendly.

So fantastic. Don't even get me started on the Crystal shops. UGHHHH. Aria, you're the best. As soon as I find a sugar daddy, I'll be back. Meet me at the Sex and the City Slot machines and we'll make a night of it.

(Edit: my four stars instead of five stars is based on the experience I had with their business partners, the Light Group. Haze Nightclub should be ashamed of how they run their business and as a seasoned clubber, I was horrified at how this club is operated. But that's another review. I feel bad for the concierge that got my earful of a complaint the next morning.)",1,1,1

First of all, I have to comment on the parking at Aria. What a complete waste of space by having that huge gap between cars. It's so annoying, difficult finding parking because every gap you see, is not a parking spot.

Next, the layout of the casino IS very crowded with slot machines. The walkway is very small. You'd think they planned out the space very well, but they apprently didn't. Mandalay Bay is more spaced out than Aria. 

Getting around the CityCenter was a total mess. They are lacking signs & direction. & Those touch-screen directory maps are full of bacteria because people are busy touching it. Who knows what else they touched before touching that screen. Yuck! Just put a big huge map on the wall.

One good thing about Aria, is that it smelled good like perfume inside. it didn't smell like smoke at all & I wasn't coughing grasping for air. 

The rest is just BLAH. maybe it will be better in 2010.

I've been spoiled by this hotel, for future Vegas trips I'll be expecting rooms as nice as this one. 

This is one of the newer hotels in Vegas, situated near the Cosmopolitan and Mandarin Oriental hotels and Crystals shopping complex. It offers the 21st century equivalent of classy, different from the Bellagio. Check-in was hassle-free and straightforward. Upon going up to our rooms, the room was clean.

Stayed here twice on standard rooms. Instantly I was hooked on the touch panel on the center screen, which basically controlled everything except the bathroom (that would be kinda creepy if it did) and call room service. You could even review your bill and check out, which is one of the best perks about this place. 

Beds were very comfortable, with the exception of snoring I had a good two nights sleep. TV was in HD and contained most of the common channels, so I was able to catch a bit of my favorite show being aired. LOVED the overall design of the rooms, gives a new meaning to contemporary and classy, from the mirrors to the drawers. If you get a room of the view, the windows are big enough to peer down at the Strip below, especially with all the lights at night. 

Bathrooms were just simply GORGEOUS. Toilet and shower\/bath had its own compartments. Glass is opaque on both doors.

Service is pretty good. We had a wonderful housekeeper who brought us plenty of shampoo and shower gel, and still kept an upbeat attitude when we forgot to ask for towels initially and asked him again.",1,0,0

The ARIA Resort & Casino is a newly designed hotel, my first words to describe the hotel: massive. There is just so much real estate to cover with this latest ""super hotel"" on the Las Vegas Strip.

It felt high end when we checked into the hotel and was greeted by a cheerful person at the front desk. The hotel lobby is very large and open. Its just a beautiful and welcoming space, very impressive.

The casino was equally impressive, the slot machines are new and I love to see the video blackjack machines. Its a fun time playing these machines, If I wasn't with my wife on our 25th wedding anniversary, I'd be grinding it out for hours. 

The restaurants are all high end. From the new Jean Georges Steakhouse to Bobby's Burger Palace, there are restaurants available to everyone. I have a love - hate relationship with buffets, The Aria has an amazing buffet that was included with our stay. A separate review is coming, we loved the fresh cut prime rib for dinner and the breakfast was phenomenal. My all time favorite was the 24 hour Jean Philippe Patisserie. OMG! They have cold lattes on tap!! And the pastries are insane. Have I mentioned 24 hours??

Walking to our room, security checks to see you have a room key. It's kind of a hokey check system, I could have a key from last year and wave it to the security guard. They need to do a scan for active keys. Once we took the elevator to our room, it was amazing. We had an iPad that controlled the room. Want the drapes open? Use the iPad. Want the TV on? iPad. Mood lighting? iPad. Courtesy flush? Now you're being silly. From the high end sinks to the cool shower heads, it felt luxurious to clean up. We had a great view of the Las Vegas strip, this really was an unforgettable vacation stay.

Shopping is very convenient, The Crystal Shops are attached and walking distance, you're inside shopping, right from the hotel.

The biggest thing in Las Vegas, Uber! Uber rules the strip, they have a separate pick up location in the back of the hotel. The GPS had the pick up location at the hotel next door, I made sure I texted the driver I'm at the Aria. Google does not know all!

The pool, here's where I almost knocked off a star. The damn pool is 3 feet deep?? What the heck man, we're all adults. Another foot of water would of been refreshing. However, the hot tub was very large and relaxing. I had a beer from the bar and I was loungin' like a rock star.

My room was worth every penny.  I was in love as soon as I walked in.  I was on the 12th floor with a city view.  My room was quite, the bed was SOOO comfy.  The decor was modern and comfortable.  My favorite part was the shower.  It was huge with a bench inside.  I just sat in the hot water every and really relaxed.

I was at the Aria for a CPA conference.  The convention centers are beautiful.  Easily accessible.  The Aria provided us with healthy and well balanced meals.  For professional meet and greets this place is just great.  Lovely ambiance, it makes the clients feel very relaxed.  Great for business.  

 I had dinner at an amazing Asian restaurant inside of the Aria, it was called Lemongrass!  The food was incredible.  It was so good I went twice in 3 days!  I had  a hot duck dish and some curry.  It was so delicious.  Again very pricey.

I had coffee at a pastry shop.  It was delicious.  I love it, it was very strong.  I did not try any but the baked good were gorgeous.  They had a large selection of various pastries and cupcakes.  Very pretty.     

I did a small amount of gambling, but only with the money I found on the floor all over the casino.  I sincerely enjoyed every bit of the Aria.  Cant wait to go back.  I am next month.",1,1,3

Our friends were visiting from out of town and staying at Vdara.  So, when we got together for some cocktails we naturally picked Bar Moderno.

Getting to City Center is pretty easy, but the parking is atrocious!  Valet parking is easy to find, but self parking is tough.  You have to keep your eyes open for the sign when you first enter the City Center driveway for the Self Parking on the left lane....if you don't, you'll miss it and end up in Valet.

Then, once you get into the parking garage, you'll be frustrated because:

a) You don't own a hybrid, you can't park in the spaces closest to the elevators.....WTF?  Seriously?  1\/2 the spots are empty.

b) There's too much space between cars, enough for another car.....but it's striped off because according to City Center they wanted ""to give more room for people to get in and out of their cars"".....that much room?  Seems silly when you can't find a parking space!

c) If you have Verizon, the signal sucks in the parking garage and there are dead spots in the hotel.

Once you get into the hotel, you'll find navigating the property frustrating because signage is terrible.  We've been here 5 times, so we can navigate to most places fine, but our friends had difficulty finding the bar.

I wrote a separate review for Bar Moderno, so I won't get into any details for that.

Will I return to City Center?  Yes, but I won't give it any more than 3 Stars until they get some of their bugs fixed.",6,5,5

I love the decor and style of the hotel. They are really into textures and utilizing a variety of materials and everything is really spacious but it can be kind of confusing to walk around in. The cashier section is not really clearly directed to and I spent 15 minutes wandering before I was able to find it.

The room is average. Smaller than Palazzo but about the same size as MGM - however our room had a magnificent view since we had a corner room. It took forever to walk there from the elevator but it was worth it to have the view we had. The sofa was a L shaped one but it could fit about 4 and wasn't really comfy- not the best when you have friends relaxing there. It also had two bathrooms which was really nice. Also invite your friends over to try the toilet!!! haha... I know it is funny and might even sound weird but OMG... It is one of those special Japanese high tech ones that has a warmed seat, special jets to cleanse your front AND back, and a dryer to make sure you are nice and clean. I am definitely getting one of these in MY bathroom at home!

The pool was also really disappointing. We went to Liquid (the 21 and over pool party) and unless you know someone or are getting bottle service, be prepared to pay $50\/person. The pool area is also pretty small- bigger than Tao Beach but significantly smaller than Wet Republic and not even comparable to Encore Beach Club. My girls and I got in but there was barely anyone there on a Sunday afternoon so decided to chill at the regular pools. Aria has 3 separate pools and I saw one jacuzzi. The cabanas look like little outhouses or small changing rooms. You can have the privacy you want since there is a curtain that you can enclose your cabana with.

For all of its style, I prefer staying at Palazzo or Wynn and even though they have a few clubs there I don't think it can compare to XS or the Encore Beach Club",2,0,0

ROOM. Very spacey, nice with modern decor. We had a decent view of the Vdara and Cosmopolitan's burned down pool area from last week. Comfortable beds and soft pillows that were tucked tighter than a newborn swaddled baby after the housekeeping made our beds. Only thing I didn't not like was their towels were sooooo rough. Every time I washed my face, I felt like I was scratching my face. They do have a shower with a separate tub. As with most hotels, they have someone always standing in front to check room keys. 

LOCATION. Although nice and somewhat centered in the lively area of the strip, I hated the location. It seriously took forever to just walk from the hotel to the strip and even further to walk from the hotel to self parking. We stayed at the Cosmo last time and loved the fact that we can go from our room to the main strip in less than 2 minutes. With Aria, you're having to walk thru the entire casino floor, through the valet\/taxi area then down past the Crystal shops then to the front area where the strip is. 

POOL. Very nice  pool with lots of spacious areas that had lots of shade. They have 3 pools but one is reserved for SkyTower Suite members. They played pretty good music and wasn't overly crowded. Loved the fact that we can order food and relax by the pool. Their $7 portion for waffle fries were HUGE and drinks were strong!

They had other amenities like a gym and spa area that seemed to be utilized by many guests. They have the typical Starbucks downstairs and a 24 hour cafe which you can grab food if you're hungry at random hours of the night. They dont have a lot of restaurant or food options compared to many of the other hotels. I remember seeing maybe 4-5 restaurants in the hotel itself.  They do have a tram that takes you from the hotel to the Crystal Shops to the Bellagio. 

I would say for a couples trip hotel, I'd pick staying at the Cosmo over the Aria. As for large groups, Elara\/Hilton Grand Vacation Suites still holds #1. Nice hotel but I wasn't a fan of how much time we had to spend just walking to get to the front the street. We do enough walking in Vegas as it is but its seriously a journey. 

They do offer complimentary wifi but there are limitations of 10mgbs for 48 hours only. If you want to extend it or use it longer the it was like $49.99 more or something extremely ridiculous. 

On top of the subtotal, expect to pay a $29 resort fee plus some other $3.48 fee for each day you stay.",7,1,3

First, the place is absolutely gorgeous anywhere you can see it in Vegas. Inside you'll find a very modern looking hotel and casino. The place is quite spacious, clean and gives a refreshing taste as it is one of Vegas' newer hotels.

My favorite part of my stay here was how technologically advanced the hotel is. I walked into my room and it was an automated technological galore. All the lights turned on, my TV turned on and my blinds started to open. I was only on the the third floor, a ""lower end"" suite, so I know the higher you moved up the nicer the rooms and most likely the better the experience.

It's a different feel from all the other popular hotels in Vegas. You'll find a bit of a seasoned crowd with not too many young folks like me walking around. Apparently there is plenty to do here with nightclubs and shops. I just wish the Haze Club was open while I was here.

Every employee you come in contact with is very friendly, courteous and accommodating. I have yet to meet a rude staff member there from front desk, bell, valet, restaurant staff to housekeeping. 

Of note this trip, first week of July, were 2 of the chefs at the buffet. Chef Craig Heber and Chef Abel Ramirez. 

I have several difficult food allergies, and both chefs took time to walk me around and point out which foods I could safely eat. Chef Abel actually cooked some vegetables and roasted a potato for me specially as that day during brunch there was nothing else that I could safely eat. He then personally delivered the food to my table. 

This type of service is unheard of from a chef at a major hotel resort buffet. Anyone with food allergies who has difficulty finding safe meals to eat should seriously consider staying here and eating at the buffet. Just ask to speak to the chef on duty and they will accommodate your needs. 

Several other employees there were notably courteous and friendly but I wanted to specifically mention these two gentlemen. 

Also want to mention that the Fitness Center is outstanding. Very big. Had everything. Very nice gym for a hotel.

This is my second stay here and it's by far the only place I would want to stay in Vegas. The restaurants from sage to the pizza. It's an all in one hotel and casino, let me not forget about the buffet. Look for that in a review for a few tips me and my friend found out. When booking use orbitz or another online service because with the hotel we got free 2 buffets each day we was there. Another perk is valet parking if you rented a car or visiting by driving. Valet parking is what you tip the driver, but be respectful on the amount you tip and you can spend more time inside with worrying about a parking spot.

In reading these reviews, I agree with some, disagree with others.  So what can I say that is different?  Not much.  

If you are a fan of technology you will like this hotel.  If you are over 60, you will not.
If you like a limited view of the strip you will like it.  If you don't you won't.
If you understand that Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation, this place will be right up your alley.  If you expect staying on the cheap, you won't.

Everyone has their own preferences, that is what makes Las Vegas so special. Whatever you like, you will be able to find.  

We came to Las Vegas to celebrate my 50th Birthday.  I came with my partner and four of our friends.  I chose the Aria because the last time I was in town, it was still under construction and it looked like it was going to be a great place.  I liked it.  I didn't 'love' it, but I liked it.

I asked what the $25 'resort' fee was actually for and got some mumbo jumbo, but I really didn't care.  What I was a little confused about was the maid service.  I know they are trying to be 'green' and all, but seriously? I have to request that my room be made up each day?  And even then, they didn't do a very good job of making up the room.  They never even dusted.

BUT, the room was nice, the bed comfortable, and the chairs comfy.  We ate at Jean Georges one night and had breakfast in the Buffet one morning.  Both were wonderful.

The Aria is spacious and well apportioned.  However, if you are afraid of flying insects, you will NOT like the lobby.",1,0,1

1) Aria's website, facebook, etc. likes to promote that they're a Forbes 5-Star hotel.  That's true...sorta.  Apparently in Vegas the rating guides allow hotels to separate parts of their hotel.  The Aria separates their ""Sky Suites"" (the $$$ rooms) from the standard hotel rooms.  It's a little deceptive if you ask me.  That said, don't expect 5-Star service here if you're not shelling out the big bucks for a suite.  There's no turndown service, no use of your name, and really no personalized care at all.  The only person that ""helped"" us was the person who took my credit card and gave us a room key at check-in.

2) Check-in lines in Vegas are long, especially around the start of daily check-in time.  The Aria has a ""Mobile Check-in"" line that was empty when I was there, while the normal line was about a 30-45min wait.  There was a sign that said ""mobile check-in available"", however there were no instructions on how to do a mobile check-in, no information on their website, no information on any reservation\/confirmation emails, and nothing in the Aria mobile app.  I resorted to posting a question to Aria's Facebook page asking for details on the mobile check-in and my post was promptly deleted and never responded to.

3) Room service trays are left in the hallway forever.  Literally.  The day we checked in, one of our neighbors ordered room service, ate the food, and then the cart was placed in the hallway.  Two days later, we checked out and the cart was STILL in the hallway.

4) The mini bar is digitized with sensors that will bill you 60 seconds after you remove an item from the fridge, so no storing any of your personal items in there.  There's a note that says storing your items in the fridge will result in a $25\/day charge...not that it mattered much anyway because our fridge door wouldn't close.  It was open when we arrived, we couldn't close it, and everything was room temp.  Yum yum.

5) Everything in the room is controlled by a tablet bedside or via the TV.  Great idea, if it worked properly.  Our TV remote sucked.  Buttons were a pain to push and rarely seemed to register on the screen, making it impossible to turn on lights, open blinds, set the temperature, or set a wake-up via the TV.  It was a little easier via the picture frame tablet bedside, but we quickly realized nothing was wired correctly.  Turning on the ""Left Reading Lamp"" would turn the light on one side of the bed, but turning on the ""Left Bedside Lamp"" would turn the light on the opposite side of the bed.  Which side is the left?  Both?  Sometimes the curtains would open, sometimes they wouldn't.  There's also a switch by the entrance that's a global ON\/OFF switch for all the lights, except it never worked for us, so who knows.

6) The privacy light\/sign is also digitized and ours would never stay ON.  We'd turn it on, then a minute later, it'd turn itself off.

7) They charge a resort fee on top of your nightly room rate.  It supposedly covers great amenities like the ability to make phone calls, read digital newspapers, and use their wireless internet.  You know.  Stuff you'd either already expect of any budget hotel or things that you'd never really ever use.  I know more and more hotels are doing this, so I guess it's not just Aria, but it's sad nonetheless.  I wish hotels would just advertise the REAL price and stop tacking on all these nonsense fees that make the room seem cheaper, but end up twice as expensive as you thought it'd be.",10,1,1

Check in wasn't that bad. The lady directing people to lines assumed that the bf and I were with an older asian guy and put us together in a line when there were shorter lines next to it, lol. Whatever, we just went into another line. Checking in wasn't too bad, the girl was nice. Got a room on the 18th floor. My only gripe with our stay is that our room was SO FAR from the elevator! If I stay here next time, I'm going to ask to be closer to the elevator. Walking in my 4 1\/2"" heels to the elevator caused serious pain ):

The room was really clean and modern. The TV was amazing! And the bed was super comfortable. I always sleep the best when I'm on vacation. The bathroom was an awesome addition. You go through the shower to the tub. The bf and I soaked in it each night. The closet and dresser\/drawers were really handy. I unpacked my duffle bag immediately and was super organized. 

Cons:
- Only plug in the bathroom is behind the tissue box
- Toilet room doesn't have a fan!! What's up with that, Vegas??
- The room controller would crap out sometimes ): I loved the idea of being able to control mostly everything from the bedside, but the bf stopped responding our last day. Sad.

The casino wasn't that great. We're not big gamblers, I like to stay with my 5 cent slots. 

The food was excellent. Everything I had was sooo good. Right after we settled down in our room, we were hungry, so we headed over to the Cafe Vettro, and were highly satisfied! Shared the corn chowder and flank steak sandwich. Yummy! And the waiter was nervous but was happy to serve us. Left a nice tip (:

There was night, I totally forgot to put ""service"" on the door before I left and the housekeeper left me a message. And I called her back to ask them to service the room... how awesome is that? customer service at their best! haha 

Although, there are couple things about the hotel which I didn't like\/love. It's behind Crystals\/VDara\/Oriental Mandarin, so it's quite a walk to the strip\/bus stop. The control were kind of hard to maneuver and the lights would randomly turn off. Also, I hate their sensor shit on the fridge, if you touch\/move anything, it will automatically charge your room. But when you check out of the hotel, someone will do inventory and credit your account back. SO DON'T DO EXPRESS CHECK OUT, YOU WON'T GET A SALES RECEIPT OF YOUR STAY.

When I explained, he said, ""Well you booked through a third party so we always give you the cheapest possible room. That's what you got.""

Neither of these alternatives were preferable to my sister and I just sharing a bed, and I told him so. Honestly, just being a little more polite and explaining that the hotel was fully booked straightaway would have prevented me feeling like I was a ""problem guest"". I likely won't stay here again because, with the costs associated with booking a 5-star hotel, I really just expect to be treated a lot better than as if I'm a total nuisance. Based on my experience with that one service experience, I would never recommend this hotel to a friend. I visit Vegas twice a year, and I've had exponentially better service from every other hotel I've stayed with (Caesar's Palace, Flamingo, Tropicana, and Palazzo). I will book with them in the future.

----- Re: Response from Aria team -----

Again, I was not mad because I didn't receive my requested room ""upgrade"".  I understand that the hotel was full -- there is nothing anyone could have done about that. I was unhappy because I was treated rudely, as if my request made me a nuisance. I was treated like a second class guest, and based on statements made by the person I spoke to, it was because I booked through Priceline. If Aria doesn't want Priceline guests in their hotel, then they should not allow booking through that site. A little politeness would have gone a long way to making this whole encounter a non-issue. Again, I will book elsewhere in the future, and I will recommend my friends do the same.",4,2,1

The Casino is great and they have some of the best cocktail waitresses in any casino in Vegas.

The rooms have a pool view or mountain view, we went with the mountain view.  Everything is the room is electronic which was a little weird at first but we got used to it.

Minus 1 star for the lock of a coffee pot in the room, they want you to order expensive room service or overpay at Starbucks.  My suggestion would be to go to the Starbucks in the connecting mall next door.  A lot cheaper if you don't mind a small walk.  Or simply go down stairs and sit at a slot machine and ask for coffee.

The good thing about Aria is the connecting TRAM monorail which takes you between casino's.  This helps you avoid all of the Vegas Strip street hustlers trying to petal show tickets all night.  Go to the back of the casino and up the stairs, follow the signs or just ask someone.

In Vegas, I have stayed at the Cosmo, MGM, Palazzo, and Venetian and had great service and experiences.  At the Aria the problems began right away.
1.  Waited in line to check in for almost an hour.  (Not the worst thing, but annoying)
2.  Get checked in at 6:30pm and head to the room to find and DIRTY ROOM with PEOPLE'S STUFF!!
3.  We had dinner reservations where we were told by the restaurant that our group would be charged if anyone was late.  I called the front desk about the dirty room and was on hold 8 minutes.
4.  Finally they answer and say we will get you another room.  No Upgrade whatsoever, but at least another room.  I asked them to send someone up to give us keys so we could get in.  It took another 30 minutes to get keys.  They did give us a $50 credit.
5.  After going out, we returned to the room late in the evening.  I was tired and pulled the covers back to find a LONG CURLY BLACK HAIR ON MY PILLOW!!  WTF.  I just threw the pillow on the floor and went to sleep.  DISGUSTING.
6.  I went downs to the front to let them know and I was polite but disappointed.  They apologized and that was it.

A hotel that's sleek, modern, and embraces technology. The Aria and its City Center neighbors are the Strip's trendsetters for what Vegas resorts should be. 

The room I booked was a Deluxe Strip View King. You don't need to slide your card key into the slot; just scan it and enter. The room comes to life once you set foot inside. All the lights turn on, the sheer and black out curtains move to the side revealing the view, and the television switches onto the Aria's visitor channel. Many of the room's settings and the hotel's services can be accessed from a mobile tablet and television. My room only had a partial view of the south Strip and faced the inside of City Center, but I didn't mind because much of street noise was minimized.

What can I say, this is a very nice hotel, and nicely decorated.  I love Bellagio but it's too bling blingy whereas this place is very modern and nice.  Service is nice, food is great, very relaxing and comfortable.  The location is really good too.  The tram is very convenient to get to other nearby hotels.

If you look around, you will be able to find great deals especially if you check in Sunday or Monday instead of Friday or Saturdays.  The food at restaurants are really good, only a bit pricy.  If you like the value deal, try weekday breakfast or lunch at the buffet.  they are basically the same price as sandwiches they sell at the cafes here.

the fitness center is really pretty and nice too.

the only surprise I found was when you move anything in the refrigerator, it automatically charges you.  Supposedly they let you borrow a refrigerator if you ask, I never have though.

I do not know whether all the personnel are like this but the one that we had at the check in  counter looked like he did not even want to be there. He was also very quiet so we always had to ask him to repeat what he had said. So I was already disappointed at the check in. Finally we got to the room and of course it is standard for a good resort. The ""ipad"" controller was sometimes slow and if you did not know how to use it, it could have been difficult.
Some details should be noted, for example, the personnel who brought up the room service was very nice and jolly, it made breakfast enjoyable. The housekeepers too always say hi as I walk pass which is too a plus.
The bathroom though can be a bit dangerous especially with the tub and the shower in the same area, meaning that you have to step into the shower if you want out of the bathtub and for me that can be a very slippery experience. Other than that, it was an average experience. I probably will not come back since there are other hotels such as palazzo or venetian that have bigger rooms.

Oh and btw, I heard that the pool was a problem since the sunlight was reflecting off the windows of the hotel and hitting the pool which ended up burning all the guests. They are probably going to renovate it though.",0,0,0

The rooms are clean and all the electronics are remote controlled...not awesome when someone in the bedroom turns the lights off on you while you are in the bathroom :)
On one night of our stay there was practically an episode of COPS being filmed on our floor outside of our room.  We were unable to get to our room at 1am because of this drunk guy's shenanigans.  The hotel security asked that we remove ourselves from the hallway and we did.
I was tired and wanted to sleep.  I went to the front desk to see if anything could be done for our troubles.  They said they would let a manager know so I assumed we would hear something the next day.
I was never contacted by a manager.  I went back to the front desk around 6pm the following day.  I was offered a free buffet (which was included when we booked our rooms).  They then said they could waive the resort fee for the night ($20).  By this point I was a little annoyed.  I was finally able to speak with a manager who offered us $75 in food and beverages.

I had high expectations for my stay at the new ARIA; however, having been transferred to it one week before check-in via lack of inventory at Vdara even though the Vdara reservations had been confirmed more than a month in advance, I also had a sense of foreboding which rang true nearly every moment I was there.  I was sending myself and three colleagues to two conferences for the week, and I do not appreciate anticipating nor paying for inconveniences.  

ARIA does indeed have potential to be a 5-star hotel and I really wanted to love it; I especially value the green, eco-friendly mission it was built upon.  Unfortunately, as soon as we arrived it was evident that design was chosen over function in EVERY aspect of the resort, including the rooms, casino, dining areas and the spa.  For example, the hotel and casino offer high ceilings and natural light that create an open and spacious feeling during the day, but a dark and confusing maze at night.  Signs are nearly non-existent.  The railings in the elevators were falling off, long vertical rods that decorated some of the walkways had fallen down, the room key worked every 5th try and the room door wouldn't close completely.  The issues and problems I encountered are several pages long -- too long to detail in a review here on Yelp.

I plan to list additional specifics in upcoming reviews of individual sections of the hotel, but as far as this review of the hotel and hotel room itself:  ARIA is very nice in a sleek, modern business\/technology way with the most comfortable bed in Vegas, but lacking in charisma and warmth, and the feeling that you are in Vegas to have fun.  Check-in at 11:00 am wasted an hour of time.  My request to have my team all in the same area was not noted, nor was my request for a room facing away from the Strip.  I repeatedly told the front desk check-in staff that Vdara had agreed to and promised this or that due to the last-minute change and, in fact, everyone on my team did get rooms facing away from the Strip (although on various floors from 14 to 54) -- except for me, the business owner, who was given a room on the lowest floor overlooking the Veer Towers and the porte cochère, which had construction crews on it and the requisite construction noise waking me up before 7:00 am every morning.  (""This is a great city view and costs more than your reservation was for, and I know you will be pleased with it.  I've not had any complaints about it,"" said the front desk person.  Well, good thing I took photos as evidence.)  When I was checking out and mentioned the construction noise, I was told they had no idea construction was ""still"" going on and they comped me 50% of the first night's stay.

ARIA is the perfect example of an establishment forced to open too soon.  Experienced staff were handling the pressure pretty well, but the majority of them were not experienced enough and this showed in their attitude and treatment of the customers.  I was reminded of our experience at Cavallo Point, where hubby was most affected.  Here at ARIA, I was the one incredibly frustrated with everything and everyone, from the extremely loud bathroom ventilation that could not be turned off to the spa that could not have been designed by anyone who understands what the spa experience should be.  And to echo Hamilton C.'s comment about the pass-through door between two connecting rooms, yes, indeed, one of my colleagues listened to someone vomiting violently for hours into the wee hours of the morning.  Too bad the bathroom ventilation wasn't loud enough to drown that out.  

Despite all the negatives, there were a couple shining stars here that will be written up shortly; the rest of the resort should take notes from them.  A lot of bugs need to be worked out throughout the resort, and they had better be worked out soon.  You cannot call yourself a 5-star hotel and charge 5-star prices, and not have your act together.

One final note:  the windows are not reflective!  If you stand in front of them in the nude, everyone can see you.  Thankfully, this didn't happen to yours truly, but those construction guys having worked for awhile in Vegas probably have seen better anyhow.",6,3,2

Gambling:

It's easier to remember where gambling games and restaurants are. I think the design concept has changed. Before it was, ""let's make the place like a maze so they'll have no choice but to roam more. Some get tired and played on our slots or decided not to leave"" I think now there was so much complaints and realization that people spend more money when they get their wants and needs met faster.

Entertainment:
Haze Night club, 4 stars
Liquid pool party, - 4 stars if I can give it. You don't need to go to Silicon Valley. Liquid pool party company will bring it to you.

In short:

Aria is pretty on the outside but mediocre when they can get away with it. Where as with Encore, Wynn, and Cosmo it's all plush all the way.

We were on the 29th floor and had an amazing view of the strip. My only gripe was that the maid mistakenly took one of our robes with the towels, but it was replaced promptly with no issues. The spa was also affordable, at $30\/person per day. That includes the three (clothing optional) hot tubs, eucalyptus steam room, and cedar sauna. Also included was a co-ed outdoor pool, salt room, and hot stone beds. The locker rooms were fabulous, with everything you need for showering, shaving, hair styling, etc. There was even a flat iron and complimentary razors, hair brushes, and makeup remover, among other things.

Another plus is the location. This is one of the few hotels that has easy access to practically any other spot on the strip. The free tram is very useful, as is the monorail which is only 5-min on foot.

The rooms are nice. The pool is fun. The buffet is alright. They used to have amazing oysters and I haven't seen them since last year :(

found aria's location very convenient as well. sure you may have to walk but it's vegas and it's expected. we definitely utilized the free tram to bellagio a lot. aria is also connected to monte carlo through a walkway but we didnt check that out during the trip. walked around to check out Caesars, Planet Hollywood and Harrahs but did have to taxi it up to Wynn when we wanted to check out that hotel - still the trip was only $10. didnt have time to check out the pool area so that's def on my to do list the next time i'm here!

This was my fifth time at the Aria - and my last. 
The sense of arrogance and the repeated overt dismissal of problems is toxic here. 
1.  Zero communication between departments means if you have problems in several different areas you would have to take it up with different departments individually. Good luck with that. 

I had problems with:
Check in
Cash cage 
Housekeeping (nasty ass 3""x3"" clump of hair under my feet in the shower)
CONSTRUCTION at 7-something AM (concrete jackhammering - loud and WTF early)
Concierge - they made my appointments for two weeks before I arrived. Thanks. Oh, and no response to my emails about it. 

All in all, it's not worth the time to run down each of these things, and the distinct impression I get now is that they'll look you in the eye, listen, and immediately dismiss you. Maybe they're too busy but I never got a return response from the front desk or concierge about the issues.

Originally I had requested the regular King room, and when I checked in and went to my room, it really didn't do a lot for me. First off when I inspected the room, there was what appeared to be a fairly large dried loogie of snot (sorry for the graphic description) on one of the pieces of furniture in the room. Secondly, the strip view from the room, although nice, was not the epic view I was looking for to celebrate my 21st with in Vegas.

I returned to the hotel lobby and while waiting in line, was greeted by a very friendly young associate named Anthony, who ushered me over to a private desk and very casually told me about a special they had with the Sky Suites. I could not turn down the awesome deal the hotel was offering, and I got the 35th floor Suite with the strip view instead of the 22nd floor normal King room.

The suite the hotel gave us was amazing, the 2 separate rooms were very nice, the architecture and the decor was all very modern and relaxing. I find the frill and fanciness of some classic hotels, even in the suites, to be too overwhelming for me. The bathroom is grand and the bathtub with jets is very nice. The shower is large with a bench and has a high swivel spout (which I love because I'm tall). The technology in the room is wonderful. From a bedside touch screen display, or from the televisions in either rooms, you can control every aspect of the room. Every single light individually (with brightness) or all of them at once, the curtains and black out shades to be drawn or closed, and the alarm setup (which can open the curtains). Plus you can also set up the do not disturb preferences and the house keeping requests from the panel or TV's. Room service you cannot do from the TV or Touchpad, but the room phone is wireless which makes everything pretty much seamless if you want to be super lazy.

Floor 35's view of the strip was wonderful. My love and I stayed up till dawn watching the sun come up over the Eastern hills of the valley Vegas sits in. From our room we could see the airport and strip clearly, it was interesting seeing planes land ""below"" where you are.
It was nice to wake up at night and just look out at the twinkling lights of Vegas below.

The layout of the hotel in its unique S shape is intriguing, not too many squares and corners, but a a lot of soft long curves that define the layout gracefully. There is no one way to get to a specific spot in the building, or all of City Center for that matter.

The art in the hotel is very modern, the architecture is something you have to see at least once in your life. It was very relaxing walking through the casinos, the ambiance for being in Vegas is surprisingly classy. There is a unique incense they always have circulating the main floors that will have you intrigued. 

The casino is amazing and fun, although the limits are too high for my cheap butt, I know many gamblers enjoy this floor. I spent my time at Slots a Fun and Sahara's $1 Blackjack. If I was a high roller though, Aria would be my Casino of choice, hands down. Who knows, there is always next year.

The bars on the casino floor of the Aria are mind numbingly expensive. My lady and I shared a shot of tequila and a vodka red-bull and it set us back $28. There are millions of little secrets for cheap and or free drinks in Vegas, so if you don't have a lot to spend, stay away from these beautiful but expensive bars.

The Buffet at Aria is to die for in my opinion. My lady and I had just checked out and packed up when we decided to farewell Aria by visiting the buffet, and we made a good decision. We ate at around 1, so there was still a small breakfast section left. The lunch section was great, I have never seen a buffet carry Indian, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, Brittish, Irish, Italian, American and more dishes and in such variety of each. We left with diversified palettes and full bellies.

We also ate at Todd English P.U.B. the night we arrived. VERY well cooked English food with a very unique selection of beer. My lady had a chocolate and strawberry beer that was surprisingly good.

Aria was treat. I will most likely be returning.",1,0,1

I understand its Vegas but during the week there are thousands of visitors who are here on business and its not exactly the kind of night you want to have when you need to get up early the next morning. The control pad also became an issue, not following commands and many of the manual buttons on the walls did not work.

The AC didn't ever really cool down the room which was fine by me since I don't love the cold. But my hubby would've liked it a bit cooler. The bathroom was huge and there was a tub and shower which is always nice. 

The casino floor of the hotel was huge. I didn't gamble here but there seemed to be a lot of people enjoying themselves. 

What I thought was awesome was there were so many nice restaurants in the hotel. We didn't do any nice dinners while we were in town but there definitely were some good options here.

Sadly, I was very disappointed. My co-workers and I arrived early in the morning for a trade show so I didn't expect to have a room available right away. Sometimes, you get lucky, but not this time. Not only did they not have rooms ready, but I had clearly requested two beds since I would be sharing with my co-worker to save the company some money. No, no double rooms available for the entire three days. The manager on duty said that they could provide a roll away bed and that was the best they could do since they were fully booked. Yes, I was disappointed but what could I do at this point? We had breakfast in the Aria Cafe until at least one of the rooms became available. The Aria Cafe is another review. My other co-worker (male) received a text that his room was ready, so we deposited our luggage there until we returned from the trade show later that evening. When we received our room assignment, it was clear that a roll away bed had not been delivered. I called housekeeping and the pleasant woman who answered asked if we wanted the bed set up also. Yes, of course, we would like the bed set up and the furniture moved to accommodate it. We left for dinner to the Bardot Brasserie (another review) and returned to find that the bed was left standing next to the wall by the other bed. Ugh, another call to housekeeping at the end of a very long day to have someone come up to set up the bed.

The remote control was another issue. It didn't work very well, so we asked to have the batteries changed. It still didn't work very well and it's useful in controlling the curtains and lights as well as the TV. I'm pretty good with remotes at home, so it wasn't that I was technologically challenged.

Also, be aware that the in-room fridge is not to be used for personal items. If you remove any of the hotel's offerings from the fridge and have it out for more than 60 seconds, it goes on your bill. Easy to overlook unless you read carefully. Luckily, we read the warning first.

I asked hubby why is it so noisy in here?  It sounds like there is a full casino of people, though it was empty.  Weird. 

My husband said they probably pipe in the crowd noise.

Back to the machines.  We each put in our cards and a hundred in each machine.

My only real gripe was the front desk. About as friendly and personable as a rock. We arrived early and they refused to give us a room, even though they admitted they had ones available. Said we had to wait for the one assigned to us when we booked. Check out same thing. My wife is 6 months pregnant and we wanted a late check to relax before our later flight.

Pros: 
1. The hotel is new so everything at that new hotel smell\/ feel which I like a lot. 
2. The casino tables weren't too high. It was superbowl weekend and I still saw $15 tables at night. 
3. The customer service from the phone was really excellent. They helped us out with everything (i.e. booking a super bowl party) and even got us good discounts.
4. The room was nice and the view was awesome even if it wasn't of the strip. The really large windows make it look cool. I had a view of the pools and those looked really nice too but it was too cold to go out.

Cons:
1. I didn't like how small the bathroom was. I think I'm used to staying in the venetian or something but I thought the bathrooms were small. I also didn't like how they didn't have any ventalation in the bathroom.
2. There is no back enterance into the hotel (according to the cab driver) so getting to and from the hotel can be a little bit of a pain if there is traffic on the strip.
3. They tried to be really high tech with the room with all these settings on some control panel and different switches on the wall but it just made me confused. It took us at least a day to figure out how to turn on specific lights in the room etc. and I couldn't even figure out how to turn the TV on. 

Overall I thought the hotel was only ok. I felt like there wasn't anything really that special about it. If it wasn't new, there really is nothing enticing about it but to be fair, I think my standards for vegas hotels have gone up because you expect so much more. If this hotel were in any other city, it would be fabulous. Because it's in vegas, it's only ok.",0,0,0

Now being that this hotel and casino is amongst a couple in the City Centre on the Las Vegas strip, Aria is more like a facade, more impressive from the outside.  The casino is fairly small and looks similar to Red Rock or even San Manuel if you are familiar with these smaller casinos.  The 2nd floor has shops that quite frankly, are not that interesting to shop in, but I did like the Viva Elvis shop, especially for you Elvis fans, that store blasts Elvis music and you can purchase things here without having to make a trip to Graceland.  I watched the Viva Elvis show and it cost  $145 for a balcony seat, pretty pricey, but what do you expect for being the newest show on the strip.  It was an awesome show, be prepared to catch a scarf falling from the ceiling at the end of the show...great Elvis tribute!  If you plan to watch the 7pm Viva Elvis show, I suggest heading into the buffet for an early dinner, they have lobster (1 per person) and complimentary wine!  I enjoyed the seafood selections, mostly different shrimp dishes, and the pasta station was good too.  The desserts were my favorite, they had small portions which were easy to consume and not feel so guilty about, especially when you have like 6 or 7 other desserts on your plate.  The outdoor pool area has several pools and I happened to go when Kristin Cavallari from ""The Hills,"" was making an appearance, unfortunately no celebrity sightings here.  The pool has no fancy or majestic landscaping, waterfalls, or statues, but it was packed with people and they seemed to be having fun regardless.

As always a trip to Las Vegas and Aria completed that wish. This was our fourth time staying at this hotel and ever since we've stayed at other hotels and tried Aria one year we've never stayed anywhere else.  Our brother-in-law who has severe allergies actually stayed here and recommended it for the clean air-quality and as an oasis from all the smoke filled casinos. It's like you just step up to a higher level. It's a great California south coast style, open concept hotel, at least to this Cali native. We've been sold since our first visit thanksgiving 2012

Again this time was an amazing stay.  By using the mobile app we got early  check-in for fee . As result, we also got free upgrade for our room from Desert to Strip view. We were trying to save a little money by going desert. So this was completely unexpected and nice surprise upon entering room. When I made reservation I also mentioned it was our anniversary when asked if a special occasion and they delivered chocolates and card to our door.  Our room was super clean so no complaints at all. We had once daily cleaning. The first day we did have to call but to be honest we did leave room  late and just got skipped. Otherwise housekeeping was very thorough and we did tip accordingly.  

Yes the hotel does charge fees like every other place now. But they didn't actually charge us for parking for some reason. We just took it as another anniversary gift. LOL. Again we highly recommend Aria and we haven't stayed anywhere else in the last several years we've been. We are M lifers  and  this always helps  stays more enjoyable and pleasurable.

(And by walking - I mean, prepare to walk a really looooooooong time to reach your room! I rented a car this past trip and stupidly parked it in their parking garage (which is on the opposite side of the casino from check-in)! So after you walk through the entire length of the casino, you arrive at the check-in area and then re-trace about half of your journey to get to the elevators that take you up to your room. Good thing the place is air conditioned!

In terms of our room, it was actually pretty cool with all of the automated controls that are controlled through a tablet - though over our stay, the system became pretty slow and non-respondant at times and the 'wow-factor' soon faded pretty fast. In addition, the layout of our room was kind of weird with the walk-in closets taking up a good amount of living space that could be improved on. Also, there was this one annoying light in the bathroom that would flicker - as it threatening to die out any minute. Calls to the front desk to get it replaced went unnoticed and were almost nonexistent. In addition, I don't know if it was because the cleaning service was lazy because we were at the very end of the hallway in the corner of our floor, but two of the four days we stayed did not get cleaned! Calls to the front desk again were met with empty promises about having someone come up while we were out of the room.

One thing I did enjoy about the Aria was their fitness facility, which was included in their resort fee and not additional! The weights and equipment was new and seemed to be maintained and cleaned regularly. In addition, the bottled water and fruit complementary provided was a nice touch!

While I didn't get to enjoy any of the other amenities at the Aria, I can attest that my room was extremely quiet and I was able to get some quality R&R and prep for my meetings. Additionally, the location was pretty central to the strip and conveniently connected to the Crystals shops. 

I have stayed at much better places in Vegas and also stayed in much, much worse places, and thusly would say that it is about the middle of the road for me. The casino was on the smaller side, but I was able to make some decent money at the blackjack tables so I'm not going to complain.

What an amazing room the view was great and everything in the room was powered by something similar to an Ipad.  The bed was great and we slept very comfortably.  We didn't experience the curtains opening or music coming on as some reviews mentioned, but that was probably the only thing missing.

The aria is clean and beautiful and offered an oasis when you were ready to return home after a long day\/night in busy Vegas. When first arriving in the hotel it's true there is a line to check in. But their are lines in every major hotel in Vegas. We were checked in in less than 30 minutes by a very friendly front desk worker who upgraded our room view as well as sending a complementary graduation gift to our room (best rice crispy treats ever!). 

The hotel elevators are not far from the check in desk and run very fast. The room itself was clean, modern and all of our room technology worked great for us. The bed was huge and comfortable, with clean sheets. Oh also, apparently you can have your room cleaned two times a day (which is excessive for me, but maybe some people like that) and the cleaning staff was always super friendly and attentive. In fact all the staff were wonderful except for a woman who worked at the pastry cafe, but hey I can live with one rude staff member. 

The bathrooms in the room were HUGE. Double vanity sink area with plenty of storage space. The large bathtub is located in the shower which was really cool. The shampoo and soap products they provided were so divine. They smell like citrus and green tea mixed together. It just all felt so fancy.

The casino had all the games every casino in Vegas has but it was very clean and did not smell like smoke, which is a plus in my book. Also, the concierge desk at this hotel is wonderful! We must have contacted them a dozen times and they were always friendly, polite, and willing to give different suggestions based on your price range. They made our trip more enjoyable and adventurous! 

The pools were nice, if a little bit ordinary compared to other things available on the strip. I mean it's kinda hard to compete with a lazy river when you don't have one lol. The one thing that really rubbed me the wrong way about this hotel was the poolside food\/drink service. We wanted to order some food for by the pool(because you cannot order food at the bar) and we were never served after waving down at least 5 different servers. Apparently only certain girls could serve certain sections of the pool due to union issues, but we just wanted to be feed. It was weird, we got food elsewhere. 

It is also important to note that my boyfriend and I stayed here on weekday nights with a significantly cheaper price on rooms. I don't know if I could ever bring  myself to spend $400 plus on a room for one night, or if it would ever meet my expectations for that price tag. But in my experience it was a wonderful hotel that I would recommend to family and friends staying in Las Vegas!",4,0,1

Nice lobby, atmosphere. Feels more like a luxury hotel than a casino. Great rooms with high end fixtures and gizmos. Very nice pool area. Large enough that it was not a problem finding lounge chairs for the family. Great fitness facility. Very nice equipment and nice layout.The Spa looked nice although I had no services this time. I upgraded from a standard room to a suite at check-in. Glad I did as the suites were great. The suites also offer an area with free bottled water, sodas, coffee, light breakfast, fruit, muffins, afternoon wine, etc. This area can actually save you about $50.00 \/day + if you have kids.

The BAD: Too far off the stirp for my liking. Takes 20 min to get from the hotel to the actual strip and then further to get to the Forum Shops, etc. Easiest method was to go through the Bellagio entrance, not easy. The attached mall is all ultra high-end. The best shops but as a reult, was absolutely dead on a Friday and Saturday. Must be a reflection of the current economy. Dining options were a little too high end for my liking as well. The buffet did look fabulous however but I had no time to try it out. Casino had high limits and very little play. Often say empty tables with dealers waiting for customers. Advice - have a few $5- to $10- minimum tables and  you will have aq full casino. $25- minimum tables empty never made sense to me.

The UGLY: I realized on my drive to L.A. that I left some items in a bedroom dresser drawer. Several shirts, shorts, etc. No big loss, probably $200- total. My fault completely. I called the Aria to ask if housekeeping had turned this in so I could arrange to pick it up. Hotel rep said they would check and call me. No return call from the Aria. I called again the next day to see if anyone had found my clothes. Again, they said they would check with housekeeping and\/or lost and found and call me back, felt a bit of an attitude or imposition on their part.. Again.......no return call at all. I found this suprising. So, next day, I called one last time and asked to talk with the suites concierge as they would have more clout suposedly. I asked if someone could simply go to the room and look in the drawer to see if the clothes were still there. ( I would think they could have offered this quick service for me but I actually had to ask ). They said they would see what they could do and would definitely call me either way. Well, you guessed it..... no call back at all. No email, nothing. Not that at that point I really expected anything. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

For what it is worth, I only deducted 1 star because of the lack of service on the last issue alone. They still have some customer service issues to work out it seems but overall, this is a very nice high end casino\/hotel in Las Vegas.

I however, will stay in the Mirage, Ceasars, Venetian, Bellagio, etc. next time I come to town as I prefer the closer proximity to the strip.",1,1,0

Yep. I actually left $110 richer. Well, not richer, but I was pleasantly surprised to win here. It's so new and shiny. I figured they would need to raise as much cash as possible.

It's beautiful. It's clean. I wish it were actually on the Strip because getting here it's quite a hike.  Forcing people to walk through CityCenter is a great marketing ploy and probably one of the best ways they could have designed it. Still, in a land where moving sidewalks are the norm it seems like they could have figured out a more direct route to the casino.

The room is spacious, nicely decorated, comfortable and clean. 

The bed is too soft in spots (weird).

The bathroom is unique. I love the soaking tub in the shower. Great use of space and no water splashing outside onto the bathroom floor. Thankful there was a scale in the room. I have lost over 100 lbs and that helped keep me in check.

The room controls were easy to use. The only thing bad was our privacy light would not stay on.  We were never bothered but the idea of being bothered, was a little nerve racking. Also the lock for the mini bar did not work.  

There is a lot of storage space. 

The part that we disliked is a big issue. We could hear everything in our room. We could hear the ladies in the next room partying, we could hear one of them crying the next morning, we could hear the people above us, we could hear knocking from the room on the other side of us and even hear the elevator bell and everyone who walked by and wasn't courtesy to be quiet. Luckily we travel with ear plugs all the time. 

To me a high end hotel should have way better sound proofing. Isn't good when you can hear other people having sex. 

We have stayed at almost every strip hotel and for this one reason, I doubt we will stay here again.

Crystals is nothing special. Very plain looking as has been mentioned many times.

As to Aria, for the most part we could hardly wait to get out of there.
We were simply uncomfortable with the design. The overall feel is busy with too many curves, lines and architectural drama.

It was very noisy with conversations floating all over the place.

We were simply not impressed with the visual busyness, like everywhere you looked there was something different design wise going on, and it was disturbing.

What stood out for me was coming down an escalator from upstairs where the Elvis theater is looking straight ahead you get the pleasure of seeing pipes and electrical boxes.

Ten billion dollars and the worlds greatest designers and architects and what is visual from the escalator are pipes and electrical boxes.

Amazing.

The Aria is like the mature older sister that's grown up a little bit and has nicer things.  I like the nicer things...

And thankfully I like nice things that are affordable or preferably discounted.  Aria always seems to have affordable rates.  I have no clue why, because it's a really beautiful modern hotel with many amenities.  There's lots of classy restaurants that offer a variety of food choices.  Not much on the low end level though.  Mostly nice lunch or dinner places.  But the citywalk attached offers a more varied cheaper fare.  

On second thought, maybe I can straddle the line between young and hip and mature older sister.  The mall attached to this hotel has nothing in it that I can afford.  It's beautiful items, don't get me wrong, but I've already payed my discounted rate for the hotel, you think I'm going to bust out $2,000 for a Louis Vuitton handbag?  Methinks not.  The casino is also boring.  I'm not a gambler, so I like flashy things to entertain me.  PH had flashy things like dancers, fun bars inside and a young atmosphere.  This was a little snoozefesty.  So those were the downfalls.  Oh, and the buffet is awful.  See my review for that lameness.

On the other hand, and a big upper hand at that, is that the pool area is awesome!  I love that they made it like a mini beach oasis.  Little sections with large pools and enough seating.  And servers who will actual get you a drink!  Not at all like the non-service I received at PH.  They have this VIP pool where you can pay to go in for like $30.  Now, I would never do that, but you can go in and eat lunch at the restaurant inside and stay to lounge around ""for free.""  It was awesome grabbing a lite bite and then lounging on one of the comfy padded beds in a less crowded pool.  Just a little tip for ya, just don't crowd the pool too much for me:)

If I weren't able to choose between the million other options in the Strip I'd most definitely go with the Aria again because, I gotta be honest, the pool area won me over above the rest!",1,5,3

Food:

Must eat: Jean Phillipe bakery.  We had breakfast there three times (bear claw, chocolate croissant, and one other pastry which I don't remember , only that it was really good).  We also bought a couple of sandwiches there for the flight home and they were amazingly sophisticated and tasty too.

Must eat: Cafe Vettro.  We ate dinner there once and lunch once.  For dinner, I had the burger with blue cheese, bacon and mushrooms ($24!) and SO had the steak sandwich.  Not cheap, but well worth it.  For lunch I had the BLT, with thick chunky crisp strips of bacon on a ciabatta roll.  It was very tasty, though I would have prefered they not put the bacon right on top of the tomato, which makes the bacon lose its crispness too soon.

Must skip: Lemongrass.  It's Thai, but more Thai-American than Thai and not very remarkable.  It wasn't bad, in fact, the food was tasty enough, but it was neither Thai nor outstanding.  One word of caution:  when ordering the spicy dishes, which are rated from zero to ten, be very careful.  The wait person recommended  a four for the tom yum soup and a three for a pork in garlic sauce.  I asked what number would she consider straight Tabasco and she said four.  She was right!  A six or seven will hurt pretty bad and you can probably use a ten for personal defense purposes :) .

Shows:

We didn't see the ""Elvis"" Cirque du Soleil show, wanting to ""save"" it for our anniversary trip.  Everybody I spoke to who had seen it loved it, even though it was still in its ""soft opening"" phase where they're still liable to stop & tweak the show midway through.  Supposedly they ""officially"" open (i.e. when critics are actually invited to write about the show, according to http:\/\/communities.canada.com\/montrealgazette\/blogs\/stageandpage\/archive\/2009\/11\/08\/cirque-du-soleil-countdown-to-viva-elvis-cirque-in-las-vegas.aspx) that Sat, Jan 29.

Bugs and ""features"" :) :
1.  The room control menu is sluggish and somewhat buggy, both via the touch screen console and via the remote control.
2.  The A\/C outlet in the bathroom is located below the mirror, in the middle, which also happens to be the only place they can put the tissue box, so it took a bit of rooting around to find the outlet!  See this pic:
http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg?select=EFgTW3F-xoYKFDEJYpOWXA
3.  The safe is in a drawer on one side of the bed.  It took some digging around to find it, not a biggie though.  Also, given the weight of the safe, I wonder how long the drawer's slides will last.  I suppose they're hoping that few people will use the safe...  See this pic:

4.  All our room phones (VOIP phones) were DOA.  We reported it on checking in and no less than two IT types (one with the requisite backpack full of spares and tools :) ) showed up to fix them.  It was a unplugged network plug behind a panel in the wall behind the bed board.",5,0,1

We stayed in a city view king bed room. The room was ultra futuristic! The lights were all synced and when you didn't want to get up from bed you can use the touch screen tablet to turn on\/off lights, watch tv, and open the drapes. The downside of the tablet is its really slow and takes forever to dim a light or change a channel. 

The very first thing I did even before unpacking was turn on the bath tub. It was calling my name! The bath tub and shower are separated but next to each other which was interesting. The vanity had one of those magnifying mirrors which is awesome when doing make up. 

The bed is like a cloud. I wish I spent more time in it! There was lots of pillows and even a body pillow. 

The only things that I didn't like about our stay was the fridge was full of mini bar drinks. Meaning no room for left overs or your own beverages. The mini bar is weighed so don't pick anything up because you will be charged! They can bring in a fridge for personal use but at an extra charge. 

Check in and out were pretty easy. Just before 11am it does get a little long but you can check out through email which allows you to get out of the line. 

Concierge and front desk staff are very nice and helpful. We left a tablet in one of the rooms after checking out and although it took an hour they made sure it was brought back to us in one piece.

Overall we very much liked the hotel amenities as well. The casino was clean and didn't have that dense smoke smell in it. The tram, strip, self parking, and valet are all walking distance since room elevators are centralized. Plus it is part of the MGM players club so on top of getting points for whatever I bought there I could use the same card at lots of other hotels like The Mirage and Bellagio.

I know it is inevitable in the casinos here in Vegas, but being allergic, I really can't handle the smells.  Gives me a headache and overall a bad feeling.

I said just cancel it and if I still wanted it later in my stay I would reorder. But the concierge said they couldn't cancel it and forced me to choose a time for delivery. Amenity was around $100 that I still paid for. Food was eventually delivered while we were out and sat there for hours which turned to mush and was not good.

Pros: 
1. Gorgeous hotel I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
2. Customer service was phenomenal! From Valet, Bell service, reservations etc..
We stayed in the deluxe King room and it was Beautiful! At check-in we were told we had a mountain view room and we were fine with it but when we got to the room we had gorgeous views of lights, several casinos and the mountains off in the distance. I don't think u can get a bad view here!
3. The drapes! As soon as you walk in, they magically open as if Vegas is giving you a great big welcoming hug! I loved this feature. Guess it's the kid within me.
4. The enclosed in but separate shower and tub! I would soak in the tub and then hop in the shower right after. It was a refreshing way to start my day and end my night.

Cons: 
1. As beautiful as the bed is, it wasn't comfortable to me. Mattress was super firm. That may just be my preference over someone else's. My husband said it was fine to him. 
2. The bathroom sink was clogged (both of them) 
3. There was a missing sprinkler cover in the room leaving an exposed hole. 
Once we called to let them know about both of the above issues, they sent someone to our door within 5 min to fix it! 
4. The bathroom towels. Damn they were some hard scratchy towels. Guess they are making sure u don't take any home. Lol
5. Valet parking charge. I really don't understand this charge. Vegas resort fees and taxes are thru the roof and I feel like the valet fee should be included. $25 per day is pretty ridiculous. I paid for a whole nother day with what I was charged for valet, taxes and fees! To top it off, they charged me 5 times when we only stayed for 3 nights. I had to call in after check out to get it corrected but still, shouldn't have been on my bill 5 times! Be sure to check your check out bill.
6. Don't expect them to come around asking if u want a drink while gambling. Go to the cheap hotels or the high roller area for that. We spent 2 hours at the slots one day and not one person came around to ask if we wanted drinks. 
7. The Green Mile walk to our room. After a night of drinking and getting tipsy, we were sober AF by the time we got back to our room! We had to take 2 elevators and walk an endless hallway. It would literally take like 15 min of brisk walking to get to the casino to our room. Sheesh!


The room also had a few useless items...
1. A scale in the bathroom (not concerned about my weight while in Vegas) I could see this in the health spa area but I don't see a point in having one in the bathroom. Maybe it's a way to get you to drink more after stepping on it. Idk
2. A plunger. While I get the practicality of it, it's not aesthetically pleasing to see. It was a nice plunger tho so I guess I can't really be too upset. 
3. The fridge. I really wish Vegas hotels would stop putting stocked fridges in their rooms. Ain't nobody removing those expensive ass items! Just give us an empty fridge please. Save these for the penthouse suites!
4. A full closet and drawers in the foyer. Other than for looks (it does look nice) it's useless to have that much space. I'm not moving in, just visiting. I'd rather have a microwave and a keurig. 

So, while I enjoyed my stay here, I probably won't return since there are alot of other hotels I'd like to check off my list but if you've never been here before, I'd recommend staying  at least once!",1,0,1

i fell in love with my room... especially the king sized bed! it's the most comfortable bed i've ever slept in. it's sad that my own bed is no longer comfy to me... wonder if i could get away with stealing it? lol.

customer service was pretty much decent all around. i also really enjoyed the fact that jean philippe patisserie was right next to the guest elevators. mMm... they'll get their own review. 

this hotel is obviously new, so it's really clean. i even enjoy how clean the place smells as soon as you walk through the doors. 

one last thing that got me... when you leave your luggage at the bell desk... you go back and pick it up. if you're heading to LAS after you pick up your luggage, you have to wait for a cab. and sometimes those damn taxi lines are insane! right? well, they actually ask you where you're heading at the time you leave your luggage. they'll note on the tags that you'll be flying home. when you go back to pick it up, they automatically cut you to the front of the taxi line so you don't have to wait. how awesome is that? that's what you call customer service!

i definetely can't wait to go back to vegas and stay at aria!",4,2,2

The line to check-in takes forever ... (20 minutes in our case). The moment we walked in the room, the smell of second hand smoke hit our faces, so I call front desk and said that we requested non smocking room, the response was ""all of our room are not smocking room"" deodorizing was offered to us, we agreed but when came back to room at night it was the same smoke all over again.  I think it's coming from the vent in the bathroom, cause the smell is so strong and doesn't go away in the toilet. We were on the 17th floor, so I don't know how the vents work. 
Walls in the bathrooms are so dirty it's pretty gross( see picture).  There was a pile of dirt left in the corner as well, feels like the dust was collected but not picked up.  Also when we came to room on the second day, the room was not made up and no clean towels.  I call the front desk again, The lady apologized and said she will put a request to bring towels in, and asked what time would we like it.  I said tomorrow morning at 6:30am, and went to sleep, thirty minutes later someone knocks on the door, I didn't feel like getting up hoping they would leave, but nope, kept on knocking, I had to get up.  It was housekeeping bringing couple of towels.  I was like ""WHat is going on here?  Just not our day. The shop and restaurants choices are good though and tablet remote is a great touch. Would never stay here again and definitely will not recommend to anyone.  It's very upsetting when you think you book a five star hotel and expect everything top notch and willing to pay hard earned money for it, then experience all that hard mess. So unfair! Hope checkout will be easier tomorrow.  Oh and I forgot to mention about a notepad that was not replaced from previous guests.  There was some numbers scribbled on it. (No fun)",0,1,0

I was so glad we chose Sky suites for the first time, most likely we will always choose Sky suites at Aria! No casino and very little smoke in this area, it was so quiet and relaxing all the time. They put everything so close to both upstairs and downstairs Sky suites entrances, spa and salon, pools, Alibi lounge, two great Asian restaurants, conference center and buffet, no line at the buffet for Sky suites guests. It is the most convenient location at Aria hotel, LOVED it! 

Private hassle free check in at exclusive Sky Suites check in lounge, they have refreshments all day, waters and beverages, simple breakfast after 6 every morning, simple snacks every evening, actually saved us time and money to buy waters or beverages. 

We got a corner Sky suite, loved the one bedroom suite. Spacious living and bed, huge bathroom with jet tub, his and her sink, loved the vanity mirror, it made my fat face appear to be smaller! That's awesome! Guest powder room, dining table, mini bar, wet bar and an empty small refrigerator. Blackout shades, robes, slippers and in room safe, even a nice sound system under TV! The amenities were the best I have ever seen! Everything you need is in there, I didn't even have to use my own things, so convenient! Twice a day housekeeping, they did great jobs! And I loved the chocolates from turndown service, so sweet and yummy! The bed, pillows and sheets are the most comfortable I have ever slept in among all hotels in Vegas! 

The views were amazing, we had the entire city center view, it was absolutely breathtaking. The in room breakfast was so good, smoked salmon was so fresh and smoky, hubby loved his steak omelette, gf loved her pancakes, we all loved the assorted fruits, everything was so delicious! I opened a half bottle of Patron from the mini bar, it was $55, not awfully overpriced, since we had snacks from the sky suites lounge, so I didn't have to raid the wet bar this time. But they do have a good selections of alcohol and snacks. Weird thing was they would charge for champagne flutes when we asked for more, no idea why! 

As for Aria hotel itself, this is a good sized hotel, not too big or too small, but the casino area smells like smoke, hated it. A good restaurant collection, not enough lounges though, a few closed down over the years, hopefully they will open up new ones eventually. A few pools, adult pool lounge, spa, salon and fitness center. They have pretty much everything here because of the city center location, walking distance to lots of places nearby, or take monorail to travel around. I would say this is one of the best hotel locations in Vegas! Had some macaroons to go at the dessert place at casino level, they were not good at all, not worth $2.5 each! The coffee was so weak too according to hubby. 

So it was definitely one of the best hotel stays for us! No complaints except that champagne glasses thing, everything else was PERFECT! 

Guess from now on, we are just gonna stay at Aria Sky suites or Mandarin Oriental, we have tried many luxury hotels in Vegas, so far this two are the best among the best! They are SPECTACULAR!!!

Ps. I am not sure if the pillows are goose down pillows, so strict vegans be CAREFUL! Call to make sure they are not down pillows, ask them to change to regular pillows if they are!",21,12,13

Everyone was very nice and accommodated to my request to have a room on a high floor. When we got to our room, I was amazed at the view. Unfortunately, the Aria is set back from the strip a little bit, but we had an awesome view of the city and the lights at night were beautiful. 
The room was small, but had great extras such as a huge bathroom and blackout curtains. 

We also spent one day of our trip just relaxing, going to the spa and the gym. We did not buy any spa treatments, but just the day pass, which was great in itself. I think i spent a good hour lying down in the warm stone beds. 

I was a little disappointed with the pools though. There were about three ( I might be wrong) but they were kind of all the same. Just a round pool. 

It seems like this hotel is catered to the more mature crowd and for people on conventions. We met people who were there for a pizza convention! With that said, I would love to stay at this hotel again.",0,0,0

Let me make very clear that I stayed in the Aria Sky Suites so my review is based on that. The whole trip was planned for the first week of October 2014 to celebrate my parents 40th wedding anniversary. The concierge was super helpful in setting up a welcome surprise basket for my parents with a champagne toast along with dinner reservations and a cake order. They also helped set us up with a cabanna. So now we are off. 

First of all our driver was late and confused to pick us up from the airport but he was very friendly and apologetic and that made all the difference. Management also gave us a credit which made us feel better because when you pay for great service and convenience, you want it. No excuses! Upon arrival, check in was quick and the bags were brought up to our two bedroom suite. OMG...these rooms are so nice and the welcome basket was perfect and we all popped the bottle and drank in honor of the fun to come. They also included a few other things which we didn't ask for. Always a nice touch. 

The bathrooms are amazing with the heated toilet seats that leave you feeling refreshed. Everything is operated by a remote. The view was amazing but something was wrong with the remotes for the curtains. But someone came and fixed that right away. The service here in the sky suites was impeccable and there was no wait for anything!

I have detailed reviews for the restaurants at the hotel but In regards to the pool service, Nikki was an amazing hostess and came back often to make sure we had everything we needed in the cabanna. By the way the cabannas are awesome and worth the money. They have misters that feel like outdoor air conditioners. Next, Our personal trainer Rocket took us on the ARIA hike and it was such a fun and different kind of workout. I highly reccomend it. He is so knowledgeable and really fun. Its Vegas guys! Try something different. Our chef at Tetsu was also amazing and everything was cooked perfectly. The wait or brought out my parents anniversary cake and needless to say they were surprised and pleased. 

In conclusion...ARIA will be the only place I'm staying in Vegas for a while. Thanks to them for making my parents 40th luxurious and memorable!",3,1,2

This is the best hotel I ever stayed in Vegas. I really loved the tablet where I could control all the lights, blackout\/sheer curtains, room temperature and TV. The goodnight feature from that tablet was very convenient for me. You could actually order stuffs from the tablet, too, such as souvenirs, take-out food, room service, romantic flowers on your bed, etc. 

I also loved the pillows and the design of their bathroom for the deluxe rooms. Yes, the pillow was so comfy that I bought one home from their souvenir store.

The cleaning service people there were friendly, too. In the morning, they always asked me if I needed anything like shampoo, towels, soaps, etc, when they saw me exiting my room.

There are many fancy restaurants in the hotel that I didn't have a chance to try. Next time, I might give some of those restaurants a try.

It was my first time staying here, and I could say I was pleased. I will be staying here in the future.

Minus 1 star for the first room I got that was a mess (There was an issue with the lights\/technology feature, so there were only 2 lights that worked. Some area of the carpet was still wet, and the drawer in the bathroom had some used dental floss, used pink-colored shavers, and some other female stuffs).

Aria's spot is central on the Las Vegas Strip -- not too north like Encore or Wynn and not too south as far as Mandalay Bay. One side of the Aria building has a rather narrow view of the Strip, and from what I could see, most of the room views are either partially obscured of the Strip or a full unobstructed view of the mountains. I've had both and still go back and forth on which one I'd prefer.

The guest elevators are not close to the lobby when you check in nor close to exit\/entry ways. So either way, you have to do some walking. Security checks keys before you enter the elevator area, so make sure you have that ready before approaching.

As for the room, the smart controlled room is managed with the use of a tablet. Pretty modern room with modern technology. The tub is in the same room as the shower, so when you are in the bathroom, you'll see a glass door for the shower and behind the shower is the tub. The only hotel I've seen with this weird configuration. They used to have Aria-branded toiletries, but they've now switched to this bamboo-ish brand. I'm not fond of the scent of the new brand of toiletries.

In case you were wondering like I was, the pool, fitness center and most restaurants are on 2nd level. Remember how earlier I said the elevators to the rooms are not close to the lobby or exits? Yea, neither are the other facilities to the room. You gotta leave the elevators and walk towards the escalators near their gift shop.
 
Last time I was here, you can use mobile check-in when you're coming and they'll contact you when room is available. I was able to mobile check-in while still driving in to Vegas! There's also a separate place in the lobby for you to check-in if you use mobile check-in. Unfortunately, you still are stuck with the $35 resort fee no matter how you check-in. 

Parking is not free either anymore, unless you have the MLife credit card or hold a MLife Pearl Level card. You have to use the card to get in and out without a cost. Oooh, and parking can get confusing since Aria is wedged up amongst Vdara, Cosmo, and the rest of CityCenter. Parking is off of Las Vegas Blvd as you turn onto Aria Place, but be vigilant to find the right lane to go to parking! Otherwise, you might get Vdara or somewhere else and it's hard to make a U-turn out in those tight quarters.

I love staying at Aria due to its relative newness and the nice big rooms with ceiling-to-floor windows. However, the design layout of the casino could be better. That said, I'll still come back if the price is right for a weekend stay!",4,1,0

However, the valet staff\/door people were extremely ride when it came to us trying to get an Uber pickup at the regular passenger pickup area. 

One Uber driver was downright scared to pick us up and we nearly had to cancel our ride (requiring a penalty to be paid) because the Uber driver was so scared to enter the complex. 

We were finally told by an Uber that there is an alternative pickup area (which is far more inconvenient). At no point did any valets share with us this location. 

We are under the impression that the valets must be receiving some sort of kickback from the cab companies by their unwillingness to help us get some sort of transportation other than a taxi cab. 

We were often forced to have the Uber pick us up in unsafe areas such as the side of the Las Vegas strip.",5,2,3

We went to javier's at aria and we weren't happy with a dish. They didn't want to take it off the bill and the manager called aria's security. They were rude and told us they will call the cops on us if we don't pay. I understand if they choose not to do anything about a customer satisfaction, but bringing up the fact that they wanna call the cops on their own hotel resident over not being happy with their food can totally ruin one's trip. It was unprofessional. They treated us like we were some peasants. We were paying so much for the room and room service and everything else to have a nice trip. But this one really ruined everything.
At the end we went to management and complained and they said they cant do anything about it and acted all careless. They really didn't care and i am not exaggerating. This is true story word by word.

We had one negative experience in a restaurant in Aria and the front desk staff when told of this at checkout bent over backwards to resolve the issue to our satisfaction.

Since our fully paid first stay at Aria, we have been offered various levels of comps each succeeding stay. We are lucky that due to our current level of play and our ongoing play on Myvegasrewards.com, we received six nights of room comps, as well as comps which covered all of our meals and shows, leaving us with a hotel bill only for tips at Mlife restaurants. We made sure to leave enough at the casino though to make up for it!!!

I guess we all have our individual expectations but I'm always surprised when reading any negative reviews of Aria. For us, we wouldn't stay anywhere else.

There are many tips I can offer to Aria guests to make your stays more enjoyable and maybe will do so in a future post or blog.

From the valets to the front desk folks to the maids, everyone was beyond friendly, helpful and chipper.  I really felt welcomed and at home by everyone we encountered.

The hotel itself is one of my favorites - sleek and modern design with fabulous art throughout to gawk at.  They were re-doing the carpet in the casino when we checked in and it was impressive to see how quickly and unobtrusively they worked - they really get how to take care of their clientele in every situation.

Our room was perfect - not the largest room of our Vegas trip, but definitely the best appointed.  The bathrooms are great (and lock if that's important to you) with a glassed in shower with rainfall shower head that is also right next to a giant bath tub.

The room's lights, temperature, television and window curtain \/ sheers are all operated by computer - handy for wake ups and the chronically lazy who hate getting out of bed to shut off that far lamp at night.

My only complaint about our Aria stay was that I felt like my belongings (toiletries in the bathroom, laptop \/ power cables \/ work stuff on the desk) were man handled way more than I'm used to.  

I get wanting to tidy up and replenish soap and water glasses, but I've never had a cleaning crew actually 'put away' things for me (as in -- put some of my toiletries into drawers and try to stuff the rest in a make up bag I left on the counter ---- they even piled papers and unplugged my computer to put on the chair so they could move hotel brochures back into their original place on the desk.  REALLY inconvenient as I was returning for a work conference call that I had set everything up for).

The only reason I mention this is that when moving all of my toiletries (multiple days in a row) a bottle of my perfume was broken after apparently falling out of my make up bag that I had zipped before leaving (weird) AND my glasses were bumped and had fallen into the trash.  The hotel responded amazingly well and took care of me to the max around the smashed perfume, but....  it still kept happening (even after I left a note politely asking the cleaning crew to take it easy).

I will absolutely be back, but will be sure to spend more time putting away my stuff before heading out each day.  Aria is a fabulous place to be!!",2,1,1

The tech features in the room were awesome; we loved being able to order room service, set and alarm, and control everything from the TV to the drapes to the music right from a tablet.  The hotel is extremely clean and inviting, with respectful and friendly employees.  There are lots of great restaurants and shopping within the Aria and, though they're a bit overpriced (we ARE in Vegas after all) they're a lot of fun.

I will say that three things were a bit of a disappointment:

- We arrived early, and were told that a room would be ready by 1:00 or 2:00.  Checkin was officially at 3:00.  However, at 4:30, we still didn't have a room, and had to talk to the front desk in order to get one.
- We ordered room service with a wait time of an hour; it took about an hour and a half to receive and food.
- We never received maid service in the two days we were there, though we turned on our service light.  On the day we were set to check out, the maid tried to enter our room even though the privacy light was on and it was before time to check out.

However, with the amount of guests they deal with on a regular basis and the outstanding experience as a whole, we'll still give it 5 stars!  We've stayed in 4 hotels on the Strip, and this is our favorite BY FAR!  Highly recommend.",0,0,0

This time, they stayed at the Aria for 4 days, so I got to see a lot of the hotel and experience different things. 
The casino itself was very nice indeed, This was late Wed - early Thursday, and the casino was probably at 15% capacity, so we could easily jump from game to game, table to table, and the table limits were low ($10 blackjack, roulette, and craps). The machines still cost much more to play (25 cent slots) than locals' casinos cost (nickel and penny slots). But the dealers and waitresses did their jobs great, and the overall atmosphere was very relaxed.
We went to a few different restaurants, and the food was good, but way too expensive for me to eat there more than once a year (breakfast was $25\/head , lunch $40\/head, and dinner was $100+\/head). But that's how all the Strip casinos are, so I can't fault them for that.
My friends were in suites, so they had room for me to crash. The rooms were nice, mainly for the fact that they weren't overly glitzy. Just a regular kitchenette, dining room, living room, bedroom, and bath. There was one thing that was strange, in comparison to other hotel rooms. We could hear the people talking in the room next to ours, even though they weren't talking very loud. We could hear almost every word. and they could hear us, for sure. There were 5 or 6 of us just hanging out talking. It wasn't even midnight, and we got security called on us twice telling us to keep it down. The walls much be paper thin.
Overall, a good time.",2,0,1

The room was in need of rehab, two different colors of paint on the door...The bed was a queen, although we reserved a king, and was uncomfortable- lumpy. The attendant at the front desk was very nice and assured us our bed was a king, and that they've gotten complaints before about the size of their Kings- again, I don't remember the bed being small before.

This will be my first time staying at the Aria.  I haven't even gotton to the hotel and I am already disappointed with the way they have been handeling things.  My company is having their annual sales meeting there in May and I had booked tix to fly out 2 days early with my husband to celebrate our 1 year anniversary.  Since the additional 2 days are not work related, I had called the hotel directly to book the additonal nights.  They informed me that they can't make changes to my reservation as it's booked thru a 3rd party and had instructed me to get in touch with that vendor.  After a complete run around which ended up being their fault.   Now it turns out the hotel is sold out of rooms on one of the days we plan to be in Vegas.  I have been to Vegas enough times to know what ""sold out"" means.   When circumstances call for it, you sell the guest an additional room especially if they are already staying at the hotel.  This is not the way to opperate at a hotel that just opened.

That was the chant I started at a blackjack table at the beautiful Aria (Hotel & Casino) every single time the dealer, Rudy, started to pass out cards. The highly intoxicated girl to the right of me with a slight North Carolina accent started to chant with me. Eventually, the two Chilean clients, who I had taken to dinner at Maggiano's with my manager earlier in the evening, began to chant along as well. 

""Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!""

Every so often, my manager would walk by and check on me to see how I was doing with the Chilean clients (and with reason since they were his biggest Latin American distributor). He wasn't gambling with us since apparently, gambling is against his religion. That's too bad. Gambling is how I was created. My daddy took his chances, pulled out, and I still won the biggest hand of his life.

""Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!""

The Chilean clients knew the chant as well as anybody. They had seen the movie ""Rudy"". They had also seen ""Star Wars,"" so my Star Wars sneakers were a hit with them. The drunk girl adjacent to me from North Carolina managed to put down her 12th glass of wine and 47th cigarette of the evening to say in Spanish, ""Esos zapatos son para niños.""

Roughly, that means ""those shoes are for children."" And well, that may be true. But luckily for me, the tipsy dipsomaniac from North Carolina was also Chilean and decided to reveal it at the table when she recognized the Spanish dialect of my clients. This helped make the table more comfortable (and even more fun) for my clients, as it became the rowdy Spanish speaking table. 

I managed to use my two years of college Spanish to play along. But for the most part, I marveled at the beauty and architecture of Aria. This is a good looking place. Seriously, I would love to stay here in the future.

In addition, the staff is excellent. They have a good sense of humor about things, namely Rudy, my favorite dealer of the evening. All the dealers were nice, and I liked that Aria never felt the need to bring out the limited English speaking dealer with no sense of humor that comes in to stop the fun and start making the house some money that every casino in Las Vegas seems to employ. Then again, I don't think they really use those at the ""high roller"" $15 blackjack tables. 

The server that kept swinging around was nice as well. She even giggled when I said, ""You see this $1 chip? This is yours if you make sure my Red Bull on the rocks is sugar free."" 

Not only was my Red Bull sugar free, she even laughed out loud when I added, ""Thank you for making it sugar free. I had an all you can eat dinner at Maggiano's and I am really watching my girlish figure."" 

For all I know, she was fake laughing. But I have never minded a woman that fakes it. Ignorance is bliss, right?

The time we spent at Aria was awesome. After about an hour, I even came out ahead $45. That's like $45 an hour. Maybe I should quit my job and move to the Vegas? Kidding. Well, sort of.

As I was about leave Aria when one of the Chilean guys wanted to go for a walk. During this walk, we found ourselves on another adventure. And this one involved karaoke.

i stood at this garbage hotel in april as a last minute thing. 

I checked into this hotel and had a HORRIBLE experience, from Customer Service to Room Cleanliness. When I got to the hotel, I waited 37 minutes just to check in, on top of that I was lied to about which room  I would be getting for the price I was splitting with my girlfriend. When I finally got into the hand me down room, I was looking around and went into the bathroom to see that area of the room, and looked in the toilet, and there was human waste waiting for me in there. I immediately called the operator, which took over 30 minutes to get a hold of 1 person to let them know what I just found, and I was not offered anything of interest in return. After not helping me at all, I asked the man to just transfer me to the bell hop desk so I can get my bags up to the room, and I was on hold again for the bell desk for over another 30 minutes, then waited another 20 minutes just to get my bags up to the room after the request.

After further inspection of the room, I saw the room was dirty. There was a layer of dust on everything, items were not placed in areas they most likely should have been. Just overall a very LOW experience for the value we were paying and after complaining about this to supervisors, getting nowhere.

when i complained to a manager, i was offered a $50 food credit...but since i have filed dispute with my credit company for the charge. i dont want a $50 food credit, i want my moola back.",0,0,0

Its important to choose a great hotel when doing Vegas right. Often times the hotel you stay at isn't just the one you snooze at but the one you gamble at, eat at, drink and party at. Its not like going to Hawaii. I would argue any old hotel in Hawaii would suffice as the beach is the main attraction. My point: don't skimp and get a cheaper, lesser hotel - get the best your budget allows.

Probably the one thing about Aria I don't like is that its direct neighbors in City Center are not as interesting as they could be. If you stay at Paris, for example, the neighboring hotel is the Cromwell and it offers lots and is easy and quick to get to without an Uber or Taxi necessary. That being said... everything you would ever want is within the Aria Resort, no need to leave.",1,2,3

How romantic and fun do the commercials for Aria make it out to be?  As a joke, my Bun kept on saying we wouldn't live up to looking like the models on the commercial the whole plane trip there.  I laughed.  Who cares if we don't! (Well, she has a cute thing going at least.)     

First thing you'll notice is the amazingly artistic architecture everywhere you turn.  It's photo op paradise in the whole resort.  I guess nowadays, all casinos are ""casinos and resorts"" to capture a wider audience, particularly for those who don't drink and gamble.  This place is beautiful.  The second thing I noticed was this special scent that was all over the inside of Aria.  I'm not sure exactly what, but vanilla and a hint of cinnamon come to mind.  The smell is very unique, and adds to the aura.

Our flight arrived earlier than normal, and so Bun and I attempted to check in.  Normally check in time is at 1, but not only did we get our rooms.  We got a free upgrade of the City Center View and a larger room.  To think we almost didn't take it because it was a smoking allowed room.  The lady working the counter was extremely nice and very helpful in getting us ready to go.  She even offered an ozone machine that would suck everything out of the room if need be, but she was certain it was fine.  

The layout of Aria is really elaborate.  A normal person can get lost their first time around.  For Bun and I, it took two to three trips around the place find where we were supposed to be.  The eyes in the sky probably saw these two knuckleheads rolling their luggage around the casino like headless chickens looking for their room.  After walking to the wrong side, and asking the security guy who checks key cards where our room was; we finally got the correct side of rooms labeled under a sign called ""Aria Sky Suites"".  I felt like a politician having the doors opened for me and greeted with ""how are you doing sir?"" by what seemed like everyone that worked there.  

Upon arrival to the front door, a glowy button catches my eye.  Holy Sh$t!  It's a door bell.  I've never seen that before.  I put the key card over the sensor and entered the room.  Yup, over the sensor, you don't have to feed it into something.  As I slowly opened the door, Bun and I entered to classical music softly playing in the background as the curtains automatically slid open to reveal a view.  Inside is furnished with some really cool stuff besides the remote for the curtains which I privileged myself with playing with for five exciting minutes.  A touch screen clock next to the bedside operates everything in the room from the temperature, television, and also those darn fun curtains.  

Need some room service?  They even have a phone installed right next to the toilet.  A feature I thought would be comical, but apparently not to people I've told.  Inside the bathroom was a very spacious shower and tub combo on the other side.  The cleaning service came three or four times a day.  While some may find an inconvenience, but I thought it was great considering they kept stockpiling my bedside chocolate mints.   

After taking advantage of the fitness center, located behind the spa, Bun and I hopped over to the pool area.  The pools outside are also something not to miss.  Laying down the towers of Vdara can be seen and one feeling being teleported to a whole different land.  We spent what felt like minutes which were actually hours there.  With free towel service, I recommend bringing your own suntan lotion or whatever other equipment you need for swimming.  The bottle of suntan lotion I bought at the little stand at the entrance came out to a whopping $20.  

All in all, Bun and I had an amazing time.  Even to this day, she still mentions to me that she wants to go back for R & R.   I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in Las Vegas for anything.  I noticed there were quite a few business conferences going on during our stay.

I'm not much for glass and chrome and from the outside that's what the Aria looks like. But inside- completely different- I was completely surprised. From check-in to day of departure, we were treated very well by everyone- from first class bars and restaurants to the great pool that provides both shade and sun- we had an excellent time! I loved walking through the grounds early in the morning to look at all of the artwork that is displayed in either shop windows or about the grounds. A map is available from the front desk that will provide a self guided tour of the art that is located all over the grounds.
One of the best features of Aria is that you don't have to walk for two hours to get anywhere- it's right on the strip if you want to stroll or there is a monorail that will take you from Bellagio to the Aria to the Monte Carlo and back again- for free. Even inside the hotel things are easy to get to. 
The rooms were very nice- new, modern. and clean. Pretty high tech- so I let my ""mad Russian"" handle all the electronics. There was a ""clock"" in the room that controlled all of the lighting and the motorized blackout curtains. Our view looked west toward Red Rock and we had great sunset views. We never saw the cleaning staff but when we arrived back at our room, all was made perfect again. The Shower\/Tub combination was cool- set inside a glass enclosure, the shower and tub were alongside one another. One morning, we filled the tub after a workout and watched an episode of Larry David on the ipad- just because we could...
The restaurants located in Aria were unbelievable- we ate at Todd English Pub, Julian Serrano, Cafe Vettro, and American Fish- (see reviews posted). All were great and the service provided was excellent. If you want to have a great meal, start right in your Hotel\/ Casino if you're staying at the Aria.
On our trip to the pool, we were met by a friendly young girl who after seeing the fair skin of my lovely date, and my olive skin, found us a spot at the pool that provided a little shade for her and a lot of sun for me- right next to each other! A note about the bar service at the pool, don't be shocked when you get the bill for the first round of two drinks, and it's $51-- to be fair though, the drinks were in big cups (that you get to keep) and the drinks were delicious-- she had a skinny cosmo and I had a mojito.
All told, I was very pleased with this resort and casino- and I look forward to coming back again- In a town that has everything, the Aria really shines!!",15,11,13

We got the the hotel around 8pm.... and was told that there were no more double rooms.. when we had requested one online (although we were told it is only a preference).... all they had were king beds left....

Meanwhile.. our friends get in at 8:15... and they somehow get the LAST double bed room......... doesn't seem right.

There was no way we could stay in a room with 1 king size bed.. for two couples? My bf and my friend's bf spoke to several people.. argued for about 45 minutes, was told that the hotel was 90% capacity and 100% capacity the next day... etc etc.. just lots of excuses.

At the end of all of it... there was some sort of compromise that made us all satisfied, including a cot in the room and a discount by the hotel. I would have rather just got what we had requested in the first place without all the hassle.

The room was pretty but nothing extravagant.. the only above the top highlight was  the curtains that opened as you walked in.

The interior is very fancy with laser cut pieces, and high ceilings.

imho, I would stay at another hotel next time for the shopping and more traditional and well known vegas highlights.",5,0,0

    When I walked into the room the sheer and blackout curtains opened up.   Nice.   The room had a very modern and state of the art feel.   It wasn't like when I first walked into a room at the Palazzo and said holy shit!   I didn't have that opulent feel here.  I was happy, comfortable and the view was spectacular.   
   The bathroom was interesting.   The dual sinks really didn't allow for much counter space.   The bathtub is behind the shower stall.   The bathroom fan was a bit loud and was on constantly.   There was no switch to turn it off and you could hear it with the bathroom door open.  It was a bit of an inconvenience to pull the door shut all the time.
   I did order room service and had the sea bass.  It made me feel like I was in a nice restaurant because for 29 dollars the portion was pretty small.  The room service menu a little more expensive than most and the selection isn't very extensive.
   I used the gym once which was 30 dollars a day.   The gym was pretty large compared to most of the hotel gyms.  It has a lot of cardio equipment with individual television screens with headsets and not too many weights and weight lifting equipment but enough to have a good workout.   Somebody came around offering hot, damp towels.  Like many of the LV hotel gyms it closes at 8 pm.  Get out of our gym and lose some money.  
   If you self park, it's a good distance to the room elevators but not as bad as the MGM.

Out of all the resorts on the strip it really is one of the most beautiful ones you can step into. From the moment we stepped in until the moment we left the service was amazing. Staff was friendly and very attentive. I appreciate the fact that the layout of the resort is simple and easy to follow. The art when you step first step inside the lobby is absolutely mesmerizing. The view of the strip from our room was breathtaking. We weren't able to spend too much time in the hotel until the last two days of our stay due to our schedules but every time we stepped into our room we were reminded why we chose this resort.

The only reason I'm giving them four out of five stars is because the nights we were actually able to stay at the hotel and explore, our bathroom was out of service. We tried to reach them several ways but maintenance never came. On our last night there, we ended up going to a restaurant on the strip to grab a bite to eat and use their restroom because I needed a good night's sleep before catching my flight.

At check out they were understanding about the issue and apologetic about the lack of service. They did credit us for the inconvenience without hesitating which we did not expect them to do. There is so much to do in the resort alone that I advise taking a day to just explore the place. We saw the Zirkana cirque du soleil show there which was spectacular! The mall is beautiful, full of amazing art. The view from our room was spectacular and I absolutely fell in love with the bathtub\/shower area.

Also, the water elements outside are really pretty.  (Not in the same league as the Bellagio fountains, but worth a stop nonetheless.)

However, it really does show that they dont put in as much effort as the other places on the strip such as mandarin, wynn and cosmo. 

Check in line was about 45 min, the longest I've ever had to wait. Upon arrival, the bedsheet on my bed had a giant rip in it. I dont understand how housekeeping can miss this. I called housekeeping to change the sheets, and that is the only night they provided turn-down service. So it seems like they only do it if you ask?

Additionally, the room was very dusty, and I got a rash the following morning. Not sure if its the bed or something, but it was very unnerving. The casino floor also has poor circulation because the ceilings are low, they also don't have very many tables either. I spent most of my time gambling in bellagio.

Their gym was clean however, and had a nice view of the pool. Other nice touches are the chocolates left at turn down and their robes are super light and comfy. Our room was on the 36th floor and we got a nice view of Tropicana road. Their curtains are electronic as well.

The machines were ok, but nothing really new and exciting.  Table limits too high for the average player.  $15-25 min craps is too much for me.  I only could play early morning when there was $10 min.  If you are a poker player this seems like the place to be as the rooms is constantly full. 

They have great restaurants, such as Jean Georges, Tetsu, and Bar Masa, but not the food is not as good as their counter parts in NYC.  Jean Phillipe is our favorite place in aria.  The desserts are so awesome.  Overall my 3rd fav hotel after MGM and Cosmo.

The rooms are plush and very modern, equipped with automated lights and curtains. The bathroom was very spacious and elegant.I would have probably given this 5 stars but held back due to a few reasons:
Our room was not cleaned for the first couple of days and we had to actually go down to the lobby and talk to the day manager to make sure it was done.
Apart from the buffet,which provided a wide variety and was pretty satisfying, I would say none of the other restaurants could justify the prices they charge. The Skybox was pretty average as was the Union bar.The restaurants backed by the celebrity chefs were at best average,although we never tried the Bar Masa. The Jean Phillipe patisserie was definitely good, although on the pricier side.
We had a good experience gambling there, the casino was nice and big and not smoky. The dealers were friendly in general.Table minimums do go up on the weekends though and sadly, they had only one ""Let It Ride"" table.

Aria is usually way overpriced (which most big hotels in Vegas are during their first year or two of hype), so I seriously doubt I would have stayed here if it wasn't for the two free nights.

However, what impressed me was that I asked to use the two free nights during the CES conference week. Hotels in egas are usually double during this busy week, so I assumed that week would be blacked out, but they let me use it! That made these two free nights worth almost $1,000! Plus, they gave me a room overlooking the strip. We're off to a good start!

I was amazed at how quickly they got me checked in despite the busy week. Obviously I knew the room would be nice since this is a newer hotel and high end, but it's a very high tech room too. When I walked in the room, the curtains automatically opened and the TV came on with a welcome message with my name on it, and a short video showing me how to use everything in the room. They have a little touch screen tablet near the bed that allows you to control everything in the room. So if you forgot to deadbolt the door, you can do it while laying in bed. You can control the curtains, the AC & heat, the TV, the lights, etc. Pretty cool.

The only real bummer about this place (other than the price if your paying for your room) is that it's not very well laid out in my opinion. It's shaped like a big arc, so if your room is not near the elevator, you will have an insanely long walk back and forth. 

Also, Aria is in City Center which I find to be one of the most confusing layouts of any area on the strip. But the location on the strip is very central so thats a plus. 

So as a free weekend, this was a no brainer 5 star experience. But if I was paying for my room, I'd say it's a solid 3.5-4 star choice on the strip. But I doubt I'd ever pay the normal $300\/night rate for it.",0,0,0

Perhaps there is a disconnect with cultures, as many of the rude staff were obviously not native English speakers... Perhaps they can do some sensitivity training and at least try to not come off as rude, short, annoyed, and disrespectful. There did not seem to be much management available.

We also decided to take our two best friends (who have never been to Vegas).  After careful deliberations, the Aria was top on our list.  

Ok, first impression:  the hotel is enormous!  The lobby décor is just ok, and if you want to skip the long check in line, use the app, but you might not get the room you wanted with that.  When we arrived at 11am our room was not ready yet, and they said that they would send us a text when the room was ready.  We opted for the mountain view because strip view was $30 more per day.  Around 2:30, we received the text and to our surprise, our room was on partial strip view.  We could see the mountains, the Cosmopolitan next door and Planet Hollywood across the street, with partial views of other hotels.  

The room itself is huge!  The bathroom is probably the best I've seen at a hotel.  We love the shower with a tub right next to it, and also the double vanity was a bonus especially with a husband and wife.  At first I was a little confused about where the controls for the blinds were, and then I remembered that they were on the ipad controls.  It's really cool how you can access everything from that.  The room really darkens great with the blinds, which is perfect when napping in the afternoon.  There is an in room safe, but you really have to look for it because it's really not easy to find.  **Be careful of the mini-bar.  You take something and put it back, you might get charged for it.  My friends didn't even touch their mini bar and were charged, but they did get it taken off the bill.  The one thing about these rooms that they are very very quiet. We did not hear a peep from anybody in any of the rooms around us. 

The Cosmopolitan hotel has a bar\/club right next door and on the weekends it really gets loud.  We were on the 29th floor of the Aria and man could we hear the music.  I can just imagine the sound if you were actually there.  So here's a tip....if you want some piece and quiet during the day on the weekends, ask for a room that does not face that hotel.  

Because we were so hungry on that first day we decided to go downstairs to the Aria Café to grab lunch.  Yes, the time change had us all out of whack.  The meal was ok, but was a little pricey.  $100 for 4 people is a bit pricy for lunch.  On the other end of the spectrum, we ate at the Aria buffet on our last night there.  Because my wife and I played the Konami slots on our Iphones, we gathered enough points for two 2-1 buffets there.  Let me tell you, they have every kind of food that you would ever want.  I think the only food I didn't see was Indian, and I probably didn't look hard enough.  From the salad to the prime rib to the seafood to the Italian food, it was all excellent.  Our server; I believe her name was Yesssie, was excellent!  She was probably the hardest worker there.  It was amazing to see her carry all those plates without dropping a single thing.  Kudos to her and the rest of the staff.  BTW, we were all so full when we left there.  This buffet is much better than the Bellagio's.  

The casino is very nice and open and does get loud at times, but that is really because of the live music and the pumped in music.  If you want to get comps, make sure you get an MLife card.  We didn't really gamble as much as others, and we got two nights room convenience fees removed from the bill.  

As I said earlier, this place is enormous.  You can, and will, get lost at times.  They need to make the signs a little more clearer for the guest elevators because they are kind of hidden.  The Aria is part of the City Center area that has the Vdara, and the Mandarin Oriental hotel.  There is also a very pricey mall there (ya, my wallet just jumps out of my pocket when I walk past those stores).  Id say what the Aria was missing was a food court area (unless I just didn't see it).  There is also a free tram that takes you from the Aria\/ Monte Carlso, to the Vdara, and to the Bellagio.  I'd like to see tram go the other way like to the New York, Excalibor, Luxor, and Mandaly Bay.  

The one thing that the Aria really needs to work on is their sports book area. The ones at Bellagio and Caesars were much bigger and nicer. This one seems like it was just kind of put in the back as an afterthought. And it really gets crammed in there on Weekends. 

All in all, it was a great trip and would definitely stay at the Aria again.",1,0,0

From the moment we got there we were disappointed. We were exiting our limo when a bell hop came over to us and asked to take and hold our bags as we go to check in.

He insisted and promised that they will have our luggage up in 5 minutes. LIE. When we called down for our luggage they said 25-30 minutes. We explained the situation as well as our conversation with the bell hop and got ""Well why don't you just come down here and get it yourself"" as a response. (Strike 1)

Once in our room and unpacking we notice that there is dust everywhere. Not just in a few odd places, but EVERYWHERE. The table in between the two beds had a sheet of dust covering it, looked like no one had cleaned it in weeks. There was a leftover open snack on the counter. The bathroom floor had hair. We got a dirty room. We decided not to make a big deal of it as housekeeping will clean the room the following day. WRONG. The following day we did not leave our room until 2PM and housekeeping had still not showed up. No big deal. When we returned that evening our room was ""cleaned"". ""Cleaned"" meant they made the bed. They left the dust. They left the garbage. They left the pile of used, dirty towels and did not give us new towels. (Four girls, one room.. we need towels). We called down to request new towels, 20 minutes later someone brought us 2 towels.  (Strike 2)

When we checked in we asked for a late check out on the day we leave because we have a reservation for 5 girls at the hotel spa at 2PM.

What do you know we are told to check out no later than noon and if we would like to stay and check out at 2 they will gladly charge us for the extra half day. Not to mention housekeeping came at 9AM banging on the door, not to clean the room but to see if we would like to have it cleaned later on. Are you kidding me? (Strike 3) 

If you have AT&T good luck. Hit or miss on your service and it doesn't matter if you are using 3G or the hotel Wi-Fi the Internet is horrible, mine worked in only 3 spots in the room. Every call ended in a drop call. For as high tech the room is I expected outlets everywhere. WRONG. No outlets by the bed. The only 2 outlets they have available in the room are on the table on the opposite side of the room. Hope you don't have to plug more than 4 things in. (Again 4 girls, 4 phones.. and then there is a camera, a notebook etc.. but I guess charging electronics in the bathroom outlet by the sink is acceptable at Aria). 


The hotel itself including the casino floor does not have that Vegas smoke smell. The guest elevators are at a very inconvenient place. You check in and have to literally go through half of the casino to make it to the elevator. 
The room itself was very dark and had almost no lighting. The hotel and rooms are very high tech, however the bedside remote to control the room is extremely bright. They have black out curtains that are opened\/closed by remote and various buttons throughout the room, however when closed they do not work, light comes in. 
The towels remind me of the cheap motel type. They were sandpaper rough. I expected some nice soft plush towels and robes instead I got motel towels. 
The beds are very comfortable, so are the pillows.",18,13,6

It's the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in I just had to have it. I contemplated on stealing it somehow, but I guess that would've been difficult with it being so big and all. 

My husband thought I was insane and ridiculous, but said he wishes there was a way for me to get it because if there was a way, he would.  He probably just said that to shut me up, but hahaha, jokes on him, because GUESS WHAT! YOU CAN! I bought the mattress from the gift shop. I knew this level of comfort was insane to not profit from. Aria Hotel is so smart that they branded their own custom mattresses and offer people to purchase it from their very own gift shop and they deliver it right at your home.

The architecture is stunning.  The architecture is problematic when you feel like you'll need sunscreen for the long wait at hotel check-in or check-out or when you notice that the desk clerks have to cover the screens with their bodies to do their jobs because of the glare.

The room is loaded with cool tech, but it works sporadically.  Some times lights come on, sometimes they don't.  The bathroom faucets are really neat, until you turn them up too high and they spray you.  The footing on the marble slab shower pan is scary.

The basics have been overlooked.  Despite the neat little applications on my TV, I can't check out from the TV in the room.  The check-in\/check-out process is a disaster.  If you think you're going to cut it close on your escape to the airport, good luck, you're probably won't make it.  You have to walk at least a football field's distance from the front entrance to the taxi stand.

I was checking in early at around 10.30am and all lines were marked as check-out. There were ten of us trying to figure where to check-in.  I was a little surprised they didn't have this process totally streamlined. The guy that checked me in was very nice though.  I called in advance to ask for a non-smoking floor and it seemed he had no idea I even made a request about it.  Luckily they did have a non-smoking room available.

Hotel: 4
I liked the modern decor of the room and throughout the hotel.  The flowing water wall outside is pretty.  You can definitely tell it's a newer hotel and it's even LEED certified as a green building.  The ventilation is very good and it's not as smoky as the other hotels.  The center location is great and you can easily walk to other resorts.  My main complaint is with the vanilla aroma that they pump through their ventilation system in the lobby area.  Perhaps I just really don't like vanilla.

Room 4
The room was pretty spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  I really liked the six fluffy pillows and the warm down comforter.  The bathroom had a shower and a tub (although no jets).  All the lights and curtains can be controlled through the TV remote.  My friend complained that there was no coffee in the room.  A few extra glasses would also be nice.

Pool: 3.5
Three pool are surrounded by loungechairs and cabanas.  Overall it's a good pool if you want to get a tan and relax.  However the pools are only 3""6' deep, so it's more for soaking versus swimming.  I wish one of these pools was deeper and made for swimming laps.   Finding a loungechair in the shade can be hard sometimes.  Also there is barely a few inches between the loungechairs, which could be good or bad.  :-)  There were a few girls serving drinks, which was nice.    A separate pool lounge called Liquid provides a more festive environment, but you have to spend $200 to get a daybed to lay down.  I think they charge an entrance fee, but we used the free admission tickets (for ladies only) that we got at the hotel.

Aria Pros:
- Tables never crowded
- Dim lighting\/less crowded\/noise a little refreshing
- Bed is very comfortable (although stay in non-smoking room)
- Chill gelato\/sorbet is quite good.. I recommend the coconut
- Less uptight crowd than Wynn etc., but better crowd than lower end 
-
Aria Cons:
- Staff do not know where certain restaurants are, let alone they exist.  Was informed Lemongrass the only late night restaurant open, yet no one could find it and majority of staff never heard of it.  Eventually, staff directions led us to the road out front, where we took a cab and ate at the Palazzo.

- Housekeeping did not pick up phone on two occassions.  Phone just kept ringing.  I was a bit incredulous the second time.  

- Aria advertising 2x a day turnaround service.  We left our service indicator on at 5pm and returned at 12am.. and the light was still on and of course no service.  This was not the same day housekeeping did not pick up the phone.  Conclusion: below average service at Aria (cost cutting I assume to reduce staff).

- Was put in a SMOKING OPTIONAL ROOM.  I was told non-smoking rooms were already checked-into.  Check-in starts at 12PM and I showed up at 3PM.  I should have cancelled right there but didn't.  Check-in counter says its OK due to air filtration system.. and when you walk in it actually isn't so bad (combination of new construction and air filter system).. but the sheets smell like my smoke.  My GF was pretty unhappy.  NOT OK.

- Food menu at pool is extremely boring\/simple.  Ended up doing takeout from restaurant and waiting 20 min for it there.  [a tip: call ahead from restaurant and then pickup once you get to pool etc.]

- Buffet had 35 minute wait to get in.  Buffett was OK, but presentation not great, ambience was a teacher's lounge, and you waited 35 minutes to get in.  

- A single file cab line will take 10 minutes to get a cab, that is after you walk the 10 minutes to get there.  single-file cab lines work at other hotels with less rooms, multiple distribution points etc.  Reminded me of NY Penn Station cab taxi line.  

- Nightlife is a ZERO.  Clubs here suck.  Period.  Why other clubs are outdoors, have waterfalls, pools..  Aria's has a big stand, velvet rope, doormen and a box.   I think it was due to cost cutting again. 

- Architecture is generally sterile.  Its like pulling up to an airport.  and then getting a smoking room to boot.  Very contemporary, but a personal preference I guess.  That said, there are pros (above) 

- Botero at Wynn is an experience.. where is that restaurant at Aria?  It's not there.  Jean George was fine, but overpriced for the location and what you received.  The Serrano food was good, but ambience much too casual to make it a nice meal vs. a casual meal.  

- Lighting controls at Aria are a comical debacle.  I turned off lights somehow when my GF was in shower and it was pitch black and took 5 minutes of fumbling to figure out how to turn it back on.  Sometimes folks can overengineer something.. the light switches were overengineered.

The bait'n'switch on the smoking room was probably the worst thing.  Could have been avoided if I just booked Wynn or Palazzo which were equivalent room rates.  If I was comped a room at Aria I would stay again.. but on strict conditions for non-smoking vs. bait-n-switch the last time around.  If I was paying for a room, I would stay elsewhere... most likely Wynn.  I am nervous that if this is Aria service today.. what will it look like in 5 years when its a little more run down?  I feel like Aria was rushed and shows evidence of cost-cutting.. which is a shame because only a few more touches would help greatly (more staff, better trained staff, re-doing night clubs, re-visiting service flows)",0,0,0

The wall coverings throughout the hotel make you want to remodel your house, WITH WALLPAPER!  They even used what appears to be upholstery in some of the hallways.  

The drapes and lights were all remote control, probably not the best idea to set your honey down with the controls while you are showering, you may end up in the dark!

One of the worst hotel experiences I've had in a very long time; most of the hotel guests felt the same. For being such a new and young hotel, they should really have their act together. The check in staff was rude, unprofessional and unacknowledged about the facility and amenities. We had reservations for a room with two beds on a non smoking floor, when we arrived we were told we were out of luck and that they only had rooms with a king size bed on a smoking floor and they would provide a roll away bed. This is totally unacceptable and the only compensation they offered was to have someone come up and air pout the room with oxygen to try to rid of the smoky smell - which never even happened because no one knew what the front desk was talking about. After much going back and forth and changing rooms twice- we had to settle for just that, except that they got us in a room on a non smoking floor. I absolutely refused to stay in a smoky room on a smoky floor. 
We had spa services scheduled on Saturday morning.... the facility was not impressive and not as clean as one would expect and the rates for their services is over priced for what you get. 

Overall their staff is unprofessional and really don't understand what customer service really is. The management team should get on the ball and provide some coaching on how to speak to and deal with hotel guests. Anytime I asked for directions on where certain areas were located in the hotel, the response was just someone pointing their finger to a hotel elevators up with that?

I was hoping that the grand opening kinks with the messy check-in system would be worked out by the time we stayed here.  No such luck.

Through an awesome deal I found online, we booked two rooms - a corner suite and the deluxe room city view.  Neither one of the rooms were ready as promised and the deluxe room wasn't ready until 7:30 PM!  A good 4 1\/2 hours after check-in time.  Ridiculous.  We had to move our dinner reservations that night until 9:30 PM.

The corner suite was definitely awesome but we had requested non-smoking and ended up with a smoking room.  We were in a hurry to get ready for dinner so never bothered to switch suites.  It comes with two bathrooms, very convenient for the times my friends in the deluxe room came over to party in our suite as they could use the outside bathroom.

It took us awhile to figure out the technology in the room.  I find it ironic that Aria is a LEED Gold Certified Green Building but a lot of energy is just wasted since we're forced to open and close the curtains electronically.  Though it definitely was pretty cool and made for some funny times when a friend accidentally shut the entire room off while I was in the middle of taking a shower.  Everything got really dark.  Nice prank you can play on your friends!

Housekeeping was extremely responsive.  We called for a roll away bed in the middle of the night and they showed up within 15 minutes.  Also found some trash in our ice bucket that was leftover from previous residents (along with some beer in our fridge...thanks!) and housekeeping came to take it away.  They also brought back our ice bucket full of ice even though we didn't request it.  Nice.  Every time they did turn down service on our sheets, we got different chocolates - chamomile, green tea, raspberry.  

The Casino:
Since Aria is new, it's not smoke-laden like many of the other casinos.  The architecture is also very dramatic with high-ceilings.  Never once did I feel suffocated which is unlike the feeling in MGM Grand or Bellagio.  The ceilings there are really low compared to that of Aria's.

We were happy to discover the minimums go down when you gamble at an odd hour of the night\/morning such as 4 AM.  $5 Blackjack Switch and Casino War.  haha.  Fun times.

Just getting in and out of Aria was a hassle.  You have to walk all the way back to City Center from The Strip.  Since we stayed in a Corner Suite, we also had to walk to the end of the hallway.  Because of the inconvenience, I won't be staying here again though it was mostly fun while it lasted.",3,0,0

This was our first stay here and decided to take them up on a offer for 3 nights. Overall we enjoyed our stay it was a good escape from the usual Mirage. The good outweighed the bad and to make this review as simple as possible I'll just list them. 

The pros: beautiful casino floor with good table minimums. 
        -nice room features like tub in shower room. Private door for toilet. Tv guide feature. Power curtains and able to change temp through tv or tablet. 
  - room service was better than par for Vegas being 24\/7 full menu is nice...shrimp quesadilla and wings were our fav .
 - good location on the strip

Cons:
 - can be a long long walk to your room and we've stayed at a lot of hotels in Vegas it seems to be one of the longest. 
  - if you self park its a very long walk from lobby to garage..might as well use valet.
 - not a lot of outlets for a new tech hotel. 
  
 Can't say anything about Elvis show or the restaurants in the aria because none caught our eye.
Our stay overall was better than good and would recommend it to anyone",0,0,0

The bathroom was huge and nicely done, the bed was comfortable, and the entire suite was spacious and well laid out. We enjoyed a great view, both day and night, and there was nothing about our stay that we did not like.

I am a frequent traveler and I appreciated the variety of things we were provided with - from toothbrushes to shaving razors to bath soaps. Very nice!

We did not really order any food as we were eating out and we never had to call the front desk for anything as there was nothing else we needed. The check-in and check-out process was very fast and easy. Absolutely enjoyable!",1,0,2

BEST PLACE TO STAY IF YOU LIKE PAYING  $300 A NIGHT TO BE TREATED LIKE DIRT!..................This is my second time in Las Vegas and I was very excited to be staying at the Aria Hotel and Resort. I heard great things about it from a  friend who has stayed there many times. It got great reviews and i figured, that being that it's a 5 star hotel, i'd have the best accomodations while enjoying Las Vegas. I booked the room through the hotel and planned on having a fun weekend. My partner and I drove 5-6 hours from San Diego. Upon checkin, we were told that the room i'd asked for was no longer available, as i'd asked when booking the reservation, for a room with a city view. I proceeded to ask  the clerk, whom was dishing up the attitude, why that had happened and she told me that because of the weekend that they had sold out. When i tryed to pay with a debit card she made me sign an additional document  stating that she was going to hard-charge the card for the full amount of the stay.  She acted like i was inconveniencing her and asked if i wanted to speak to the manager (That is NOT good customer service!). I replyed, irately, ""Yes!"". She stood there, blank-faced, until i asked her to get a manager again. The manager, Ryan Gregory, came over and....I have to say, I've never before been treated with such disreguard by a hotel manager . The first thing he said to me when he came up to the desk was ""I was overhearing the conversation (which tells me he'd already made up his mind about what was going on) and what I can do for you, is this! For an additional $40 a night i can give you a room with a city view."". I replyed, ""She (the clerk) just said that those rooms are sold out, a minute ago! How is it that all of a sudden, for $40 more a night, there is an availability"". Ryan says "" Well we would take it from another hotel guest"". I found this unfail to not only myself, but to the other hotel guest that had made that reservation. I declined to pay the extra for the room I had originaly asked for. The clerk comes back and, even more sullen and sour than before, starts going through the do's and don't of the room. I found her insolent tone  particularly offensive when she avised me ""not to touch any of the amenities, as I would be automaticaly charged for it. I replyed,' Wow! Can I sleep on the bed?""...I get up to my room to take a nap after my long drive only to be awakened by a friend of mine, also from San Diego who is staying at the MGM Grand. I answer the phone and it him telling me that he's in the lobby ( I'd asked him to meet me for dinner)  and that they won't let him up. I understand that this is policy for some hotels, but i didn't even get a call from the cleck, whom was being a total jerk to him also! I called the front desk manager, Elijah, to help me out, to no avail! I had to jump out of bed, put clothes on and physically go down through the casino and all the way to the front desk to ""collect"" my guest, half asleep, just to have the clerk give me a smarmy ""You're welcome"" before rolling her eyes and making some low-brow joke about us to the next guest. Incidentaly, my guest has stayed at the Aria many, many times and says he's NEVER been treated so rudely (as we're riding in the elevator with some dirty towels wadded up on the floor of it, that remained there for a few hours, i might add) . He will not be back. I called Ryan Gregory (the hotel manager) again to complain and see why I was being treated like this (in a 5 star hotel at a whopping  $280 per night). I was on hold for nearly 20 minutes, then when i finally spoke to him, he proceded to tell me that ""No one was rude to me and that everything (negative)  that had happened was all a result of having had problems with my card and his staff following procedure. I told him that i was feeling as if though he and his staff were treating me as if though they were doing me a favor by letting me stay at the  Aria. He said that he was not being rude in any way, that he'd actually TRIED to help me. Fed up with his and everyone's attitude, i asked him to cancel the rest of my stay, as i'd booked the room for 3 nights. He said, very condisendingly, ""It would be my pleasure!"" and hung up on me. I will never stay here again.  My bill was nearly $300 for one night of hell at the Aria Hotel! Sometimes, you DON'T get what you pay for!!  I've NEVER, EVER payed that much money to be insulted, disreguarded and disrespected in my entire life. A simple apology would have pacified the situation. I checked out the following morning and booked a room at New York New York for much, much  less. The room was not as lavish or luxurios, but the clerk, her name was Mila, was so very friendly and helpfull that i was inclined to tell her so! We had no problems whatsoever and they were able to find us the room that we wanted! I WILL NEVER STAY AT THE ARIA HOTEL AGAIN! Save your money and go someplace friendlier!",3,0,0

We were a group of women spread between 2 rooms, and they were happy to put our rooms next to each other when we asked.  Awesome!

The fact that everything in the room (the lights, the drapes, the TV, etc) could be controlled from this little touch screen thing next to the bed was cool, although I must admit I wasn't the most proficient at controlling things.  I could see how a senior citizen might get super confused just trying to control the TV.

The beds were ultra comfy and provided a great night's sleep.

The relaxing, deep bathtub with bath salts was a nice touch as well.

We got a great price for our stay over the weekend...$160 per night.  We also got an extra $100 resort credit which we used towards dinner one night.",0,0,0

I'll start by saying that the Aria is a beautiful hotel BUT the customer service and care is absurd for the amount of money you have to spend there. Let's start by saying when we first got there no one offered to bring our bags up to the room which most resorts do. Then I needed to use a desktop or laptop for a few minutes to confirm something so I went to the business center that most hotels allow people to use for free and was informed that I would have to pay $1 per MINUTE to use it. I think that is ridiculous for how expensive this resort is.  And this is just the beginning. We had leftovers later that night that we wondered if they could warm up...of course they could not without a fee. Then when we asked for a fork and spoon we were informed that it would be 1.50 PER UTENSIL. Theres no bottled water in the room unless u want to pay 5.50. Way to go Aria your customers cant get water while in the desert. While I could go on, I'll just say I will not be back at this resort no matter how beautiful it is, I've never had my patronage so unappreciated or been nickeled and dimed the way I was here. Do yourself a favor and take the large chunk of your money to 1 of the other beautiful resorts in Vegas. There's a plethora of them!",0,0,0

The tower suites come with a comp limo round trip limo service.  I was greeted by the awesome Maurice at baggage claim. He ushered me into the champagne colored stretch. As soon as we pulled up in the hotel driveway, a gal came to greet me curbside and ushered me into the special check in lobby for suite guests. The lobby featured complimentary drinks and snacks. Very pleasant and friendly faces in there. 

The room was almost a 1000 Sq feet of tastefully decorated space. Highlights included the floor to ceiling windows with a super sexy view of the strip at night, the 1.5 baths, the turn down service where they even tie your phone cords into a neat knot, and the jet tub.

We initially were assigned a room far before anticipated... score!  ...on the 4th floor... crud.  So we headed to the check in desk and were given the option to wait for the 39th floor.   Yes, we'll wait.  They said they'd notify us when ready.  Perfect, we'll go wander for a bit. 

The wait was likely longer than it needed to be as we weren't actually provided a room until my guy went to see what the scoop was (about 6hrs later) and he was informed we could head right up.  That being said,  the wait was worth it!  Great view, great room!  Pretty quiet,  though I could see it being noisy on busy late nights... 

They did a bang up job with roses (set up as a sweet surprise from my Valentine)  and the spa is fabulous!  Wonderful masseuse, hot stone beds,  Himalayan salt room, a coed lounge where you can wait together for couple's treatments.  ...can I go back yet?",1,0,1

It seemed like they cut a lot of corners when making this place. First, there was no line when I walked in. I don't know if they are trying something new at this place or what but the concept does not work. You have a melee of people trying to get a spot and no one to really guide what's going on. My buddy who was also staying there ended up waiting 40 minutes when his key didnt work and he had to get a new one. Terrible service. 

Once up to the room, you get surprised with the automatic blinds and a great looking room but that's where things end. My bed was collapsed on one end...how does this happen in a new hotel and how do they not replace it? The walls were paper thin. I could hear everyone's conversations! It didnt matter if there were yelling or talking at a normal level...I could hear it. 

Out of the room things were no better. Try to eat in the hotel and you will pay top dollar for average food. The buffet will charge you extra for their weekend brunch when its simply no more than left overs from the week prior (trust me I ate there about 3 or 4 times and the items were starting to get old). They did have some interesting things on the menu such as goat but it hardly justified the price. I also went for a burger in the main cafe type restaurant and ended up having to pay extra for every addition on top of the bun and meat. I think I ended up with a $25 burger that I could have gotten at Burger King for less than $5....my total meal with drink and salad came out to over $40!. 

The hotel bars were ok but became over crowded as there isnt much to do here and you're always looking to go else where. I also don't like over whelming smells and the air fragrance they pump into the hotel is absolutely obnoxious. I could actually smell people at my convention who had been staying at the Aria because you could smell that horrible fragrance.

The property was beautiful but the rooms were fairly average.  I travel regionally for work and often find myself staying at mid priced hotels in remote areas, such as Holiday\/Comfort Inns.  The room at the Aria was worse than almost all of the hotels I've stayed at that were far cheaper.  The personell were OK, most were polite but there were no real services.  For the right price I would have stayed here again but for two major flaws with the room.  No coffee maker in the room and no power outlets near the bed.  I was constantly switching phones, computer and cameras in the outlets to keep them charged.  I brought my laptop to watch my local ondemand and a couple of DVDs in bed so that I wouldn't be stuck with hotel cable.  Unfortunatly my cord would not reach the bed, which meant I had a dead laptop after a few hours, and as I stated, most of the time there were other things plugged in to the outlets.  Also, without a coffee maker I had to go to the casino\/lobby pre shower to get a cup of coffee which incidently cost $4.27.  Lastly they don't allow you to choose which type of room until you check in.  We checked in after midnight and being a smoker, I wanted a smoking room.  This resulted in a switch from a King to a room with two very small queens, so I had a choice, smoke or sleep with my wife.  I won't tell you which I chose.  One last compaint was the touch panel next to the bed. The time and date were way off and I couldn't figure out how to fix it, therefore everytime I tried to set an alarm I had to do math and I couldn't use the alarm in my phone because it was usually plugged into the outlet across the room.  I called the front desk twice to see if they could fix the time, but neither time did they pick up.  On the positive side, the casino is nice, the food was decent but way overpriced for what you got.  The buffet had a great breakfast which was reasonably priced, but the dinner was $30.00\/pp and was average or just above. The pool area was great, plenty of shade, the waitresses were polite and efficient, but again, if you get a drink at the pool its going to cost you at least $8.00 and most likely $12.00.  My wife and I spent almost $60.00 on drinks at the pool in about 3-4 hours.  

Other than the lack of a King\/Smoking room, check in was good and the desk clerk was very polite.  The concierge was very helpful on a few occasions, except they need to learn the taxi prices, was told a taxi to someplace would be about $12, it was $25, this happened twice.  The 24 hour cafe was good, but if you order the nachos, beware, there is no salsa, which made them very dry.  

Summary, everything was very pretty, but fairly useless.  I will not stay at the Aria again.",0,0,0

Whoever designed that place put their foot in it. I love modern design and this place was out of this world. The beds were so comfy and soft. I wanted to take the pillows home with me. Our stay was flawless. We had no issues and the room was cleaned well. At first when I heard the negative reviews I thought that maybe I spent too much on the room. But after I got there and saw the room and the city view and the rest of the hotel I decided that it was well worth my money. I felt as if I got what I paid for. The food is good at any of the restaurants. Only negative side is that they could have done a little more with the arcade for the kids. It was lacking. But even though that was the case my four year old son even thought the place was ""Beautiful"". Thats in his own words. The bars were all unique in design and beautiful also.

If you're looking for customer service, friendly check-in staff, you're knocking on the wrong door.

On Saturday, we had 4 separate people knock on our door in a 2 hour period, after the room had already been cleaned. The prices are over the top. They charge you for absolutely everything.

The room was very impressive, my friends got a deal from priceline or wherever so even on Thurs and Friday night we got the same rate for both nights.  Most Vegas hotels for friday night are very pricey.  I think some hotels cost about $400 a night on a friday especially the whole 1 king sized bed thing.  The access to everything was great, the gym and the pool.  

Downside was I thought the bathrooms were small but I mean we had two queen size beds so it was 4 people ( 3 guys, 1 girl) sharing a bathroom so that was just the slight issue, it was hurry up shower, do your business and get ready in the bathroom quick so the next could go and we would not end up getting to the clubs too late.  
Another downside - daily $25 resort fee tacked onto your daily rate (per room, not per person), Another downside- I heard the same thing too, even if you touch the mini-bar and move stuff you will be charged $50 restocking fee and probably charged $4 for some stale ass potato chips.  My friends and I kept soda, beer, Haitian vodka bottles, Captain MOrgan rum bottle  and Gatorade fully stocked to drink in our room.  

-I have to say hotel rooms were beautiful and very futuristic looking and saying you stay at Aria did hold some weight in the club later that night (fellas I am just sayin').

It's quite the new commodity and it's very clean, trendy, and feels fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend stay here with my boyfriend celebrating our 3.5 year anniversary. 

A friend gave me a discount code\/promotion so we saved about 200-300 dollars. With the promotion, I received a free upgrade to the city panorama room which was gorgeous. We also had $50 credit to spend each night we were there (so a total of $100).

They also have a really great Tapas place called Julian Serranos which is located to the left of the check-in\/concierge stand. SO GOOD. YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE WHEN YOU BOOK A STAY AT THE ARIA.

I absolutely had a blast and the rooms were gorgeous. We also got upgraded to the 52nd floor (out of 54) so our view was beyond spectacular.

This hotel is so calm inside compared to some of the other hotels, it smells of vanilla when you walk in and the rooms are technologically inclined which puts you in a feeling of the future. I usually stay in the Sky Suits and I seriously contemplated buying the bedding they use from them (you can buy it from the hotel website) because the Sky Suite beds are some of the most comfortable I have every slept in at a hotel. The rooms are always clean and the hotel has great amenities. 

The Spa is where you can usually find me, either relaxing in the salt room or passed out in the hot stone room lol. Ive gotten the water massages here a few times as well and have always had a wonderful experience. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the beauty salon, not only is it a rip off but they don't do the greatest job, especially the nail salon. 

The pool area is large with many areas to choose to lay out and even the party pool Liquid can be quite fun if you go when it's not too over-crowded. 

I've been really impressed with the restaurant selection at the Aria, my favorite being barMASA. Its expensive but worth the splurge. All of the restaurants are wonderful and unique. 

The poker room is also a great atmosphere compared to other hotels and one of the best high limit poker rooms.   

After many years I'm still not bored here.",2,1,1

Even on the 4th floor, the view was fantastic; I can see Vadra, north end of Bellego, and the Comso right from my hotel room. Dang no coffee in room however the coffee shop ""John Felipe"" does make Starbucks sound like a rip off. Casino smells beautiful. Buffet was okay; so far I perfer the Wynn buffett, more selectons of super high quality foods. Pool was a paradise especally on a 80+ degree days. The only down side is resort fees is $25 per night plus tax; then again even low end hotels like Circus Circus has resort fees so with that in mind you cant go worng in this joint.

We stayed here for our anniversary back in April, but I'm just now getting around to reviewing it.  The only negative part of our experience was check-in.  We arrived around 1am on Tuesday, and the wait wasn't too awful, about 15 minutes.  The bad part of check in, however, was the customer service agent Erleen.  From the moment we walked up to her at the counter, we knew that she was going to make things difficult.  We asked her if she had any complimentary upgrades available, and offered a $20 tip with our credit card if she was able to give us a view or high floor or other upgrade.  The entire time she had major attitude and a pissed off, angry face, as if we were bothering her by daring to check in to our hotel room.  In the end, she didn't actually offer us an upgrade of any sort, but decided that her lack of effort and service meant that she deserved to keep the $20 bill.  Luckily, this was by far the worst part of our trip.
      The room was absolutely gorgeous!  When you enter the room, all the lights turn on, the curtains open, and soft music starts playing in the background.  I like to think I'm not that old (I'm 22 years old), but the tablets that control the blinds, lights, and TV definitely took some getting used to.
    Everything else in the room was fantastic.  The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in!  The sheets and comforter were super soft and comfy, and didn't have any holes or stains or anything.  Half the time we ended up just hanging out in the room, enjoying the comfy bed and watching the draft.  We had a view of Monte Carlo and MGM, which wasn't too bad.  Although the whole time we were there it sounded like birds kept running head-first into our windows!
    Housekeeping was absolutely fantastic!  The first night we were there, they left us a box of Aria chocolates because we mentioned that it was our second anniversary.  Each night we were there (four in total), housekeeping came twice a day, once for the regular room cleaning and once for turndown service.  No complaints at all with them.
    Room service was also fantastic, we ordered the miso ramen on a whim at like, 3am, and service was pretty quick, and the person who brought our food was super friendly and professional.
    Lastly, the casino.  We're pretty low rollers, so we mainly hung out on the side of the casino with the lower limit slots.  Slots were tighter than a virgin's knees (for me!  Boyfriend took home about $300 when all was said and done), but the cocktail service was fantastic.  Waitresses were very attentive, and brought drinks in a timely manner.
   The only complaints I have are A.  Erleen, B.  the size of the rooms (a little small), and C.  The rooms are a little dark.  Otherwise, we had a fantastic time, and we'll defs be back soon!",0,0,0

Once your inside your nose if over run with the soothing sent of Vanilla. I suggest grabbing a drink at the View Bar right next to the check in desk to get you trip off right. Once you get to your room you'll understand why this Hotel so so great, everything is literally at a fingers touch. 

The casino has a electric vibe and the drink service comes around frequently. Seeing that it's such a hot spot the tables can get crowed, it's not a bad thing... everyone wants to be there. 

I highly suggest Liquid during the day, the crowd is great and the atmosphere is alive. You don't have to purchase a chair or table but I highly suggest you do if your planning on drinking (they give you a minimum to spend, roughly about $100-105). If you don't want to go this route then they have a bag check.

Dinner is amazing in any of the number of restaurants they offer. As for the nightlife... you can't go wrong. Whether your in the mood for a club (Haze) or just a lounge you have a wide range to choose from and you wont go wrong with you choice.

The Aria is connected to the Cosmopolitan and City Center which is nice, but the City Center shopping is kind of over the top.

I tried the $20 sandwich trick for complimentary upgrades before checking it but they said the hotel was completely booked so I kept my deluxe room on the 30th floor.  

The Good - The hotel itself is beautiful and is very modern. I personally enjoyed the remote control to the entire room but I can see why people would complain since it is attached by a wire so really only the person sleeping on the bed side with the remote can use it and sometimes the remote is unresponsive. 

The Bad - Unfortunately, I was the lucky one that had such a horrible first time at Aria. When I first got to the room, it initially looked great but when I checked the toilet it was backed up with sewage and smelled horrible (pictures attached). I had requested a room on a high floor but since I had to move, they could only move me to the 7th floor which I felt was unacceptable so they released a room to us on the 24th floor and gave us $100 resort credit ($50 initially but we had argued that we had gotten in late and this whole moving around room situation was wasting our time)

We were placed next to a bachelorette party and I'm not complaining about the party (because let's face it, we are in Vegas) but they were pretty loud so I asked to be moved the next morning, in which I got a city view back on the 30th floor which I honestly don't think it's worth the extra money. 

Some people have also stated that the aria entrance is quite a walk to the Strip, which it is so you should walk  through Crystals to the strip or you can take the tram that takes you to either Bellagio or Monte Carlo.

This hotel is classier (not as glitz and over the top) than many on the strip.  Great ambience and has all the facilities.
The room rate was pretty reasonable but they do charge over the top at most of the venue.  Saying that you can enjoy your stay and make the most out of the hotel if you mix up where you eat (so many places in other casinos and on the strip) and watch out for the hidden extras.

Room was great and spacious.  Pool areas large (4 pools) but shady and plenty of room to relax.

Please take heed on one extra worthing paying for.  Absolutely worth paying for the express check in service ($15 or something like that).  We were able to walk straight in and checkin bypassing  queue of at least an hour  - it also allowed us t check in 2 hours early and rooms were ready.

Oh man, where to begin? I was here for a work event, so we ended up getting a group discount at about 130$\/room. Thank god, because if I had spent $400+ somebody would have been hurt. badly. 

we get to the check-in desk and there was a HUGE line despite the fact that there were 10 different reps. assisting guests. Why? Because apparently, they were explaining to everyone else in front of us who had ordered 2 double or queen rooms (as they told us after we waited 30 minutes in line) that despite the fact that we had reserved a room with two doubles, only rooms with ONE double or queen was available. good thing we had 3 people to our room! They told the people ahead of us as they told us that apparently rooms are on a ""first come first served basis."" Then why the hell would I make a RESERVATION IN THE FIRST PLACE? they didn't offer us an upgraded room for the same price, nor did they comp us a meal or anything for the EXTREME inconvenience. What DID they offer us? a cot. RAD. 

To top it off, everything in the rooms is controlled by a single computer control system. There was more than one person in our group who had issues with their lights not turning on, their television not turning off, etc. One person had to actually be moved to another room because they could straighten their computer problems out. When we left, even a tech person employed by the hotel was joking with us about how nothing worked. 

The layout of this hotel also sucks. They put the sports bar in the back where no one can find it, so it remains relatively empty all the time. you would think that someone with enough money to open a casino would have marketing strategists with an IQ at least slightly above retarded. 

Not to mention the complicated parking situation.

Cons: 
Vanilla scent all over casino floor and lobby smells alright in the beginning but gets annoying by the second day, 
Not enough cocktail ladies and they take forever to return, 
Not enough 25 cent slot machine (Mostly penny slots or $1 and higher slots), Not enough creative slot machines that are interactive (I love the Uspin and Sex and the City - very fun when you win), 
Room fridge has a sensor. If you remove any item, even if you don't eat it, they charge you, 
Too much technology! Flipping the channels on the tv is annoying since the remote lags a little bit. 
No fan in the bathroom or air ventilator 
Table minimum bets are too high for roulette and craps - $15, ouch! 
There's no late night or 24 hour dining options on casino floor 
Casino layout is confusing, I wish there was a cashier cage located on both sides of the casino

When we arrived, checkin took approximately 30 mins and the desk clerk was very friendly and informative.  After receiving an explanation of where all the highlights of the Aria were, we made our way to our room.  One complaint I do have is in regards to the Aria's TooTight security in front of the room elevators.  I understand the need for security, but the constant checking of every guest to see if they have a room key is a bit much.  I noticed that this is especially troublesome for women, since they have to continue to dig through their purses to find the key each time they go back up to the room.

We did breakfast, brunch and dinner at the buffet and it was very good, I feel in love with the anchovies there (originally I thought they were sardines due to the size).  The food is of a good quality and the desserts are excellent, I'd recommend the oreo shooter to anyone.  The only downside to the buffet is that the offerings are somewhat repetitive; I noticed on several occasions that they Asian section always had orange chicken, mixed veggies and beef and broccoli, even during breakfast at 8am.  I'm not Asian, but I doubt a lot of people eat sweet and sour chicken at 8am :-)

The casino was great, I had two of my longest ever slot machine sessions there: one was for 2.5 hrs on a mega bucks $1 machine and another was for 2 hrs on a 2 credit reel $1 machine.  For the table games the dealers were really friendly and the slot floor supervisors and drink service was excellent.  One one occasion the cocktail waitress even remembered what I was drinking and corrected me when I ordered the wrong thing, due to being inebriated :D

All in all, I give this place 4 stars.  My only suggestions are to loosen the elevator security, add more variety to the buffet and add some late night dining options.  We found ourselves going to other casinos whenever it was after 10pm just to find food.

Note: The Aria is very tight on comps if they give you a comped room.  I played through about 15k over 3 days and that wasn't even enough to get us 1 free breakfast.  So, it seems that you need to play through at least 10k per day just to cover a comped room.",0,0,0

When you are awesome at losing lots of money, they invite you to stay in Vegas for free. 

Because we are so awesome, I even got us upgraded to a suite. 

Anyone who says that they've stayed at a better hotel is either lying or an heiress, or both. (cause I know there ain't a better Hilton) 

When you first walk in the room (suite, last time our regular room, did not do this) all the curtains and sheers auto open up to a beautiful city scape. There were 3 flat screen TVs in our suite. One in the sitting area, one in front of the bed, and one in the bathroom, which could be tilted towards the spa tub. My son loved this place, he really enjoyed the heated toilet seat, bidet, & spa tub ..... lol. 

The architecture is very modern, the exterior is kinda like Frank Gehry (Disney Concert Hall) and Cesar Pelli (some of the world's tallest buildings, and actual architect) had a building baby. The interior is very modern and lavish at every turn. It is impressive, especially if you understand interior and architectural design. Even the little patisserie off the Casino is gorgeous, not to mention the gargantuan gates in front of BarMasa. 

The choices of restaurants is also impressive, you have; Jean Georges Steakhouse, Julian Serrano (Tapas), BarMasa (legendary in New York), Sirio Ristorante (excellent Italian), American Fish (Michael Mina), Shaboo (the most expensive Shabu- Shabu ever, prefix menu $300 per person, it is located inside BarMasa). 

The Spa looks absolutely divine, then again haven't met too many spas I didn't like... 

The Pool area is cool, but I think it could of been a little more innovative, it wasn't ready the first time we came here, but it was December anyway. They really should of made at least one of the pool areas super cool, modern, & chic, or at least fun for the kids, I guess all the architects were too old to remember having kids. At least it'll keep the pool skanks at Mandalay and the Hard Rock...lol.

The Casino is a decent size and tastefully done, the lighting is dim (if you could see yourself you'd appreciate the dimness), I like the way it is set up. It is not too smoky like other Casinos, they keep the air pretty fresh and clean, also the cocktail waitresses are nice and pretty quick with the drinks. The dealers are pretty cool too.

The last time we went, we did notice that from the bedding to some of the counters at the eateries, dilapidation was very noticeable for being less than a year old. I guess wear and tear in Vegas isn't the usual. My one legit complaint is that the remote control this last time there was extremely fickle ...... hated it..two snaps. dang...I am that old.

Overall, great hotel that is unlike the crummyness that is a large part of the Strip. It is good to stay here, relax, eat, lounge, swim and then head out to the Strip for some crazyness if that is what you are into. (Or hike in Red Rock Canyon - which is what we did!)

If you like cheesy hotels with drunkards packed like sardines and smelling of vomit, then stay away from the Aria! It's a classy hotel for refined taste.",0,1,0

I'm not sure if it's the best place to gamble since it seemed like everyone in my party lost a lot of money but it's all good, as long as we had fun, right?

As far as the place goes, it's very clean, aesthetically beautiful, and I love the rooms.  The problems that we did encounter the first night was that our television screen wasn't working but the sound was there.  Thankfully they sent their technician and all was okay.  Also my friend had reserved two queens instead of fulls.  That was a turn off but I'll still give Aria four stars cause I had stayed here previously a year ago for my birthday (Jan 29) and they sent me a complimentary dessert tray with chocolate covered strawberries and chocolates, so that's a plus in my book.  

My party and I also went to go see Zarkana and that was thrilling.  I'd recommend going to the Half Price ticket booths they have along the strip.  It wasn't necessarily that much cheaper (we paid about $95 a ticket) but I think the hotel was selling it at like $125 for the same spots.  If you aren't money conscious then get the tickets at the box office or the concierge, whichever is convenient for you.

Aria is definitely off the strip but we ended up driving around and valeting our car.  The valets and bellhops are attentive and friendly so don't be afraid to use their service!  Used the bellhop twice to take our stuff up and down our room and the valet guys multiples times--too many to count.

Overall I had a great time.

Amazing hotel, great Elvis show, wonderful food and ice cream, French bakery was over the top. Dealers were top notch, very comfortable bed

Then the Valet lost my rental car keys....Valet did what they could to make it better by getting new keys from the rental car company and giving me a $100 room credit for my trouble. Then when I returned to the airport Payless Car Rental charged me 312.44 for the replacement key they provided to the valet. When I questioned them Payless Car Rental was rude and not helpful. Then the Aria said they would cover it all I had to do was submit a claim. Well I did and now Cathy Robison in Aria Risk Managment (702-590-7575) is playing games and now wants to take the $100 credit from the valet and count it against the cost of the key. We have now written letters and several phone calls and Aria sent a legal release saying they only want to pay $141.00 of the claim. They say they can't pay the taxes and fees on the new key they will only pay the line item for the key. Well after a great trip she is working hard to make sure I never come back.  I am forced to spend way too much time to get $312.00 from a multi billion dollar hospitality company.

Walking into the hotel, there's a subtle Vanilla-like smell in the air that is refreshing; unlike the weird smell at the Venetian. The decor throughout the hotel is very aesthetically pleasing. It's close to the Monte Carlo and New York New York so you may have to make a slight walk to the places in the middle of the strip, but taking the tram to the Bellagio will help.

As for the room, I really like the concept of having a remote control nearly everything in the room. The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a bit laggy when I would try to change the channel or move through the channel guide. I also didn't like that in order to turn off one thing, I had to turn off almost everything else. I also like that there's a door separating the toilet to the rest of the bathroom.

Overall, it's one of the more upscalish hotels on the Strip. If you decide to gamble, people are dressed more for going to a club than getting a bite to eat at McDonalds. Very modern feel and if you have the cash to spend, there's the City Center next to Aria for you to buy expensive stuff.",2,2,1

The ladies in my family have been coming to Las Vegas since 2001.  We have always stayed at either Caesars Palace or Bellagio. Last year we wanted to try something new and heard good things about Aria.  We took a chance.....and obviously couldn't be happier.  

I called about a month before our arrival date and asked if we could get our 2 rooms close to each other.  In all of the years we have been going to Vegas, we were never even on the same floor.  The woman I spoke with said that she would make a note, but since we were checking in at 11 PM, there were no guarantees.  Well, we got to the desk and Robin was HAPPY to help us.  We were celebrating a birthday (just as we are this year) and when she heard that, she said that she would see what she could do.  A few moments later she said that we would be staying in the Sky Suite part of the hotel.  We had no idea what that meant, but we were very excited since the rooms would be together.  Well - what a treat we had for the week!  Not only were our rooms RIGHT next to each other, but we were able to take advantage of the fabulous extras that Aria Sky Suites offer!  The pools, the ""lounge"" (yes, there was wine and cheese at night!), and EVERY single person who worked there - all top notch. 

The people who worked in the lounge of the Sky Suites got to know our names, and even what we liked to drink!  The waitresses at the pool were always attentive and friendly!  After so many years of coming to Vegas we have had our share of crabby pool staff - not at Aria!  The drinks were fantastic, the food by the pool was JUST what you want while basking in the sun, and even the other visitors were cheerful and friendly.  Again - something you do not always find at a Las Vegas hotel. 

We are everyday people, but at the Aria we were treated with such care and consideration - we felt like VIPs!

Aria not only met our expectations, but the staff and the hotel itself far exceeded anything we imagined.

It is in a great location near everything else I wanted to go to.  I went with a group and received great service from all the employees I interacted with.  The staff that does the take down service at night was awesome.  We were a group of girls with our stuff literally strewn EVERYWHERE in the room and they took the time to fold up random clothes, position slippers by our bed, leave us chocolates and organize small groups of items on the counter tops while also preparing the beds for us.   I was really impressed at how pleasant and friendly all the service employees were.  

There is a safe in the room that is very discreet.   There is no microwave or refrigerator there.  I wish there was a fridge so I could at least have drinks cold, but the ice is free - I would recommend buying a cheap foam container from the CVS across the street to put a bag of ice in for if you have drinks to keep cold.  I don't mind that there was no microwave as much since I know they want you to eat out and spend- not cook and stay in while you're in Vegas!   

The pool had 3 -4 lifeguards at all times. Good for kids because it is shallow.  Go there early if you want to lay under a little bit of shade though.  They have service at the pool so you can order drinks or food there.  

Something I would keep in mind is that the mini bar will charge you, just like all other places, if you use the food or drink in there.  However the difference is that it is weight sensitive - so if you pick up the items or open the fridge and put things inside - it will notice and charge you for ""using"" the item, whatever it was.  It is a 50 dollar charge per day to use the mini bar fridge by putting things in, and then various charges for items available.   Just keep an eye on your check out statement before you leave so you can contest any problems with that - maybe your kids or you picked up items to look at them - it will still charge you!  So check your final bill before you leave - the lady at the front desk removed the charge and it was no problem but just something to keep in mind.  You don't want to leave Vegas and then realize they overcharged you later!",3,0,0

A lot of things pissed me off during my stay here and I expected better at such a high end hotel..so in general, this hotel is only average to me.

Pros
-Beautiful and modern hotel
-Staff is extremely friendly
-Comfortable room
-You can control your thermostat, alarm clock, lights, curtains all from a screen on the night stand.

Cons
-The day I checked in, one of my bathroom lights wasn't working. I had to call housekeeping to get it fixed. Later that night, I noticed my desk light wasn't working either..
-On my 3rd night, I noticed that my room's blowdryer was replaced with a blowdryer that did not work. The plug was bent and I was unable to stick it in the outlet. I had to call housekeeping to get a new blowdryer..
-I did not get turndown service any of the nights. I had to call and ask for bedroom slippers, did not get chocolates on my pillows :(, and had to remove 1000 pillows off the bed in order to sleep.
-On Monday, I heard loud music all night. Maybe it was Marquee since my room was facing the Cosmopolitan. The bass was vibrating my windows and I couldn't sleep at all. I WAS SO ANGRY!! How is it so loud when I was on the 29th floor...To make it worse, housekeeping had no earplugs. The gift shop downstairs was out of stock of earplugs as well. The next day, I died at our booth at CES.
-The wiring of my lights was messed up. The light switch near my room door somehow turned the TV on. The light switch next to the left lamp on the nightstand turned on\/off the right lamp on the other nightstand. Wtf.

the casino was nice, dim lit with dark earthy colors it's a modern take expressing nature i guess.  the servers took forever to ask and deliver drinks. was playing craps for 4 hours and only got asked if i wanted a drink 2 times...  people at the poker tables were nice, but the craps table everyone was pretty silent and not interested in the game going on at all

stayed in the sky suite towers on the 51st floor, the room was very nice. comfy bed like any other fancy hotel. but one thing that really annoyed me about the room was the lag lag lag lag lag, tv lag, that controller thingy by the bed lag.... hellllla lag -___- another thing is that the bahtroom door is this sliding door that doesn't lock. but in the bathroom the toilet was separated by this opaque glass wall that did a good job keeping the stank away. the view was alright, being on the 51st floor only got a view of veer towers, mgm,side of cosmopolitan and some of planet hollywood, so overall the view wasn't great.

Very high quality and high tech feel.

Face & Body service $250, classic mani $60, and classic pedi $95. They were all nice treatments, but not at all worth the price tag in my opinion!

I can't review the restaurants in the Aria, because we either ordered room service or hit up other restaurants along the strip and in other hotels.

During the first leg of my recent Vegas trip, I spent two nights at Aria, one of the many properties in the City Center Complex.  More specifically, our room was within the Aria Sky Suites section of the hotel.  When I was told that the Sky Suites was a Forbes Five Star and AAA Five Diamond award winner, I must be honest and say I didn't understand the significance of those distinctions.  However, after only a two night stay I can truly see why those awards have been bestowed upon them.  Being a guest at the Sky Suites was truly an experience unrivaled and unmatched by any other hotel I've stayed at.

As a guest of Aria Sky Suites, your ""experience"" actually begins upon your arrival at the airport, where the driver of your limo will meet you at your baggage claim.  This service is complimentary and the hotel is accessed via a private entrance\/driveway onto the property.  Check-in is also private and is near a lounge area for sky suite guests.

Walking to our room, the hallway had a very contemporary 70's-esque look to it.  In any case it was quite unique.  Upon arriving at your room, just lightly tap the key card against the door sensor to enter.

Amenities of our suite included:

*Bar are with mini-fridge, sink, wine bucket, glasses, wine opener, and beer opener as well.

*Powder room just off the entrance to the suite.

*Spacious living room area with sofa, chairs, coffee table, wide desk, flat screen television and decent-sized table seating four.

*Immense and spacious bathroom with closet space, stand up shower, dual vanities and a sizable bathtub positioned in the center.  There's also a dental kit provided with dental floss, toothpaste, and shaving necessities.  

*Master bedroom is just as spacious as the bathroom.  In fact, it may nearly be the same size.  The bed is extremely comfortable and the pillows exceptionally soft.  There's also a flat screen tv and a small bench\/sitting area at the foot of the bed.

*Push button controls for the blinds\/shades for the entire room.  There's also a tablet near the bed that houses the ""master controls"" for the entire suite.  

*Turn down service in the evening.  Staff will turn down the bed and provide slippers for guests.  We later discovered all the extra pillows on the bed were placed in the bathroom closet on the top shelf.

Other amenities during our stay at Sky Suites included:

*Guest lounge in the lobby is stocked with pastries and fruits in the morning as well as coffee and tea.  Guests are also able to retrieve\/help themselves to waters and sodas from their mini-fridges.

*The aforementioned complimentary limo service\/transportation to and from the airport.

The Aria property has many features\/amenities to keep guests entertained and busy during their stay.  Of course there are the requisite casino, bars, night club and lounges.  In addition, restaurants\/eateries and shopping opportunities abound as there are various restaurants within the hotel or next door at the Crystals shopping mall.  There is also a tram that connects the Aria with the Crystals Mall and Bellagio Hotel.

Overall, I think I have nothing to complain about.  Well, except the housekeeping staff ringing the doorbell while I was trying to nap.  However, I must excuse them since they were just stopping by to ask if we needed anything, which I thought was very kind.

BOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and comfortable stay at Aria Sky Suites.",19,4,6

The upside is that we booked our rooms far out enough in advance and using Hotwire that each of our two rooms were under $100 a night.  On the other hand, there were a few things I loved and a few things I didn't love so much...

LOVED:

BEST.  BEDS.  EVER.  I mean.... like, EVER.

Their casino floor is awesome.  It's pretty big and spread out, so you don't get the slot machines all up in your face all the time.  Doesn't smell like smoke, and doesn't smell like obnoxious carpet cleaner, either (I'm talking to you, Treasure Island).

Free tram between Monte Carlo - Aria - Vdara - Bellagio.

Room was modernized -- everything was controllable by a button on a wall, a touchpad, or the TV.

Pools.  They have lots of them, and lots of seating all around.


DIDN'T LOVE SO MUCH:

Just walking from your hotel room to the parking garage could easily take 10 minutes.  The hotel floors are so wide and long, you feel like you're walking forever just to get to the elevator bank, then you have to walk to the other side of the casino floor just to get to the parking entrance.  A bit frustating, if all you want to do is get something from or put something in your car.

In the same vein, just walking from your room to a restaurant at the Cosmopolitan took FOREVER, even though the hotels are almost right next door to each other.  It just felt like Aria was tucked away, really hard to access from other parts on the strip.

Bathtub & shower combo.  I get it, it's practical.  Just felt weird to take a bath enclosed in a shower.  Hmmmmm.

The closet doors slam shut pretty loudly because they are heavily magnetized.  Didn't want to hear that at 4am from other rooms.

Other than that, would visit again if the price was right, but I wouldn't mind paying a bit extra for a slightly worse room, located in the heart of it all.",2,1,0

Th bathroom towels are nicely ribbed, but not as soft as it should. The toiletry are nice and great. The roof view is still great considering their roof view are very nice.
The bed is a bit soft but yet comfortable.
We got complementary room credit and show tickets with our VIP booking, so there's no complaint there. Overall it's a very nice hotel. We didn't make any calls to housekeeping or front desk, knowing how busy they are during this weekend, we left them alone. We are not complainers.

When i Checked in I am a Gold card MLIFE member  It is supposed to get you a complimentary upgrade in 3 years and 7 trips I have never gotten an upgrade. Speaking to the young lady at the desk whose name i forgot I ask her about the upgrade and I get told no there is nothing I can do about that. I ask in the very least Can I get a late check out cause my flight is going to be a red eye and a late check out would be appreciated and I get told no sorry there is nothing I can do. The next morning I went downstairs and spoke to the only sensible person in that hotel the Hotel manager Alex who as far as I am concerned get's 10 stars. Alex upgraded me to a Corner Suite. However the toilet bowl clogged up 2x on me. Now overall I go to Vegas to play poker Every year it is the same damn problem in this hotel when the WSOP is in town the list for any poker game is 50 or 60 deep you would think these F***** Idiots would have solved this by now but no as a guest I had to wait 3 hours to get in a game and when I complained again the names are forgotten I was told I can go someplace else to play. I purchased a few bottles of water I played during the week at least over 10 hours at aria and a few at other MGM properties. I could not get a simple bottle of water COMPED I keep getting told ohh we can give you points but you can't pay with your MLIFE card Finally the torture ended my last day I decide to go to Aria cafe for breakfast I decide that whatever I got on my poker playing I would use for my breakfast and bear in mind I have been  getting my card swiped at every mgm property every purchase i make plus playing poker plus slots and a few table games for a week. come to find out there is only $2 on my card. I go to the MGM life desk and ask to speak to a supervisor and he informs me I have to get the comps before time directly from the poker room there are 8 MGM resorts and you can use your card but not one of them is connected with the other when it comes to points and I was also told by the JERK OFF supervisor I don't have to stay at an MGM resort and I can go elsewhere if I didn't like it. Well I am officially done with MGM I will never be back to Aria unless they offer me a sky suite for free for a week of my choice. Oh and 1 more thing I made a phone call back home cause my cell phone was in a dead zone in the room $34 no notice that long distance charges apply on the phone. NEVER AGAIN ANY MGM PROPERTY,0,1,0

It seems that professional reviewers may be a little easy with the stars in this city (AAA gives it five.)

I've been fortunate enough to have stayed at a few five star hotels in my lifetime and none of them involved long lines, unwelcoming and even rude staff, and piss poor quality meals. Having said that, for a casino hotel the Aria is a nice, though perhaps overpriced, option for those who don't mind being repeatedly reminded that you're just another one of thousands of guests who pass through its doors on a given day. To accentuate the positives, facilities really do aim to impress and the beds are quite comfortable. If you don't mind paying the extra $30 per person \/ per day charge, I do recommend that you check out the spa facilities. They are perhaps the only thing that lives up to a true five star billing. 

Attention to detail and great customer service are signatures of any hotel worthy of a five star rating and I believe that sheer size makes it impossible for this, or maybe even any, Vegas hotel to live up to true five star status.",1,0,1

Such a shame, too because it IS a gorgeous place.  I'm sure it's new and just needs to work out its initial kinks, but C'MON PEOPLE THIS IS VEGAS...there should be NO place that isn't ready to go all out in service.

In all fairness, we didn't stay that long to explore much else than our first stop, the casual dining joint in the edge of the casino floor...they were a bit slow to seat our group of 12, even considering they only had to shove a few tables together.  That was about all they did for us, though.  It wasn't as if the place was crowded, or that they were understaffed....they had plenty of people there, but none of them were actually SERVING.  We had so many people hanging around the table telling us their names, but not really making anything HAPPEN.  At this point, we would've been ecstatic to receives some friggin' WATER in our glasses.  Food service isn't rocket science.

My salad came before anybody actually got any WATER, and I thought it was the greatest goddam salad I ever had, only because it took so damned long to get to me.  A friend sitting across from me ordered an Oriental chicken salad, and the only thing Oriental about the whole deal was ME, looking at her salad and saying, ""Where's the chicken?!""  The server took forever to address it, and did so by walking over a manager of some sort, and THAT person took the salad away, coming back with a couple of crumbles of chicken that could barely make a baby's handful.  Gimme a break.  My boyfriend's steak sandwich was a joke...looked more like a couple of slices of beef on slider buns.  My roasted shrimp penne was not roasted, and the penne was swimming in a pool of oil.  

We ate our food because we were starving (I'm starting to think they dragged their asses in service as a ploy to get us to eat and be grateful for it), but the food and service were absolutely inexcusable.  Wild monkeys would've been better at running this restaurant.  

As we were leaving the City Center, we were less in awe of the waterfall facades...because I'm sure that visual is the reason why there was no water on OUR TABLE. Planning is so inconsiderate for this complex, that even the cabdrivers are bewildered as to how to get there, and how to get the hell out!

I came here shortly before new years and just a few weeks after Aria had its grand opening. Since Aria was a brand-new, five-star, luxury hotel that bragged about offering an experience that no other hotel outside CityCenter would offer, I had high, high expectations. 

Value: I got a pretty good deal. By signing up on the mailing list for Aria, i received an opening offer of stay 2 nights, get one free deal. The average nightly rate came down to around 125 before tax\/fees. 

The room: There are highs and lows in terms of the room (i stayed in the regular deluxe room). First of all, the highs: i first stepped into the room and once i walked in, music started playing, the TV came on, the window sheer opened, and the lights automatically turned on. My jaw dropped a little at that point. It is a very spacious, modern room with dark brown accents, a floor to ceiling window, and lots of fogged glass in the bathroom. It is very tech-savvy since there is one central console that controls everything from the TV to the window sheer in the room. this may pose a problem for older folks who are not accustomed to such technology or anyone who would rather not waste time figuring out this crap and just pull the window sheer open manually. The TV was a large, HD flat screen and all the amenities were present in the room that i required. 
Now to the lows: After my jaw dropped at the technology of the room, I went to the bathroom, slid the door close, and the knob fell off. It just fell off. Apparently it wasn't glued on right or something, but come on! who has heard of a five star hotel having their knobs fall off?! Secondly, the safe (which is cleverly hidden in one of the nightstand drawers) was locked and non-functional and the window sheer did not close all the way when commanded to. How frustrating to say the least.

The service: I understand that this hotel had just opened and maybe the staff was still not fully trained at this point, yet I still would say I am disappointed considering my low expectations. First of all, the check-in required over 20 minutes because there was a problem w\/ the computer system and some communication issues between myself and the receptionist. Secondly, when I called the front desk to solve my room issues as described above, I was on hold every time for at least 15 minutes. Lastly, when i checked out on the TV, my two nights get one free deal was not shown. I had to perform the old-fashioned in-person checkout process and basically heckle the management to honor this legitimate deal! 

Overall, I was disappointed in Aria. After the hype, I really expected a unique Las Vegas experience, but what i ended up with was the same ol, luxury-faux Vegas establishment you get with bellagio, venetian, etc.",8,1,1

Our friend booked it through an Expedia package deal with her flight from NYC, so we got it for a pretty good deal, like $149ish(?) a night for three nights. She mentioned at check-in that we were celebrating a birthday so they hooked us up with a room that had a sick view on the 20th floor. Absolutely beautiful view. Man, was it a WALK from the elevator though; this hotel has some pretty loooong hallways. I mean, just look at the outside appearance and you can see what I mean. No big deal, might as well burn some calories since we'd be spending our nights in pure eating and drinking gluttony.

The hotel itself is so technologically advanced! You won't see any ""Do Not Disturb"" door hangers here, just press a button and your request for privacy lights up in red (or service in green) on an LCD plate outside the door. My baaad. My friends and I even had fun playing with the switches for the huge windows, the sexy ""mood lighting,"" and just about everything else that can be manipulated. And if I remember correctly, you don't even have to SWIPE your room key -- simply hover it over the door sensor. Super Bond Girl-status cool.

The staff was always so courteous, and crazy generous with the toiletries and towels! They even delivered chocolates on a plate to us one morning! So sweet.

The hotel itself is swanky and modern. Oh, and the gelato at Jean Philippe is GREAT! Effing tasty. Everything about Aria (and the City Center in general) made me smile and I'd love to return. I've stayed in many Vegas hotels on the Strip, but this is definitely one of my favorite.",4,2,1

I've been to all but 3 casinos and this is by far the worst. To start with the check in we went to the front desk around 12:30PM and we asked the front desk to check in early so we can pay the early fee and she told us "" there's no need to pay the fee, you just need to wait 10-15 mins for your room to be ready "" then she gave us the room key and she took our phone number so they can text us when the room would be ready. We never got a text or call but finally after a few times of complaining at 4:20PM we got the room no one gave us a explanation or apologized for the long wait. And the room wast cheap at all, we payed 225 for the room. When we walked in the room all the furniture was dusty and my little one is allergic to dust. Both trash cans in the room didn't have a trash bag. And tissues literally were empty but only had 1 tissue on top to make it seem as if they were full. When I went to take a shower I grabbed a towel and the towel was still wet and smelt terrible. And when we checked in they held a deposit of $150 for any damage done to the room or anything taken from the fridge. When we opened the refrigerator it was missing; 2 bottles of alcohol, a soda, a beer, and 2 of the mini alcohol bottles. Of course we had to again call the front desk why there was multiple things missing in the fridge so we wouldn't get charged and when we called a lady picked up with a terrible altitude and told us to not worry because the house keeper forgot to restock the fridge. Let's talk about the worst part of my experience here, our family of 4 went to eat at their buffet that advertised to have multiple kinds of food including king crab and once we got their the price 46.99 even though online it said 42.99.  We saw nothing we were told would be there.  I waited over 20 mins I asked the person so managed that section of the crab legs and she was very rude, she told me the crab legs were not ready. Of course after 20 mins she opened a box and pulled the crab legs from there onto the ice. I didn't understand what she meant when all I asked for was normal crab legs not cooked ones. Then I was able to get regular cold crab legs which was not worth it at all because they smelt terrible, it seemed not fresh at all. We tried some mediterranean food and it was beyond greasy. When I say we waited over a hour for our drinks to be refilled it was beyond ridiculous.

The casino - Dealers were very friendly and were not robot-like as you can find in other casinos. Very comfortable atmosphere.

The spa - $30 will get you an all day pass to an excellent spa featuring hot tubs, ice pool, eucalyptus steam room, sauna, salt room, hot stone bed, infinity pool, as well as drinks and snacks. An easy way to spend a few hours to unwind.

The pool - The hotel has 3 elliptical shaped pools. The water temperature was just right and I loved the entry to the pools. The only problem was that the pools were too shallow - only 3 feet deep.

We stayed here on a Thursday night and got the basic room for $120, what they don't tell you is at check out, you get nicked for a $22 resort fee + tax... But considering the rooms are usually $180-$200, the $120 price was decent.

You walk into the room, the curtains open and the TV comes on with your name on it, the Time and indoor \/ outdoor temps. The entire room can be controlled by one ""tablet"" looking remote that includes lights, curtains, TV, radio, all volumes... Pretty much anything with an on\/off switch or is plugged in can be controlled by this universal remote, AMAZING. 

My favorite part, we set our ""wake up call"" to be the curtains opening, the lights coming on and the TV coming on... SO COOL! The bathroom was pretty standard, but stone everything...

PROS: Room control, modern look, location on the strip, 3 free pools and the bed was really nice and soft!

CONS: Wait time at check in (15 minutes), high resort fee, prices for things in the hotel were steep ($6 for a coffee), overall hotel cost was high (~ $140 after taxes and fees).

I would probably come back here, but not for the standard rate... But it was sure fun to do it once! If the price was a little more competitive to other hotels on the strip ($80-$120) I think they would make a killing!",5,2,3

The sleep I found in that queen bed deserves five stars alone, but the room, casino, eateries, shops and the hotel itself warrants that same rating as well. 

Architecturally, it is absolutely stunning. The whole layout of the City Center has been meticulously thought out and has paid off well for the mega-hotels there. The casino is easy to weave through, although not as grand as the casinos at the Belagio or Mirage, it is still keeping with its sumptuous overtones of sophistication and luxury. 

The rooms there are immaculate. From the roman bathtub within the huge marbled shower to the spectacular city view to a gadget geek's dream galore, the room was simply beautiful. I'm not sure what prices are going for since I didn't pay for it, but whatever it is, I'd pay it to stay here again. 

Saturday afternoon, I spent some time pool side soaking up the sun, chilling with friends and enjoying the eye candy. I didn't go into Liquid, even though it was only $20 for the adult only pool party entrance fee. Apparently, good a time as it was, my friends had to put down $150 each for two lounge chairs, something I wasn't willing to do. The tab they ran on drinks on that side came out to $400 or so and the couple of girls that partied there saw themselves sick throughout the night. For less than half that, we got our buzz on with the free guest pool.

Deluxe Room: stayed at the deluxe room while 3 friends stayed in the Aria Sky Suite on the 24th Floor.  Got the chance to compare both.  Only real difference is the living area, a small dining area, bidet and jacuzzi tub.  Other than that, the deluxe room would be fine.  

WARNING: DO NOT REMOVE ANYTHING FROM THE REFRIGERATOR! So the first time we walk into the room they had that wonderful soft welcome music, the curtains automatically open and all that jazz.  It was great and we were taken.  So we open the fridge and they have items like: water, soda, candy and even Veuve Cliquot Champange (yellow) label.  Pretty Impressive for a deluxe suite.  We removed  some items to store perishables we bought down at Jean Pierre. Apparently the fridge had sensors and we were automatically charged.  Fortunately, they removed the charges when we checked out.  Whheeeww.

Bathroom: loved the ovesized shower head and the tub being next to it.

T.V: great bed side touch screen control.

Bed: very comfy, slept like a baby. It's great they had more pillows you can use because I can never have enough!

Service: very fast service from their staff.  If we needed something, they were on it!

CONS:

1) My bed side lamp bulb was out and the free standing lamp bulb in the corner was out.
2) The touch entry did not work when we tried to open our door the first time
3) Elevator location is a walk away from most rooms. Sucks if you don't call service up for help.

I have only 2 gripes:

*The bathroom- I wasn't a huge fan of the design and there was no fan, which meant the mirror got foggy after every shower. The bed however was uber comfy and more than made up for the poor bathroom design.

The room:

LOVE the remote control EVERYTHING
LOVE the bathtub... after a long day walking around I made use of that tub to the point I fell asleep in it. 
LOVE the bed. We tested it by of course jumping up and down on it... very sturdy!
LOVE the room service. After a drunken dalliance with the strip retuning back to the room at 3am, ordered the ""Burger topped Pizza"". GENIUS IDEA. What better than having a burger or a pizza? Having a burger pizza. 
LOVE the view of the pool. I didn't plan to use the pool area, but with that view decided before we check out on the last day we would go laze and catch some rays.

I would have given it 5 stars on account that I loved the room & pool area, what let it down was the casino.

Overall, the hotel is very nice--rooms are well appointed, nice big shower with a bench, dark wood cabinetry, plenty of space to hang and store your clothes.  Also a cool thing in the room was digital, from opening the curtains to turning on the AC to turning off the bathroom lights, even turning on the light for housekeeping!

The room is small and so is the bathroom.  It's nice there is a separate area for the toilet, but it's separated by frosted glass, which by the way, you can still see through.  It was a good thing it was just me and the hubby.  I would not recommend this room for a group of people.

However, this hotel (like all the other hotels in City Center) is very far from the other casinos like Caesar's Palace or Venetian.  Even if you want to walk to Planet Hollywood, you would have to walk out of the hotel, down the stairs, then upstairs again, then downstairs again.

Another downside to this hotel was that on our 2nd night staying there, housekeeping never made up the room.  We left the room around 11 a.m. on the 2nd day we were there, came back around 3 p.m. and found the room was not made (even though the light for housekeeping was on the whole time).  I figured, it's only 3 p.m., and we're leaving in a couple of minutes so no big deal--our room will get serviced later when we get back.  Around 7 when we returned, still nothing.  I finally had to call the front desk and let them know.  They immediately asked if I had the service light on, and I said yes, ""All Day.""  She said she would let housekeeping know right away.

Just about everything (except toilet flush lol) could be controlled at the touch of a button or remote control; however there are downfalls. We had a reading light and floor lamp go out thinking we needed new bulbs so we called housekeeping where they quickly sent up a tech from utilities. Reading lamp just needed a new bulb, but the floor lamp needed more. After 15 minutes or so of clicking, calling another tech on walkie talkie then removing wall panel it was decided that a new lamp would have to be sent up the next day. The room was very dark but thankfully it was almost bedtime.

And because everything has been planned out electronically, there was hardly any outlets for our personal devices. Both my husband and son require medical breathing machines and we could not find any outlets near the beds and nightstand. Again, we had to call housekeeping who sent someone up from utilities to provide us with an extension cord. So now we have spent an extra $10 in tips for utilities...one hand at the blackjack table.

The outlet (which is turned on its side) in the bathroom for the blow dryer was also located right in the middle of the sink counter backsplash.

I loved the Aria, my husband thought the $200\/night rate (after taxes and resort fees and taxes ON the resort fee) was a lot of dinero that we could of spent on the craps table or slots. 

We've had some bad experiences with Valet at other places so we self parked. BAD IDEA!!! The check in was all the mother effen way across the hotel. I SWEAR! Just do yourself a favor and valet. It felt like an eternity. 

But awww, we FINALLY got to our room, which after an ""invited guest"" check in was still a long wait. So bring your patience. Those lines are outrageous. 

The room was gorgeous, the bed so soft tons of pillows and tons of neat little gadgets like the curtains opening for ya. Yes, the novelty wore off but it was fun. 

Wifi - was included in the $25 resort fee was spotty and could never connect. We used our 3G on our phones and iPad most of the trip. 

Food and drinks - no food court peeps. Want pizza after a long night out, guess what walk over to Monte Carlo. 

The Pool - fancy schmancy and nearly 50 bucks for 6 beers, of BUD LIGHT!  But they make these mojitos with berries, yummy and $24. That added up REAL quick.  We spent most of our day at the pool and I couldn't complain, my husband missed the Monte Carlo and their lazy river, go figure. And their cheaper beer prices. 

The best parts - Sage - great dinner, the not having to leave the complex, want cheap tables take the bridge over to Monte Carlo. Want to go to Bellagio like we did for O, take the tram FOR FREE.  The staff was friendly for the most part, constantly saying hello. At the pool though you swear it was hard to get a waitress. 

All in all I loved it here, but buckle up, everything IS pricier, from the beers, to the tables ($15 a hand at night). but your paying for the vanilla in the air and the modern look of the place.

The rooms decor is modern with motorized black out windows that open to your ALARM!
Room bathrooms are on the larger side with frosted glass windows to separate the toilet and shower from the vanity and sink!

Aria has a fantastic entrance and approach (worthy of sticking our head out the window and sunroof of the car and blastin DJ Class - I'm Da Ish), but the insides don't live up.

First off, the lobby has an incredibly strong vanilla-musk odor that's way overpowering. The lobby and casino are really dark and not so inviting. The shops\/buffet\/bars are nicely decorated, but lack distinct identity.

Now on to the rooms - they are small! Like Montecarlo size! Sure, the curtains open upon first entrance  to reveal an awesome view, but other than that, nothing about the room worked properly, including that touch screen remote thing.

There aren't enough outlets in the room. The beds are WAY soft and hurt my back. The bathroom was nice.

I don't think I'd stay here again. It's just not worth the money you pay. Encore all the way!!!",13,8,8

Awesome welcome: When you open your room for the first time, the curtains open, lights turn on, the music starts playing, and the tv welcomes you, by name, to the Aria.  This doesn't happen again no matter what you do to the controls (I verified with the front desk).  The touch screen is nice but fairly gimmicky.  The screen was slow to respond and it took me a good 20 minutes to figure out all the functions - and I'm an engineer!    It is neat that you can use it to request room service or privacy without having to leave the bed, but I think the touch screen just confuses you with too many options.  

Bed was nice and plush with a TON of pillows and silky smooth sheets.  The towels were super fluffy and soft.  However, the maid did leave a service towel in my bathroom- accidentally, I assume.  Shower was nice with a bathtub set next to it making for a large hygiene space.  My view of the pool was nice, even in the winter time.  Hotel is kinda set back from the strip, so it's a bit of a walk to get anywhere else.  The parking complex is also kind of confusing with BIG gaps between cars.  Helps prevent door dings, but takes up a lot of valuable parking real estate.  

$20 for internet connectivity?  Are you kidding me?  Good thing I my data plan with T-mobile worked well.  However, my coworkers struggled with reception on other networks.

Took 12 hours to fix, still T.V trouble. Besides they do clean the rooms promptly and restock items which I read they had trouble with in different reviews.

But alas, it didn't live up to the high expectations.  I'll start with the good things.  The place is new, the rooms are big but nothing like Venetian or Palazzo.  The entire room control system is pretty nifty but I doubt anyone would be in their hotel rooms long enough to enjoy it fully.  I didn't have any problems with booking and checking in.  I got the exact room I booked online and checking in late around 10pm or so didn't cause any issues.  One thing that really bothered me was that they only had one set of elevators right in the center of the hotel.  If your room was on the end of the hall, you had to walk all the way down and all the way back.  And let me tell you, it is a large hotel and it is a looong walk if your room is at the end of the hall.  It's not that I hate walking but just seems like the rooms and the layout are poorly planned out.  Another problem I had, the rooms didn't come with any laundry bags or a safe.  These are not big issues but it just shows how unpolished everything is at Aria.  I agree with all the other comments on there that this place just doesn't seem that lively.  Sure its new and large but it was kinda empty and everything seems so static.  No vibes, no noises, no nothing. Walking though the place, you don't even feel like it's a casino.  I'd give it a 2.5 but I'll be nice, 3 for being new and clean.",1,0,0

Room:  When you're tired of the over the top tacky-ass-ness that is Las Vegas it's nice to come home to a hotel room that would hold its own in New York City.  The decor is simple and clean with muted colors that radiate calm.  The (occasionally buggy) bedside room control board is great for push-button light and curtain control when you feel like being a lazy bastard.  The bed here is heaven.

Casino:  Even the casino at Aria is an oasis in the neon desert.  The clean lines and earthy color palette can be found here as well.  The casino floor is ringed by several restaurants and bars -- all with a unique and modern aesthetic.

Parking:  Valet service is prompt and the most pleasant I've experienced in Vegas (and free as usual).  This most recent trip I did try out the self-parking once and I'd say that the few bucks you save not tipping the valet is not worth the extra walk.  If you're valet-averse its really not that bad, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're just checking in as its completely on the other side of the hotel from the front desk and you'd have to drag all your crap through the entire length of the casino.

Food:  The Buffet is probably my favorite buffet ever.  As a vegetarian usually I get mostly shafted, but here I'm able to make several trips and come back with a differently themed plate consisting of a few different dishes.  The dessert station here is devilish.  I've also eaten at one of the restaurants in the casino which was delicious though it was a couple years ago now so I don't recall which one.

Overall the quality of the hotel has held up very well over the course of my four visits and Aria continues to be my Vegas go-to.

Tip #1: Sign up for their e-mail list -- they have some great specials all the time with great rates and sometimes including resort credits to be used in the restaurants.

Tip #2: Be prepared for the $25 resort fee (plus tax).",4,1,1

I was like, who the hell is in here. But I figured it out pretty quick -- it was a keycard-activated automation for first-time entry. What a welcome!

There's an iPad-esque device on the nightstand that controls the room. I chose to set my alarm to the black-out curtains opening, the room heating up to 74 degrees, and the TV coming on to smooth jazz at 8:30 a.m. Worked like a charm.

We didn't have a problem booking a room at the last minute.  So my 5 stars was basically for my boy, Sean,  at the front desk who graciously hooked us up to their Penthouse Sky Villa Suite on the 33rd floor with a panoramic view of Vegas.  Not sure why, but he felt like we deserved it and YES, we did!  

The room: Our 1400+ sq ft suite  had  1-bedroom, 1 1\/2 bath, dining room, work station, living room, and floor to ceiling windows.  Lights, temperature, curtains were all automated and operated on their touch screen control.  (That touchscreen was a bit slow to react).  One push of the ""Good-night"" button and everything was shut down for you including the curtains.  

The bathroom had a huge tub, a separate shower that also doubled as a steam room, a heated toilet seat that also doubled as a bidet, and a huge double door wood closet that just screamed luxury.  Robes and slippers for you to use. 

Room service was awesome.  He set my breakfast up just as I wanted, with a view of the city.  

One con: Static!  Literally when I was messing with the bed sheets, you can actually see the static sparks.  If you wear those slippers around, beware, cuz you're gonna get shocked!

I think this rubs off on some of the staff as they seem quite unhappy. In a weird way, it reminds me of a mental asylum. 

If you enjoy shopping, Aria connects to Crystals Shopping which is a great collection of high end shops such as Bulgari, Dior, Fendi, Prada and Gucci. 

If you want to go dancing, it has two night clubs, Haze and Gold Boutique, as well as many lounges where you can relax and people watch.

all of you SUCK at life. Change your career since you are clearly not good at being a member of a hotel staff. (not you Partick at the front desk, your cool) 

To the supervisor of maid services on my floor (a middle aged black women): your incompetent and a lazy piece of  crap. If you have her you need to switch floors. 

Heres why I hate the aria hotel and their staff. there is a lot to say so Pay attention:

I flew to Vegas 1 day earlier then the rest of my family so on day 1 room 1 we find: 

 problem #1. The mini bar was half emptied out so I spent 3 phone calls to the front desk to make sure I was not  charged and to replace the stuff in the mini bar.. 3 phone calls REALLY!?! 

#2 the girl who came to replace the nuts and other items in my mini bar said that there are 4000 rooms and they are understaffed. Look at how much it cost to stay there, do not tell your customers that.

#3.  At 5 a.m. I get back to the hotel and forgot my room key... No problem, lets go to front desk and get a room key... Wrong, BIG problem.. their systems reboot at 5 and they are unable to make a new room key. I must wait in lobby til 5:30 am. Well at this point I lost it. I started to scream... they gave me $50 food and drink comps. 

#4. My Whole family arrives we are checking into 3 more rooms. 2 are ready. ""Your other room will be ready at 2"". okay, 3 oclock comes around, rooom is still not ready... now we have 8 people in one room getting ready to go out.... so I decide to check the sheets (THANK GOD) and I notice hair lipstick and other dirt on my sheets that they allegedly just cleaned and SERVICED.  Well now I went down to front desk. Flipped out... okay sir sorry heres $200 drink\/food comps. We will send maid service supervisor to your room.

#5. The Maid Supervisor arrives. She says sorry sorry but we have 4000 rooms. Again , not my problem lady. changed every sheet in every room NOW. within 2 minutes there are 10 people in my room changing our sheets. 

#6. AUxiliary and outlets do not work in one room. 2 days later 2 technicians are in my room pulling out our mini bar, dust is every where , we are trying to get ready for dinner  around these men . So STUPID SOOOOO STUPID... but at this point i dont complain bc this hotel is obviously in a whole heap of problems alone. So they repair this eletric problem in about 1 hr while we are all in the room.

#7. due to this electric problem when we checked out they had charges to our room for our MINI BAR!!! bc the guys moved the mini bar out and shook it up. FUN!!!! 

#8. The Cafe by the pool only has waitress service on the weekends. but you can order food and sit there during the week, but you just have to go up to the counter to do so.. uhm WHAT??? why????? this is just dumb.

#9. The taxi services got us a limo (group of 8). Limo had no air. we told driver to let us out. He drove away. Insisted the air was on. But it wasnt and we told him it wasnt and we wanted out. PS we had to let our selves out onto the Strip in the middle of the street. Thanks for the limo @$$**** 

I could go on.. but these 9 reasons should be 8 too many for you too read. 

DO not stay here, do not even visit here. the hotel is boring and has horrible services and there is no where fun to go inside. the pool is very boring also.

The resort is just incredibly beautiful and located in a very good spot for tourism. It is very modern looking. 

We stayed Wednesday to Saturday and the line to check in and out were always long. They move the line as quickly as they can. They also have an online checkout that I would highly suggest to skip the line.

The room was just amazing and very modern. They have a tablet that controls pretty much everything in the room. You can set the alarm on it, close the drapes, and change the temperature on the tv to name a few things. The bathroom has a tub and shower to meet all types. The bathroom is very large. You could have about 4 girls getting ready  ( using the mirror) and in the hallway have 2 or 3 just doing makeup ect, so there is plenty of room. The mini bar is in the room and has a timer, so if you take something you have to put it back or you get charged.


They have plenty of restaurants to pick from in the hotel. We ate at the Herringbone and it had beautiful outdoor seating, but the food wasn't exactly worth the money. We checked the prices for the restaurants to the views and didn't feel it was worth it. We left the hotel to eat for the rest of the meals.

The pool was beautiful and large. They has different size pools for all needs. We always went in the morning because the crowd to seem to only come after 11. They had plenty of chairs and ladies serving drinks. You also do not have to bring your own towel.

There was a mall attached and we went there and it was nice. You can walk the strip to find different places. There is always somewhere to walk to. 

The resort is pretty confusing, so make sure you grab a map. 

I am not much for gambling but the casino was very large and there are always machines open to use.

  The sports book here is awesome!!! Love the comfortable chairs and the atmosphere!!! The staff inside the sports book is really friendly!

Now about the bar outside...
 We decided to go to this bar to order drinks. After sitting down, we inserted money into the poker machines and not long after was approached by the bartender John. He informed us that to have drinks comped, even if you were gambling, you needed their MLife cards. So we told him that we would like them and he radioed the information to someone that sent two hotel reps to get us signed up! They explained that you had to accumulate so many points while gambling that would later translate into how many comps you would receive. I didn't really understand all of it but figured I will get on the website when I return home to read it over. Mean time, our 2 beers were comped... We continued playing for awhile longer and my boyfriend ordered another beer, also comped. Now comes the reason for the three stars... There were two older men playing the machines to the left of my boyfriend. Apparently they were under the assumption that they would not be charged for their drinks since they were playing the machines. So the man on the far left was extremely upset when he was presented with a bill for the grey goose drinks he had ordered. This is when John, the bartender who had been joking with them earlier turned on him. He was completely rude when telling him that it was hotel policy! The man got up and left right after. The man sitting next to my boyfriend said something to John and received the same treatment and left. When we asked if everything was ok, John's response was "" they aren't my friends, I don't know them and I am not going to lose my jobs for them. 
 A couple minutes later, we decided to order a couple of shots of Patron, indicating to John, that we knew that we would be charged for them! And when we received the bill, we soon realized why the men were so upset!!! 2 shots of Patron $32!!! I am a bartender and this price is ridiculous!!! Still not his fault, he doesn't make the prices.... However my boyfriend decided that he wanted one more beer. John looked at the machine in front of him and, pretty nastily asked"" are you still playing?!!! "" his tone was extremely rude and I felt my boyfriend, who is pretty even tempered, tense up!! His reply was yes and while John went to deal with some people he obviously knew or had waited on before, my boyfriend inserted a few more dollars into the machine!! He got his beer and when John turned away we moved over to the casino!!! 
 We will probably be back in the future, but if John is the bartender, we will probably drink elsewhere!",1,1,0

Valet was very helpful. Check in was quick - not a lot of people. Asked for a high floor, non smoking king bed room. We got a room on 28th floor. As soon as we walked in, the curtains opened and TV turned on. The room came with this iPad like thing that controlled everything electrical in the room. It took me day 2 to figure how to just turn off TV. Loved the iPad remote control- makes one lazy- love it!! The room was spacious and clean. Loved the soap\/shampoo\/body wash\/ moisturizer. It smelled good. Because I have back issues, I can only sleep on firm beds else with wake up with back pain. The bed felt soft but was firm if that makes any senses. It was super comfy and I loved the pillows- so soft. The house cleaning staff were really nice - I think it helped that we left small tip every day. Our soaps were always refilled. The hotel is huge- wear comfy shoes. The decor is very clean looking, modern, beautiful. We walked through the lobby of Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, Caesar's  Palace, Paris, and felt that Aria surpassed all in beauty- fresher smelling lobby ( not smoky), clean, well light, large space with lots of slot machines. Also the margaritas served during our time playing slot machines was generous in alcohol and tasted great- larger glass than Caesar's and Paris hotel. 
 There's a backery called Jean Phillipe right next to the guest elevators. U must try their almost croissant - a buttery, flaky, almond butter piece of heaven. We ate that every day- I am still dreaming about it. 
Upon check out, we asked if they could waive the resort fees since we didn't use those amenities - they said no. Strange since I read other reviewers got theirs waived. Please remember those fees add up- $112 for 4 nights which is high, especially if u don't use the amenities and to charge tax on resort fees seems a little too much for me.  Also, upon check out, they tried to charge us for two Fiji bottles of water which we did not use. I have to say an issue I had with the room was that there was this loud popping noise every 3 hours which woke me up. At first I thought a bird flew into the window since it scared the crap out of me the first time. But I watched the windows and no birds. I have no idea where that noise came from. The view from our room was beautiful.   I appreciated the front desk being able to accommodate our requests. The only other issue I had was that I started breaking out really bad from buttocks to ankles. I was so itchy every day and had red bumps\/welts on my skin, especially my legs. I don't know what is was. I put lotion on every night to alleviate the itching. At first, I thought bed bugs but the hubby didn't have any issues that I had. But of course, being a man, he is hairy and if I was a bug or flea- that would take too much work.  We have been home and the itchiness has gone away. I don't know what caused the itching- maybe the body wash and dry skin? 

The one thing I really liked is that this hotel didn't smell like cigarettes. It actually smelled clean with a slight flower scent. For people who are allergic to smoke, u will appreciate this when u visit the older hotels that reeks of smoke. 

If we are to return to LV, we might stay here again.",0,0,0

I wish I had.  I want to stay here now.

This place is BEAUTIFUL!  The BF and I decided to take a random walk down the Strip, and somehow or another, we ended up at City Center.

City Center itself takes a little getting used to, as the layout combines a mall, two hotels, and a gallery or something.  Whatever the case, I wasn't really sure where we were at, but after maneuvering through a near-empty designer mall (empty but GORGEOUS!), we somehow ended up outside the doors of Aria.

We walked in and...

Ooooooooh.

The best way to describe the lobby+casino, in my opinion, is that it looks like a really tranquil spa.  Tall trees reach up to the ceilings, everything is furnished in ivories and deep browns, the lighting is dim and moody, and strangely, the casino is sort of... peaceful.

Most importantly, everything somehow looked CLEAN.  It wasn't bright and glitzy like most other showy Vegas hotels; rather, Aria felt more Zen.

We exited the casino through a different set of doors, and I guess this area was the main entrance.  There was a beautiful wall fountain with cascading waterfalls (SO PRETTY), a cool light show thingie going on with the awning, and a small but dope fountain with lights that made each jet stream look like fireworks.

Summation?  The outside looked like some awards show venue.  The inside looked like the poshest spa ever.

And after scoping out the website, I'm determined that my next Vegas trip will include a stay at Aria.  I need to check out these rooms, especially while prices are relatively reasonable.",6,6,4

My bf & I recently stayed at Palazzo last month which we loved, but after staying at Aria's tower suite for EDC weekend, Aria is our new favorite hands down. It's a huge suite and we got the 2nd highest floor on the building (53rd floor) w\/ a gorgeous view of the pools, cosmo, and vdara.

Check in was a breeze and the staff were very welcoming. The tower suite was so awesome, lights turned on automatically when walking into the room. I like that they also have 2 fridges in the room. 1 is free to use to store your food\/drinks like at Rio, the other is pre-filled w\/ beverages etc and it will charge you if you take it. There are 2 bathrooms in here, 1 in the living room and the other in the master bedroom. The bedroom is frickin awesome! The king bed was really big, plush, and comfy, but they need new colored sheets cause the brown isn't very romantic LOL. There were lots of pillows and they were goose feathered which I love because it's so soft. Anyway, the bathroom in the bedroom is so cool w\/ dual sinks, a nice jet bathtub, huge showers w\/ a giant seat inside, AND the best toilet ever. Yes, the TOILET PEOPLE. It's like one of those toilets in Japan that washes your butt for you!!! It was our first time using it and I really wanna get one in the house now hahah. It even has a seat warmer on the toilet and you can adjust the temperature. 
-There's tv's in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom. It was nice to be in the jet bath tub w\/ bath salts watching tv
-They provide toothbrush & shaving kits here!
-The lotion, shampoo, body washes were good quality. Didn't leave my skin feeling dry. Loved the green tea citrus shampoo!!

The room is very high-tech, loved that the little ""ipad"" by the bed controls the ENTIRE suite, not just the bedroom. It controls the temperature, tv's, lighting in the restrooms both in the bedroom and living room, etc. The a\/c filtration system in here works beautifully, never felt dry or anything like at the cheaper hotels. I loved the bathrobes and slippers provided as well. We used the fitness facility and pools which were really clean. The fitness facility had everything your local 24\/LA fitness would have EXCEPT stair masters :( They provide you w\/ towels and water bottles as well as apples at the gym here. Next to the gym is a nice fireplace area that you can chill at, it's really tranquil. The pools are are great, we got to soak up sun w\/out being bothered w\/ lil kids running around. The jacuzzi was bigger than the typical normal circular ones. It was more like a big oval, which was nice 'cause I like my space and it didn't get as hot. There are multiple pools here and the crowd is more mature.

I love that everytime we call for room service\/front desk they greet us by our last name. Speaking of which, the room service here is fast. Another nice gesture is we told the front desk it was our anniversary and they surprised us by having room service give us complimentary ammenities! I seriously felt so pampered here, the room was clean and free of any bugs. I highly recommend Aria because of the great location, professional service, and 5 star rooms. It's really relaxing coming back to this comfy suite, it was sort of like going home.",10,9,11

Other than that, we were pretty content with our stay at the Aria. We had a lovely room overlooking the strip. The Aria also had everything that we needed - restaurants (we ended up trying Five50 Pizza Bar and Jean Phillippe patisserie) and casinos (we ended up playing a bunch of video roulette and poker). Aria was also nicely located in the middle of the Las Vegas strip, so it made life a lot easier for us when exploring the strip. We had also rented a car (somewhat unnecessarily), but Aria offered valet and self parking, so we had our choice of how to park. Being lazy, we pretty much ended up using the valet. Aria will probably be our go-to Vegas hotel from now on. We ended up joining the M life rewards program, so hopefully we'll score some good deals.",0,0,0

The commercials for the hotel get you excited that Aria is THE hotel THE place to be in Vegas. As I pull up to the hotel the signs all around are reinforcing the commercials the Center the Excitement has shifted to Aria. As I pull up the hotel is beautiful the water show is small but eye catching. 
I enter the hotel and (what) this is it, there must be more. The lobby is plain and there are all these 10 -12ft high partitions blocking my view. I can't see it. Behind each partition is another and another . . .  where is the WOW. . . . .Nothing. There is no wow.
The registration is to the right and at 10am there are lines to check in and out. There is no WOW in waiting in line! I get checked in and am on my way to my room. I walk thru the casino to the elevators and it is very brown and dark but no WOW. I get to the hotel room and the curtains open as I go in the room. I did appreciate that. But the room is very brown and boring. I had a nice view of the pool area. The bathroom is small (compared to other hotels on the strip.) and neutral. Now if I'm remodeling my bathroom or buying a house this is the bathroom I would hope to get. I do not expect this from the a Vegas hotel. BORING! The shower\/bath tub set up is weird. The tub is behind the shower inside of the glass doors for the shower. It is a weird set up. The towels are so so in quality. The bed is nice and comfortable but the pillows are not. 
Check out was the same as check in, there are lines of people to check in and out. There are hotel employees telling you which line to queue up in and you wait. There is no WOW in waiting. The woman managing the queue's had the worst breath ever! I wish I could have helped her out with a mint. I keep asking myself why can't the line manager just get behind the counter and start checking people in and out? Seems that for all the 6 or 7 people managing the lines they could actually help with check in\/out and move the lines along. All the staff at this hotel lack the enthusiastic nature about them that you usually get from hospitality staff, maybe they are all newbies to the hospitality industry? They are not overly helpful nor do they have the usual customer service I have come to know from staying at any other hotel on the strip. 
All in all I could have been at the Courtyard by Marriott and had better customer service and a room decorated in a similar boring way. Don't waste your money -- pick another hotel (any other hotel) on the Vegas strip. Especially if this is your first trip to Vegas!!
 Review of the Convention Center -
Can you put the Convention Center any further away from the sleeping rooms?? The walk is a 10 - 15 minute long walk. There is no Starbucks or similar to stop in along the way. The size of the convention center screams that meetings are big part of the Aria hotel business.Then why not cater to us even more by having a convention hotel room tower?? It would be so nice not to walk 10 - 15 to and from my room multiple times a day. 
The food in the convention center was terrible. The fish was so tough it needed to be cut with a knife or smelled too fishy for my tastes. Needless to say I did not eat it. The Asian themed buffet was bland, boring and lacked any flavor. The breakfast was bland and boring -- thank goodness for the fruit. If you are attending a meeting at this hotel -- BROWN BAG IT. Save the calories for some Vegas cocktails. 
The ""Business Center"" should be called the Print Center as they only things they can actually do for you is print and make copies. Meeting Planners do yourself and your meeting attendees a favor and select a hotel with a Full Service Business Center. A Full Service Business Center that opens early, Aria's opens at 8am. Are you kidding me -- 8am??? My meeting starts at 8am.

The City Center is a very large mall with tons of shops that are sort of cool, but also totally useless.  The Aria is very spacious with a huge pool!  My room was quiet and that to me is the most important.  After catching up with old friends, a ton of alcohol consumption, sleep is key.
The only issue I have with the Aria is the actual location.  Its cool how you can take the tram to Bellagio and then walk to Caesars Palace, but I'm talking about the other way.  Its very sketchy over by the Harley Davidson Casino and some crappy Palm Hotel behind it.  Watch which way you turn when you leave the Aria, you may end up in crack land.",0,0,0

Definitely for the techy-audience because everything is controlled by an ipad-looking type of gadget. I was in for a pleasant surprise when i walked into the room, and the curtains opened automatically, making for a dramatic self-entrance. The bed is fluffy and soft, making for a good night's rest after a long day in Vegas, and the tub is right next to the shower. ! You can step out of the bubble bath and stand right into the shower to rinse off. Genuis! 

The husband and I also love the buffet at the Aria - one where quality definitely beats quantity. We'd rather enjoy a few select fresh seafood options over a mass produced type of buffet.

My trip was Monday-Thursday so it was definitely less crowded than on the weekends.  After reading so many bad reviews I was really worried about coming here...but I'm glad I did anyways.

Driving up and valet parking was SO easy!  Check in was less than five minutes and they moved me to higher floor for no extra charge.  I was also given a $75.00 resort credit which was applied to my bill with NO problem at all.  All the staff at the Aria were really friendly and it was such a nice change from all the other casinos where no one would want to help you out.

The basic rooms are really nice.  Everything is controlled electronically which is cool but was sometimes annoying.  I was watching TV and I hit something on the remote control and all of the sudden the curtains closed and all the electricity went out and I had to go stumbling in the dark to try and turn the lights on.  The soaking tubs in the bathrooms are nice but they are not very long.  I'm only 5'4 and I had to fold my legs like a pretzel to get in!  

The Aria is floor to ceiling windows which gives an excellent view of the strip from where ever you are.  The only problem with all these windows is that after it rains the raindrops leave behind their residue and dirt.  And it had rained the week before and the windows had not been cleaned and it really took away from the view.  There was even a window in the hallway that has caked on bird poop and it was not cleaned in the four days that we were there.  I think they need to come up with a way to keep those windows clean especially after a rain storm.

All the places we ate were great (Skybox, Lemongrass, Buffet, Sweet Chill, and the Roasted Bean).  The restaurants are really expensive and the best value by far was the buffet.  There was never a wait at ANY of the restaurants at any time.

We also saw the Viva Elvis show which I loved.  I'm a huge Elvis fan and anyone that is should see this show.  The Viva Elvis gift shop was really cute with all sorts of souvenirs that you just can't live without :o)

My guilty pleasure in life is slot machines :o)  However, the slot machines in the Aria are mostly electronic.  Which means that they don't even have the old fashioned reels in them.  How easy is that to set up for a NO win situation?  I steered clear of those machines and due to that fact I didn't gamble very much here.

Checking out took two minutes however you have to go down in person to do it.  They give you the option of checking out on the TV screen and even to have your receipt e-mailed to you.  So I input my e-mail address and then I had to wait for a few minutes only to be told that the system could not process this request.  So why give me the option if the system isn't set up yet?  The only ""bad"" part of the experience was actually getting our car out of the valet which we hadn't used in three days.  It took closer to 30 minutes to get the car.  And everyone in the waiting room had also been there for a long time.  A lot of people were complaining!  They really have to get the valet system organized!

First, housekeeping stole a $100 bill out of my wallet when they did the turn down service (i dont gamble so I know I didn't spend my $$) 

Second, my key was deactivated about 15 times during my 4 night stay and the keys wouldnt even work when I would go down to the concierge and ask for a replacement so every time I wanted to get into my room I was at the mercy of security to let me into my own room. This was extremely inconveniencing at 2pm, 5pm, and 2am especially when security took their sweet time (upwards of 30 minutes) to let me into my room. 

THEN, after I complained, one of the managers said I could have a $40 room credit which I planned to use on room service after I had gotten off work. I ordered a SALAD at 12am hoping it would arrive in an hour...no. Two hours later, I called to cancel my order because I was going to bed...starving. 

Finally after that charade happened, I left a dress in another room. I called 2 weeks later wondering if it had been turned into lost & found. Immediately the lady on the other line said it wasn't there and they only keep items for 14 days. Remind you, she hadn't asked what my checkout date was or for a description of the dress. So rude.

It has many modern touches and specialities, particularly with controls for the room lighting and TV from a tablet in the room.  It had some lighting features like ""romantic"" which aren't really romantic. The nightly room turn down service puts it on this setting, and the bathroom seems like the lights will trigger an epileptic fit.  Don't do it.  They do have nice chocolates on the turndown though.  

Instead of a door hangar, you have buttons where you can mark privacy or service for the room. I would recommend if you want your room tidied up that you actually mark the ""service"" button.  I didn't have anything marked, was gone all day, leaving before 8:30 and back 4:30 and my room was never cleaned.  One of the lamps also didn't work for the wall switch or tablet commands...oh well. Unplugging it works. ;)

I ordered room service from the tablet and found it lacking in customer service option for the meal items and ordering which left the room service a bit off.  I didn't have any sort of pancakes with my breakfast, which was standard eggs, bacon, hash browns, but I was brought two different syrups, but not hot sauce or ketchup, and it took about an hour & 1\/2.  If you have dietary concerns, there weren't any special notes or way to make that in the tablet for room service orders.  My glass of iced tea had no ice and was heavily watered down, and no where  worth the price. Food was a tad overpriced for a Vegas and what it was even for room service.  Skip it...go try the other food options. 

Positive item! The bathroom is amazing.  It's a walk in shower but in the back of the shower area is full soaking tub.  Loooooooved it.  Shower is amazing too. The room comes with robes and slippers to use which is a very nice plus. 

The bed and linens were fantastic.  I slept sooo amazing. 

As a business traveler, I wish they had a coffee option for the room, but it's Vegas...I get it.  Otherwise that was the only thing really missing from the room experience, at least in the base level.  I didn't cruise through the hotel extensively, but really love that I didn't have to walk a mile from any main entrance to get to my room even though this place is HUGE.  It also wasn't massively smokey on the casino floor getting to the room elevators.  Non smoking floor actually has no trace or hint of smoke like some hotels.

Customer service is the #1 most important thing to me when it comes to a hotel. And with Aria being a 5-star hotel you would think customer service would be #1 to them too. 

My group of girlfriends were here for a bachelorette party. We blocked a set of rooms and when we all checked in we all were not even on the same floor. 

We spent $1000+ on the Cabana at the pool for a day. Freddie was our attendant and he must have had a bad day when we were there because his attitude was awful. I have read a few other reviewers mention how Freddie was rude and not pleasing to us as the customer. You would think spending that kind of money on a cabana the service would be more than excellent. At the end of the day he did not even thank us for our business. I could go on about how awful Freddie was but I think you get the point. 

There was no coffee in our rooms. There was no free water. At least one complimentary bottle of water. The fridge was full of items you had to pay for. No place to store your own food. 

The room looked ran down. There was dirt in the corner of the bathroom. The carpet was dirty and it just looked like an older room. 

We ate at the Aria cafe a few times and each time it took FOREVER to get our food. And it was mediocre food. 

I will never spend another dime at Aria. They nickel and dime you for everything but it's not being ran like a 5-star resort. More like 3-stars. Take your business to Cosmopolitan.",0,0,0

 beds are amazingly fluffy- like sleeping on a cloud, 
restaurants a plenty from american to asian to dessert, 
separate check in line for those that have mlife unlike Bellagio where they use that as a plus on mlife but is actually not an option. 

Cons: 
self park and valet are on the opposite end of the hotel, it's quite a walk over to just get your car, 
the remote SUCKS...i feel like i'm literally breaking my fingers each time i have to press the button and you have to press it about 5 times before it actually works- and no there's nothing blocking the tv range, it's just awful for some reason.
the towels aren't the best- feels like i'm not really dried off and is actually kind of coarse to use.

The hotel just charged my AmEx the total cost of the 2 rooms I reserved - over $3,000.  This, despite having paid a deposit a month ago to secure my reservation.  When I called to inquire and ask for a refund, I  was bounced around for 30 minutes before speaking with the hotel's head cashier, Floreta.  She was extremely sarcastic and patronizing.  She finally agreed to credit the charge, but implied the reason I wanted it reversed was because I ""must not have sufficient credit.""  Wow!  Really?  If I had time to research another hotel, I'd cancel and book elsewhere. I hope Floreta is just one bad seed and not a sign of the service my family receives when we arrive.",2,3,0

I booked a room for 3 days during EDC weekend- had an early flight so I called a few days before(Thursday) to see if they allowed early check-in, was told absolutely. We arrived 8:30\/9:00am to find that their system had been down since Tuesday and they couldn't check-in until 3:00. Shouldn't I have been told that when I called on Thursday? After walking the strip in 100 degree heat all morning, I went back to Aria around 1:00 to see if anything had changed- it hadn't. I hung out in the lobby until 3:00 only to find that check-in had been pushed to 5:00 because the computer system wasn't back up. Tell me this- what did we do before computers? 
Currently, there are 500+ people in the lobby waiting to check-in(the line wraps around the building). And what's being done? Absolutely nothing.

You can't bash something until you try it right?

Let's start with parking: I read that some people had difficulty finding the self parking structure, but honestly it was easy.  There's a sign that says Aria Self Parking, how obvious is that?  The people that missed it probably just weren't paying attention.  I agree that the layout of the parking structure is pretty ridiculous.  Lots of dead spaced that can be used for parking!! 

Luckily, we didn't have to deal with the hassle of checking in because our friend had the rooms under her name and she already checked in prior to our arrival.  The rooms were nice, but on the small side.  Everything is controlled electronically which I thought was pretty awesome.  I really liked the bathroom set up and the bath tub\/shower combo.  However, our TV wasn't working and we really wanted to watch the Laker game.  We had to call the front desk for them to come fix it.  After waiting for about an hour, we decided to just go watch the game downstairs.  Supposedly, they were backed up, so it took a while... but when we returned to the room our TV was up and running! 

Didn't have a problem with house keeping.  They were actually pretty good with cleaning our room.  They called us to see if we wanted our room cleaned because we had the privacy switch on.  It was nice coming back to a clean room with soft music playing in the background.  

We also ran into Joakim Noah who was apparently staying at Aria as well, so that was a plus!

Overall, I was quite pleased with our stay but, maybe we just got lucky?",1,1,1

Restaurants: Great variety of casual dining and upscale dining.

Front Desk: Always cheerful when I'm checking in even in the middle of the night. They always strike up conversations while helping you rather than just greeting you, getting your information, and sending you off.

Casino: LOVE the dealers. They're so funny and always involved in the game. I was thrown off by the strong vanilla scent in the air but after having stayed here a few times, that scent has grown on me. Smells like I'm home every time I walk in there and take a wift of that wooden vanilla.

Arrived 10:30 am today, rented car as we used to live here. 
As noted, self park hard to find. I suggest if you rent a car to go out Gillespie, right on Warm Springs, take that for quite awhile (past Tropicana) to Twain. Right on Twain, immediate right on Frank Sinatra. Left on Caesar's, follow that around to Las Vegas blvd. Ignore the first signs you may see for Aria\/parking, unless you want valet. Go down to the light after Harmon.....I think it's just called City Center Dr. Immediately keep in left lane for Aria self park. Didn't have an issue finding a spot, but as far as we could tell only one bank of elevators in back corner. There are NO SIGNS TO LOBBY that we could see. So...take elevator to 2 (casino) go left out of elevator area, then left again to see beginning of a walkway. Take walkway, then down small escalator. At this point we're in a small blank area and one sign that said to go back outside to get to Lobby. A nice patron told us to walk the entire way thru casino (you'll see it @ bottom of escalator, behind glass doors) to get to lobby. Not fun w\/lots of bags. 
Small quick line @ check in, maybe 3 deep each Station. Nice reps. Room not ready as there super early, but they even called to see if another was. No luck. But checked bags w\/ bell Capt. (have to go outside to do that..odd) and walked a bit. Ate @ Todd English pub (very good, full review later) went thru crystals (super high end, not much there) and played some quarter poker slots. Hubby won 50 bucks. Back @ check in room ready. I didn't think room was that far a walk, esp. even w\/ us @ end of hall. Checked out cleanliness ASAP as heard horror stories. No stories here! Super clean. 
Foyer area is first, then half bath, nice sink and mirror, toilet. Then to living room...nice furnishings that were comfy too. Great view. You can operate drapes and lights from wall switches for the less tech inclined. Commands on wall(s) also include open, close and stop command for blackout curtains and sheers. Living Room: Desk, couch, ottoman, big coffee table and chair. Bar area w\/ extra empty fridge that also has its own icemaker. Our view (29-197) from living area was everything from Monte Carlo, part of NYNY, PH, etc. Big HD TV w\/ nice flat screen. There are outlets next to the desk as well as in bar area, from what I noticed. 
Before we got further, hit luggage icon on phone to get luggage up. Door knocked quickly, it was guest services w\/ chocolate covered strawberries and macaroons - nice touch. 
Bedroom next, good size, big closet w\/ lots of hangers, a safe and nice shelves too. Closet lights up when you open it. Two luggage racks and full ironing board and iron too. As noted by many -crazy comfy bed. It's a bit high up though. Beside tables w\/ good storage space and each has pull out ""top"" for desk\/snacks\/etc. Main lights and reading lights you can dim. Nice dresser, nice modern furnishings, another big HD flat screen. Room controller everyone talks about in there, although I think it's attached via cord, so can't take it around. Work lights, TV, music (on TV), drapes and a\/c via it. They also have the standard TV remotes for more traditional folks. 
Bellman came up and also brought ice, super nice. Brought all into room. View good from bedroom---Part of Rio and mountains (""behind"" you), strip, Planet Hollywood, etc. For this suite the safe was in the closet. 
Bathroom is fab.u.lous. Just as big as bedroom! Sep toilet area w\/ infamous fancy toilet and phone, two big sinks w\/ lighted mirrors, scale, huge jetted tub looking out to all glass\/view and big walk in shower w\/ rain head and bench. Also lighted, mounted magnifying mirror. Lots of toiletries; 2 shampoo\/conditioner and shower gel, 1 lotion, hairspray, shaving cream and mouthwash. Also had Q tips and Kleenex. Lots of towels and bath mats. Individual a\/c controls in bath, bedroom and living area. I think from bedroom and bath we and able to see the Bellagio fountain show from there. All glass on the two ""corner"" walls for great, complete view. Tub was great, super hot water, good pressure and the jets are very, um, jetty? As noted from others, ten minutes after you turn off jets they'll go back on, to clean tub, but I was still. It spooked me a bit. 
Everywhere we went all the staff were friendly and helpful. From the elevator sentry to housekeeping to Concierge to wait staff. Saw staff wiping all the machines down and everyone kept it spotless in the casino. Not smoky at all - which is great. Vanilla scent not too overpowering. 
Ate @ Caffe Vettro, which is the restaurant open 24\/7. It's near the guest elevators and has all the tall, frosted green glass sculptures. Really nice décor - and much nicer than most 24 hour restaurants you'll see in Vegas. Decent menu - Breakfast available all the time; standard appetizer menu (crab cakes, salads, etc); sandwiches, burgers, pasta, steaks and more. Fancy cocktails were about $12, Dinner from $15-30.

Rooms:  very high-tech. When you walk in, the tv turns on with some music, and the curtains open up so you can see the view.  Everything is controlled by the tv remote.  You can even check up-to-date flight status, adjust all the lights, curtains, etc. all on that remote.  If you don't like all this technology, you might get frustrated, but I loved it. The regular rooms are not suites, and are sized as regular rooms, so keep that in mind.  It's a decent size, but if you're used to other Vegas hotels and all rooms being suites (ie Venetian), you'll think this room is small.  Spacious closets, soft bath towels, large flat screen tv.  The distance from the elevator to our room was quite a trek, and we weren't even at the end.

Bed:  wow, what a soft and comfy bed.  I believe it was a memory foam pillow top they have on the mattress.  I had no problems falling asleep.

Bathroom:  I heard this hotel is an eco-friendly green hotel.  That being said, they have those sinks\/faucets that spray the water out in a certain way.  After using the sink, I looked around the counter and my clothes and it looked like a had a water fight with myself.  It is a dual sink, and maybe I just have a lot of stuff, but there was barely enough counter space for 2 people. The toilet is separated from the rest of the bathroom by a frosted glass door and wall (and the ventilation is automatically on).  So technically you can see a silhouette if someone else is in the bathroom with you.  The shower head is awesome.  To get to the tub, you have to go thru the shower, and I'm not really a fan of that, and that's just a personal preference.  The amenities are the standard amenities, however, there were no cotton swabs or shoe buffs or mini sewing kits to take home with me, err, I mean use at the room.  

Food:  I did not eat at any of their establishments.

Sportsbook:  Not a fan of the setup.  No free drinks there either.  WTH.

Casino:  the layout is pretty wide.  Also, they try to cover up any smoke smell with some sort of light vanilla scent.  No theme at this hotel whatsoever so it doesn't feel like you're in Paris, Italy, Egypt, Medieval Times, etc..  It is just a clean, modern\/contemporary hotel.  

Parking:  I am cheap and won't even take advantage of the Vegas free valet.  Self parking used to have ridiculously large spaces when they first opened which was such a waste of space, but now it's normal.  They have a handful of low emission\/alternative fuel parking spaces available, but unfortunately all but 1 car was legitimately parked there.  It takes a while to walk from the parking to the guest elevators, fyi, and you take an outdoor (but covered) ramp to the caisno as well.

Pool:  3 pools, and the beach club, Liquid.  I didn't have a chance to utilize it but it looked like your standard fare pool.  

Spa:  Didn't use, but I would love to check it out as it did look very nice.

Overall:  I am glad I tried this hotel, and while not the most exciting, I would definitely stay here again at a promotional price.",0,0,0

For example, the guest rooms are equipped with a mini fridge, but if you remove a mini-bar item, you will be automatically charged, so you can't even put your own water bottle inside.  At another point during my trip, I needed to mail a large envelope and the business center charged me $5 just to add it to their pick-up (my postage was purchased ahead of time). 

The room is completely synced so that the curtains, television, lights, and thermostat are controlled via TV control, which is irritating when you just want to quickly close the window or adjust the air conditioning. Furthermore, the air conditioner must be controlled by a governor of some kind because the room was uncomfortably hot during the night, even when the AC was set as low as possible. For all the upgrades, the Aria couldn't manage the one thing that a hotel should be: a comfortable place to sleep. The mattress was no more comfortable than the 5-year-old one that I have at home. 

The bathroom also seemed to be all show without any consideration for comfort. The toilet is partitioned off from the rest of the room by a frosted-glass door (I can't imagine why anyone would want a pseudo-private toilet experience). This glass chamber echoes and magnifies the sound of peeing so that it can be heard in the room. The bathroom itself is separated from the rest of the room by a heavy sliding pocket door, which is neither private nor convenient. 

Worst of all, housekeeping didn't visit our room until late afternoon, once we called to complain. Aria's billboards, which tower over the strip, advertise twice-per-day cleanings.

The casino is very clean and modern with plenty of table games and video machines. It gives an ""open"" feeling to it, unlike some of the other casinos on the strip that make you feel cramped.

i sat down at a holdem table where there were three other players and the dealer (duh).  first of all, she wasn't friendly at all, but that didn't bother me. what irked me was her lack of professionalism.  we all placed our blinds\/bets, flop came out.  i realized right away i had two pairs.  i'm first up to bet or check, so i checked.  this looney dealer PICKS UP MY CARDS, looks at them, and says ""it's a good hand, play them"".  so of course EVERYONE ELSE folded!  i was so confused by what she did that i just got up and left.  now that i think about it, that was totally not okay!

First off, you roll into this baller side room that looks like you're in the temple level on Goldeneye '007 to check in.

Perhaps the best part is we got to see Anthony Davis in there. 

You roll up to your room, which is a ballin' two bedroom suite that's fully automated and controlled on tablets- tv's, music, curtains, lighting, everything. Really nice and luxurious room that makes for a comfortable stay. 

Allow me to point out that you haven't lived until you've taken a dump from a heated toilet seat. The toilet seats stay nice and warm all the time, with a bidet, and a freaking air dryer to dry your freshly bideted hiney.

This was our first stay at Aria hotel and we chose to book a corner view suite in the towers. 

The room is totally worth it. First off the technology in the rooms, the floor to ceiling windows with views of Vegas all around the room just wow clean, new, beautiful rooms and facilities. 

Also being in the tower suites you get access to a lounge that gives you complimentary water, soda , coffee. Just stop in and grab a bottle for your room 
We get thirsty so this was awesome lol 

All this was great but the best part of this hotel is the service. The front desk to the staff around the hotel. They are so nice and go out of there way to give you 5 star treatment. 

We have stayed at the Wynn, Venetian, Caesar's 
And bellagio. This is by far and away the best room and service we've had in Vegas.

I got cocktail service in the casino and I was with one other girl. I'm surprised that a guy wasn't getting served at the casino.

The first thing I noticed was the cheesy butterfly decorations hanging from the ceiling and that, ugh you can smoke in public places in Nevada : ( All of that aside, we got an upgraded room on the 30th floor that was quite large. It was clean and modern and the bed and pillows were AMAZING.

The casino was really nice, it's not as bustling as Caesar's or Bellagio, but that was fine. The patisserie near the elevators was a major guilty pleasure with the gelato (they do samples) and crepes. The restaurants are ok. The Aria Cafe was better than we expected as was American Fish, but BarMasa is an epic fail.

The location is great, I don't think the tram is really value add because it goes from Bellagio to Aria and at times, I thought it would have been faster to take the Strip.",1,0,1

Go back and reread Fredric Jameson's segment on the Westin Bonaventure in his The Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (pages 38-45). The reference to Jameson's reading of the Bonaventure can be applied to the state that, I think, is intended by the Aria.

Displeasures- 
I didn't get the whole welcoming with music and curtains opening when you first walk in everyone talked so much about, very disappointing. 
45 min to check-in was a little annoying, but I learned later that you can check in using your phone.
I wish the entrance to the Vegas Strip was a little more accessible. It felt like walking a marathon literally.  I really like Crystals, but I didn't want to walk through it every time I wanted to hit the strip. It was either that or the scorching sun.
The biggest issue was the fancy device that controls everything. This thing had a mind of its own. If I closed the curtains, the tv would shut off. It was so annoying I wanted to throw it out of the window. I ended up doing everything manually. Maybe it was defective but I was excited about using it just to end up disappointed.
Not being able to bring outside food to my room was such a turn off but hey that's the policy. I snuck it in anyway (don't tell nobody).
Do not, I repeat,  do not touch anything on the mini bar or in the mini fridge (from all the other reviews..this warning is self explanatory).

Pleasures-
Overall, the hotel was amazing. Besides the issues above..I was in heaven. I had the deluxe king with a view  on the 14th floor and boy did I have a view.
I signed up 4months in advance on Aria's website to receive deals through text message and emails. I week later I was offered a great deal. I ended up paying 450 total (including resort fees) for 4 nights for a deluxe king, the city view was complimentary. Yeah I can hear you saying, "" you could have went through a third party."" Hey, I was getting married to the love of my life. I did not want any issues like some did during check in went through hotels. com  and they were told to call the third party vendor to rectify the problem. Yeah..no thank you.
The atmosphere and people wasn't bad either. This place just had a great vibe. 
My room stayed clean and the fresh towels and linen kept coming.
I wish I could have pack up the plush robe, towels and bedding to take home with me. 
The casino was awesome. The staff was really nice and friendly.
The food is very expensive but it was to be expected. Even though majority of the time I ate outside of the hotel, I occasionally treated myself to the best sandwiches I've ever tasted.
Check out was a breeze.

For those of you who are using the reviews to decide if you want to stay, I say go for it. Your experience may be different from other folks. For example, I didn't get extra charges on my card, my room stayed clean and customer service was great. 

Would I ever go back to Aria? Hell yeah.",1,0,0

Had a regular room since it was a last minute thing for a few friends and me.  Just a standard two queens, with a fridge that's already stocked with the overpriced liquor, TV, iPod dock, etc.  Everything can be controlled by the master touch pad which is pretty neat.  It's all modernized here.  Really nice bathroom, it has one of those fogged glass doors when entering the toilet, I thought those were fun!  Beds are really comfortable, the best I've slept on in Vegas.  The hotel is really spread out so walking in this place can take some time, especially for the inebriated.  The pool party was real fun, small and crowded the day I went, if that's your thing.  $20 for guys, free for the ladies.  The pool party should have been called Haze as well because that's what I felt like the whole time I was there ;).  They let the liquor pour here!  However, I have yet to go to Haze :).  The regular pool area was very nice as well, but didn't spend too much time here.  Of all the times I've stayed and been here, I haven't eaten here, so can't comment on that.  

Walking to the strip takes a little longer than expected so best to take a cab, unless you want to take a look around the Crystals shopping mall or go next door to Monte Carlo, or if walking is just your thing.  There's also a tram that'll take you to Monte Carlo and Bellagio, and like a few yelpers pointed out, walking to the tram and Monte Carlo is pretty much the same distance..? Ha!  Craps is fun here, though not as exciting as other places like Cosmo or Casino Royale, and they're usually at $10 minimums.  The sports book is a nice and decent size too and like any other place during football season - get there early!  I like Aria, its prices, its table games, its sports book, but the distance kind of deters me a bit from going back here at times while I'm walking.  I'd definitely stay here again because of its good prices and I want to check out the suites, but there are a few other same rate hotels with better pools, more exciting games, and easier access to other hotels\/strip I can think of staying at instead.  - more like a 3.5",5,1,1

As for staying here: expect luxury and comfort. We stayed in a standard Q\/Q room and we loved it! There's so much use of technology in this room, it's really convenient once you figure it out. It'd be great if an instruction manual was left near the panel that you use to turn the lights and tv on and off...as well as the curtain control for the window. Aria advertises a corner view in every room, don't expect a full out corner. The architects were VERY clever by cascading the room windows out so that each room does, in fact, have a corner view. The windows go out about 5-10 inches to achieve this. At the time that I stayed here, I had earned a comp room via MyVegas and had no issues with the check in process. Aria does have a bell desk who will check your bags should you arrive before check in and\/or your flight leaves a bit after check out. This makes it easy to go out and explore the strip without hauling around your bags! 

Aria is located right smack in the city center which makes for a lovely view. We had a mountain view room, so we got to look out into the valley and see all of the lights. So pretty! There are ample restaurants - some are SUPER high end - throughout Aria. There are a few lounges and bars - nothing crazy. I've heard that they're adding a club within soon though, which will make this an even better location to stay at! 

Aria's pool complex is... well, a complex. Plenty of various pools to choose from including their  ""beach club"" liquid. Liquid is pretty small though, so I think you're better off making your own party around one of the surrounding pools.

Aria is worth the stay, if you're considering it. You'll get a luxury room with access to luxury all around... makes for another kind of Vegas experience.",1,1,2

The hotel itself looks amazing on the outside with some arts here and there and a nice fountain located in the main entrance cul-de-sac. The layout inside is a different story though. The fitness center and spa\/salon was on the ""promenade"" level where you had to walk through shops to get to. Personally, I would think the fitness and spa area should be more close and inclusive to the actual hotel rooms. Another layout flaw is that the main entrance is different from the main valet area. 

Now comes the worst part of this hotel: terrible customer service. 
Booked rooms through a third party site and when arrived they told me I had to pay more for a 2 bedroom queen b\/c it was previously not listed on the website when I first booked it. (the excuse was that they thought the 2 bed queens were gonna sell out so the didn't list it on the site). Ok then are you assuming that any two person party coming to your hotel is a couple? 

Moving on, I requested a higher floor room and the guy at the front desk said ""I'll let u know"" and keeps typing away. Later doesn't even inform me which floor is available. He just makes me sign some papers and I find out he gave us the 10th floor. Great.. thanks for listening guy. 

The rooms are ""technologically advanced"" but the controls are not as smooth especially the temperature functions through the remote. Also, the bathroom was not stocked when arrived. Second day, housekeeping stocked the shampoo et al better. 
Gross part of the room: there was a piece of fried chicken underneath the entertainment center!!!! Is this really a 5 star hotel? 

Lastly, the jean phillipe pasterie (sp?) had horrible customer service as well. Waited for 15mins for food. Asked if they might have forgotten my ticket. They gave me a lame excuse saying they had to wait for the panini. Really? I just saw 5 ppl in front of me get the same thing I just ordered. 

Ok I'm done. haha Probably worst experience at a supposedly 5 star hotel. Will not go again. Encore\/Wynn is so much better.",3,1,0

I am a pillow freak - there were six king size pillows on the bed which sent me into total bliss.  I was there for two nights and would definitely recommend the hotel.  City Center and the shops are very high end and there are a couple of decent bars and restaurants - the omni present Wolfgang Puck and a Todd English Pub which was packed both times I went.

The front desk doesn't have one big line, it is on a first come, first served basis. I went to one of the shorter lines thinking that I scored. NOT! Apparently the couple ahead of me were having an issue with their room which took some time. I stood in line for 30 minutes (all the while seeing people who came 15 minutes after me check in before me!). 

Finally after getting up to the counter, the rep doesn't apologize for the wait, despite seeing me stand there for 30 minutes with no acknowledgment.

We get up to the room and it's really big! Relieved that I'm finally in my room, I start taking a look at all the amenities inside. There is an Audio\/Video panel that has all kinds of ports: USB, S-Video, internet, etc. There is even an iPod\/iPhone input...awesome! So I get out my cable to play some music, and then I realize that the input isn't compatible with the iPod USB cable. So I look through the manuals on the table to see if I'm missing something and it doen't say.

So I call the front desk to ask, and the girl said she doesn't know and transferred me to their IT line. The person answers and we have a very uncomfortable exchange until he realizes that I'm a guest and not an employee. At this point he said that they only assist staff and not guest issues...so I have to call the front desk again. Ugh......

So I call, again, and I reach another person. He said that in order to use the iPod connectivity in the panel, you have to go to the gift shop and buy a proprietary cable for $15. Are you serious?! I really hope that they haven't made anything off their little scam; I can't understand how they can expect anyone to buy a cable that will probably only work at their hotel. At the Palms they have an iPod dock that comes with the room, for free! Needless to say, I was totally annoyed.

On the bright side, their housekeeping staff is very friendly and responsive; the rooms are really big and SUPER comfortable; we had an excellent view of the Marquee as well. 

For the price, the room itself is great and the hotel is very clean and upscale. But the service leaves something to be desired for sure.

I've stayed here nearly a dozen times so it's about time I wrote an accurate Yelp review. The hotel lobby is always clean, smells nice and is bright when you first enter the hotel. A short walk through the casino (compared to other hotel walks through casinos) takes you to the guest elevators, and they always have security checking room keys to ensure safety. 

The casino used to be smoke-free, but unfortunately it seems they have recently changed policy to allow smoking. It's disappointing, but the smoke level is less than other hotel casinos. 
The rooms are spacious and comfortable. There is a tablet that electronically controls your room - lights, TV, curtains, etc. It feel so welcoming to walk in and have the room come in to life and your name displayed on the control tablet! It's a very large hotel and casino, but is laid out so it's easy to navigate. 

The pool area has several different pools and cabanas (for an extra charge) to choose from, offering a wide variety. Be warned it can get a little rowdy and very crowded during special events and the summer! The poolside food and beverage selection is great; in fact, my favorite summer drink is from the Aria pool!

There is a wide option of restaurants, eateries, and bars to choose from. Don't miss Julian Serrano, Sage, Blossom or Javier's (reservations recommended), Lemongrass or a special treat from Jean Philippe Patisserie. And the Buffet is not a typical cheesy Las Vegas buffet; it has a phenomenal selection and you won't leave hungry. The location in City Center is ideal. The City Tram is a good selection for transportation between other hotels and shopping in City Center. Aria also houses a Cirque du Soleil show, Zarkana. 

The spa at Aria is a special visit unto its own! I has a massage and then enjoyed the facility for the greater part of a day. There is an outdoor pool, indoor spas and saunas, stone beds, and a salt room. Spending a few hours at the Spa has become my new favorite treat in Vegas! The gym is a large and very nice facility.

First class my x$%&-! As a matter of fact, EVERY call took forever to get answered (room service, housekeeping, and front desk)

Horrible customer service the entire weekend! Account kept getting messed up, Casino staff was rude and not helpful, food was not impressive at all.

The only good thing that happened was we got a cabana by the pool for one of the days and the staff there was awesome!

we go to Vegas everything 3-6 months so have stayed at many hotels. So far the best by far is Mandalay Bay, which we almost ended up switching to halfway through our stay.

The rooms here are nice but since there ""techy"" rooms with full electronic touch pads to control everything you would think they would use ""new"" technology in their touch pads, instead it felt very dated and the design of the software was horrible and it ran slow. 

Overall I would not even waste your time here, there are sooooo many more options on the strip then this place.",4,3,1

Entrance and Valet: 

We entered through the strip and had taken 5 minutes to drive to the valet passing the Vdara entrance. The waterfalls around the valet pick up area were a great touch for the entrance and at night they change color. Sculptures are located around the property, like the canoe sculpture out front was a sight to see.

Check in: They have a check in and check out attendant to assist you with your reservations and direct you to open front desk agents. The woman who checked us in was very friendly and told us all the great things about Aria being a 5 star hotel and told us about the resort fee. Since the room was comp, the resort fee was comped as well so free WiFi for all devices (smartphone and laptop).

Casino: Typical casino with no windows, air was very clean and cold, dark brown all around and dim lightning. This was not a pleasant gambling experience compared to The Mirage and Bellagio.

Room: They have guards in the elevator banks to check from room keys so security is excellent. The Aria is the very modern and high tech with the video panel near the beds that controls the lights, curtains, tv and beck and call. More brown in the walls make this room less appealing and was designed that way to make you leave the room and gamble. Flat screen TV with a office area and a charging station was a great for the techy but they didn't have any outlets bedside which would've been more convenient.

Bathroom: Our tub and shower was an odd design with the tub being located behind the shower. The frosted glass in the toilet area was the same thing I saw in the Flamingo Go Room, it also had separate lighting for the toilet and sink areas.

Buffet: Great design with the colored tile on the walls but the food selections were a bit limited.compared to Bellagio. I ate there during lunch and dinner and still wasn't impressed. They have a view of the pool area by the dessert station and it had a great selection compared to The Mirage's Buffet. 

Shopping: Since you're staying in a 5 star hotel, expect $$$ stores like the Crystals mall located inside the Aria. It's nice to look at but not to shop unless you're loaded. I prefer the Miracle Mile stores in Planet Hollywood because it works with my budget and they have better selection and not too pricey.

Pool Area: I can't comment on the pool since I stayed there around winter time but it looked nice.

Restaurants: All pricey and even the cafe is not cheap. 

Overall property: It takes around 30 minutes to walk from your hotel room to the strip depending how fast you walk and it can get tiring especially in 105 heat.  This is a typical mega resort property designed to make you spend spend and the archiecure is very sleek like Wynn and Encore.

The casino host assigned to me, Randy Hedland, made a mistake on my reservation and caused me a lot of frustration. Throughout the weekend, he was difficult to get in touch with and had terrible customer service. I'm sorry but he's simply a terrible host! Luckily, I was assigned someone else and things turned out better. But, Randy is probably the worst hosting experience I've had in Vegas.

The cafe is empty, yet you still have to wait 15 mins to be seated and this is in the VIP line haha! P.S. This is not an exaggeration when I say that the Eggs Benedict I ordered here at Café Vettro was the worst breakfast I have had in my lifetime! In my entire lifetime! The ham tasted like air with the texture of rubber. The eggs were sour and runny.  The hashbrowns were cardboard.

The room functions\/buttons\/remotes etc are just so damn confusing. The sky tower suites were okay, but actually smaller than I anticipated.The VIP lounge was always out of stock of sparkling waters and only provided some cookies?! Late night I went down there to grab some waters, and they lady said there is a min 2 per person. You're joking right? I wanted 4 for the girls in my room.

The overall hotel experience was excellent. It is a beautiful building inside and out. 
The service was exceptional from everyone. There are a couple of reviews that noted poor service. I don't see how that was possible based upon my experience. Every single person I encountered was smiling, friendly, and helpful to whatever I needed. I think that your own attitude has a lot to do with how you get treated. 
Reviews noting the 'smoke smell issues'. I am extremely sensitive to cigarette smoke. Although I was staying in a non-smoking room, it was absolutely not an issue in the Aria common areas or the casino.
The service at three of the restaurants we tried, was really great. For me, the food was ok, but I wasn't looking for a dining experience on this trip.
The room was second only to the Four Seasons Las Vegas, and there were some things about this room that actually beat out the Four Seasons.
Like the fully electronically controlled . . . well EVERYTHING. Lights, curtains, tv, music. . . all from a single remote. It was the bomb. The room was a good size, and since we were on the 35th floor, the view was spectacular to say the least.
And, one of my pet peeves has been solved by the Aria. . . The hotel room doors do not slam shut! That in itself makes me jump for joy.
Other things to note, they let me check in to the room early, they let me check out late, all with no hassle what so ever. And, the hotel was totally booked for a fighting event. So, I know they could have easily said NO.
The beds are super comfortable, and the a\/c unit is quiet. 

For those thinking of ""hotel pool crashing"". . . don't bother. There are sooo many checkpoints where you must show your room key. I LOVE THAT.  I paid for my hotel amenities, you can just stay at your Travelodge.

After the first stay, I would have given it a raving 5 star review, but I was not as impressed this time around.  Our front desk receptionist was very friendly, and I still think this casino does the best job of masking\/eliminating the cigarette smoke.

Our room was a little disappointing. The beds were still great, not quite the Venetian or Bellagio, but quite excellent in their own right.  Some of the tech that created such a wow factor when I stayed here in 2010 was not such a wow this time.  The room control pad was not sensitive to touch to the point that it was tough to use. The TV did not work. We weren't spending a whole lot of time in the room so that wasn't that big of a deal, but we left a note for housekeeping on the first night, and nothing was done.  The shower (and bathroom in general) were really cool, but the shower area reeked very strongly of bleach.  Overall, the room seemed to be showing some age. Not ideal for a property that I don't think is even 5 years old yet.

My biggest complaint would probably have to be the business center. We only brought tablets and needed a desktop to access a program and print something.  The business center charges $1 per minute to use a computer. On a 4 year old desktop. With mediocre Internet. With a 15 minute\/$15 minimum. Are you kidding me? How is that not included in the resort fee? I lamented to the girl manning the business center who was as nice as could be and seemed to agree with my frustration. She cut us a deal and only made us pay for the time we used (7 minutes that could have been 2 with a better computer\/faster Internet), which was appreciated, but the whole thing still seemed kind of absurd.

I do think I would rank the Aria Sports Book as my favorite in Vegas.  The seating is really comfortable and the tv screens are immaculate.  It is a little small so getting a seat means you have to get there early, but it is worth it.

Also, the Aria has an ideal location near the middle of the Strip and provides a free tram to Bellagio when you need to go further north.  I was not blown away by Aria like I was a few years ago, but it is still an unquestionably above average Vegas property.",2,0,0

I have read other reviews on this site so we decided to try this Hotel. We got a decent package from US Air and when we arrived they gave us and early check-in which was great. We had the bell hop bring our bags and he was terrific, and so was the concierge staff in setting up tickets for a show, and the valet and front desk staff is great. 

Cons: 
Hotel cleanliness 
Lets start with the carpeting in our room, when we arrived on Wednesday we noticed peanuts, lint, and some plastic packaging material on the carpet, we called housekeeping at 10:00am as soon as we checked in and they stated they would send someone out, we came home that evening the room was still not vacuumed, called the front desk they apologized they could send someone at 8:00ish we stated we could wait the next day for the regular housekeeping but be sure to have housekeeping vacuum. 
The next day came, the room was still not vacuumed in fact we saw housekeeping and did not hear housekeeping running a single vacuum on our floor, in addition, the lobby had crap all over the carpets outside of the elevators. I am not sure what the policy is on running a vacuum in this hotel. We called housekeeping again and I spoke to a Manager and finally at 6:00pm our rug was vacuumed. Not what I would have expected from a 5 Diamond hotel. With bed bugs running rampant in hotels in Vegas I would think a through vacuuming in every room would be a good solution. 
Now for the bathroom, the water is extremely hot the tub is nice and deep but to get to the tub you need to go through the shower and the floor of the shower gets really slippery when wet. I know hard water is more difficult to keep fixtures and glass and granite\/marble clean however the shower and around the tub had mildew and outside of the shower was dirty. 
In fact you don't see them wiping machines or cleaning the bathrooms. 

This hotel looks great on the outside but they need to up their housekeeping inside before I will ever stay here again. It is dirty but I suppose if you have a few of their high priced cocktails you won't mind it is not what I expected from a 5 diamond hotel.

There was no ""sophomore slump"" experienced with my second stay; if anything,it was even better than the first one. Everything was better - the hotel experience, the room, the food, the casino games - everything. 

This trip was for a small conference that didn't have a really big itinerary, so I took advantage of some of the other hotel amenities and took some time to really walk around the place. The hotel is freaking huge - I came across lots of areas I hadn't seen on my first trip. It's bigger than Caesar's (even though all of the shops around Caesar's makes it seem enormous) and it's just as big as the Bellagio. HUGE.  

If you ever stay here, be sure to get a city view room. I don't even know what the experience would be like without one since I've had it both times (and I always plan on doing that) but it really enhances the room. This time my view was a bit more towards Las Vegas Blvd. It was great. Next time I'll try to get a view facing the Bellagio (if I don't decide to go up to a Sky Suite).

I decided to do a bit of room service on this trip and I felt like kicking myself for not doing it on my first trip. I travel a lot and sometimes the room service food at those hotels are kinda 'blah.' But not here - it was GREAT. Be sure you order the Fettuccini with chicken and shrimp - it'll blow your mind. 
I decided to give the Buffet another shot (first time wasn't that good) and they redeemed themselves. Breakfast selection was great and the chef preparing the omelets were off the chain - best omelets I've had in a while (come to think of it, the omelets I had at the conference site were good too - guess it was a good week for omelet makers!). I ate at a few other locations this time around and I wasn't disappointed.

And I also took the time to learn how to play some more games. Generally, I'm a craps man, but I've now taken a keen interest in Pai Gow. I left down pretty big so I'm hoping I can get a comp'd room or something on my next visit (hint, hint - LOL)

Overall, I enjoyed this stay 100x better than the first. Maybe it was because there was no major convention in town going on, but everything just seemed so much better - I don't know. But I will try to make sure I time my trips back out, whenever possible, to not coincide with big conferences.

Pros: 
-The rooms are nice. I really liked how when you opened the door for the first time the curtains would open. 
-I really liked the contemporary art they had all around the casino. Very few places were a bit on the Lady Gaga side (triangles and mirrors and cactuses?) 
-This isn't really a pro, but I thought it was sooooo cool how all their surfaces were different textures. No, I was not on LSD during my trip. Really people, the walls on the hotel floors outside the elevators were leather, whereas other places were smooth wood, granite, etc. Warning for future stumbling bastards: as you walk down the halls to your room the walls are a rough and have a grainy texture. If your face hits this wall because the Patron has taken over, half of your face will be scraped off!
-The maids were very friendly. Tip them! 
-Many restaurants for fine dining. More reviews later. 

Cons:
-The gambling is alright. I have a theory that since they are still relatively new they have to spank everyone and take their money in the first few years unlike the other casinos. I feel like I win more at the MGM and the like. Obviously gambling is part skill, mostly luck, and the house always has the advantage. 
-For an approaching holiday weekend I thought their check-in was on the slow side and only 4 people were working if I recall. I am a patient person so I didn't really care about the wait, but if you aren't then maybe Aria isn't the place for you.
-The room did not have blackout curtains. WTF. Well, technically I guess they are, but the very top of the curtains were wavy and let in sunlight. I'm not explaining this well, all I know is that I woke up at 6 am the first day since the sun was brightening up our room.
-The bed was comfortable, but I really didn't like the pillows. 

Random:
-I hope this isn't TMI but the toilets are too high. Just sayin'. 
-A lot of the tables were non-smoking, which I haven't really seen before in Vegas. Sweet! 
-Other people have commented on the vanilla smell. I liked it because you couldn't smell it all the time, only certain places had the strong aroma.

No one offered to help us with our luggage.  The registration line was super long and the associates were incredibly slow.  Even worse, when we checked-in, we were told that they only had ""smoking optional"" rooms available, even tho we requested a non-smoking room [nevermind the fact that the person next to us was given a non-smoking room immediately AFTER we were told there were none].  Anyways, I don't like to be difficult, so we took the smoking room after being told that they were well ventilated.  We get to the room, and of course, it stinks like an ashtray. We called front desk, only to be told that we'd have to return registration to switch rooms.  We returned to the front desk three more times and each time we were told that there were still none available.  Needless to say, we were stuck in the stinky room the rest of the weekend.  In the casino, I approached two employees behind a counter to ask for directions.  They were chatting away and waited minutes before having the courtesy to look up at me.  And when they finally did, they gave me the ""why are you bugging us"" look.  Unbelieveable! 

The exterior of the building is contemporary and pretty, but the decor of the casino and hotel is modern but kinda gloomy -- lots of brown and dark colors. I wasn't a big fan. The rooms are nice and modern, but are on the small side.  The fancy-all-in-one remote that controls everything from the lighting, music, TV, curtains, etc. is a cool concept but reeeeeally slow.  The layout of the room  is awkward. 

There are so many nicer hotels on the Strip that actually understand what customer service is.  This was definitely my first and last stay at Aria.",4,1,2

Upon arrival, which was near midnight, check-in was quick and painless.  We had requested a lower floor, although did not think that we would receive the 3rd floor and a view of the rooftop.  In the morning, we were shocked to find workers present when we opened the drapes, so we kept them closed at all times during our stay.  

Finding your room is quite an ordeal if you're tired or if you've had one too many drinks, since the hallways are winding and very confusing.

The Casino is much too dark, making you very tired, thus most people did not stay up late in this particular Casino.  The ambiance is not lively or welcoming in the Casino itself and even the Bar area plays classical music and not the upbeat music to keep patrons awake and wanting to play.

The Breakfast Buffet was not good whatsoever.  The stations are not clearly marked and the actual food was not as tastey as we expected it to be.  The Cafe' however had wonderful food, so we ate there most of our stay.

The Room was nice and while we did enjoy the high-tech gadgets (they all were working properly thank goodness), the bathroom does not lend itself to having more than 1-person in it at a time due to everything being glassed in and see-through.  There is only one plug behind the tissues and we didn't even have a Shower Cap.  The toilet area is roomy, however, there was no vent.  The upside was the bed -- the most comfortable EVER.

One huge complaint by us and everyone else we came in touch with was there was literally no place inside the Hotel\/Casino where Cell Phones would work.  When I needed to use my phone, I had to go towards the front desk area and outside the doors and in January it was pretty darn chilly and the time we were there, it rained 3 out of 4-days.

I didn't find the Hotel very user-friendly whatsoever.  We were being picked up by Limo to go to another Hotel and finding the area where Limo pick-ups were made took us 1\/2 hour and asking everyone we could along our way.  

I'm sure the Tram service is convenient, although the area in which you must walk to catch the Tram is not covered and with all the rain we experienced, we were never able to get to the Tram.

I have to say that I enjoy the other MGM properties much better than I enjoyed the Aria and I probably would not stay there again.",0,0,0

The exterior is clean and modern... and then we walked into the lobby. The lobby is beautiful; nicely decorated and continues the modern design. The sculpture of the Colorado River by Maya Lin over the check-in desk is so beautiful. 

And then we got to our room. Spoilers! When we opened our door for the first time, the lights came on, the curtains opened up and then music started playing. It made quite an entrance. Practically everything in the room is controlled by the tablet on the bedside table. I played with it quite a bit. While we didn't pony up for a ""room with a view"", we had a nice view out onto the strip and out west towards the Rio. My only (tiny) criticism is that the bathroom does not have enough towel bars.

First, the self parking is about a mile from the front desk through the entire casino. While typical of a Vegas casino, it's still incredibly annoying. Then, hopped in the line with about 20-25 people in front of us. About half way through the line they stopped checking anyone in. Eventually some agent came through the line saying they were ""updating"" the computers and it would only take 10 minutes. 10 minutes later another employee came through offering water saying that the systems would be up any minute now. Another roughly 10 minutes have passed. And, what looks to be a manager, Reginald, strolls through the line not addressing anything unless asked. So, I asked how things were going about 27 minutes into the wait. He told me that in fact, this shut down was scheduled. Yes, the Aria thought it was good to shut down their systems at 4PM to update it. Well, it's now 4:37 PM and no sign of the systems being up anytime soon, yet everyone is so assuring saying "" it should be up anytime."" Reginald also told me the shut would take 5-15 minutes.

The hotel is beautiful, the waterfall and art at the entrance are stunning. The bellman quickly offered to take our luggage, and thank good ness because the line for check-in was so long and slow. We spent about 25 minutes in line. The receptionist lied and told me since I had made my reservation less than 30 days ago, the rate had gone up. I had made the reservation 4 months prior along with 4 other of my coworkers who had already checked in earlier in the day. I even offered to show her my confirmation email, which she declined. Anyway, I had no choice at that point, it was 11pm, I was sleepy, hungry, just wanted to get to my room, I paid the higher rate. 
The room drapes opened magically as soon as we stepped in, but our view was horrible. Only on the 4th floor, we were overlooking Crystal Shoppes and saw a portion of the tram. The bellhop delivered our luggage very quickly and even brought a bag of ice. He was nice.
The hotel is beautiful. The concierge pointed out the silver sculpture at checkin is actually modeled after the Colorado River, 300 pounds of silver in that sculpture.

Service is pitifull
Quality of room is nowhere near 5 star
Fancy room technology does not work
The window washing that occurs wakes you up

When I arrived at the front desk I was greeted with a smile by the desk clerk (thats where the kindness ended).  I inquired about getting a room with two queen beds and you would have thought I asked to speak with the president himself.  She gave me a lot of attitude about how she would have to check and see (sounds easy right), but she seemed so upset over checking that.  Nonetheless she did get me a room with 2 queens.  I was going to ask for an upgrade but after that experience I was just glad to get 2 queens and still be alive.  When I walked into the room I was at first fascinated with the technology that comes with the room (electronic curtains and lights, etc) but it didnt take long for me to realize they went cheap on it.  The clock is also a remote with a giagantic cable hooked to the wall.  At best the clock remote works 45% of the time.  Our TV broke the second day there and had to be fixed.  Its fancy technology on the cheap...real cheap.

My biggest complaint by far was the window washers at 7:45am.  There I was trying to sleep on my vacation day, heaven forbid, and all of the sudden I thought King Kong was scaling the building.  I investigated the noise and saw two guys washing the windows, blairing music.  This happened the next day as well.  I complained and a $50 credit was ""given.""  I went to dinner at Julie Serrano, which was an OK place for tapas.  The bill was charged to the room with intent to use the $50 credit.  When I checked out the $50 credit was not given.  I went to the lobby and spoke with a desk clerk.  I explained all the problems I experienced during my stay and asked if she could credit the entire dinner bill, which was $92.00.  She said ok, then credited $50 to the bill.  I said, ""I thought you were going to credit the entire bill,"" and she responded, ""No,"" then handed me the receipt.  At that point I just wanted to leave the place and never return.  I dont recommend this place at all. They should be ashamed of their service.",2,1,1

At first I was totally awestruck with the place. Visually it was beautiful and we were taken aback by the size of the bathroom. However when I went  to take a shower I noticed a pile of blond hair stuck to the wall of the shower. Now, I am a girl and I understand we shed hair, however you would think that the housekeeping staff would clean the bathroom walls. 
We called to complain about the hair and the staff was really friendly and said that they would come take care of the situation. That evening we came back to our room to find the hair still on the walls of the shower. This time we went down to the front desk to complain but all they did was type the complaint in the computer and said they will take care of it.
In the end, nothing was taken care of,. We found a lady in the hallway who was dealing with turndown service, showed her the hair, and even though she wasnt a housekeeper, cleaned the mess for us out of the kindness of her heart.

We liked it quite a bit, but there were a few small irritations that annoyed me - not deal breakers, just irritants.  I would stay here again if I get a good deal on the room rate.

First the Pros:  The Aria is quite new, so everything is modern, clean, and not showing any wear or grime.  There are lots of restaurants located on the casino level and the Promenade level, at least three places for coffee (including Starbucks), and a spacious Jean Philippe Patisserie that serves beautiful pastries as well as sandwiches.  The casino is huge, doesn't reek of smoke, is well-lit and pleasantly quiet, not frantic and deafening.  Outside are two water features that I found mesmerizing: a ""waterfall wall"" and a fountain with a unique lighting system and different spray programs.

The hotel staff was very efficient, polite and courteous.  Even all the housekeepers smile and say ""good morning"" when you pass in the hall.  Security (there were many) and casino workers were likewise pleasant and helpful.

In the room, everything electronic is\/can be controlled by a master LCD touch panel (like a tablet) on the nightstand.  So when you go to bed, one tap on an icon will turn off all lights and TV, and close the drapes.  The panel also serves as a clock and you can set an alarm if you wish.  It also controls the air conditioner and TV.  I think you can change channels with it too, but there is a regular remote control for that as well.  The bathroom has double sinks and a separate toilet area.  Towels are thick and fluffy, and they even provide robes for you to use.  We did not use the bath sundries provided.

I liked the master on\/off light switch and the ""Privacy"" and ""Service"" switches next to the door that illuminated signs outside, which replace the old doorknob hang tags.

Elevators are fast and plentiful.  For efficiency, they provide six elevators for every 12 floors or so, so depending on which floor you're on, you must take a certain bank of elevators.  There is a free electric air-conditioned tram that shuttles you between the adjacent Monte Carlo and Bellagio Hotels.  If they could only extend this to the entire Strip!

Now the Cons:  As other yelpers pointed out, you do a lot of walking at this hotel (but this helps you burn off the calories that you're consuming in Vegas!)  If you self-park there is a long walk to the front desk to check in because first you have to reach the hotel, then you must trek through the entire length of the casino to reach the front desk.  I fumed about this until my wife pointed out that the front desk is at the FRONT of the hotel (closest to Las Vegas Blvd. and where the taxis and valet parking are) so that made sense.  Besides, you only check in once, then you never have to do the hike again.  The walk back to your car really isn't that long; it is comparable to most other Vegas Strip hotels, I think.  But to get to the Strip itself you have to walk through the adjacent Crystals Mall instead of just through the casino.  There can be a long walk from the elevator to your room, however, since it is a large hotel and one bank of elevators per floor.

I did not care for the electronic control panel in the room.  There is an annoying 2-second delay between tapping the icon and the action taking place, as another yelper mentioned.  This can and should be fixed.  I mostly preferred to disregard the touch pad and just use the regular on\/off switches on the lamps and the wall switch for the drapes.

The wireless internet in the room is slow!  When you login it tells you it is 1Mb per second.  Really?  Can't they at least do 10Mbs which is the slowest you can do at your own home these days?  And for this you pay $28 per day (resort fee is $25 + $3 tax..they don't tell you about the tax until you look at your bill).  The resort fee entitles you to a daily newspaper (but you have to go get it) and access to the workout room (I didn't try).

Our king bed was soft and comfortable but my side of it was saggy.  I attribute it to guests sitting on it repeatedly in that spot because the control panel is on that nightstand and you have to sit to operate it.  Aria management should look into this phenomenon as a byproduct of the control panel (Note to management if you're reading: Room 19225).

Lastly, we had two electrical problems in our room.  One was a burned out bulb, then the next morning we discovered that the bathroom duplex outlet and some of the lights didn't work.  We called downstairs and they quickly sent an electrician both times.  He apologized for the inconvenience (praise to him for speaking on behalf of the hotel) and fixed the problems in good time.  He said the lighted makeup mirror in the bathroom had malfunctioned and blew the electrical circuit.  He fixed the GFI outlet and replaced the lighted mirror.  Great and efficient service fixed the problem!

The walls in the hotel rooms are so thin that you can hear right through them,  we went to vegas for a specific event that started early in the morning. the people staying in the room next to us left their TV on playing music full blast. I'm not niece about vegas but i also know that i shouldn't be able to hear the people next door. when i called security about this they walked by and said they didn't hear anything. so i called them again and they asked if they could come in the room. when we let them in they tried to say it was the pool party, irritated that it was 3 AM and had to wake up at 6 , told them unless they have a party in the parking lot it wasn't that! at 4 am they finally decide to go inside the room next door and turned off the TV that was left on. 

the next day, after the event that i was supposed to go to we decided to go look at the shops with my sister in law and went to the elvis store they have, she loves Elvis and she wanted to buy a shit there. when she got to the cashier the she had the nerve to ask her if she wanted a different size the shirt she got was a medium and maybe she needed an extra large... i couldn't believe it! my jaw dropped... she didn't bother to buy the shirt and we left outraged and very disappointed in the quality of service. 

I will never stay at the Aria again. now when i go to vegas i always stay at the Encore or Wynn. it may be more expensive but the quality of service that  i receive there is always amazing. So my suggestion to who ever is looking to stay in vegas.... DONT STAY AT THE ARIA!!",0,0,0

Having stayed all over the strip the past 6 years, Shady was ready to take on M Lifes' top prop. Sitting square in between the ultra quiet Vdara and the ultra raucous Cosmo, Aria fit the bill for the first half of the sojourn. The second half was at Cosmo so the relative quiet of Aria was welcome. Upscale, attractive, with very very reasonably priced rooms for the quality and service, Aria makes the short list of possible returns. Jean Phillipe Patissierie square in the middle of the casino is a BIG problem for Shady and his sweet tooth. Multiple gelato\/espresso\/chocolate runs were needed to deal with all the ?stress?  Rooms are very comfortable, high tech. People claim to have problems figuring the entertainment system. What? really? These same  people have analog stereo's and tube t.v's as well. Casino is nicely laid out, not a lot of smoke. Shady spent a fair amount of time at the sports book and hit every bar multiple times. Not really a ""singles"" kinda place, Aria seemed most fit for couples. Pools, all three (not Liquid), were nice and easily accessible at all times. Seems the front pool was a nice mix, the middle pool a little more rowdy(closest to the bar!) and the back pool most quiet. Having Crystals next door is a plus, unless, like Shady,  you decide to take a special someone for a little shopping. Bring the black card. Easily accessible to Cosmo next door, Aria offers a nice retreat in Vegas. Shady and VERY LUCKY guest spent an entire afternoon at the luxurious spa-thai yoga massages, hot stone massages, reflexology, pools, hot tubs, saunas, steams, nice  workout area-it has it all. As nice as Canyon Ranch at Venetian\/Palazzo. Shady was very happy with Aria, and puts it right there with Venetian\/Palazzo as a go to place with  a lucky guest. V\/P, because of the suite-rooms is a better option for groups.Cosmo is still tops for a boys\/girls trip.  But you cant go wrong at Aria. Food options are plentiful and Shady hit 'em all !",2,1,2

every few floors has their own 3 sets of elevators. the layout of the hotel is kinda odd. its practically 2 arches intersecting, making for a maze of a hallway. 

when we get to the door i pull out my card key to locate which side the magnetic strip is on; there is none. its a blank white card. i look at the doorknob for a keycard slot; there is none. all you do is wave the keycard on a small black circle just above the knob and you hear the mechanism unlock itself followed by the affirming green light. 

the beds were a little tall which is cool and as comfortable as you could ever imagine. 7 pillows on each bed. sheets were plush and downy. theres an automatic mini bar with a digital lock to keep out sticky fingers. when i say automatic i mean there are sensors on all the items in the fridge. im guessing if you touch, you buy. 

asides from the mini bar there were 2 bottles of fiji water, a bag of potato chips, box of chocolates, bag of pistachios, chocolate covered almonds, martini shaker, and other random things that i wanted to bring home. 

everything was controlled by a digital control panel on the bedside table. it was tethered via usb cord but cool none the less. curtains, lights, music, flatscreen tv, alarm, everything. if at 7am you wanted the temperature to fall to 60 and have the curtains open you could make that happen. 

the bathroom had everything you could want, especially a nail file, cleansing pads, cotton swabs and those badass mini sewing kits. the toilet is hidden behind an opaque glass. theres also a shower bathtub combo. kinda hard to explain but its pretty neat. the bathtub is in the shower pretty much. 

one of the managers comped us a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries too.. me n my womans first new years together.

downstairs theres this delicatessen or whatever with pastries as well as paninis. they have a prosciutto and fresh mozzarella sandwich which is THE BOMB!!!

One thing after another. Not to mention they totally messed up on the billing. Finding this out almost 1 week later when I was double charged for a room. Come to find out when I called them up about it they had no record of the charge to my credit card. Now having to file a dispute with my credit card company on it because Aria could not explain why my account was double charged and they found no record of a double charge on there end yet I had all the proof recipes and everything to back up my claim that they even double charged me even statement from the cc company. Thank god the cc company has my ass covered.

Now it's just a waiting game . Nice hotel just watch the billing watch your statement and charges carefully.

EDC Weekend Attender
they ended up fixing a lot of things but the room was all messed up. I am going to list them here.

1) The AC was horrible the room got cool but still was on he very hot side. Kept the AC at as low as it would go but still didn't seem to kick out enough cool air. It was manageable so we just kinda dealt with it.

2) hairballs found in the bathrooms upon arrival. it was corrected but still kind of nasty did arrive seen it and then having to call up housekeeping to deal with it it should've been done before arrival and especially when you're paying so much money for a room.  not to mention who the suitr

3) TV went out in the bedroom the second night and had to have maintenance come fix it.

4) Lost phone service out of one of the phones during some time but then ended up coming back after they fixed it.

5) One of the bathroom faucets you could completely ripped out and fell off and was loose. 

Now I will give it to Aria that they did correct most of the things. But it's was still upsetting to have to experience so much head ach with the room. What actually killed the icing on the cake was that in the end the bill was all jacked up and to have been double double charged as stated above. I don't feel that Aria with all the problems cared enough. Instead they cared enough to double change me and then act as though they had no clue about the double charge.

And now having to deal with this and disputed charges was just the icing on the cake.

Anyways felt it was necessary to voice my
option and experience. I will say this I might not go back seeing how my first experience when so bad from the problems with the room all the way to being double billed .

Not to mention I tripped over ripped up carpet on the floor that never got fixed after I mentioned it to

I came here for my birthday with a large party for a weekend. I had a wonderful experience, although I think alot of my friends might have a different opinion. 

It took me all of 5 minutes to check in, but for some of my friends it took as much as an hour. (We checked in at the same time...) I couldn't understand why, but FYI Aria, when the lines are long, the solution is not to close up shop. You should open up more lines. 

I had chocolate covered dipped strawberries and macaroons sent to my room, complimentary from the hotel, for my birthday! That was a great gift, thank you! 

I have to say, the touch remote that controls all of the functions in the room is pretty cool, but only after you figure out how to use it. It sucks when you try to turn on lights, but instead cue all of the curtains to close and all the lights to turn down. Haha. I would HIGHLY recommend  that those who are NOT TECH SAVVY do not stay here. IT WILL DRIVE YOU MAD!! 

The pool was nice. It's nothing special, but I have to say...almost every other chaise lounge has an umbrella which is fabulous. I was planning on getting a cabana for all of my friends one of the days, but didn't because I didn't think it was hot enough. Good thing I didn't. I would have wasted my money because of all of the wind, cold temp, and the umbrellas! 

The cafe downstairs (Jean Philippe Patisserie) is pretty good. Their spicy chicken panini is pretty tasty. We ate this both on Saturday and Sunday  for a quick bite. 

Service was pretty slow all weekend for everything. I couldn't get through even to the front desk Sunday afternoon, so I was forced to go downstairs. (For some reason I couldn't express check out of the hotel through the tv.) I found out through concierge that my touch pad in my room was missing like 100 service buttons. I guess that's what happens when you have too much technology in 1 machine. Haha. So I had to express checkout the old school way (filling out a form and dropping it off in the box). There was NO WAY in hell I was going to wait in line to physically check out. 

I found out that the weekend I went was a sold out weekend for the hotel. This explained ALOT. The hotel is probably not as bad on a slower time...but it wasn't HORRIBLE as I'd imagine it to be (based on the reviews here..)

I won money gambling, always had a drink in my hand, ate some good food, and had a wonderful time with my friends. I'm not going to complain too much...!! If I get pretty good rates in the future, I'll def be back!",3,2,1

We have stayed at a variety of different hotels throughout the years (Stratosphere, Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Treasure Island, etc.).   

When we arrived we parked in the self parking lot.  It is a bit of a walk from the lot to the front desk, but nothing out of the ordinary in comparison to other hotels.  We found the front desk and got in line.  It was a moderately long line and we did wait about 25-30 minutes to be helped.  It was again nothing out of the ordinary as it seems we always find long check-in lines regardless of what hotel or day of the week we arrive.  There is a front desk \/manager (for lack of better title) at the front of the line greeting each guest and leading them to the next available clerk.  He was very pleasant, however, he began to close lines down when we reached the front of the line and there were still a significant amount of people behind us. I was slightly irritated that I had to wait even more time because of that. When we were finally helped, the clerk was extremely friendly, polite and helpful.  It was a pleasant check-in experience and we were given exactly the room we had reserved, unlike at other hotels. 

When we arrived in our room, it felt like the room was waiting just for us.  As we walked in, the lights turned on, the TV turned on and began to play music and the curtains began to open to reveal a beautiful view of the City Center and Strip.  The room we reserved was a deluxe king city view.  We got everything we asked for.  The amenities are plush- comfy bed, gorgeous bathroom, spotlessly clean.  The shower and tub were large and the toilet area was private. I liked the fact that our room provided a nice size tub-something most hotels do not give unless you pay extra. (the Bellagio did not have the same to offer). The room was nice sized-not overly expansive, yet not so small that you couldn't easily walk around among the furniture.   The touch control panel was nifty and nice to use while laying in bed.  I did, however, accidentally hit the ""good night"" button by the bedside and everything turned off at once and the curtains closed, making the room pitch black.  Great for bedtime, not great at that moment, but a funny memory nonetheless.  

The housekeeping service is very polite and respectful of privacy.  At the Aria, there are no more doorknob hangers asking for peace, now you just press a simple button inside your room, and a little red light appears outside your door.  Additionally when you leave, you can request service by pressing another button by your door.   There is also a turndown service.   Every housekeeper we saw during our stay while walking down the hallway greeted us.  It was a change from other hotels.    

Casino- we really liked the cleanliness and lack of excessive smokiness at this casino.  Neither my husband or I is a smoker, so we appreciated the ventilation systems they have in place at the Aria.  We only played slots at the casino, but no tables since we are both hesitant to blow more than $5-$10 on a hand of anything.  However, what we loved about Aria is that it is just a short walk (mostly indoor) to the Monte Carlo where they did have tables and poker that was more up our spending alley. 

Restaurants- we ate at Javier's, Cafe Ventro (?) and The Buffet.   I will review those seperately, but what I will say is that the food options are on the pricier side.  Cafe Ventro was reasonable and we only had dessert there.  The choices for food are limited to high end choices, but there is a food court within walking distance so at least there are options.  

Would I stay here again? Absolutely. I am the type of girl who likes luxury and the room felt luxurious.  I slept great and loved all of the fancy little extras that you do not find elsewhere.  (We stayed at the bellagio just last year and it had been renovated.  It was beautiful, but this is better). The decor throughout the hotel is plush- various fabrics and materials to create a rich feel:  modern, contemporary but not abstract\/weird.   The elevators for every floor are in one central location. I like that- I don't have to go searching for the right tower or section of the hotel.  It is easy to find.  I love visiting the Crystals shopping center.  Staying here made that easy.  And I love that for the gambling, if I'm not interested in a $25 minimum bet, I can easily get to the Monte Carlo for something at my comfort level.  Without a doubt, one of the best stays we've had in Vegas!   Stay here, you will love it!

They are two distinctly different worlds but offer the same opulence and service that one expects from a 5 star establishment, executing in different ways but in equal effectiveness.  On this stay we opted to stay at Aria.  Such a phenomenal place from start to finish.  I only had one gripe this visit and I will get that out of the way to focus on the many positives.  Upon arrival at McCarran I checked my e-mail and was informed a room was ready....the only problem was it was on the 4th floor.  Since we were going to be in town for 3 nights I wanted the best view we could possibly get so I inquired about getting a strip view once we arrived at the hotel (around 8:30 am).  I was told that it should be a few hours for a strip view to be available but once a room was ready I would be informed via text or e-mail.  To waste some time we walked around the strip, come 1:00\/1:30 we still did not receive notification of availability.  We went back to the hotel to see about getting an update and was told the room was available.  I wonder had we not checked when or if we would have even gotten notification, or for that matter how long had the room been available.....not acceptable in my view for a 5 star place but they did more than make up for it.  I had been coordinating a floral display for my girlfriend as a belated Valentine's Day gift (couldn't possibly get her flowers here at home on Valentine's Day and have them die while we were out of town!) and boy did the concierge and floral department deliver.  The display was executed to perfection while we were out seeing a show that night.  The display might I add was exemplary and even better than the pictures the concierge had sent me.  Many thanks to Kim and Ms. Manaj in the Concierge area.  Next highlight was the buffet that was provided packaged with our room deal.  Such a great variety of food from all around the world, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The flavors are awesome and even if you had to pay full price it would still be worth it.  On Friday I surprised my girl with a couples massage package at the spa.  We had done couples massages at other establishments but this one had a few things that we enjoyed thoroughly that the other places did not have.  They had a co-ed waiting area so that you and your significant other could be called to your appointment at the same time.  No waiting, no guess work.  It was fantastic.  They also had a Himalayan salt room that was so relaxing and meditative.  The salts are supposedly good for the upper respiratory health.  The Japanese Hot Stone beds were soothing also.  Good for metabolism and relaxation.  The 80 minute massage itself was heavenly and provided just what we needed to alleviate stress.  You never know how knotted your body is until the massage therapists begin their work.  Needless to say.....we will definitely return to Aria when we find ourselves in Vegas again.  So wonderful.",3,0,3

Aria takes itself so seriously, but lacks any sort of substance. Everything about this place is wrong, from the overdone technology that barely functions to the almost inedible room service.

I booked a room at the Sky Suites. The stay started off well enough, with a limo picking me up and taking me to the ""private"" entrance. The free ""lounge"" area was nice except for the scores of other guests scurrying to hoard as much free stuff as possible. The frenetic atmosphere of this area reminded me more of a Shoneys than a classy lounge.

The technology in the room was excessive and barely worked. The jets in the Jacuzzi tub turned on randomly. We ordered 2 pizzas from room service that were, without a doubt, the worst pizzas I've ever had in my life. And I've had a lot of pizza.. The entire pie was about 4 inches thick. The crust was 0.25 inches, the sauce 0.25 inches, and (I'm not kidding) about 3.5 inches of disgusting, low quality cheese was piled on top. And they charged almost $50 for it.

It didn't end there. To try to make up for the horrible heartburn suffered from room service, I looked for a coffeemaker or some other device to make tea. None in the room. I called Room Service, and they wanted $4 to ""deliver"" it to me. 

We asked them not to clean our room. They called 3 separate times to confirm this, and then started to clean our room at 11:30 PM when we were out!!! And when we complained, no one cared.

Aria should rename itself Kafka, because the cold indifference of the staff was really the icing on the cake. In the most contrived tone they could possibly muster, the front desk pretended to care about my terrible stay. With SO MANY better hotels in Vegas, don't make the same mistake I did and choose Aria.",8,2,0

The City Center has become it's own little world, and the Aria is a huge part of it. The ambiance in the casino is unusual, dark and mysterious but really enjoyable. It's difficult to get ahold of the cocktail waitresses sometimes while you are gambling, but my boyfriend and I had great luck in their casino so we were happy. The hotel rooms are great, clean, modern, well designed. The buffet is one of my favorites on the strip by far! Try the biscuits and gravy, totally evil. The pool area is great!!

To their credit, staff (Corrine) was friendly but unable to accommodate rooms side-by-side on a higher floor.  She did provide a roll-away in each room at no additional cost...but aren't they always free?  I was in no mood to question nor verify and accepted with graciousness given my inclination to blow my meager paycheck.

Stayed in 24-274 and 37-115.

Pros:
-central location
-shower head
-proximity to Secret Pizza and Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo via North Valet entrance (7 minute walk and avoids the Strip)
-$117\/night per room through Priceline Express
-""free"" wi-fi as part of mandatory resort fee
-sports book 

Cons:
-$28 resort fee per room per night
-37-115's key sensor malfunctioned on Saturday so they provided a $100 resort credit for our troubles (thanks to the fiancé).  Applying the credit became a hassle in it of itself and we soon found out it was not applicable towards retail items nor boxed chocolate at the cafe.  So of course, the fiancé makes another call and had them refund me all resort fees (~$106).

Room: The room itself (the new, clean one) was decent.  The beds were very comfortable, there was plenty of space to hang our clothes, and the iPad that controlled everything from the tv, to the lights, to the curtains was a nice touch.  I wish I had gotten to take advantage of the large tub but the shower wasn't bad either.  My only complaint about the room was that even when we lowered the AC to below 70, we were both still pretty warm.  I would've bet that it didn't actually get lower than 75 in there. On our 2nd day, we requested housekeeping service on our way out for the day.  We came back several hours later and they still hadn't come.  They ended up calling our room in the early evening to see if we still wanted them to come by.  I'm not sure if we had just missed them or they were understaffed, but we were disappointed that they were not able to clean our room that day. 

Room service: We ordered room service one night.  Vegas is a 24 hour town and thankfully so is the room service.  We ordered a pizza and some fries.  The wait was pretty standard, about 45 minutes.  And the man who brought it to us was very sweet.  The food, unfortunately, was mediocre.  But I didn't have to change out of pajamas to get it.  If there's a next time, I'd probably opt for Jean Phillippe's on the casino level which had much better food.  

Casino & Bars: As is the case in most casinos, smoking is permitted.  As someone that is pretty sensitive to the smell of smoke, I was surprised that I could hardly notice it.  Also, I'm not a big gambler but there seemed to be something for everyone.  In addition, there is quite a diverse selection of bars and restaurants to choose from around the casino.  I won't comment here on those as they all have their own separate yelp pages.  But Javier's was excellent for dinner and Jean Philippe's was good for a quick sandwich or snack.  

Check out: The check out process was hectic.  Of course, we chose to check out on a Sunday morning at 11, along with half of the rest of the hotel.  They do have the option for either mobile checkout or checking out via the room's iPad.  But due to a technical error on their end, it was not working for our room and we had to see the front desk.  There was someone there to help us out and didn't stand in line for very long.  We were also able to leave our bags at the bell desk so we could go enjoy our day before our flight.  Bag drop off and pick up was excellent.  

I had a decent time here but I would likely not come back the next time I return to Vegas.  There were other hotels that I've heard better things about.  I will say that every staff member we encountered was very nice.  But overall, for the money we paid to stay there, I was not impressed.",2,0,0

I really have to share how unprofessional the front desk receptionist is. The room that I stayed at has a leak from the ceiling. We are up at 7 since the leaking noise . I called the front desk regrading to this issue and I was told that we have to switch room which is not a problem beside up at 7 in the morning. I have to call back again since I need to pack up my stuff and call back again.
The interesting part is when I called again and the front deck receptionist seems like did not know what happened.(The first receptionist told me that she will leave comment and I only need to tell them about changing the room) 
The second receptionist that I had over the phone kept asking me where the leak is at instead of apologize of the whole situation and she doesn't seems like knowing what to do. I have to tell her the situation and request a bell boy again instead of the front desk receptionist able to offer to me. 
Last part is I got hang up after I told her I need a bell boy and she didn't even ask if I need anything else.

Another thing I like about this place are the rooms which are modern but simple, yet elegant and spacious enough to make you feel like a king.  From the moment you walk into this hotel, you'll feel like you're in a hip, dark lounge that makes you feel comfortable enough to unwind and feel free to roam around the entire property in your robe with a cigar in one hand and a glass of vino in the other.  

My favorite part about this property is the casino, especially the poker room, which is located right in front of the hotel, and it's big enough to accommodate enough people than almost all of the other poker rooms on the strip.  I heart this poker room and the casino here is HUGE!  Every game you can think of is available at this property, and it makes this a gambler's paradise.

The joke was that we were too old to stay at the Cosmo. That sort of sums the Aria experience right there. It definitely goes for a more mature audience. 

The room was beautiful. Even if it was on the 5th floor (WTH?). The bed was so amazingly comfortable, that when they legalize marriage to inanimate objects, I am going to marry that bed. The techy part was a neat gimmick, opening and closing the curtains from bed - convenient, although we did end upturning off all the lights by mistake more than once. The bathroom was okay. There's a separate toilet room, which would be handy if the door wasn't frosted glass. One of the keys to a successful marriage is never seeing your spouse on the bowl.

The casino used to be one of my favorites. I can tell you now, since they swapped out my machine, (while I was there!!!!) that Miss Kitty used to pay out. We drank at Bar Moderno and the View Bar. Some of the live music was okay, but guitar dude? Late night? Where are we again? We like to play spot the hooker. Good times. On principle, we decided that we wouldn't eat at the Aria restaurants even if we became millionaires. Look at those prices! Do you think I don't understand food costs? GFY. 

The Aria also has it's own tram that shuttles back and forth to the Bellagio. We were on it with these guys who kept expecting it to take them across the street to Planet Hollywood. It was pretty funny.

But beware - the entire first floor - lobby & casino - smells like vanilla. If you are migraine or allergy prone this may not be the place for you. 

All in all, next time, I think we might try the Vdara. I'll let you know.

I've been to Vegas several times and normally opt to stay off the strip due to fact that most of the reasonably priced hotels on the strip are extremely old so when I found a under $200 rate at a new modern hotel I was geeked!!!
 
Unfortunately that ended fairly soon. 

ROOM: Great looking, very modern & spacious, yet there is no real direction as to how everything works. Took me 15-20 minutes to get things working properly and even then I had several lights that I could not get to turn on. also the only outlets are at the front of the room by the tv. No night stand outlets so if you are like me and like having you phone close to you at all times, charge it during the day else be forced to get up out of bed in the middle of the night to answer it.

FRONT DESK: Very friendly yet sometimes inefficient.  Had to call several times about getting my lights fixed. Internet wouldn't work properly and they kept transferring me to the wrong people to fix it. Called for an extension cord so that I could work comfortably in my bed b\/c the outlet is soooooo far away and she talked to me as if it was the silliest thing they've ever heard.  Let how odd is it that I would want an outlet near me so I could work from my bed or answer my phone!

CONCIERGE: They just seemed confused. The last time I visited Vegas I used the monorail to get around the strip. Being that the city center is so new and I asked about trains, buses, monorails to get back and forth.  Th e1st concierge told me about the free shuttle to get to Bellagio. The 2nd told me about the RTC bus. The 3rd told me to walk to MGM grand and get the monorail. None of them actually got me to where I was trying to go.  I just ended up taking a taxi because they confused me even more.

ELEMENTS: This is their 24 hour one stop shop although looking from the outside you would never know this.  When walking by it looks like a clothing shop advertising the Elvis show but they have everything. I loved it until I went to pay and couldn't find a register that was open.  When I finally saw an employee standing by a register I sat my items on the counter and she pointed at a closed sign that was closer to another register. Didn't even speak or try to get me some help.  I was flabbergasted! 

PROS: Great vibe. Not at all casino-y lol Has a upscale feel. Nice location. Great food although lacks a cost variety. Cheapest cup of coffee in this place was $8
 
CONS: Room has hair everywhere. I have no clue where it came from because my housekeeper was bald. My towels were noticeably dirty and one reeked of smoked.

I like the feel of the City Center but I won't stay here again.  May try Planet Hollywood or the Cosmopolitan next time.",2,1,0

At first take I was so smitten by the quiet, understated modern elegance of the clean lines and modern decor.  When I walked in the lobby it didn't have that ""overwhelming-crazy-busy-Vegas"" vibe, which was a very welcoming and relaxing feeling (esp. right after traveling).  I was pleasantly surprised by a woodsy-sweet scent in the lobby instead of cigarette smoke and that gross ""up-all-night"" musk.  But I was really more excited to try out this ""one-touch integrated room technology"" it boasts and supposedly sets it apart from the other hotels.

But as time passed during our Vegas visit, it was just a series of ""Are you serious?!"" moments that led me down a path to these two an a half measly stars.

- We requested a room away from the elevators - but they put us waaaaay at the end of the building.  Are you serious, Aria?  It was a hike.  And as you would imagine that was problematic after a long night of drinking (and in heels, no less!) LOL

- When we got inside our room, there was no ""greeting""; no lights turn on, the drapes don't open, no music welcomes us.  The tv is supposed to turn on too, to allow me to personalize my settings - but there was just a whole lot of.....Nothing.  What the heck?

- The huzbeau fiddled with the ""One-Touch"" switch to open the drapes; There was no one-touch about it!  He had to keep pressing the switch because the drapes kept getting stuck.  It was such bad comedy to watch.

- there was a gaping hole on the door to our bathroom, where a doorknob is supposed to be; where's the hardware?  Now that's just sloppy.

The room was nice, pretty and functional bathroom, comfy bed.  I would expect this much for a 5 star hotel.

And yes, the rooms are nice (when you actually are able to get to them). But guest services for check-in and check-out were horrible. We spent 3 hours checking into our room. First time they told us they didn't have the room type we originally reserved and put us in a King smoking room, but told us we could change it in the morning. We said fine. We get to our room and the card keys do not work. We come down and wait another 40 minutes to get the keys reactivated, then go all the way back up to the 15th floor to find out they gave us someone's room. Good thing my friends and I are not stealers because we had complete access to the room, which is completely unacceptable for any guest. So we go down a final time and wait again, almost an hour, to speak to a manager to get us our rooms. We ended up getting one night comped and $175 worth of resort credit in the room type we initially reserved but it still wasn't worth all the drama we had to go through to get it. But the drama didn't end there...for the three nights we stayed there, housekeeping did not come by once to clean our rooms, so I constantly had to track down a cleaning lady to get fresh towels for the day. And when we checked out, they were trying to charge us again for the extra night they comped us. Crazy!

Although the smell is still far from ever winning me over, the amazing memories I built at Aria from my last trip will always be engraved within my nostalgic brain. However, this time around I knew my Vegas 2012 trip would triumph all. My friends and I booked the 2 bedroom penthouse for the weekend so we already knew our Vegas trip would be going down in history.

Although I missed the accommodated limo ride to and from the airport (my flight was later than my party), I was still able to enjoy the luxurious amenities Aria offered throughout the weekend. For starters, the Aria Suites & Villas stayers had a separate area for check-in and elevators aside from the rest of the hotel. This lavish secluded area had a lounge that provided a seating area as well as complimentary food and beverages consisting of chocolate covered strawberries, a variety of cheeses, perfectly crafted scones, decadent chocolate chip cookies, red and white wines, bottles of Fiji water, Sprite, Coke, Orange juice and so forth. The lounge was always stocked despite our 14 people party depleting the stash a majority of the time. The staff was always alert and catered to whatever it is we wanted, including our request for 12 towels in the room. 

As for our two bedroom penthouse. HOLY MOLY. It was the most gorgeous of all gorgeous sights. Two bedrooms; each stocked with a walk in closet, king sized beds, 100% Egyptian cotton sheets, mattresses feeling like your back is resting on heaven, 52"" LCD HD TVs... one in every, single, room, including the bathrooms, which by the way there's three of them. Each bedroom has it's own bathroom with a bath whirlpool tub, granite sink countertops and vanities, private shower AKA ""private water closet,"" and a toilet that has an electronic bidet that cleans every crease and crevice of your frontal and back private parts. A wet bar, dining room, living room, bedside touchscreen technology to open curtains, turn on television, do all that handy stuff without having to get up from your comfy ass bed, space on space on space, holy crap my heart is beating rapidly because the very thought of explaining our penthouse makes me fall in love all over again.

Aside from all the hotel amenities, I absolutely loved how Aria was conveniently located close to everywhere we wanted to go. Also the entire resort was just so pleasing to the eyes. In my last review I might've stated that ""Perhaps on my next visit to Vegas I just might reconsider staying at Aria again,"" I would like to take that statement back and say with confidence that I will always want to stay in Aria's penthouses every time I visit Vegas.",3,3,2

For the price, you could get something better somewhere else. 

My first experience was two years ago when we stayed in the summer. Given- prices were extremely high due to the particular weekend, but I was very unimpressed by the room they gave us. But I gave that a pass.

Latest experience was this weekend. Check-in time was what, 3pm? We arrived at 7pm due to our flight. They gave away our 2-bed room and left us with a 1-bed room that smelled like straight up WEED. No apologies and no discounts. Are you freaking serious? It honestly felt like a huge slap in the face. 

Another thing is the fridge. Why can't they reserve the top row for the weighted\/censored items and the bottom row for people to put in their own food and beverages? Or have two separate fridges? Ridiculous!

The lady behind the counter seemed lost at times and was not that pleasant. So if your room is not ready they will take your information and then text you when it is done. There were five of us and we all wanted a high floor all together she said that would be an issue. So we said do the best you can and she said it would be about two hours. Less than ten minutes later our friend receives a text saying the room is ready. It was but for the wrong people the room and all the amenities that we ordered such as fridge, our chocolates for anniversary. So 3 hours later we go over to find out why our rooms are not ready and we find Raniel (awesome). He told that the person before him messed up the rooms and he took very good care of us. We were placed on the 52nd floor. I recommend getting as high as you can, we had a city view...wow you could see over most of the other casinos.
         Room: The room was very clean and modern. It also had a Touchscreen that controlled the room and a big flat screen. The bed is the most comfortable bed that I have slept in by far. The AC worked well and so did everything else. The TV was a little slow in response to you changing channel and volume. It was a decent size and had a lot of room for storage. There is a safe it is in the night stand bottom drawer. Don't touch the stuff on top or in the fridge it's an automatic charge to the room. 
 Hotel and casino: Hotel is gorgeous looking lots of cool art and also smells nice. The casino is huge not to crowded limits are high. The sports book is great lots of TV and space to sit down and enjoy the games.  The bars are really nice way overpriced but hey that's Vegas.  The chocolate place also has breakfast sandwiches and coffee, it's a good place to stop and grab a bite to eat.

I got to see some of the most beautiful sunsets of my life out the window. 
Here's some of my complaints.  I was in Vegas for a conference and the pool and spa closed at 6pm.  There's no way I could be back in time.  Extremely short pool\/spa hours. I understand this isn't just the Aria, but most\/all of the hotels in Vegas, but still... 
There's also not a ton of food options.  There's a buffet, Thai restaurant, burger place, pizza place and a couple little cafes.  Considering how massive the hotel was, I was expecting more options. It sounds like a lot, but when you're there for a week, it was a lot of burgers and pizza.  Also, there's no open seating for you to just hang out and sit and read\/work around the hotel. All they have is the hotel lounge in the main lobby.  Which is okay, but compared to the Bellagio, it was disappointing.  Bellagio has beautiful little seating areas by windows and spread throughout the hotel to sit and talk\/work\/read, etc.  Not the case with the Aria. There's no seating.  So you have to sit in the lobby or go back to your room. 
It was a beautiful hotel and overall good experience, but I'd prefer one of the other hotels given the options\/competition available.",1,2,2

It's located in an upscale part of the strip called City Center which is surrounded by luxury stores such as Tom Ford, Dolce & Gabbana and Stella McCartney. Stayed here since a very close friend of mine works in management for MGM Hotels and got me good hookups.

I arrived at check in around 12pm and they were able to get me a room despite it being 3 hours before check-in. Staff was very helpful and the line was moving quick. 

The casino isn't a cheesy, smoke smelling casino like others found on the strip. Although smoking is allowed, you can hardly smell the smoke. The food\/drink options are phenomenal! So many places to eat or drink. My favorite was Javier's and Julian Serrano.  Nightlife  there really isn't anything too hip happening except Haze nightclub sometimes. Crowd was fairly good, not many douchebags. Mostly couples and professionals in their late 20's and 30's. Pools weren't as crowded as others on the strip.

The rooms are comfortable and very clean. House keeping really does a great job at cleaning your room. Love the technology incorporated in the room, as well as the tub and shower. Room service was also great! Left my room completely trashed one day due to heavy partying, went downstairs to get brunch with a girlfriend and came back it was impeccably clean and she even organized all my clothes\/shoes. I called the front desk to give her praise and leave her a tip, she was amazing! 

I just wish the rooms had more color and a more boutique feel to them like the Cosmo has. The room was nice but it was just full of brown and neutral tones. Pops of color would have been nice.

Pros:
Elegant, Luxurious, Modern
Good crowd 
Great dining options
Clean room
Good Service
Location
Great stores 

Cons:
A bit of a walk to get to the strip 
Casino isn't as lively 
Nightlife isn't really popping 
LONG walk to rooms 
Water wasn't working on the Sunday I stayed and they still charged me Resort Fee
Wi-Fi wasn't working on the following Monday and still charged me a Resort Fee

Great for couples and families who want an elegant and modern place to stay and enjoy Las Vegas. If you're looking to party with your girlfriends or have a bachelor party or just want something more lively but still elegant and modern I'd say stay next door at The Cosmopolitan

Update: Management messaged me and comped me my resort fee for the day the wi-fi and water wasn't working plus comped me my room service charges those days. I did not complain at all other than write a review. Great staff!

The servers were more attentive than other pools (Tropicana), but we still had to go to the bar. The bar line was backed up, but the bartenders were doing the best they could.  There should be another bar (maybe there was and we didn't see it.)

We used two pools.  Whenever we got hot we went to go take a dip.  One pool had a lot of kids and another was more adult.  

The pool was peaceful despite the number of people there.  The decor was very calming, and it wasn't loud at all.

I booked two adjoining rooms with strip views for a bachelorette weekend. Multiple items were not up to par and left a bad taste in my mouth that spoil the possibility of future stays. 

I was sent a special gift of chocolate covered strawberries from a third party vendor. My fiance was assured that they would get delivered to me. The strawberries should have been delivered on Friday when I checked in. I never received them to my room even after three different calls assuring both my fiance and I that they were available to be delivered. The vendors are not to blame because these items were delivered to the hotel but though your concierge desk as well as room service communication breakdown the gift was somehow suspended in a limbo. 

One of my guests spent thirty minutes trying to get into the room when she arrived on Friday evening. Despite the fact that I left her name at the desk her room key needed to be reissued and she was told over the phone that a security guard would escort her to the desk and no one ever came for her and she went back down and up alone. 

On Saturday we had to call three different instances to request service because no one came to tidy up our room. We had to take out our own trash and place it in the hallway. I noticed chips crushed into the hallway carpet close to our rooms that stayed there for several hours. 

On Sunday morning we were awaken by the cleaning service at 9 AM even though we had our privacy light on. Check out was not until 11 and the knocking was very loud and disrupting to one of my guests in particular. 

Needless to say one or perhaps two of these incidents would be understandable but for a hotel that claims to be the ""ultimate luxury Las Vegas hotel and casino"" it certainly does not live up to the hype. I have actually never experienced such short comings at any other MGM property in Las Vegas and this is the first time I have written a bad review of a hotel.",3,0,0

I walked into the casino one evening about 2:00am and it was practically deserted, but it was a week night and this is not considered to be a ""locals"" casino.  At that time the only restaurant serving is the Cafe.  They don't have any fish on the menu so I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich which had a lot of flavor but was a bit awkward to eat as a sandwich.  Before I went to the Cafe I was wondering around the casino floor like most people do on a first visit to any very large casino on the strip to get a better perspective of the lay-out.  One of the floor managers? starts walking beside me with an odd grin on his face and asks me ""can I help you""? or something to that effect.  This seemed a little peculiar to me because most times when walking thru a casino most of the workers just stare and try to size you up.  I've never been in the rooms but the whole feel of the Aria including the casino and design is angular with not much softness.  Anyway,  I discovered 12 MGM properties are listed on the Hyatt web-site and can be booked at that site.  It even confirmed a reservation I made using one of the 2 free nights from the sign-up bonus from applying for a Hyatt credit card thru Chase Bank.  Must spend $1,000.00 in the first 3 months to receive the 2 free nights at any hotel or resort.  Also one free night a year with the card issuance.  Imagine earning points for your stays by using this credit card during all your stays.  Don't forget to obtain a Hyatt Passport Membership # before applying for your card.  I would like to try some of the other restaurants in the future when I visit as a guest.",0,0,0

I was expecting more, I guess, but either way this place was fun and our trip and stay at Aria was also a lot of fun. However after visiting some of the other hotels the decor and the casino at Aria are just OK.

The rooms are nice, considerably quiet considering Vegas. We stayed in groups of 3 so there was plenty of room for all our stuff. The bathroom was spacey; however you had to go through the shower to get to the tub which to me was weird. The light switches and the TV was all very modern.  Getting to your room took FOREVER because there is only one set of elevators and then you had to walk to your room once you were on your floor. I guess we got a room that was more towards the end of the building. The view we got was just of rooftops but I'm sure other rooms had better views. 

The hotel service staff was friendly, the hotel maids were very nice and got us more hangers, towels and extra shampoo. The concierge lady was also friendly and helped us get the reservations we wanted. 

The pool area was nice, there are 3 pools, two of them are just regular pools and one party pool. We did not go to the party pool because it was super crowded. The regular pool was nice however there were no open chairs. One of the days we had a cabana which was nice since you got a waitress for yourself otherwise the pool waitress were so busy it took a while to get your drink.
We went to several of the restaurants at the Aria and the food and service were just OK, nothing spectacular. The Cafe Aria was nice but the service took forever and the place was not crowded at all. The little cafe at the bottom of the elevator had great pastries and coffee. The buffet was ok (not Wowed), the Tapas place was expensive but the food was great (ok service), the Italian place was amazing food wise but when we asked for separate checks the waiter gave us a giant frown and it kept up the rest of the evening. The pizza restaurant was also very good and they had a good beer selection but the service (again) was just ok.
What surprised me was that some of the restaurants closed at 10! For a city that's not supposed to sleep this was very surprising. We went to the sushi place at 10:05pm and the woman looked at us like we were crazy wanting a table that late! 

We paid $30 for a day pass at the spa which included just the pools, the steam rooms, rock beds and the meditation room and it was well worth it. We would have booked a massage or something but they we didn't do it in advance so we had to settle for the day pass. 

The casino was just OK, it was not crowded, it didn't seem inviting or exciting to go gambling here. I guess compared to more traditional hotels.

All in all I would go back to Aria for the amazing price we got however it was better advertised that what reality showed us.",2,0,0

First off, thank you to my bf for telling me to look into Aria... and then the great deal that they were having.

-LOVE the fact that you can check-in whenever you arrive. I came in super early so checked in around 7-8am and got a room around 11:30pm. Normal check in is 3pm but they are willing to accommodate you as quickly as they can! You get the room keys when you check in and they will text you when the room is ready (so that you don't have to go back to the front desk).

-Customer service is SUPERB! The entire staff from front desk, bell desk, to concierge, was amazing. Customer oriented at its finest :) LOVE that there aren't super long lines for checking in or checking out. LOVE that bell desk brings your luggage up to the hotel, down from the hotel, and to the taxi line. LOVE that you can print your boarding pass at the concierge. 

-The rooms were immaculate and modern! Loved the bathroom, the robes, the automatic windows, the view, soft pillows, comfortable bed. EVERYTHING basically! :) 

ARIA is one of those hotels that you can actually call your home away from home (Especially when you get a chance to sleep in Vegas!)

-Absolutely LOVED the pool. It's huge so you really won't have a problem finding a spot. It's so peaceful and relaxing! The hot tub was nice too!

-There's also a lot of food variety at Aria. We ordered from the Cafe, dined at the Buffet, and had delectable delights from Jean Philippe Patisserie (FAV @ Aria!)

I don't gamble an insane amount, and yet, they email me 'deals' pretty regularly- my advice is to sign up for a players card at your favorite casino. It's worth the 20 mins out of your day!

Nver had any problems during check-in. Front desk staff is friendly and efficient. Rooms are sleek, very modern and clean. I love new! Beds are some of the most comfortable I've ever had the pleasure of passing out on. On my first couple of visits, we had luxuriously heavy down pillows but during the last stay, our room had run-of-the-mill poly-filled ones. Still nice and oversized, but not the same. That was a minor disappointment.

Bathrooms are spacious and newer, which addresses my two hotel dealbreakers: cramped bathrooms with no counter space, and old, crummy fixtures. Shower is also spacious, mostly because the soaking tub is inside the shower stall. It's a little weird but convenient if you want to rinse off before or after your soak. 

Casino floor is clean and nicely laid out, albeit not the biggest. I actually prefer it that way. I can sit and gamble or throw away my money on a slot machine without a convention of dentists parading past me. For a larger experience, I go to Bellago or Ceasars. Which brings me to location.

Location is very good. It's smack in the middle of the best part of the strip within reasonable walking distance to Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Ceasar's. Some people don't like that Aria is a bit of a trek from the sidewalk because it's set so far back from the street. I don't know. Like everything in Vegas, time and distance are deceiving. I've walked into the MGM Grand to meet a friend in her room, and 15 minutes later, was STILL walking to get there.

Lastly, I like the way Aria smells. Their lobby\/casino aromatherapy is pleasant and soothing. All the hotels have it, but my nose votes Aria, Bellagio and the Ventian as the best smelling hotels in Vegas.",0,0,0

The driver of our car was slowing down while going around the loop-around, past the entrance, and this guy started yelling at us to stop. Then when we stopped, he demanded that we cant stop in front of the hotel. We told him that were checking in and that the passengers are just getting dropped off to go to the lobby so that the driver can go to the self-park to park our car. He seemed to calm down and stopped harassing us, and could it be that he appeared a little sheepish, as well? Nahhh, cuz hes a jerk.

The valet was a little confusing.  We had to sit in our car for a few minutes wondering if we were in the right place before someone came over.  But from the moment we stepped out of our car the service was exceptional.  

We arrived on a Thursday night and were in the check in line for less than a minute.  We always try the sandwich trick in Vegas but were a little hesitant because this property is still so new. It worked like a charm.  We had booked the cheapest room and our check in attendant worked hard and managed to get us  a room with a phenominal view on the 53rd floor.  He even had a complimentary mini fridge set up when I inquired about storing medication in the mini bar.   

Our room was georgeous.  The view was breathtaking.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the high tech remote thing.  I didn't do so great with it but that's just me and my clumsy fingers.  The closet was really big and I liked that we had  a his and hers side.  I'm OCD when it comes to keeping my hotel room neat and I liked that we didn't have to have our suitcases out in the open.  It's also nice to be able to settle in a bit.  It made for a much more enjoyable vacation. The bed was one of the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  Every night I fell right to sleep. Literally.  Waking up at 6am everyday to change into my pajamas and get ready for bed became a daily ritual.  I'll be purchasing the pillows.  They were the perfect combination of squishy and firm.  I wish I could afford the sheets.

On our second day we decided to go the buffet.  Had a little incident with our waitress who accidently dumped a diet coke on my lap.  When my boyfrind politely let someone know and inquired about having my pants cleaned they gave us the choice of cleaning my pants or comping our meal.  It was a little awkward having to deal with security over diet coke but it made for a good story.  It also was a great excuse to go buy new pants.

Overall the service was oustanding.  The hotel was beautiful and smelled so delicious.  The location was perfect. Everytime we go to Vegas we like to try a new hotel in search of the best.  I don't think we will be continuing that tradition.  Aria is  our favorite.

Aria is very modern.. the room is simple, classy, designed in a contemporary style... All electronics, TV, radio, curtains, lighting's are controlled by a simple touch screen remote placed next to the bed. I got the room on the 54th floor (the top floor) facing the strip with incredibly beautiful view. 

If you check in Late you might not get the room you desired... 

I usually get to Vegas & check in after 10 PM 
first time they give me a smoking room when i asked for a non smoking room. but they switched for me. I didn't like dealing w\/all the hassles.. 

second time I'm here asking for a room with 2 full size they only have single bed room left. They switched it for me the next day & for all the inconvenience they brought they've given me $150 credit to my account. They have a great management system, & great with handling situation dealing problems. 

pool is amazing.. it's more of a family scene rather than Tao beach is more of a younger crowd. Maybe I was here on the mother's day, it was mostly families. 

I also got Internet service which charges $15 in 24 hr per laptop. I tho the service is per room, but no it's per device.

My room was very clean like the rest of the hotel, and my bed was super comfortable. There's a remote control for everything in the room (lights, tv, curtain, etc.) The best feature is that it memorizes all of your settings after you turn everything off and leave the room.

Check in a breeze. Check out even more breezy.

The game floor is really clean, new and doesn't have a smoke smell to it.  restaurants  were of a nice decor and we checked out Sage and it was Epic. Really well put together meal. 

Concierge was friendly. Printed out our cirque tickets at MGM Grand, and pointed us on our way. 
Location is really good. Walkway to Monte carlo which has a fast food court and cheap tables. Connects to the Vdara and Bellagio via tram but walking for us was way faster. and right outside Aria is a CVS store for cheap booze. 
Now to the rooms. I gave in to the Aria due to the fact it was suppose to be super hi tech. Everything can be controlled by the remote, but I was expecting more. The bed was extremely comfy but the pillows were horrid. 3 pillows evened out to one for me. The air conditioner said it was set for 61 degrees which is the lowest it went and it never reached that temperature. Stuck around 65\/67 the whole time. Really strange. and lastly the toilet. Didn't think to flush first before I used it for the first time, and of course it didn't work at all. So that kind of sucked. Simple call to front desk fixed the problem.

There are TONS of options for food and drink, though I didn't love the patisserie.  

We splurged one day and got a cabana by the pool.  They have some specials right now, so definitely look into it.  I would have lasted about an hour at the pool without it.  With the cabana we made it the whole day (though the food menu at the pool was mediocre.)

My only complaint about Aria, is I felt SO nickled and dimed.  I you lift something from the mini bar for over 60 seconds you are charged, if you use the mini bar fridge for personal use, you are charged a $25.00 a day personal use fee - ridiculous.

For the price of the room, it was not worth it.

It remained awful smelling the full week. Expected better from such a nice hotel. 
The fridges in the room are fully stocked so no space left for anything to add. Ice machine on our floor didn't work so it was a hike to the next closest option.

We were not impressed and won't stay there again. Upon check-in, they couldn't find our reservation and when they did locate what they needed, only had smoking rooms available when we specifically said no smoking. The clerk needed to find out what she could do and brought over a manager which at time this time, both ladies turned their backs to us while ""discussing"" the rooms. Eventually they sorted out the issue, whatever it was.  One compliment that I will give Aria is that they did upgrade us to the 50th floor with a fabulous view, due to the inconvenience.   
During the rest of our stay, my poor husband kept being called by my last name each time he had to call for service, and on our honeymoon, that is a bummer, especially when this was the first trip as man and wife and I'm taking his name. We corrected them at each opportunity but it was never corrected in their system.  Biggest oops of Aria was no room service after our first evening.  Hubby and I went on a LONG Grand Canyon tour.

The softest bed I've ever slept on, I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. Electronic window controls, fancy lighting controls, all around excellent. The wi-fi even worked perfectly in our room.

The pool was so nice and relaxing (3 to choose from, in addition to a few different hot tubs). My small complaint there is that the restroom for the pool is a mile away, and that the depth of the pools is only 3 feet or so. But we had no problem getting a good spot and there were no screaming kids running around, so you gotta love that. The casino itself is the least smoky of all the ones we hung out in, maybe the smoke is just covered up by that distinct ""Aria"" scent, or maybe they have great ventilation.

You have to walk past slots and tables and a cafe just to get to your floor elevators. The path to the elevators is monitored by a hotel security representative.

The bells and whistles in the king sized bed room are nice.

The towels are horrible...
Full stocked mini fridge and some nonsense on the top of the counter all of which is x2 or x4 the normal price.


The bed and the pillows were the best part of my stay.
Pool is Ok. Whirlpool\/hot tubs are nice and shaded by Palm trees.
22$ Hotel fee per day + what you paid for your room.
Long distance calls not included in Hotel fee....

There was an incident the last night I was there where security was called and took 20 mins to show up. 

I was told by a manager that I would get a call from her in a day and never got it. Re-guarding the issue.

The room was meticulously appointed, and the bath was pure spa-like luxury.

One of the more fun and interesting places to stay while visiting Vegas.  I also recommend the hotel restaurants - Julian Serrano was very good, unique and interesting food, with an interesting Romanian waiter - truly made the night more fun.

The Buffet was excellent, for $20 per person in an all you can eat spread that included everything from a to z, it was an exceptional value.

Cafe Vettro was fun as well, but breakfast can get quite pricy there.  

With prices as reduced as they are in Vegas -- you can stay in a suite at the ARIA for $140 per night, which probably would have run closer to $400 to $500 per night, just a few years ago.

If you're going to go to Las Vegas -- be sure to stay at ARIA.  And believe it or not, the hotel garage is FREE, the valet work for tips only -- and they truly do hustle!",5,0,1

They only have two queen beds in the regular rooms which are very nice already. If you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to splurge, go for a suite.

POSITIVES: completely automated room. The iPad lets you do everything from controlling lights and blinds to tv and room service. I guess you have to still open your own door. But when you first do the automated blinds re open for you. 

The bed and bedding rocked as did the shower. the mini bar is well stocked with all the high end brands you'd expect from this caliber of a spot. 

The service at checkin, bell desk, and when I had a maintenance issue were all exceptionally well handled. 

I only ate at the herringbone and at the pastry shop but both were great. Quick attentive service with deep rich flavorful options. 

Hotel decor is stylish. 

The NEGATIVES: 
you have to find the north valet for ubers.
Neither the tables nor the sports book - despite being loaded with screens - are a very fun scene. 
The towels are over laundered and need to be retired.... Very scratchy. Makes me wonder why the bedding is so soft. Maybe it's not laundered enough.",0,0,0

Let's start with I checked in at midnight and there was a line.  I'm assuming this may have been a fluke...but the hotel entrance and lobby BEAUTIFUL! They were very accommodating.  What was TOTALLY annoying was having to show your key to get pass the ""PROTECTOR OF THE ELEVATORS"" Really all this money spent and I have to fumble in my purse to find the key instead of getting it out on the elevator.  Even some lower end properties have a slot at the elevator.  Basically IF you have a key that's your key to the elevator.  That felt a little harassing\/movie theater ish.  :-(  

So the elevators to the 38th floor were SUPER fast.  :-)  I really enjoyed that.  Some places an elevator ride could take 10 minutes.  

When you walk in the room the curtains automatically open up with one of the MOST amazing views of the strip!  BEAUTIFUL! You can't beat it.  You can see the ENTIRE STRIP both ways as well as the airport and mountains.   

The room was spacious and had every amenity you could think of BUT the fridge that was stocked with stuff you had to pay a lot for,  left you no room for anything you wanted to store inside the fridge.  I had Chocolate covered berries that I wanted to keep chilled. BUT if I wanted to have the items that were in t here removed, I would have been charged a DAILY fee for it OR have to pay for the items I moved since the items were on a sensor.  I think EVERY hotel should provide a refrigerator.  For convenience or even medical reasons for some people. 

Room service was super FAST! one of the FASTEST I've ever had.  HOWEVER, I ordered a fruit plate...when you LOOKED at the fruit you could TELL the fruit was NOT ripe...WHY would you serve that to ANYONE?  I could have sent it back but it's vegas...hey you know I was racing out the door. 

 HOWEVER, at 330pm I DID call housekeeping and asked for the room to be cleaned.  Left the service light on as well and upon return at 900pm NO ONE came.  I called and they apologized and said someone would come.  I left for a show and when I returned it was cleaned.  Keep in mind housekeeping is 24 hours.  

The shower...it's cool how the tub and shower are separate but behind the same glass.  It was hard to find a happy medium with the water temperature.  The toilet had it's own area AGAIN nice when it's more than one person in a room.  

So Overall I'm gonna keep this at a 4 star...I just think for the amount of money EVERYTHING should be next to perfect, but the customer service was so WONDERFUL makes you forget about other things.  I had the chocolate covered strawberries delivered.  Where they were kept in the cooler closed at 5pm, even though I arrived AFTER midnight they went and got them for me.  :-) that was an extra touch of service.

The first room we had, 15270, was dirty unbeknownst to us. Had housekeeping not come to our room, we would never have known. Could have fooled us though, it gave us a great illusion that it was perfectly clean until we paid attention to the details. Apparently the room was marked dirty in their records so they sent someone to double check. We sent them away thinking it was a mistake but I'm kind of a nut about these things when it concerns lodging so we all looked around. There was hair all over the mattress and some smudge debris on a few of the pillow cases. I even took pictures of it. One strand on a pillow looked like it was pubic hair. NOT cool. Onto the restroom, not pretty. There was what looked to be like dry urine on the floor in front of the toilet. Yuck. Lifted the toilet seat and there was brownish\/yellowish muck all over it. Disgusting. The soap dishes, stained and obviously not cleaned prior. My mom decided to give the front desk a call but even the phone was not working... She had to call from her cell phone. A total mess.

Off we went, to room 18109. First thing we did was check the room's hygiene, didn't even bother to get comfortable this time. Similar shit. A soiled towel behind the door, dried make up (lipstick?) on the bathroom counter, and urine sprayed all over the toilet seat, which my boyfriend spotted, that housekeeping failed to wipe off. Gave the front desk another ring.

Finally, here we are, in our third room. The walk here wasn't pleasant as we were all beginning to bitch about the hotel's housekeeping. We were greeted by hotel personnel, Dennis (was extremely nice and accommodating), who walked us in and inspected the room and made sure it met our expectations then comped us $150 for hotel wining\/dining for our troubles.

The all-in-one remote that controls the room, impressive, but it's been done before. Pretty standard for luxury hotels.

Thank God it was free because of this three days stay offer my mom received. I would have been PISSED if I spent my money on rooms and had gone through this much trouble.

Anyways, I'm still optimistic about the rest of our stay. Let's hope it's pleasant from here on.",1,0,0

My boyfriend is ballroom dancer and one of his student has connections to all the hotels in Vegas so that everytime we went to Vegas, the trips were paid for. However, we would just get regular rooms. BUT, recently his student's best friend was promoted to the president of ARIA so for our recent trip, we stayed in the penthouse sky suite. IT WAS SOOOOO BREATHTAKING!!! I wish I could live there. The view was spectacular, the room was nicely decorated, the hotel itself provided so many things to do. What else can you ask for?

Upon entering the hotel, it took my breath away. The decoration was amazing and I love the smell of fresh vanilla. Due to that, the casino doesn't smell like smoke at all! It was such a relief.

When we entered our suite, I just had to let out a gasp. It's so gorgeous. I especially love the modern and classy, yet simple, decoration of the room. It is definitely my style. The hotel itself is very high-tech. There were remotes to control the whole room. Our bathroom consists of a shower and a bathtub with LOTS of space. You will definitely feel like a king in this hotel. Our fridge and minibar was filled with goodies and someone would come by once a day to restock. Room service was also amazing. We would leave the room and when we came back, EVERYTHING was neatly folded and placed in the right spots. I remember throwing my makeup all over the place in the bathroom because I was in such a rush. When we came back, all my makeup was neatly placed. My hair straightener was neatly wrapped with the cord. My makeup pouch was zipped back up. My papers and accessories on the nighstand were also neatly placed. AMAZING.

Once you come to this hotel, you really feel like there isn't a need to leave. EVERYTHING is here. There's spa, swimming pools, hair salons, massaging rooms, nail salon, the list goes on. There is lots of everything.

We only had one mishap during the trip. When my boyfriend gave his car to the valet guy the previous night, his gas tank was half filled. The next day when we got it, it was on EMPTY!!! We were pretty pissed. But I guess we can let half a gas tank go in return for a free trip to Vegas with alcohol, food, limo service, room, and show tickets all free of charge. I heard the suite itself is $600\/night.

If you have lots of money to spend and enjoy the luxury, I suggest you stay here. This has now became one of my favorite hotel and I think I will request to stay here everytime I go. I seriously can go on and on about this place.",1,1,1

The first trip was the second week of December and this trip was a long weekend after Thanksgiving. First of all, the hotel itself is stunning. Every wall has granite or wood working or glass and every nook has perfectly selected holiday decor. From poinsettias to orchids to ornaments to one giant light display shaped like a reindeer. The rooms are fairly spacious with a full wall of windows. Obviously, the higher the floor the better the view. We have stayed on several different levels. But the bathrooms, oh how I love the granite bench and enclosed full size soaking tubs at the Aria! After a long day walking the strip you will be in that tub I guarantee you. We decided to stay here a second time mostly because we loved the rooms but also because 99% of the people who work here provide great customer service. My only complaint was with a booking agent and I have already spoken to Aria Guest Services about that! The Lemongrass restaurant serves some really great Thai food, try the Panang Curry! And the five 50 pizza place has some pretty good pizzas. Plus more than enough TVs to watch all the football games on! The location is great and choices for eating out are abundant but one draw back here is that the table games have higher minimum bets than a lot of the other surrounding hotels and the $10 tables are always the most busy. The restaurants are high quality but also come with a slightly inflated price as well. I'm guessing they want to be a higher status hotel and therefore believe their guests are willing to pay more, to get more. There are absolutely times I am willing to spend more for quality, but that then means I have a certain expectation. There were a few small things, such as not fully restocking toiletries and having to change rooms early on (it was a 13 floor upgrade so I wasn't complaining) but Overall, if we did come back to Vegas again I would probably put Aria back in the running for hotels.",0,0,0

It was made clear the total price did NOT include daily resort fee of $28 so no surprises at check- in. But I must still complain about this bogus fee that entitles the consumer to NOTHING. When will the marketing people and the tax people get together and agree that this bogus charge is a tax which I think most people would more readily accept than  a fee for which  you receive nothing of value. As so many others have said here, long lines at check- in- because of flight delays, we checked in around midnight and had lots of company. Throughout our five-day stay, no matter whether it was early morning, afternoon or late night, there were ALWAYS long lines at check- in. Maybe Aria considers this a plus- a sign that the hotel is very popular. What it translated to me as a customer was a hotel that has to be making a fortune based on room rates, restaurant pricing and casino pay- outs but isn't willing to hire enough staff to speed up check- in. The rooms were spacious enough and the beds are very comfy but they are so BROWN - decor is dark, dull and boring. The high- tech systems for turning on lights, setting room temp, opening curtains, etc are very cool but when you walk into the room for the first time at midnight, you'll find yourself patting the wall surfaces just to try to find some light so you can get inside with your bags. Not practical. I was amazed at the lack of any bath mat or safe flooring in the shower which is extremely slippery when wet. The lack of in- room coffee makers is a HUGE misstep- the closest place for morning coffee is an overpriced bakery downtairs with annoying humongous lines - a coffee and muffin will set you back $10 and there's inadequate seating. The casino isn't exceptional- too many $1 slots and the payouts on all slots suck. We enjoyed the free tram connection to Crystal Center , Bellagio and Monte Carlo but Crystal is a waste of space- nothing there except Chanel, Dior and other luxury retailers- noticed none of them had any customers. A More affordable variety of food choices would have been welcomed. Aria buffet is to be avoided- food is very average and it's overpriced compared to other hotel buffets. Atmosphere is like a high school   cafeteria. Lemongrass was the only hotel  restaurant we used- there are several but they are all overpriced. The food is great- for two with one cocktail each, no desserts, two entrees- $150 including tip.  hotel    location  is good - basically the middle of the strip.

I came here to celebrate my birthday and it was all I could have ever wanted for a long weekend. Its a quick and easy ride from the airport. Check in is very painless and the staff is very helpful with directions, recommendations, etc. The hotel its self, is absolutely stunning, they have the best art, and installation pieces throughout the hotel. 
      1.) The ROOM OMG, we had a strip view room that had just been updated and it was perfection. The linins were comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and inviting and the technology interface made the room. Room service was on top of their game the whole weekend. I of course wanted to leave the room..dah its Vegas, but at the same time I almost didn't want to. The best part was the lack of noise you could here in the room. I couldn't here a thing and I was shocked. 
       2.) The pool, was the perfect balance of Vegas action and Relaxation. The trick is to get down earlier than later.. of course this is always easier said than done, but worth it if possible. You get a better selection of chairs this way. We also rented a pool cabana one of the days. This was a blast! If interested in this you need to get to the pool consigner to reserve one. You can't this online, only in person. The experience you get with this is worth the price. They take care of your every need and make you feel like the most important people there. The cabanas themselves, are equally as amazing as the hotel rooms.
     3.) THE FOOD was great, not amazing. The buffet has so many options, but it can be a bit crowded, because of the amount of people at the hotel. Get there before 10:30. I also dined at the steakhouse and Lemongrass. I had good food, but not the quality as I expected for Vegas. 
      4.) The nightlife: whether your gambling or dancing their is an option for everyone. the casino is very clean, modern and fun! Jewel is their night club, its a smaller dance club, it almost feel claustrophobic. I did not stay long here because it was to many people in a small space.

The service overall was great from a quick check in, an easily granted late check out and convenient bellman to check our bags at before going to the hotel.  When I go to vegas again, I will most likely stay here again.",0,0,0

The staff has been great, and we got a beautiful room on s high floor.  The view is amazing,  and the bed is crazy comfortable!  The shower\/tub area are well designed and relaxing to use. I would like more water pressure, though. I am thoroughly enjoying my stay.",0,0,0
