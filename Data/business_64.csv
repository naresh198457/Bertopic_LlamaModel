I just returned from a trip to Vegas, and I wanted to reach out to you about my stay. I called a couple of months ago to book my weekend visit, and was given 1 night comped and a discounted night as well. I was also provided $30.00 in free play and $50.00 in food credit. The purpose of my visit was a getaway for my mom who hasn't been to The Mirage in 27 years, or to Vegas! She and I were very excited.
 
I checked in at The Mirage on March 4th for a 2 night stay. Upon arrival, I was provided an upgrade to the 25th floor into a King Suite, and we were thrilled with the customer service at the front desk.
We got into our room, and everything was great....on the surface. Then it all went downhill.
 
The bellhop brought up our luggage (7 pieces) and placed some things on the counter above the refrigerator. Because of this, we did not see the flyer that stated not to place personal items in the fridge. We placed food that my mother brought to me from the east coast. Needless to say, that food spoiled as the fridge wasn't working.
Our toilet didn't flush unless you flushed 5-10 times, our shower was filled with mold, the ice bucket had a bag of water inside of it and we had invoices and personal letters in our room (from previous guests) that were dated February 5th, so we knew that our room hadn't been cleaned well.
 
At first we called the front desk and we were assured that someone would come to our room, fix the toilet\/mold and clean for us. We were given an additional $50.00 food credit but the cleaning and fixing never happened.
The following day, Saturday, we called again to the front desk and again, we were told that someone would come at noon to take care of the problems, again, this didn't happen.
On Saturday night, I had enough, and stood in the check in line for 40 minutes so that I could speak to someone about our room. I spoke to a lovely lady, and I should have written down her name. She tried so hard to assist, and provided an additional $50.00 in food credit but explained that the hotel was sold out due to the race and there wasn't another room to put me in. I understood, and was grateful for her trying.
On Sunday, I was done..the toilet put me over the edge, and it was truly disgusting.
 
I checked out, and graciously was comped for the entire weekend. I was and still am very thankful for this gesture.
We went outside to get our car from Valet, and then all of the kind gestures went out the door once again.
I saw the valet attendant pull my car up, he got out said my name, but didn't give me enough time to gather my 7 suitcases and get to the car, so he drove off and parked my car.
I went to the valet stand to let them know that I needed my car pulled back up as I couldn't carry all of my baggage and they refused!!! What the heck?!!
 
I don't know how the staff can be so great in some areas, and then not so much in others.
If it wasn't for the front desk and customer service, I would never return. I have stayed at almost every hotel in Las Vegas, and I have seen worse, but I have definitely seen better.
 
Thank you,",5,0,0

Very spacious and clean. My view overlooked the strip, which was beautiful, however the sound of the volcano show was a bit loud. I also liked that my hotel room also included free internet and free access to the cardio room. Most hotels charge you extra for these ""perks"". 

As far as the casino, the gaming area is clean and doesn't smell nearly as smokey as the other casinos. The restaurants and bars are great (they have Stack, which is one of my favorite) and the staff is friendly and very helpful.

I didn't really get to check out the shops, pool, or dolphin show. I guess that will be on my list of things to do on my visit.",0,0,0

They do add the resort fee which can be irritating, I would rather just have one price and have it all included. Seems like just a new way to get another $25 a night. Despite how old this casino is, you would never know it. The rooms are extremly well maintained. No issues what so ever with cleanliness, older stuff, etc. Was very happy. In Vegas we are never in our room long so I prefer the more reasonable rates like they had to the fancy ameneties of other places which is nice if you are in the room a lot but we were not. They do have a really nicely stocked mini bar that has some interesting items in it! Room is good size, shower has great water pressure, and the rooms are quiet. Customer service was fast and friendly checking in. A very long line only took 5 minutes since they had all the counters open helping people check in. 
If you stay here, you get a discount at the shows and secret garden which is a nice bonus.",6,2,3

We stayed Thursday through Sunday in a hospitality suite.  I would definitely stay in this room again.  The master bedroom is large with a TV that comes out of a cabinet at the foot of the king sized bed.  The bathroom has a dual vanity with plenty of counter space for two (2) people, and probably more than that.  There is a large soaking tub, a separate water closet, and a separate shower.  We were on a high floor (21) and had a great view of the Strip.

There is a living room with a large couch and a 60 inch (approximately) flat screen on the way.  There is a wet bar with two (2) bar stools, the minibar, and a separate fridge with ice maker.  The center of the room has a large square-shaped table with 4 bench seats.  You could probably seat 8 or so around the table comfortably.  This would be a good room for entertaining, in addition to the space there is a half bath right off the main entrance.  So, if you did have guests over they wouldn't need to use your personal bathrooms in the 2 bedrooms.

The second bedroom is a standard Mirage room with double bed and a much smaller bathroom.

There are three (3) main table games areas to the Mirage casino.  There are a total of 6 craps tables on the main floor, and a couple of banks of table games, plus another bank that is dedicated almost entirely to blackjack.  Limits were appropriate for the Vegas Strip.  $10 during most days and at least $15 on a lot of games during the weekend nights.  They had limits of $10, $15, and $25 for craps on weekends.

The poker room is remodeled since I had last been to Mirage.  It's right off of the sportsbook.  It was a decent room, but it doesn't get any games besides 3\/6 limit and 1\/2 NLHE.  There were a couple of tourneys available but I did not play in them.

Love is one of the better Cirque shows in my opinion.  Highly recommended.  Mirage also has the best lineup of stand up comics in town with their ""Aces of Comedy.""  David Spade and Ray Romano were in town the weekend I was there.  I have seen Daniel Tosh, Brad Garrett, and Jay Leno in the past at Mirage.

Like most Las Vegas casino hotels, you have your choice of several cuisines:  Japanese, Chinese, Italian, steakhouse, buffet, American, and the ubiquitous 24 hour Vegas coffee shop that every place has.  On our last trip we ate at Pantry and Fin.  It has been a long time but I remember liking the buffet, Cravings, very much.  

I would stay at Mirage again.  The dealers were very friendly for the most part and there are enough dining options for a few days.  Recommended.",2,1,1

Reservations were made for 3 rooms. I have never been so disappointed there were so many things that were wrong. 
My son checked in first with me Wednesday the 25th. We got adjoining rooms. I was in the room with my 2 granddaughters. Around 12:30 we decided to call it a night. When I pulled down the bedding there was blood on the sheets. Apparently the sheets were never changed, I don't know what else wasn't done. I can't even express how bad that was. They came and changed the sheets . My son kept his room. I decided I could not stay there another day so I checked out. 
My daughter and son in law checked in late that night and got a beautiful suite. Later that night , due to a leak they had to be moved. A day later my son and his wife also had to move due to water leaking thru the ceiling. They sat in the room for quite a while waiting to be moved.
We paid a lot of money to the Mirage thinking we would have a great rooms at a beautiful resort. We also paid your resort fees .. For what? The pool is closed, we paid extra for the secret garden. I have never stayed at Mirage before and am not sure any of us will again this is really unacceptable. What is going on there???


Update Jan 2nd ..... I sent an email to their customer care team. After getting a little bit of a run around I did hear from a manager. Bottom line she's sorry but they had talked to my family members when each event happened and they seemed ok. IF we stay there again she will personally make sure everything runs smoothly. Left me feeling a little flat and I don't really think spending hundreds of dollars again just see if it works out is not going to happen! 
That's her best offer??? There are to many other choices in Vegas!",2,0,0

The worst was Circus Circus and the best was The Mandalay  Bay. The Mirage was pretty decent, it was clean for the most part and not crazy expensive. I checked out some reviews on Yelp and they weren't too bad so that was a good thing.

Got there on a Sunday around 11am expecting to wait to check in because check in was at 3 or something. Surprisingly they checked me with no problem so I was happy about that. The employees were pretty nice and helpful which is always a plus in my book. I got to my room and it was a nice size but the bathroom was a little small for my liking. Also the bathtub was just a regular size which is fine because I didn't reserve a suite or anything.

They have some decent places to eat like a burger spot I went to it wasn't the best burger I had but it was good. The star of that burger spot was the milkshakes which I had a Twinkie shake but it needed more caramel. I didn't spend too much time at the Mirage because I was at the Venetian across the street which has a pretty nice food court. My favorite was the Haagen das ice cream, the pizza and the lobster.

So if I came back to Vegas would I stay at the Mirage probably not but I did enjoy my stay and it was affordable. There wasn't anything really bad about the Mirage but it wasn't my cup of tea.",6,4,2

I will start with their taxi stand. I think that they have a very organized system. Jason (I think thats his name) is AWESOME! My husband and I stayed there in April and he remembered us every single time. My husband and I also stayed at the Mirage in September AND HE STILL REMEMBERED US!! I was so blown away! AMAZING!

The check in line does look pretty long. Especially because check in is usually at 3pm unless you request\/pay for early check in. Don't be fooled though. The line moves pretty quickly. However the check in\/concierge staff is very efficient. 

The rooms are nice. I mean if you ARE paying for a standard room, don't expect a huge amount of space with a gorgeous view. You do get what you pay for. I would also like to note I love their elevator system. They have about six or so different areas to take you to your room. So like the first area is for floor 1-5 the second area is like 6-10 etc. There are also about six elevators in each area. I really love this system because you are never waiting for an elevator. The elevator is never full. & each elevator only goes up a certain amount of floors. We've all had those horrible experiences where we are at the 24th floor, but other people in your elevator are on floor 8, 12, 19, and 21. HOW ANNOYING. That problem NEVER happens at the Mirage!

The housekeeping staff is very friendly. You are always greeted while walking down the hall!

I also love the Mirage casino. I think that the casino here ISNT as smokey as some other casinos. I think the high ceilings near the waterfall help. Also, the casino is very easy to navigate around, unlike Caesars. Eeek. 

I think there are good dining options here, different varieties. However, no cheap food court like options, except for Starbucks. Although if you are staying on the strip, you should expect to pay a lot for food!!

LOVE love LOVE the Mirage!! Will definitely be back!",8,2,2

However if you have any problems in your room it may be a different story. I had a problem with my AC as the room was set to 60 and would not go below 72 degrees. I called three separate times to see if it was possible to have it looked at, the first time the gentlemen came he was extremely polite and acknowledged the room had an intense mold smell as well as the air not blowing below 75. After he adjusted it, he told me to keep the fan on HIGH because if you kept it on auto the sensor would detect no one was in the room and default to 72. After walking around all day and going to see a show, we came back to our room and it was at 75, So I called again  to see if someone was available to fix it so we could get it to 67-68 so we could sleep a little better. I was told a gentlemen would be right up to fix the issue  and after returning two hours later the room was even hotter, so I called again and the manager told me someone had already came to fix it as long as a do not disturb sign was not on the door.  The was no sign on the door as the manager stated to make sure there was not one. A gentlemen named Won came back to the room after my third time calling and said he didn't enter because no one was in the room. So this time he came in used his temperature probe to check the room and it was at 73 not the 65 I had set it, just to ensure it would get to at least 68. He was extremely rude to my girlfriend as I was in the bathroom and I heard him trying to intimate my girlfriend and I came out, asking him to please just leave. Overall the issue was not addressed and the ""5 star room"" I booked could not get any cooler than 75. Due to his rudeness and attempt to intimate my girlfriend I told the manger and she was as polite and apologetic as possible, however she did not do anything to fix the issue. I am writing this review after one day even though I am staying for 4 because it bothers me greatly that my girlfriend was intimated by a staff of the mirage and the issue was not solved. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is great but the manger and the maintenance staff would rather intimate you than accommodate you. Best of luck to anyone else who stays here.  I stayed at a holiday inn recently and their rooms would easily get to a comfortable temperature well below 68. I am by no means the type of person to write negative reviews as you can see by my reviewed establishments. Just a heads up and take care all.",0,1,0

In general the hotel takes good care of their patrons and out of the 6 times I have been upgraded 4 of those times without even asking. It is one of the oldest on strip, but it has kept up quite well with surrounding newer places. 

The lobby is real nice with the mini rain forest and the wall length aquarium. The rooms are well kept and were recently renovated (3yrs), the casino is one of the nicest and lower priced tables in that part of the strip and even better, it's right across the street from the cheapest casinos. I like the sports book here...nice and tucked off to the side allowing for me to sit and do what I do without outside interference.  

I like the Brazilian steakhouse (Samba), but it is a tad over-price when compared to other comparable places. 

I like the regular and European-style pool (Bare) even though I do not agree with the surcharge for Bare.

Our family friend is a VIP member at the hotel, so he always gets us fantastic rooms. What I love about the mirage is that it's seemingly the only dog-friendly hotel in Vegas. So many hotels on the strip have a nonexistent pet policy. However, that being said, I had to fill out an extensive amount of paperwork regarding my dog and put down a hefty deposit. The pet relief area, however, is amazing. While the mirage rooms are nice, the lobby is extremely dark, dirty, and smokey. While this is nothing new (I mean...c'mon it's Vegas), it's much more run-down and tobacco-filled than many of the other casino resorts. The carpet seems filthy and there's literally no room to breathe. I had to rush my poor pug outside so he didn't get sick. Secondhand smoke is a real problem that the mirage needs to acknowledge for the safety of their guests. They also recently changed the room service menu. While it is 24\/7, which I appreciate, the new menu is not nearly as good as the old. The food is supplied by the lobby restaurant. Rather than rolling food in on a cart with silver trays and ornamentation, they literally hand you a bag. Not very upscale. 1 oak is a blast. It's rather small, so definitely get a table if possible. The dance floor is super crowded and several men attempted to pickpocket me. I would recommend this hotel especially if you are visiting with your pet. I would highly recommend going the VIP route at the mirage, as well. The VIP lounge has a separate check-in\/check-out lounge with free drinks and snacks. The VIP concierge can also guarantee you tickets to sold-out shows which I never knew. I went to the regular concierge for Daniel tosh tickets. They told me they were sold out. I then went to VIP and they got me and my boyfriend fantastic seats. Lastly, they can put you on the list at any club in Vegas. Well-worth the heftier price.",0,0,0

This was our 3rd or 4th time staying at Mirage.  My sister had 2 nights free\/comped, but my room was booked through M Life called ""run of the house."" I did the online hotel check-in, but did not see the email from Mirage with a ""code"" that needed to be scanned. (I didn't have internet connection to get the email).  Fortunately, a man at the desk was able to get me my room cards and complete our check in.  We had a nice 2 queen bed room with a nice view of the strip, away from the elevator and ice machine. (as I requested)

    The beds are comfy and the rooms are spacious, but the bathroom was small.  The shower had excellent water pressure.  What I didn't like about our room?  1) we could not put any of our waters or beverages in the fridge, as the fridge was full of alcohol and beverages set on sensors.  (you remove it, you pay for it).   2) there was no in-room coffee maker.   The only coffee available for room service is from The Pantry downstairs and cost $15 for a BOX of coffee that holds about 6-8 cups of coffee!!!   I ordered coffee the morning of check-out, as I wanted coffee and we had about $12 left on our $50 credit we had, included in our room rate.   Out of the box, we only drank 2 cups of coffee before we had to leave.  I didn't want to get dressed to go down to Starbucks for a cheaper cup of coffee.  3) no free bottles of water.  Expect to pay $4.50 at the store downstairs for a bottle of water, or about $5.00 for a bottle of water in your room. (another option is to get a small bottle of water from a cocktail waitress while your gambling...if one comes by you).

    Another thing that changed since our last stay 4 years ago at Mirage was the restaurants downstairs.  At the deli restaurant, you now order BEFORE you sit down.  And BLT is now called LVB, but still has good burgers.  Their shakes options are different, but they look good.  

  At least 2 times, I waited for a waitress to come by while I was gambling so I could get a drink, but no one ever came by. Another time, I ordered a bottle of water, but the waitress didn't come back.  On Friday morning & afternoon, we kept seeing a very friendly cocktail waitress who was always coming around us & everyone in her area to see if we were OK and if we needed anything.  Of course we didn't need any beverages at that time.  Wish she was working in the other area when I was thirsty and waited for a drink and never got one.

   We spent more $$ than usual on gambling, so I stopped by the M Life desk to see if we had any rewards earned.  The man at the desk commented that we only had 200 something points, and would need 1,000 points to get $10.  He was a little condescending.  At least the front desk staff were very nice and helpful, along with the bellman, the man who helps with taxi service, the restaurant staff, that one pleasant cocktail waitress and the housekeeping staff on our floor.

While I was away from my room for a few hours housekeeping threw out my most prized personal possession that was given to me by my grandmother who has since passed, and I've had my entire life. After verifying with the manager of housekeeping and multiple other housekeepers, I learned the hotels policy is that housekeeping is not supposed to remove or even touch any of the things in the room until the guest is checked out. However the housekeeper who cleaned my room was obviously completely unaware of this policy as evidenced by his obliviousness to the gravity of the situation. From this point on it only got worse. The director of housekeeping was pretty rude over the phone and in speaking to the manager I was told that they in fact claimed that It had been thrown out by me which was not the case. They told me they were looking for it but I could tell by the tone it didn't seem of concern, or a priority that the item got return to me. I spoke to multiple representatives from the mirage who said they would get back to me but none of them ever followed up about it by calling me back. This was especially difficult and frustrating because I had spent an entire day of  my vacation dealing with this issue to only be left hanging several times. Security wasn't much help either they just had me fill out a form and said Risk Management would get in touch with me but they never did.

I was really excited to stay here, since I love the ambience and the restaurants and shows in the hotel. However, the room wasn't that nice, definitely not worth the price we paid. The front desk even said they upgraded me and my husband to a nicer room since we were on our honeymoon, and what we got was a boring, plain room with TWO queen beds. What are we going to do with two queen beds? I had specifically asked for a king in my reservation, and this is an upgrade?

We had a lot of leftovers from dinner, and even though there was a fridge in our room, we weren't allowed to put anything in (if you take any of the drinks or snacks out of the fridge, even if you don't use it and put them back, you get charged). They couldn't provide us with a fridge, nor could we rent a microwave, so we were stuck eating cold food that had been out all night. I've been to Travelodges that had fridges or microwaves, if not included than at least you could rent them. 

Worst of all, I checked out on my phone, which I thought would be more convenient. I was never emailed a copy of my receipt. I have called at least FIVE TIMES and emailed TWICE in the last month asking for my receipt so I can see why I was charged $90. No one responded to either of my emails, and I was on hold 20-40 minutes each time before hanging up. I will not be staying at The Mirage ever again, and I go to Vegas quite often.

Sadly I am very disappointed.  When we arrived to check in rep told us that we coul upgrade for $20, I said wow just $20 she said yes!  But we needed to wait 2 hours for them to get the room ready..and they would text us once ready..When I walked away we noticed my hotel receipt showed I paid $268-- Well we waited 2 hours went back to the desk --spoke to manager by the name of Gage who said that the upgrade was $68 all together..We told him that the girl told us $20..he said OK I will change you back to the regular room and never apologized...So we waited 2 hours for a room that we never got..because he DOWNGRADED us!  I met up with my sister and her husband who had come the day before...they were not happy they had to switch rooms 3 times since there arrival..because of cleanliness and smoke filled rooms.  They also dealt with the same manager Gage!  Of course let me tell you about our room-- the carpet was dirty..and the lamp shade was busted up.  Awful-- we had to wear our shoes on the carpet..But it gets worse..My sister told me to come and look at there room because it was an ""upgraded room""..I was shocked her room was worse than ours!! I finally called the front desk spoke to a great manager by the name of Shannelle. he was able to apologize and offered to refund all my fees --offered to move us..and also offered my sister and her husband the penthouse because of all the trouble associated with 3 moves.  He was the only professional manager that we dealt with.  There were other problems that I could go on about--My best friend was humiliated at the Mirage Buffet..We had already eaten there every day since our arrival, until the very last day when the cashier told us my friend could not use her military ID for the discount, we explained that we had used it previously each day, she said that my friend could not use it because she was a spouse and not an actual military member--The funny thing is my friend also served in the military which is how she met her husband.  The manager came over and belittled us and said I will let you use it this time but that's it.  And how awful it is to say you cant use your military spouse Id card was the last straw.

You dont feel like a hotel guest here you feel like a burden on them - they make it feel like they are doing you a favor by doing their jobs.  We liked to go to Bare pool which was one reason we chose this hotel.

We had to call the manager and they said yes they do clean rooms and make beds, but now we had to wait until 9pm for them to come back up.

We chose this hotel based on price (great deal on retailmenot.com) and what the pool looked like since we knew MOST of our time during the day would be in the water.

The Staff:
Our check in was very easy and since we were there celebrating our anniversary, they allows us to check out at 3pm and waived the $30 late checkout fee. Unfortuantly for us, that was all they could do since we had already paid the hotel in full. 
The Bell hop was also very gracious and helpful with keeping our bags safe and hailing a taxi out front for us.

The Room:
We ""upgraded"" for only $25\/day to a Resort Tower King room which promised a strip view and a few extras we were sure to use. The 'strip view' wasn't straight out of our window and technically we had to crank our necks to the left so that wasn't worth it. What was nice is that these rooms included private elevators to the 24th and 25th floors, spacious bathrooms, dual sink vanity, soaking tub and separate walk-in shower in the bathroom. Those upgrades were worth the splurge.

***We lost power in our bathroom and hour before checkout and maintenance NEVER showed, despite TWO phones calls. Very dissapointing and unacceptable .***

The room's & pool's Wi-fi was nice to use each day and since you're FORCED to pay $25\/day for it, might as well take advantage when you can.

The Food & Drinks:
Vegas has gotten down right RUDE with their pricing. Expect to pay TWICE as much as you would back home (Seattle for us) but at least most of what we ate was really great. We had the best meals at California Pizza Kitchen and great wings at BLT but also had a handful of dissapointing meals. This included breakfast at the Deli and a horrible chicken caesar salad at the poolside restaurant. The next day the hubby and I shared a FANTASTIC club at the same place (super big and satifying) so go figure.

Expect to pay $5 for a coke and $15-24 for a drink with a couple shots of the good stuff while laying poolside. Crazy to think about spending that kind of money but when it's 100 degrees outside, you'll do just about anything to cool down.

The Pool: Waterfalls, palm trees, friendly serve staff and overall a very relaxing experience. We were VERY surprised\/dissapointed to see the same amount of trash (bottles, cigg butts, bottle caps, food wrappers EVERY morning we were there. There is no excuse for this and they really should clean up each night after closing. Makes the place looks trashy.

The Show:
We saw the Beatles LOVE show and it was honestly the best Cirque du Soleil show I've ever seen, hands down. The staff were very friendly helping us find our seats and chatted with us about our event before we were sat. It's a MUST see!!!",6,1,0

I've stayed at a few different hotels ranging from a suite at the formerly known PH Towers, South Point Hotel, Suite at Treasure Island, Stratosphere and now Mirage. I'd have to say that without a doubt the best overall experience I've had was at the Mirage. I do think their rooms are a tiny bit over priced for the week we were there however. The hotel itself has nice amenities and we loved the pool (The do need more servers at the pools however). We tried most of the restaurants inside and the only one we did not like was the Carnegie Deli. The Carnegie Deli is a huge blemish on this hotel. They are very disorganized, slow and the foot options just don't all really make a lot of sense. We tried it last year and gave it another go this year and had almost identical bad experiences. As for the rest of the hotel the rest of the staff was always friendly and we had no problems. 

The beds in this hotel are down right amazing! I think we are going to order one of their pillow and comforter sets they sell in the hotel shop. 

Our biggest complaint would be the night club. Each night we returned to our hotel there were always some very unsavory individuals lurking about that had just left the club. One night a man was making very inappropriate gestures at my girlfriend making her very uncomfortable. Other nights there were just people being really loud and obnoxious coming from there, making her and I both a bit uneasy. We would love to see a dance music based night club in there.

Just like with the Bellagio, you can tell Mr. Wynn has left the building. 

There is something that has been cheapened by the Kerkorian takeover of the former Wynn properties and the elegance and uniqueness of The Mirage is mostly now gone though some hints of former glory still exist. 

Not much has been updated in the past fifteen years and what has been updated or added stands out against the traditional tropical decor of the property like a sore thumb (such as the entrance to ""Love"" by The Beatles and the Revolution bar). And it has not been kept up like it would were it still a Wynn controlled property. The location is prime and parking is good but there is nothing about The Mirage that makes me want to stay and gamble, drink, or eat. They offer a nude pool, which is great, but the tasteless posters of a woman's backside right in my face - funny how in 2013 they don't advertise any shirtless men to lure the ladies - that litter the casino floor do not make me want to go and are more reminiscent of one of the cheaper, rowdier casinos.",9,9,8

We booked our trip through Travelocity and got a pretty good rate, complete with a $50 food\/beverage credit.  We had an early flight, so we arrived in Vegas around 10am.  Check in is 3pm. Oh no.  Well, turns out The Mirage rocks.  I went to the front desk to ask if they may hold our bags until check in, that way we wouldn't have to lug our luggage around.  She did better than that, she said our room was already ready to go.  Sweet! The woman that helped us was so nice! Great first impression. I will note that you will have a $200 deposit.. no matter what.  We found it strange since our room was already fully paid for months in advance, but oh well.  Resort fees are about $30, which is standard at any hotel on the strip. Our room was gorgeous, we had a strip view and we were on the 22nd floor.  The view was so nice, especially at night.  The decor was very modern, and the room was comfortable.  No complaints.  The walls were a bit thin as we could hear people conversing outside, but it wasn't to the level of bothersome. The bathroom came complete with shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash.. yay! Oh, and skip the mini-bar! Unless you want to pay $6 for a water bottle.

The reason I'm giving a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the hotel itself.  I noticed that the casino in the Mirage was quite smokier than some of the other casinos we visited, but I guess that's just something you have to accept in Vegas.  The pool at the Mirage is also FREEZING! I should have had my husband film me as I got in, because that was the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge right there! This was in August, so it was a scorcher out.  Yet nobody was in the pool, except a few kids of course.  Kids don't seem to feel cold. Weirdos.  Also, I'm not a fan of the dining options in the hotel.  I noticed that other hotels such as the Venetian, Caesar's, Flamingo, etc.. all had food courts.  The Mirage has no such thing. This makes for pricier meals or having to walk off property to grab a bite.

Overall, the central location of The Mirage is fantastic.  I would definitely consider staying here again.  Now if you guys could turn the temperature up on the pool, I'd be forever grateful!",7,4,3

Asked for complementary upgrade and got it with a view of the Volcano and The Strip. (You gotta take care of the front desk and they'll take care of you!) If you got time, get to the poolside early because its fills up quick or you can spend a few more tokens and lay in secluded shaded area. The pool got that Playboy mansion grotto feel to it.

The perfumed air made to smell like suntan lotion made me a little sick but I noticed that the Cosmopolitan also smelled perfumed so maybe that's a thing now.  I am sensitive to chemical fragrances so it wasn't for me plus I don't appreciate my clothing smelling like the Mirage. My room smelled a little of cigarettes even though it was non-smoking.

Other than that, it's decent. Like a mid range Hilton decent. 

The furniture in the room had some scratches and nicks and there was a wet spot on my carpet when I checked in. I stepped in it with my bare feet. Yeah gross. I called the front desk and they checked with housekeeping and told me that the carpet had just been spot shampooed. Hmmmm okay. They offered to move me but there were no other rooms available with a strip view.

No one offered to help me with my bags to the room. 

My view was cool and a free upgrade. 

The bed was cozy but was uneven from side to side as if one side had been slept on more than the other.

The hair dryer was a Babybliss and was awesome!!! 

The decor was fine with me though I wasn't a fan of the carpet.

The bathroom is tiny as was the basic tub. Just a bathroom.

The trash cans didn't have plastic liners in them which I think is GROSS. I hope they wash them out after each guest ! (Hello women and sanitary items!) 

Biggest complaint  with this room is that there is a door that connects to the next room but is locked. The problem? You can hear every word the people in the next room speak. Every. Word. Luckily the ladies next door to me where quiet ... And I was out all night. Otherwise the lack of soundproofing would have ruined my trip.

I had forgot my earplugs at home and had to pay $7.00 for earplugs from the store at the mirage called essentials.

They only carry foam earplugs but not the good silicone kind. With rooms like that they might want to consider the silicone!

I would give 3.5 stars if I could.

There must have been a renovation of sorts in the last few years. The room we stayed in was a good size. 2 queen beds,  a desk, mini fridge, lcd tv (no espn news though), bathroom was decent...  The only problem was that our room was the one closest to the ice machine so we could hear the noise from the ice buckets being filled every time someone went for a refill. Wasn't too happy with that... I mean, it wasn't terribly loud. But it was loud enough to be annoying after a while.

Another negative was the amount of time it took for the valet to retrieve our car. Not a pleasant experience waiting for your car for about 30 mins in Vegas heat when you just showered and cant wait to jump in the rental, blast the AC and go grab a bite off the strip. The valets did apologize for the delay but I had to mention the wait.

I've stayed all over the strip in various price ranges from the Cosmo and Vdara to New York NY and Treasure Island.  The Mirage rooms have thin walls so you can hear a pin drop in the room next to you.  I was in Vegas this trip for a convention and rented 2 rooms for 2 night.  My co-workers room was clean and quiet after 10 pm on the 1st night (not on the 2nd night).  I wasn't as lucky.  The room next to me partied off and on until 4am.  At one point I did call the front desk and they sent security up promptly to address the noise.  The next day the front desk was very accommodating in switching me to another room at 4pm the following day.  Unfortunately this room was rough.  Carpet was dirty, floor was sticky, smelled musty and smoky and there was hair in the tub and toilet.  The 2nd night proved to be just as noisy.  At 1am I had a drunk gentlemen standing outside my door playing music on his phone for everyone to hear while he waited for a friend to let him into his room.  This went on for 15-20 minutes and there were multiple other groups yelling in the hallways until 4am.

We spent the week in the 2-bedroom version of the Tower Suite and it was, well, SWEET!  Floor to ceiling windows in all rooms, colors were dark woods with red (unlike the lime green on the hotel website), spot on strip view (and truthfully, the kids room had a better view than the master simply because of where the bed was placed), 52"" flat screen in the living room, 42"" flat screens in the bedrooms and 32"" flat screens in the bathrooms and a crazy comfortable bed .......all wrapped into 1650 square feet of fabulousness.  

I will say this though .... the shower in the (insanely large) master bath had the worst water pressure evah.  If you have long, luxurious locks be prepared to spend some time rinsing out your shampoo and conditioner.

The hotel might not be the newest, but it doesn't feel old at all even compared to some of the newset additions like Aria. Pool was definitely the best I've been too, food selection is good and the Cravings buffet is definitely a bargain. Staff was helpful and always nice and the personnel at the Mlife desk was definitely better than in many other MGM casinos. Our room was a resort king and was clean and spacious enough, climate in the room was so good we barely used the A\/C at all. It might miss the gazillion of trendy shops of many other resorts, but honestly who needs them when you can find them basically everywhere on the Strip? Loved the Essentials shop right in the middle of the escalators aera, it has been useful at times.

Self-parking area is perfectly located and doesn't require hours to get back and forth from your car if you have any

If I should say something about defects, I miss the frequent volcano shows (2\/3 a day? Definitely not enough). But I can understand the cost might not be justified and that's not really a defect is it?

Only real defect is that rooms are not really sound proof and at times we got a lot of noise coming from the corridors.

The fact that it was a couple of guys spending little time in the room had a lot to do with it. We were good with average, but we did want resort level with all the options expected in a Vegas resort. Nail-on-the-head best describes the choice.

We arrived on Saturday at about noon and checked in quickly from a line with only one young lady ahead of us. No surprises- the room provided was precisely what we had reserved. I'd been to The Mirage a couple of times before and it had been several years since my last visit. I depended heavily on recent reviews to set expectations about how she had aged. She's taken quite good care of herself. I've based at the full spectrum of Vegas properties and covered the top (Four Seasons) to bottom (Imperial Palace), so I have a balanced perspective. The Mirage is an outstanding value and offers an experience that cannot be easily criticized when kept in perspective. So The Mirage can be forgiven for a lot of things if one is careful about fitting it into one's standards. We had a strip\/volcano view and frankly watching the volcano from street level is the only way to do so. I loved the open window option but it was obvious that their windows have not been cleaned in years- possibly never. Sadly, the crud is so thick it is probably impenetrable anyway.

I appreciated the room redesign since my last visit and remain slightly disappointed in the bathroom size in the level of room that we selected. But really, two guys don't need a luxurious and oversized bathroom, so it was fine.

We both felt comfortable with all the public areas including the most important part for a Vegas property- the casino. Everything was clean and tidy. For a first timer, by the end of the trip my son preferred The Mirage Casino to the others that we visited. I've always been comfortable playing there, though I do have other preferences. With the exception of places like Wynn, Bellagio and Aria the smoke factor doesn't differ much from one to another so I won't knock The Mirage and they will probably never go smoke-free. With one exception, the dealers were friendly, personable, helpful and tolerant. They were not generous- consistent with all Vegas casinos. 

We only ate at the buffet twice and weren't impressed, except for the fact that our Sunday breakfast included a whole lot more than our Monday experience. We didn't visit any other restaurants during our stay. I did start my morning walks with a stop at The Roasted Bean a few steps off the elevator. I didn't get his name, but there was a young man at The Bean that was especially helpful and friendly. I mention this because that style of greeting and care are sadly becoming the exception. 

Even though most of the reviews clearly describe the resort fee, it surprises me that some are still shocked and annoyed at it so be prepared. You really get nothing for it. The wifi is the only tangible thing that you can make any use of and we didn't because my iPhone hot-spot provided a better connection. So to me it was worthless.

We saw one show. Daniel Tosh is one of the features of The Aces of Comedy series. He's caustic and nothing is exempt. I never stopped laughing. The Terry Fator Theater is a great place to watch the show. I've seen The Beatles' Love during a past visit and would recommend it as one of the (my) top five Cirque shows.

Again, The Mirage has its place in the full spectrum of properties in Vegas and unless the purpose of your visit or your preference of luxury dictate otherwise, there would be very little reason to avoid a stay at The Mirage.",1,0,0

We had a really nice room though, it was a corner room, so windows on two walls of the room, so we had an amazing view of the strip. If I were rating solely on the view, it would get 6 stars. Excellent view. 

My friend and I wanted to get a nutella shake, and BLT burger was closed. So no shake.

Thought we'd try to see the volcano (you know my many attempts to see it, and how it never seems to be working), and surprise surprise, it wasn't working. Again. 

The light switch in the bathroom stopped working at one point. How am I supposed to do anything in a dark bathroom?

I remember staying here with my family when I was about 8 years old.  Now, 15 years later, I'm paying to stay here myself.  And I'm glad I chose to come back, because I can finally appreciate the Mirage for everything it is.

I stayed in a 2BR Penthouse Suite.  I originally booked a Tower Suite but they hooked up a free upgrade to the top floor... +2 stars right there.

My bathroom was humoungous.  Seriously though, just the main part of the bathroom had enough floorspace to fit a kingsize bed.  Dual sinks, huge tub, and big shower.  Bathroom hallway with a separate toilet\/bidet room, large walk-in closet, and empty dressers.The toiletries were very nice, and the amenities were excellent.  My girlfriend said that the blowdryer in the bathroom is worth almost $200... not that it mattered to me.  But pretty cool nevertheless.

The beds were super comfortable.. I slept better than at home... and the bedding was clean and soft.  The furnishings in the living room were also very nice, and room service kept our room clean and stocked with fresh towels.  I loved the couches... they were super-comfy.  The TV's are all old CRT's (no Plasmas or LCDs everywhere) but that's fine, we don't need to watch TV in Vegas anyway.  The stereo system (with a real receiver) was great for bumping the party music, and being on the penthouse floor, we were able to stay up late and be loud without anybody complaining.  They also did not charge me for a roll-in cot I asked for (had a couple friends staying in the living room).  +1 star for general satisfaction with the suite.

Check-in and Check-out were quick and efficient.  The bell service was very quick with our bags too.  Valet found my car within 15 minutes even though I had lost my valet ticket sometime during the drunken stupor of 72 hours in Vegas.  +1 star for good in\/out service.

Two days before arriving, we decided to buy some tickets for the Beatles Love show.  However, the only tickets remaining on the website were for very crappy seats and very overpriced.  I called the concierge service at the hotel and informed them of my dilemma.  Once they verified my hotel reservations, the concierge was able to get me excellent reserved seats for a ridiculously good price (they were about $30 less per ticket and 6 rows closer than I could find online). They were also able to help me check availibitly at a couple of MGM Grand restaurants, though I didn't end up making any reservations.  +1 star for the helpful concierge desk.

All in all, I was very pleased with my experience at the Mirage.  Even though it's one of the older casinos on the strip, everything is still quite nice, without the pretentiousness of other places.  There's a good reason why the high-roller room at the Mirage is always waaay more packed than any other 4-5 star hotel on the strip.  I definitely felt like I had a 5 star experience.",1,1,1

My other complaint would be that the walls are extremely thin. It wasn't an issue most of the time, but anytime people were walking in the hallway it sounded like they stopped, came in our room and continued their conversation. We had a strip view on the 22nd floor and it was great. We had a great view of the volcano and Venetian. The volcano is not to be missed! We never used the pool area, but we did walk out and see it. It's beautiful and if the weathers right I would highly recommend making time to spend out there. I love that they have many restaurants open late. I stayed at the Luxor and Caesar palace prior and if you're hungry after 11pm you're out of luck. We had a package that included tickets to Love. It was great!

Mirage, while not the fanciest hotel on the strip, gets the job done. After all, you're just here to sleep, right? And in some cases, not even...so why pay a premium for a place to put your luggage?

The sensor bar and fridge was over the top.  I was so afraid to be in the area of the bar that I might ""touch"" something and be charged.  The TV was good, nice selection of channels.
The resort book was missing most pages.  Only 2 pillows and 2 towels, but left note\/tip and got more the next day.  They did a good job cleaning the room as well.  The resort Wifi, which the over charge in the resort fee, was not good most of the time.  Was a non smoking room, which was VERY smokey smell.  My view was of the ugly roof and mess as well

The pool is pretty, but nothing deeper than 3 1\/2 feet, wish a least part of the pool was deeper, or even an area kid free would be nice.  Plus needs to be a non smoking area for those who actually want fresh air someplace.  

Their food is good, the cafe had a great breakfast and the coffee shop \/ bakery is nice and people friendly.  LV burger was very good as well.  Gift shops nice people but overpriced drinks, but there is a CVS and Walgreens nearby.  

Not a big fan of the table games, too many high rollers tables.  But enjoy the poker room here.

Booked at Mirage for our Christmas break thinking that they are known for their hospitality, decor and central location. But what a GRAND disappointment this has been so far!

We checked in an hour ago. 

A few problems were apparent right when we checked in.

1. Safe did not work
2. TV did not work
3. Bathroom door could not be locked
4. There was a line of ants in the room (WTF)

We went to the front desk to report this and requested a change of room, talked to a rather belligerent (and frankly imbecile) employee named Anthony, who refused to change the room for us. He kept insisting that he would rather have someone ""analyze"" the problem before taking an action. He also mentioned that they would not put this room out of service. He said someone will come to our room to ""analyze"" the situation in 10 minutes.  What a bad bad way to even converse with a guest (This is despite of the fact that we kept our cool and never argued or raised our voices).

We are waiting for past 40 minutes since, yet no luck... My wife just called the front desk and (sure enough) they had no idea about such a service call being placed. So, the ETA now is 20 more minutes. It is 11 PM, my kid is really sleepy and we are sitting in complete disgust, waiting for someone to show up and ""analyze"" the situation,

I must say was very disappointed to find the snacks etc which are placed in the room, are not free.  Six dollars for a bottle of water..... yep..... wonder if that is how they make up the difference in the price for the room. Why bother putting them in there- I buy my own and for much less expense. Note, if you lift an item, it automatically gets placed on your bill. SO watch those kiddos, and if they pick something up- call the desk immediately so they can verify. Do the same if there are any items missing from the selection. 
Nightclub is a problem. The crowd extends well into the lobby path making it difficult to maneuver through. Also some pretty freaky looking folks hanging out there. I was traveling alone, so waited for crowd to get to elevator before getting on. It's Vegas- I trust no one...LOL.... 
I received one free meal with my stay. Big disappointment. The salad chef messed my salad up and insisted I take the one he made- he made it with blue cheese and I cant stand that stuff- and I was clear about that from the start, another chef stepped in and corrected my order.

The casino staff and the reception desk were excellent - greeting and taking care of their guest was very welcoming. However, the reek of marijuana on the 11th floor was something when we exited the elevator.

We stayed there this past weekend and our experience was anything but great. First off, will say I have paid a lot less for nicer rooms on the strip also inside of much nicer hotels. The rooms were nothing special especially with the view we had of an empty pool. We stayed in room 19091 and have no idea what noise was keeping us up all night. At first I thought it was the people upstairs then I realized it might be coming from the elevator. Please whatever this is get it fixed!!! It is horrible to charge someone so much and they can't even get a decent night sleep. The resort fee of $32 per night they charge is a joke. Why should I have to pay for services I do not utilize?

First of all, I really like what they did with renovating the rooms here. I especially love the bathroom mirrors; the lighting's pretty intense. There's plenty of room for your luggage and to roam around the room but I do wish that the bathroom was more spacious in comparison to the rest of the room. The mounted plasma TVs are great when you have downtime in your room in between Vegas outings during the day and night. And the generally central location on the strip is great so walking to Caesar's Palace is very do-able.

Upon arrival, my friend plugged in her straightener then the outlet wouldn't work. We called the front desk and a guy came fix it. He was extremely helpful in showing us what we should and shouldn't do in order to avoid the problem again. 

I'm not the biggest fan of the Carnegie Deli and JET Nightclub but other than that, I like what they've done with the place (for being an older hotel).

I thought self-parking structure was fairly accessible; the distance from the elevators to the parking garage wasn't too bad, at least in comparison to other hotels like Planet Hollywood or the Venetian. And when leaving The Mirage when driving, being on the side of the strip that's closest to the freeway does help. 

The prices are pretty good for what you get and for the location on the strip. It's a great alternative (as well as TI) if you can't shell out the money to stay at the Bellagio, Venetian\/Palazzo, or Wynn\/Encore. I would want to stay here again if there is a Beatles ""Love"" promotion.",0,0,0

1. ""Room ready"" text never received - Arrived 2:15, which is before the official 3:00 check in time, however I was able to check in at the front desk.  Good!  The room was not quite ready (which was fine because it was before the official 3:00 check in time), so I stored my luggage with the bell desk.  I was to receive a text when my room was ready.  By 4:30, I had not received a text, so I went back to the front desk to inquire about my room.

2. Room 1 not cleaned - Apparently the room had been missed by the morning housekeeping crew, so the room would not be cleaned by the evening crew until at least the 7:00 pm.  That was totally unacceptable, so I was assigned another room.

3. Room 2 not cleaned - I went to the room and when I opened the door, there were dirty sheets, towels, and balloons from the previous evening's festivities on the floor.  I called the front desk, and the gal said the room would be cleaned within 30 minutes.  She said she would waive the resort fees.  I had to get changed and have dinner before the 7:30 Terry Fator show, so I couldn't wait for housekeeping to come to the room.

4. Room 2 sort of cleaned - At 9:30 pm, I returned to the room, and it had been for the most part cleaned up.  There was still scotch tape (I assume used to attach the balloons) hanging from the bed's valence!

5. Resort fees not waived - The morning I was to check out, I reviewed the room charges on the TV.  The resort fees were still on the statement!  I called the front desk.  Fortunately there were notes in the system about waiving the resort fees, so they removed the resort fees.

6. Parking charges for no car - I had paid for another room, so I asked about that room's charges.  There were parking charges on that statement, however the occupants did not have a car!

7. Moving mini-bar items triggers charge - There were 2 mini-bar charges on the statement.  I did move 2 items which were on top of the dresser, however I replaced them.  The front desk removed the 2 mini-bar charges.

8. Mystery mini-bar charge - After returning home, I was emailed a statement which included a new mini-bar charge.

9. Customer Care phone number doesn't really care - In the statement's email, there was an ""If you have any questions or concerns in regards to your folio please contact MGM Resorts International Customer Care at (855) 275-5733 and one of our specialists will be delighted to assist you."" statement, however after listening to all of the infobot options, I discovered that you can never really speak to a person!  I even tried pressing ""0"".  I ended up calling the hotel's front desk to have the new mini-bar charge removed.

10. Email survey expires in less than a week - Was sent an email survey less than a week ago about my stay at the Mirage, but when I clicked on the link, a message displayed that the survey had expired.  Hate when surveys have an expiration date, but they don't tell you until you click on the link.

Pro
- When I finally got into my room, it was nice, spacious and clean, except for the hanging scotch tape!
- Front desk personnel were courteous.
- The spa was nice.
- Terry Fator show was great!

Con
- Do not move mini-bar items on top of the dresser to even inspect the item, otherwise you'll trigger a room charge.
- Review your statement before checking out.
- Review your statement again after returning home.",0,1,0

We managed to get a new room...20th floor...overlooking the strip.  

*The new decor , nice. 

*Beds, comfy.

*Linens, crisp and clean.

*Bathroom, beautiful but with bad shower.

*HD flat screen TV with no HD cable?!?!? 

*Pool, AWESOME.  They need to have more cocktail servers though.

*Service\/guest facing personnel, had a few ""rude"" encounter but service was good for the most part.  Oh and if you go to Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden, don't ask the Dolphin habit  women anything.  They're super rude, especially it seems, to guys.  My boyfriend and another guy that was there both had unplesant encounters.

Pleasant dinner at Onda...FANTASTIC Garlic Crusted Sea Bass...quite tasty Veal Marsala...unimpressed with service and my mixed green salad was limp under a thick coating of creamy dressing...ick!

Carnegie Deli...huge portions of sub-par food (bland, dry rye. gummy Swiss. dry corned beef).  Although the fries were PERFECT!

Carbibe was decent, went for breakfast.  They do a 1 item breakfast which is great if you don't want to stuff yourself.  It comes with 1 egg, 1 slice of toast, 1 piece of meat and 1\/2 a serving of hash browns.  It hit the spot and I didn't feel bloated in my bikini at the pool! hahaha

Gambling treated both of us well.  At Roulette I put down $10 and walked away with $100+.  Slots, put in an $18 credit slip and walked away with $300.  I pissed away about $100 here and there so I'd say I actually WON about $300 in our 2 1\/2 days at Mirage.  Can't beat that!  It paid for at least  half the trip (& my boyfriend's winnings paid for the other half).

I've been going to Las Vegas since 1971, and my wife and I actually lived in Henderson (next door to Vegas), but it was our first stay at the Mirage, even though we've eaten there many times in he past.

The room was nice and overall, very comfortable. The bed was comfortable as well, which is important to us.  That's the PRO!

The CONS were the buffet and the casino areas.

The Mirage, once upon a time, had a really fantastic buffet, and I would have rated it 4 - 5 stars at one time, but not anymore! The buffet this time around actually SUCKED! No longer any pride in food preparation.  Even their prime rib was horrible and without any flavor at all.  The ONLY redeeming items were their desserts! VERY SAD!! I had heard this from a close friend of mine who was there this past August, but I just assumed that maybe they had just had an off-night. She was 100% correct though!

What REALLY upset me the most however, was that they weren't serving Alaskan king crab legs.  When I had checked the reviews on the Mirage a couple of weeks before we went, there were many places that weren't serving the King crab legs, but it stated that the MIRAGE WOULD BE SERVING THEM. So just to be on the safe side, I called the Mirage about them and they connected me with someone at the buffet. The person I spoke with GUARANTEED me that they would be serving them. GREAT!

When we arrived on 11\/25, there were NO Alaskan king crab legs to be found.  I asked our server if they had run out of them, and she said that they weren't serving them at all. I told her that I had placed a phone call 2 days earlier, and she stated that I must have spoken to someone from housekeeping who was cleaning the floors and didn't know any different.

I LOVE being lied to!

After dinner, I went down to the casino floor to do a little bit of gambling, and it was incredibly stuffy and quite warm. There was NO ventilation at all, which is NOT conducive at all for gambling.

The customer service is bad and lacks any emotion, empathy, or excitement. Actually they are pretty rude. Because of my previous problem with the Mirage with unnecessary charges, I paid everything before hand so I would only be responsible for the very expensive over charged resort fees. After one night stay I found a $120.00 charge on my debit card. I went down stairs to talk to front desk. The rep I spoke to stated the charge was added by ""Housekeeping"" for smoking in the room?? I'm not a smoker. I explained to the rep That the night before my husband bought a Cigar at a cigar bar, didn't finish it and brought it upstairs in a bag to smoke it at the casino later. We have been coming to this hotel for 15 years, we know the rules about smoking in the room. After hunting down the manager, they reversed the charge. Now I'm $120.00 short on what I can spend.. I checked out yesterday. I checked my bank account this morning for the reversed charges of $120.00 and my $100.00 deposit, now to find I'm charged by the Mirage AGAIN and this time for $300.00. Now my bank account is a mess and overdraft charges every where. I called the Mirage, on hold for 30-40 minutes. The front desk rep states they charged my $300.00 smoking charge. I explain that if she goes into my account she will see that I've already handled this stupid problem, even threw the damn cigar away. The rep takes nothing into consideration, no empathy, lacks the fact how inconvenient this is.. doesn't even offer the manager (she probably wouldn't have been able to find him \/ her ) she kind of shuts me up by stating only "" I refunded your money, can I help you with anything else"". No sorry, no anything!! I'm to frustrated to wait longer for a manager, I just accepted her response and hang up. I will not be staying here ever again. I'd stay at motel 6 before I come back here.

Checking in was a breeze & easy. When I got to my room the space was very nice, but there were a few minor specific things that I would have liked to see changed. It smelled like someone had taken a shower every time I walked back into the room (because it was that type of stuffiness). Our window had this dripped paint, or bird poop (I couldn't figure out which one it was) and one of our light bulbs was out next to the TV which was sort of annoying. But the service was really great and if I had called in to have those things changed I know for a fact they would have fixed it for me without asking any other questions. The Casino in the Mirage was smaller than other properties on the main strip, but the restaurants were my favorite. Everything was at the foot of my door, or a few steps away. I would absolutely come back again for my next trip.",2,0,0

I've stayed at hotels 'round the globe, both for business and on vacations. Not at all impressed with the Mirage. First, had to wait 3 hours for a room to be ready. After a long day of traveling, that wasn't at all a great start to my stay here. At the 3 hour mark of waiting, I got back in the line to get to the front desk, thinking maybe they'd just forgotten to text me with a room number as they said they would. The service rep at the counter was lovely and gracious when she said, ""oh, sorry for the wait - the room they were gonna clean for you isn't ready yet, but you were just looking for a standard room, right? Oh yeah, we've got plenty of those - let me assign you one.""

SO, my 3 hour wait was so I could get some *specific* standard room in this 3,000 room hotel, not just so I could get a room. They had plenty of rooms available - they just wanted me to wait 3 hours so they could give me a particular standard room.

Really?

When I finally got to my room, I started a hot bath so I could wash the stench of having to hang out by the casino for 3 hours. (Mygod, I think I may have gotten lung cancer in those 3 hours. SO much cigar and cigarette smoke & smell.) As I filled up the tub for what was to be a glorious hot bath, water starts dripping out of the light fixture over the tub and onto my head. A slow drip at first, then a steady, faster one.
Argh. 
Yet another delay to my relaxation as I had to call the front desk to inform them, and to get the plan in place on how they were gonna fix it. I could wait another 3 hours for another room, or, I could just deal with the drippiness until they could tend to the issue. I told 'em at that point I just didn't care anymore, so they could deal with their water leak on their own time. I opted to look at it as a shower\/bath combo, and not give it another thought. Thankfully, the next morning, they got to it and fixed it, so at least there's that.

And it's probably petty, but really, the reason I'll not stay here again is the lack of a certain amenity for guests. No coffee makers in the room. If you want a cup of coffee while you're here, you have to get yourself dressed and go on an adventure to get it. This morning, for example, I woke up at 0530 and thought, ""gee, a cup of coffee sounds like a great start to the day!"" 

24 minutes from the time I left my room 'til I got back with some java. Not the great start I'd been hoping for. Gotta get dressed, walk the Green Mile to the elevators, wander through the loud, stinky casino, and then stand in line with everyone else who is bitching about the coffee procuring procedure, and then pay almost $5.00 for a crappy, bitter cup of Starbucks swill.

I've only got 3 more nights to tough it out here. It's not the worse place I've ever stayed, but I'll definitely be grumbling to my boss when I get back home, telling him to please let me make arrangements and reservations for any future conventions I need to attend. If I have to be away from home for that long again, I'd prefer to find one that has those little things in place, like rooms that are ready upon check-in, bathing facilities that won't lead to electrocution, and coffee. I suspect I can't avoid the stench and potential long cancer while in Vegas, but there's gotta be a place that has coffee more easily accessible to guests.

Again, it's the little things.",0,0,0

We arrived on Saturday morning for a 2 night comped stay. 

First and foremost, The new parking situation is beyond ridiculous. As an mlife tiered member, we get free parking but no one at mlife could get our card to work correctly and had to pay $7.00 twice to get out of their parking lot. Upon returning to the mlife desk I was told ""we outsourced our parking lots and valet to a California company and can't do anything or reimburse you for those fees."" Really?!? That's your customer service response for your crappy implementation of paid parking.

Secondly, shortly after arriving, we decided to go have breakfast at the buffet. Shocked to say the least at the $65 for two for brunch. The place wasn't packed for a Saturday morning and that should have been our first clue to run. Every piece of food was cold and flavorless. Oh and you serve yourself literally everything including getting your own soft drinks or coffee. I didn't realize the Buffet had turned into an expensive Souplantation. And to top it off, we both got sick from the food. 

We decided to cut our stay short at the Mirage and checked out early (which the front desk wasn't happy about but did nothing to accommodate or make it right) and went to another property across the street that still knows how to cater to its patrons.

Very sad, and we spoke with many other returning Mirage fans also turned off by the ""7-11 feel"" of the new cup.

What is your theme, your essence, how can I describe you in one word? First of all I don't think anyone can answer those questions because it seems like a mish mosh of Egyptian, oasis, desert, tropical, dark mirror like, old world décor with modern lights, as easy a layout and flood design as they could make it without tearing down walls and such. I'd almost liken it to a frugal man's Bellagio\/Caesars Palace. Notice I didn't say poor man's because it's not. It's 4 stars in my book because the beds were comfortable and the rooms were pretty good, but Jet is their club and it's a great place to party, a little confusing to get to the club and the waiting area could be bigger, but it's not too big to where the DJ is lost to the crowd and it's small enough to where meeting people isn't a hassle. The front desk could use some work, but it's a true Vegas designed casino. I read earlier that someone compared Hard Rock to Mirage and my main difference between them is yes Hard Rock is newer and probably more comfortable an experience, but it's more of a Vegas-esque Hard Rock Hotel rather than a hotel designed for Vegas, made by the Hard Rock. Parking is a chore and valet is the way to go. Your room either gets light, tons of light or a little light depending on orientation, the blinds are adequate. The pool is the place to recoup after a night out at Jet, but get a cabana because like most Vegas pools unless your rolling deep and block off an area it can be a mad house of people.",3,2,2

Our first impression of the hotel was nightmarish. We had booked 2 rooms for ourselves and my parents about 4 months in advance. Prior to arriving, I had contacted the hotel with a request for one of the rooms which went off without a hitch (the conversation). Upon arriving to the hotel at about 10pm a couple nights before new years eve, I was told at the reception that I had NO RESERVATION and that both my rooms had been cancelled a few nights before (by a magical creature probably because I'm the only one who had access to the reservation and made no such request before arrival). I was then told that the hotel was fully booked and that we had to leave and find somewhere else to stay (!!!!!). Anyway, after a bit of back and forth, and escalation to the manager, I was then told that the person who told me my reservation was cancelled was new and didn't understand how to read the information on the screen and that in fact, my rooms were ready (?????). They also realized that instead of using my full first and last name on the reservation, they used half of my first and half of my last name combined which is why they couldn't see the active booking (what????). Needless to say, our stay started off VERY stressfully as you can imagine and we went to our rooms relatively pissed off at the staff, and their unprofessionalism. 

Location of the hotel is good (but not GREAT) and rooms are kept very clean as is the rest of the hotel. However, the hotel is HUGE - it takes 10 minutes+ to go from your room to the outside world if you get placed in one of the really far rooms like we were despite clearly asking for that not to be the case in advance.

There are lots of places to eat in the hotel itself, but the ones we tried were not really great. Also, and I think this goes without saying, but stay away from the hotel bar. One night, we order 2 rum and cokes, and paid a disgusting $54 for them...

Overall, I would never choose the Mirage if I visited Vegas again. I'd go more central, try to be closer to the action, and probably stay at one of the newer hotels on the strip! Sorry but can't recommend this hotel!",2,2,0

Rooms are fairly basic with no bells or whistles, but the casino itself is fairly well kept and extravagant. Cool reception aquarium, tiger den, Beatles lounge, and volcano show out front. All food is overpriced, but cheap eats across the street. Very tight on comps! 

Pool was pretty good, but be careful ordering drinks. We got some massive mojitos that were like sugar water and cost 20 bucks a pop. Not sure about Bare, but probably not as cool as it sounds.

In short: Broken air conditioner went unfixed even though they sent up a facilities guy twice, but they moved us to a new room. In-room internet access is so slow it's useless, even though you're paying for it in your daily Resort Fee. Everything else was fantastic and The Mirage exceeded my expectations considering it's an older Strip resort. Now, to the details:

I tried the $20 donation trick at 11AM with the very pleasant lady checking us in and even though the bill was politely returned, she gave us a ""Strip view upgrade"", but the room wasn't ready yet. We were texted a couple hours later with our room number. Happily we went up to the 14th floor and got settled in our room. Only after returning a few hours later did we realize our air conditioner was broken - it was blowing air, just not cold air. Seeing as it's the end of August and it's 108 outside, our room quickly heated up to about 76 degrees. The thermostat was broken and we couldn't change the set point. We called the front desk, they said they'd send a guy up, and we went out to dinner. When we returned, the room was still too warm, but the thermostat was fixed. 

We figured we'd let it settle for the night and maybe in the morning the room would be nice and cool. Changing the thermo to 66 did not make the actual air conditioner blow cold air. We both slept like crap as the room temp increased to probably 84 degrees during the night. In the morning, we called down and they offered to send another maintenance guy ""up right away"" to fix things, and put a room on hold in case it couldn't be fixed. We went out for a few hours, returned, the room was still hot (and the guy hadn't come yet), so we called down to the desk and they switched us to a new room right away. We were sweating like crazy as we re-packed our bags (it had to be at least 88 in our room by then), and fortunately our existing keys worked fine in the new room down the hallway. So, not so good about the unfixable air conditioner and the crappy night sleep, but great about how they moved us right away as soon as we said we had enough.

Both wired and wireless internet access in our 2 rooms on the 14th floor was a complete, horrible failure. If I was staying at the Mirage for business I simply wouldn't be able to work at all in my room as there was absolutely no way to maintain anything near a usable internet connection, wired or wireless, using my phone, my tablet, or my laptop. I spent a very aggravating hour in my room trying to download a few PDF menus for various Vegas restaurants and I could never get higher than 75kb\/s. Often it was more like 40kb\/s. Considering your ""free internet access"" is part of your $30\/day resort fee, it's completely unusable.

Both of our rooms were very nice. Wide open floorplan, with a desk-like writing console attached to one wall. Marble entry way that gave way to carpet - it looked very nice. No extra walls blocking sight lines. It was one big room, very well decorated in a modernish art theme, with a 36"" flatscreen TV, alarm with iPod dock, two phones, mini-bar fridge that you couldn't store your own stuff in. Plenty of lights, and the windows actually opened up a little bit so you could let in fresh air. Bathroom was fine, normal sized tub\/shower, all the fixtures looked high end and modern, and again exceeded expectations.

The casino was decent. Not as wide open or as vast as say The Venetian but a good size and without an oppressive, smoky feel to it. A wide variety of machines and table games, including video Craps and video Roulette. Drink service while playing was excellent. I wasn't seated anywhere for more than a few minutes before a waitress came around. At the lounges, a 32oz draft beer and a Cosmo was $28, which I found to be about average on the Strip.

The MLife card is accepted here but the card rewards are a joke, unless you plan on gambling $10k or more during your stay. We gambled quite a bit at the MLife \/ MGM properties over the 4 days and I didn't even come close to earning a free T-shirt let alone a dinner or a show ticket.  

Carnegie Deli was great, Starbucks was slower than at home. They do serve unlimited beer (including a good IPA) and wine and champagne in the buffet, so you could probably get pretty wasted in a cost effective manner.

Checkout was fast and courteous, and they had ample people at the desk plus a parade of other guys checking you in the line to make sure you didn't want to use their Express Checkout. Bell desk was great, doormen were great, everything was much better than I anticipated. Every single Mirage employee I dealt with exceeded my expectations with their courtesy and demeanor. If the price remains comparable to other Strip resorts, I will definitely go back to the Mirage on our next stay.",2,0,0

First there's no automatic door or doorman, so drag your stuff in as best you can. Then the front desk -- Very Understaffed. Instead of a single line you get to play ""line roulette"" and guess which line might move -- mine doesn't because the rep is ""waiting for her guest"" who has disappeared. No one else to be helped in this line. (I wish I was someone's guest...)

They offered me the choice to pay more to get a room or wait for a text and come wait in line again (!). I need to run one business call today. The Business Center offers me a quiet corner for $60\/hour. What exactly is it that my daily resort fee does for me again?

No one who cares about customers manages this place. My advice: Go somewhere that appreciates your business.

--------------

OK, update: I'm going from 1 to 2 stars. The room is nice. It's a middle aged property, not too bad. Everything is overpriced (think $14 hamburgers and $8 beers) but that's probably typical. The restaurants like to keep a line going so they delay seating you even with many open tables. Overall it wasn't terrible.

Yet to me First Impressions and Service are important. If the manager has never gone through the experience of arriving and checking in to his\/her own property and doesn't try to make it the best it can be then I know there are other properties where I will be valued more as a customer. For example I have had great experiences at the Venetian and more recently at Rio.",4,0,2

Jon at the front desk hooked my GF and I up with a penthouse suite (1200+ sq. ft) for an amazing rate! It had an incredible view of the strip (right over the volcano). The bed was very comfortable (memory foam), the bathroom was the size of many SF apts , the jacuzzi tub was relaxing, and the room overall was newly remodeled (there was granite throughout and everything seemed very luxurious). If you're looking for a VIP Vegas experience, then stay at the Mirage's penthouse. It was incredible. 

As for the casino, I had a lot of fun playing a few games. There are a lot of restaurants, lounges, and a club in the resort, too. I liked Japonais the most, since I'm a big sushi fan.

The staff is very polite and friendly throughout the resort.

I also spent time at the pool and the zoo. The pool was impressive (too bad the weather wasn't warmer) and the zoo was fun--great seeing the dolphin acts and the white tigers.

First of all, this hotel was ONCE (pre-Bellagio, pre-Wynn, pre-Encore, pre-Cosmopolitan, etc etc) the best and brightest on the strip.  It was.  Then, along came all the other hotels.  And then, Siegfried and Roy vanished........along with their tiger display (a huge, huge loss in my book), along with the passing of one amazing Danny Gans.  At least it still boasts Cirque du Soleil's Beatles Love show, which I have yet to see..... not for lack of trying, however.  This hotel is no longer all that it once was cracked up to be.  Honestly, having spent some time walking around inside, there is no longer anything to see, and I refuse to pay to see a habitat there.  I was there a few years ago, and that's good enough for me (no offense to all the animals lodged there).  While I can say that our rooms were extremely spacious and comfortable (we had a king bed, and our daughters' room had 2 queens), there were some problems.

First of all, I have never had issues using a debit card to pay for a room.  While the card took immediately, I was forced to pay up front, which was no big deal really, but I never have in the past.  They ""usually"" let me run a tab.  No one, nowhere, has ever batted an eyelash over what I use to pay for things, and my debit card has the Visa logo and everything.  Here, once I paid, that was it.  I couldn't charge another thing to the room, such as an-room movie, or I'd have to commit $100 in advance PER DAY to cover an $11 movie.....or whatever it costs.  Why?  What is their deal?

Then, there was a refrigerator\/freezer in the room.  Cool !!  We could put all our leftovers in there.........yeh, that's if we were interested in paying a ridiculous sum (anything over ZERO is considered RIDICULOUS) for just putting our own, already paid for perishables in a refrigerator. They charge by the ounce.  I have no idea how much per ounce because I was so outraged that they would do that, I didn't get past the idea.  SERIOUSLY?  Who does that?  That's just low.

Finally, we had previously signed up for a hotel promotion where we could eat at any MGM resort buffet for breakfast or lunch, and it was equivalent to $40\/day for 2 people per paid room.  Allegedly, it was plus the cost of tax to equal $56\/day.  At the Aria Hotel, they honored the $40 plus tax, but yet, at the Mirage, they did NOT.  This, mind you, was stated by 2 of the 5 idiots telling us how this promotion worked, but in the end, we were unable to get the measily $3.22 tax comped at the Mirage.  I simply didn't have enough energy to fight over it.....but I was pissed.
  
Unfortunately, we were told five DIFFERENT things by five different people........nobody REALLY knew, the least of which was us.  Our first day there, we ate lunch at Carnegie Deli and ended up using my comped amount (the $80 of free BUFFET food), and THEY stated it was good at their restaurant.  I was surprised.  However, the next day, the front desk said NO WAY, so for a little while, we were in the throws of having to cover the $80 difference that we thought was a done deal.  We never asked.......Carnegie Deli offered.  So, why should I now have to cover something that was a mistake on their part????????  The hotel ended up eating that cost, as they should.  I pitched a fit on that one.  It was NOT MY fault.   They also argued this with my brother, who stayed at the Mirage, as well, and who had signed up for the comped buffet meals.  They gave him the equal runaround, and in fact, they made his situation worse than mine........HE got stuck with having to charge $300 extra ($100\/day for 3 days) to cover the cost of the comp.  Okay, explain that.......why should HE have to pay, or even commit the funds temporarily, for something that is COMPED BY THE HOTEL in the first place??????  What the hell is that about?  That REALLY got us both up in arms (me in support of him).

As I stated earlier, the rooms were fine, but there was just a whole lotta mix-ups, misinformation, and the hotel was just one of the more boring hotels, given all that there is to do in so many of the other hotels.  I was kinda sad about it.  Four stars for the room comfort and size, but honestly, they only get 1 star for all the other nonsense that ensued....thus, I'd say they should feel pretty good about getting an overall 3 stars from me.",4,2,1

It's centrally located (for me at least since I like to stay on the east end of the strip) and the decor is pretty cool on the inside. There's a huge waterfall-looking thing as soon as you enter. 

Guest services were quick and efficient. I don't think I've ever gone to Vegas and NOT had to wait in a long line to register, but I simply walked up to the desk at the Mirage. Thats's major KUDO points in my book. The lady was friendly and met all of my requests. 

One MAJOR DRAWBACK is that the rooms are pretty far away from the front desk and unless you have a bellboy take all of your luggage, you have to walk THROUGH the casino with all your stuff. The elevators to the rooms are all the way in the back of the casino near the Beatles ""Love"" arena (highly RECOMMENDED BTW!). I know that's something that shouldn't bug me, but I just don't think it's cool to maneuver your things through the casino, especially since it can get kind of packed when idiot tourists are stopping to take pictures at the most inopportune locations!

The room it self was nice, but nothing outstanding. It had an iPod deck (major plus for an iPhone user) and a flat screen TV. It was one of few rooms I've had in Vegas where you can actually OPEN the window and get some fresh air. Needless to say it's pretty loud, but I enjoy a cool Vegas breeze every now and then (during the winter time at least!). 

The only complaint I would give is that the bathroom was pretty small in comparison to the rest of the room.  Also, as others have mentioned, there is no real place to eat in the hotel other than the buffet (not recommended) and a VERY OVERPRICED deli.

The Mirage is a nice hotel. Rooms are very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The casino is smaller than most of the others on the strip... I personally like that about the Mirage, because it is a little less overwhelming than the other resorts and it is easy to navigate. We had an amazing view from the 23rd floor that looked out over both the strip and the hotel pool\/dolphin habitat (we woke up to jumping dolphins!)

The pool is beautiful. Went to most of the bars and lounges and it was a good time. Lots of drink specials and relaxed atmosphere. 

We ran into no problems with check-in or check-out, received several comps and a $75 resort credit, and found everyone to be very friendly and pleasant.

 We got a GREAT deal on the room: around $120 a night. My advice, ""like"" the hotel on facebook... they run 72 hour sales every so often and post it on their facebook page those prices really can't be beat!",0,0,1

Decor & Electronics: Lovely. Very modern and fresh. There was ample seating, and we were pleased to find plenty of AC outlets and even some direct USB jacks. There's a great flatscreen HDTV with an HDMI port for you to watch movies from your laptop (just be sure to bring your own HDMI cable, as the hotel doesn't lend or sell them). There's also plenty of storage for clothing and whatnot in the many drawers around the room (though you may want to note that there's no wardrobe, so good luck hanging up any of your more delicate outfits!).

Bed: Incredibly comfortable. We spent more time sleeping than anticipated just because it was so damn comfy! The sheets were fresh and soft, the mattress was firm yet moldable, and the pillows (which I never seem to have enough of in hotels) were, for once, entirely adequate: big, fluffy, and, like the mattress, firm yet moldable. 

Bathroom: Quite small, but it didn't bother me, though it might (actually, it probably) would bother others. It consisted of a toilet, a sink, and a shower with an attached tub; there's no additional room for movement aside from opening and closing the door. The shower curtain was outward-bowing, so there was plenty of bathing room, and the water pressure and heat were fine -- fully acceptable, if not more than.

Cleanliness: Terrific. I found no stains, dirt, or dust anywhere. I'm EXTREMELY picky about room cleanliness, so for me to be this pleased is very rare and certainly says something about the standards held by the Mirage. In fact, they have a 24-hour cleaning crew! Even if you sleep until 3:00, you can still expect your room to be clean by the time you get back later that night.

Noise: Nearly as silent as it gets. Sure, we would occasionally hear groups of 10+ guys carousing their way down the hallway, but it was muffled enough that it hardly registered, and it was certainly never loud enough to wake us up. We never once heard the folks in the rooms on either side of ours, nor did we hear any water from other pipes or sounds from other TVs.

Price: Exceedingly affordable. Our stay was $40 a night (mid-December, Tues-Fri). The $20 resort fee is a bit much, especially considering the Internet connection was never particularly reliable, but it's not unusual for Vegas casinos, so it's difficult to knock them for a charge every other place adds on.

CASINO: 4\/5
Games: Fun, but a bit limited. The tables are pricy, and we couldn't find several of our favorite newer machines (e.g., Texas Hold 'Em and Multi-Hand Blackjack). 

Service: Fantastic. Everyone was exceedingly friendly and eager to help. When a couple cut in front of us in the line to check in, a security guard, who had been watching, came over and quietly led me and my boyfriend to a hidden open desk at the far end of the room so that we wouldn't be cheated out of our ""turn"" at the counter. We also watched one clerk get quite unfairly screamed at by a guest for not honoring an expired offer; the clerk offered her a freshly printed copy of the details of said offer, along with her own name for the woman to complain to management. At the end of the transaction, the clerk told the woman to have a wonderful day without a trace of irony or sarcasm in her voice. These people are truly interested in making your stay as pleasant as possible.

Cleanliness: Fine. I didn't notice any trash, and the bathrooms were always clean.

Decor: Not particularly inspired, but certainly nice. The little tropical forest with the waterfall at the entrance gave off a very fresh smell that was oddly comforting, especially after the reek of booze and smoke on the Strip.

Food: BLT Burger is a great place to eat. Other than that, though, the choice of eateries is a bit lacking. The only place open 24 hours is the Carnegie Deli, which I can tell you is most definitely overpriced; they're coasting entirely off their name (I mean, $22 for lox on a bagel -- seriously?!). Still, the food there's good, if you're willing to pay the massive premium. We just found ourselves wishing there were more options available to us late-nighters.",1,0,0

And it was so worth it.

Spent New Year's Eve and a few days before for a hell of a deal. Best hotel decision I've ever made.
I've stayed at the Imperial Palace last time and I really loved the proximity of not being too far away from anywhere on the Strip (well, MGM-area doesn't count, that place beyond there is dead) so I was more into finding a cleaner hotel in that area.

But I'm talking about lights, nightclubs, free attraction shows, this is where it's at! The heart of the strip! And damn right, The Mirage was the perfect hotel! I checked in way sooner than I was supposed to arrive because of weather issues and flight delays in the East Coast, so my original request of being on a high floor with a straight view of the Strip was somewhat not honored and ended up on the 9th where all I could look down on was a huge glass ceiling. Boo hoo. At first, I was really upset since I've called twice to make sure I'm on a higher floor prior to checking in. It's not so bad though, since a lot of people checked in that day and I still got a view of the strip and large fires from the Volcano regardless, if only it wasn't all black down there. But my hotel room was a LONG walk from the elevators.

As soon as I walked up to my room, I already felt welcomed in there. The room was absolutely gorgeous! Had all the amenities there, EXCEPT sandals and showercaps. But the guy who brought me those ammenities was real nice about it. VERY soft pillows, had to stack the pillows up to sleep since I have neck pain (I suggest those of you who have neck pains like me do the same). Clean bathrooms, free wifi (if you're a guest), mirrored windows, flatscreen tv, and even an iHome dock! But what I loved MOST about it was the desk chair. You can lean back all the way you want, it's still solid on the floor, baby. 

Honestly, the rooms are really far from the entrance to the Strip street. Pass by poker tables, strippers, and lots of smoke. That Revolution lounge is gorgeous, by the way. The front of the hotel is gorgeous though, very calming and relaxing by the waterfalls. Since I stayed for New Year's Eve, they gave a complimentary autograph (no preprinted stuff A-list celebrities like Cameron Diaz, Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise's secretaries give out) signed by Terry Fator and chocolates! 

By the way, they check your room key at night so make sure you have a room key with you (why wouldn't you?). The only problem I had when I checked out was they charged me $16x.xx for a 4-night stay, including resort feel,  because I opened the fridge occassionally to put the drinks I bought from outside. Huge WTF. Apparently, the fridge is monitored each time you open the fridge, they charge you, assuming you drank\/ate something. Doesn't matter though, they send someone to check if you really took something out.

Overall, a great hotel and I loved how proximate it is to the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. Very friendly staff as well. You definitely will get your money's worth. I'd definitely come back!",1,1,1

Clean rooms and casino. Friendly and helpful staff. Comfy beds too, we got the standard room for 2 nights. King size bed and still plenty of room to walk around in room. with a view of the pool. 

Loved the bare pool. Which is topless but optional, I'd say about 1\/3 women went topless and no one made u feel uncomfortable if u did or didn't. Look for promoters outside the pool, I got free entry and my bf got in for $10 originally $10 gals and $40 guys. If u want a place to sit besides the pool u will need to purchase lounge chairs, day bed, or cabana. Chairs $50 per. Bed about $250 and cabanas around $1,000. But all food and drinks go towards ur total. Which is easy to do btw. Buckets $50 pitchers $75 singles $12. I will def be returning here. Fun relaxed environment. 

Reason for only 4 stars was the shower, the water pressure was out of control, I felt like I was getting washed with a pressure washer! Ouch! But I guess I would also complain if it was too weak so..oh well.

They were at the Riviera and, after looking at the pictures of the hotel, I was kinda grossed out. So we decided to book at the Mirage instead. We went through Southwest Vacations and (unlike a previous reviewer) we had absolutely no problems. There were quite a few people checking in, so it took us a while, but they were super friendly. Signed me up for the mLife card also, which was nice. 

Our room was a pretty decent size, everything was clean, and never had any problems with the cleaning staff or really anyone else. With our vacation package, we got 2 free tickets to a show and decided to go to the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil, which just happened to be at the Mirage. We went to the Sunday night showing, so there really weren't very many people there at all and we got upgraded from balcony to lower level seats, which was a big plus. Show was excellent, as can be expected with any of their shows.

The good thing about the Mirage is that it's (fairly) centrally located on the strip, so you only have to walk a short distance to get to most of the good things around. We bought a bus pass (3 days for $20 each) and rode that if we wanted to go up to the Riviera where our friends were staying or to the Stratosphere, or down to Luxor. On a side note, definitely recommend the bus pass. Cheap, convenient, and saves you from miles of walking.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here and it was reasonably priced for an above average room. When we looked at the prices, the Riviera (by FAR a lower quality hotel) was actually quite a bit more expensive than the Mirage, so it wasn't a hard decision at all. This was my first trip to Vegas and it certainly won't be my last. I would definitely stay at the Mirage again, and would recommend to anyone else coming to Vegas.",8,0,1

It was one of the first Lux Hotels aside from the MGM Grand and before Treasure Island.  It had style. And refreshing next to aging mildewing Caesar's Palace.  But you know what, I got the BEST personalized service.

I stay all over the strip, and have stayed in almost every major Hotel. The all have their niches, but few have actual Customer Service.  At least, the Customer Service I like.  What I mean is, people who are willing to actually have a conversation, or know how to have a conversation.  People who can work, tell a mild casual joke to break the ice, and expedite my needs with ease.  People who can actually explain things so there are no surprises, or so I don't have to ask. Yes, the old Mirage, that's getting an interior face lift, did just that. And it started with the Bell Man, and ended with the Bell Man. 

What I don't like, small rooms. Or, rooms less than 400 sq ft.  However, their new room rates reflect this so I'm ok with staying their again.  

The Pool, OK. Well monitored. The drunks are kept under control, so families, be not worried.  Unlike CP.  The room, clean, decent, updated. But, I hate the lack of ventilation. So if you have bad gas, go to the lobby bathroom, unless you want to stink up the whole room for hours.

Check in was a little confusing, but there was an employee to guide us the right direction.  The girl checking me in had a weird smirk on her face when I answered her questions that I got a weird vibe from, but I was hungover, could have been me.
My standard size room was much larger and felt roomier than any other standard sized rooms I've stayed in in Vegas.   It was decorated tastefully and modernly.  Our view sucked, however.
It's in a good location on the strip.  We walked to the Forum Shops, Caesar's Palace, Harrah's, Paris, Bally's fairly easily.  If you're leaving by taxi, you exit onto the strip.  That suckkkkkks.
They have a lot of tables, machines, a huge sports book, and many restaurants.  They have a Starbucks too which is a necessity in Las Vegas.
One complaint I have is about the dolphins.  Dolphins have no place in the Nevada desert.  How sad are they living in a little pool doing tricks for fish to entertain hillbillies?  Set them free.  They have the tigers there that attacked Roy.  No concern about the true welfare of WILD animals.  They are not domesticated pets.  (That's the end of that soapbox)

I am an avid Vegas goer and I stay in various hotels so I can compare which ones are worth visiting again and which ones I'd steer clear from. 

CHECK IN \/ OUT
I checked in on a Sunday afternoon in the summer and the line was fairly short. My desk clerk greeted me with a warm smile and addressed me by name several times during the check in procedure. Check out procedure was fairly simple. Like most hotels they have express check out so I was able to check out via email at the end of my trip. 

ROOM QUALITY
I booked a king bed in one of their standard rooms in the smoking section of the hotel. Very clean and tidy. Spacious. Only thing I didn't like about the room and the hallway was the decor. I suppose it's supposed to have a bit of a desert theme in an oasis since it IS called The Mirage, but it didn't personally excite me. 

AMENITIES
I strongly believe that this hotel has the best packaging for their shower amenities and they smell delicious!

I had a particularly bad experience as far as In-Room Dining went but when I filled out an online survey at the end of my visit, one of the representatives took it upon herself to refund us for the meals we ordered as an apology for the terrible service. If that's not good customer service then I don't know what is!

Pro 2: 
The spa is awesome and I had a fantastic day of relaxing in the whirlpools. Jenny made me a fantastic juice mix drink that gave me the little extra sugar boost I needed. She even sprayed eucalyptus on the iced towels per my request! But it is so dry in Vegas...I had hoped they would have coconut water.

Pro 3: 
The gym is pretty stacked for how small it is. The trainer (Craig) is nice and friendly...really easygoing guy with a smile on his face and helped streamline the whole ""can I get a cardio machine"" process. 

Pro 4: We accidentally bumped some of the sensors holding snacks and drinks when moving in but nothing was taken so they were kind enough to take my word for it and remove the charges.

They even offered to comp that first night as a result of the inconvenience. They also sent someone to escort us to our new room and help us with our baggage. Thanks Todd!

Con 2: The charge removal from the first night was not reflected in the statement when we were trying to checkout so I had talk to a front desk associate about it. Instead of removing the room charge and the resort fees and taxes for the first night, they only removed the room charge. As I was explaining to the associate over the phone what I was told the previous night, she grew frustrated and raised her voice at me. I asked her not to raise her voice at me and she apologized for it. I expressed my dissatisfaction in the lack of clarity of everything and was about to just call it day and give up on this circular conversation but then she shouts at me,""You wanna talk to someone else? FINE! (CLICK)""

Pro 6:
After being on hold for 5 minutes, the manager I spoke to was accommodating and much more polite to me. She did ultimately remove the charge for the room and resorts fees and taxes for the first night and apologized for the rudeness I encountered earlier. 

Pro 7:
The LOVE show was AMAZING. For anyone who really understands the music of the Beatles and the message that it represented...you'll LOVE it. 

I was annoyed to have had to spend so much time on the phone with the front desk and housekeeping and IT (wifi connection issues in the room) during what was supposed to be a nice vacation but other than that it wasn't too bad. The staff did try their utmost best to make sure I enjoyed myself for the most part so I am grateful for that. Thanks Mirage.",1,0,0

It is with great sadness that I write this.  I have loved you for many years.  I always chose you over the others.  You were special.  From your tropical decor and aromatherapy- to the tiger habitat.  I even had my wedding reception with you.  Well, it's been a few years and I am shocked and disappointed at what you have become.  I could almost say that you are close to sleazy.  

Yes, I know that you're trying to stay ""hip"" with your new art deco rooms with orange accessories that could trigger a migraine.  Sure, it's probably hard to control the odor of cigarettes and beer in the casino. But- somehow you used to do it. The Wynne does it, as does Bellagio, Venetian, Pallazzo and many others.

But what I really found distasteful was the new Revolutions Club where anyone walking past- on the way to the elevator- was given a show of half naked go-go dancers.  You know I'm not a prude.  There are some women that enjoy going to a strip club with their man and I say ""you go girl"".  That's their choice.  But I'm not one of those women.  I don't like anything pushed in my face.  And I do mean ""pushed in my face"".  The dancers are in little arched doorways between the casino and the club.

I know it's Vegas, but I expected a little more class from you Mirage.

Good bye forever.",2,1,2

We were able to get a good deal by calling the hotel and booking vs. booking online or through Expedia.  When we arrived at the hotel, it was pretty late but we still had our room!  We told front desk we were in town celebrating a few birthdays and they were nice enough to give us a free upgrade!

The upgrade gave us a great view of the strip.  And, we were able to see the famous Volcanoes of the Mirage erupt a few times!  The hotel was pretty easy to navigate.  Unlike some of the other ones where you get lost and don't know where you're going.  The walk from the garage to the front desk to our rooms wasn't too far.

The room we had was pretty spacious, and new.  This is a pretty old hotel, but it didn't seem like it from inside the hotel room.  There were nice flat screen TVs, an iPhone Dock, new panels and drawers, nice mirrors in the bathroom.  There wasn't too much of a cigarette smoking issue in the casino, and we didn't smell it from where we were.  However, we were on the 22nd floor.

The beds were nice, but a little lumpy.  They were soft but you kind of also fell in.. in the middle.  The sheets were nice and clean, and soft.  I liked staying at the Mirage because of its location.  You're almost in the middle of everything.  If I were to go to Las Vegas again, I would not have a problem staying here!

This is definitely NOT the Wynn but, perhaps because of having been owned by Mr. Wynn in the past, The Mirage still packs a nice atmosphere into a reasonable price. 

The lobby here is very cool with the huge fish tank and tropical garden; it is almost reminiscent of The Polynesian at Disney except without the Disney-esque fakeness. The rooms are tastefully decorated with mid-range contemporary furniture (better than Ikea but not as nice as Bo Concept) however the bathrooms (although nice, with marble and granite) are rather small and lack a separate soaking tub. Also, there is no coffee machine in the room and when paying a $20\/night resort fee they could at least give us the cheap hotel-room coffee for when we need to nurse a Vegas hangover. The beds were EXTREMELY comfortable though. 

The casino here is pretty lively but there are not many 5c and 25c slots...$1 slots rule here which is fine for a while but once you've lost a couple of hundred dollars at the tables it is nice to relax at a nickel machine for a bit. 

The palm lined swimming pool with waterfalls and tropical flora is a great feature of The Mirage. It is a wonderful place to relax on a hot Vegas afternoon before a night of eating and gambling. 

The buffet here surprised me. The night before we ate at the Wynn's buffet which is always fantastic so I had low expectations for Cravings at the Mirage, however I was mistaken. The food selection was excellent and everything was super fresh. One of the better buffets I have eaten at in Las Vegas, though the desserts here were just so-so (especially compared to the Wynn). 

I would stay at The Mirage again if I got a great deal however I don't yearn for it the way I do other hotels. The location on the strip is great though and all in all it was a good experience for a good price.",1,0,0

All of this should of been handled right away at Mirage when the incompetent bellman made the mistakes.

The Mirage is definitely in one of the best spots on the strip! The placement makes it easy to get to other casinos and clubs.  

The rooms in the Mirage are really clean and beautiful.  They did major renovations on all of the rooms a few years ago and totally revamped the casino.  Every room is decked out with marble bathrooms, wi-fi, flatscreen tv's, huge views of the strip, fresh accommodating beds, robes,  mini-fridges, and iHome's so that you can blast your own music!  They constantly have promotional deals going on, and the last time I went we got a deluxe suite for $110 a night.  

The casino is relatively smoke free and the craps tables are great too.  I have no complaints about the casino although I could have asked for more waitresses on the floor, they don't come around as often as waitresses at the Wynn or the Venetian.

I'll finish with the most impressive part of the Mirage.  THE POOL.  The pool is off the hook!

I know it doesn't sound like it, but this is a compliment. These girls wouldn't let the MGM Grand hang out with them, and certainly not Treasure Island. But they like the Mirage and invite her to all the cool parties because she's fun and witty in a way they'll never be, but still totally non-threatening because she's an eight and they're totally tens.

In fact, what's weird about the Mirage is that she's kind of cool for NOT being the super-hot popular chick. She doesn't drive daddy's BMW Series 3 or wear Manolo Blahniks. She's classy, she's approachable. Nice to the lesser girls and secretly smart -- she's going to Cal Tech this fall on a full scholarship and she doesn't even talk about it. She's athletic instead of bulimic, she can play the trombone, and she once hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. And what are those other girls doing? Indoor tanning to death and getting hammered on wine coolers. They're overpriced, all bling and no substance. The Mirage is easy going and can hang with the boys. In fact, she's coming over today to watch the Super Bowl, she's got money on the Ravens and she's not going to spend the whole time asking what's a two-point conversion and standing in front of the TV while hoovering Diet Sprite and vodka.

To be honest, this place really is the best value for your money. Spent a few nights here for 80bux a night and was very satisfied.

To make it short and sweet for you, here are the pros and cons:

PROS:
+ Across the street from Venetian & Palazzo, next to Caesar Palace (Forum Shops!) & Fashion Show Mall
+ Rooms JUST renovated, and come equipped with the following: iPod mount, hair dryer, cable flat screen tv, robes, iron\/board
+ Has two coffee shops located at each end of the hotel
+ Shuttle in back of hotel entrance to Treasure Island 
+ Tram in front of valet entrance to Treasure Island
+ Discounted LOVE Cirque Du Soleil & Mystere Cirque Du Soleil if you are a guest here (buy one ticket, get one FREE of which is a great deal!)

CONS:
- Rooms do not have coffee machine which is quite odd
- Room Bathroom amenities are barebone (only shampoo\/conditioner, bar of soap)
- The white tigers are no longer free to watch by the large glass window, you now have to walk to the pool area and enter a small ""park section"" and pay an admission of $15 to see the white tigers, this was such a pisser
- DO NOT DINE HERE! Unless you want to eat at California Pizza Kitchen, the buffet is below average and the restaurants have mediocre food with expensive prices.

No hello, no smile, and she wouldn't even answer my questions! I asked her how I transfer my Hyatt diamond status to MLife Platinum and she shrugged her shoulders! Head down like she was pissed off at the world. Unhelpful is putting it mildly.

Additionally, even though I told her I was there for a major event (for which I was apparently supposed to receive a special packet from the front desk), she didn't offer it, nor mention it to me. It was almost too late when I finally found out I needed the packet - two minutes before the event!! If I wasn't in such a good mood that day, she would have set a negative tone for my entire trip! As one of the first people to greet you when you enter the hotel, I would recommend Mirage either get rid of her or put her in a non-customer-facing job. This chick is miserable, and that is being kind.

I was dreading having to have to talk to her a second time, when I returned to the desk and she was open for the person next in line. It had only been about 5 minutes since she checked me in, and she looked straight at me, without any discernible amount of personality and asked, ""Checking in or checking out."" I replied, ""You just checked me in. My room -"" She interrupted, ""What can I help you with?""

As I was saying... my room was unbearably smoky and I wanted to be moved to a non-smoking room per my reservation. She didn't say anything to me... just typed away, looking down, making annoyed sighs every time I spoke. I told her I had called from the room and the person who answered said they'd take the resort fee of my bill. She gave me a blank stare and said, ""It's taken care of... next!"" and handed me new room keys. Zero emotional inflection whatsoever during both of our interactions. 

The second room was clean and didn't have that smoky smell. The bellman, Tom, was extremely kind and helpful. I told him of my front desk experience and he seemed almost personally bothered. His empathy made me feel much better and led me to believe this was probably an issue with the person and not necessarily the hotel management of the staff... Tom got a big tip.

At night, although signs were posted to the contrary, there was no security at the elevators during the Saturday through Monday of my stay. I thought that to be a bit strange, since every other hotel I've stayed at on the strip checks your room key after a certain late night hour - certainly by midnight.

There are a plethora of things to do, see, and indulge in within the Mirage; rainforest, dining options (Heritage Steak was fabulous), Secret Garden, casino, dolphin habitat, 1OAK, Aces of Comedy, Terry Fator... there's something for everyone, and MLife gives you great discounts! 

I finally found out, on my own accord, that MLife platinum status is automatic with diamond Hyatt status, but you have to go to the MLife counter to receive your status upgrade and new card. I recommend doing this before checking in, so you can get the room perks that I missed out on.

The monorail is across the street, behind Harrah's. It's about a half-mile walk through the Harrah's casino and out the back side to the monorail station. This is my main mode of travel up and down the strip when visiting Vegas, as it goes south to MGM and north to SLS. So easy!

I'm not sure whether I'd stay at the Mirage again. There are so many other options on the strip, begging for my business, with front desk agents who are elated to greet you and take great pride in their jobs!",37,26,28

Big whoopee, you cannot say, no thank you, it is annoying, why not just slap it on the room rate and be done with it? Despite that, our rate was amazing value and we expected a little room overlooking the parking garage. But no, we had a large room facing the strip and the volcano! The rooms have been refurbished and are airy and stylish whilst feeling comfortable, we were impressed. The bathroom was a little cramped but the free toiletries are lovely and the towels and robes were fluffy and soft.

When choosing a Vegas hotel, my two main selection criteria are location and pool; mirage receives 5 stars for both. 

The moment you walk into the hotel you are greeted by a total tropical, lush ambiance with large palm trees, flower gardens, waterfalls and a check in desk that is back dropped by a tropical fish aquarium. 

The casino floor itself is a little dated and in definite need of a face lift; however, not to the point where it detracted from the overall atmosphere. 

The rooms were recently renovated; it has probably the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on. Alot of yelpers were complaining about the small size of the bathroom's; I found it to be more than adequate. 

Wide variety of food selections. We ate the BLT, Carnegie deli and their buffet (amazing)...all were affordable and tasty eats. 

The location is probably the most appealing quality of the mirage; dead center of the strip, right across from the venetian and in between ceasars palace and treasure island...perfect for trekking the strip. There is a tram across the street if you get lazy or if you want to travel to the tail ends of the strip i.e. go north to the stratosphere of south to Mandalay bay. 

Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Vegas for any reason -- you get the best of all worlds without breaking the bank.",2,0,0

The white tiger exhibit is a rip off, so don't go.  I didn't go, but my sister went because my niece wanted to go see.  The tigers weren't even that white she said and they were sleeping.  Seriously, for $20, it's not worth it.  Should've been free for hotel guests.",0,1,1

Bachelorette said check in line took FOREVER and the second room on her reservation took hours to get ready. I don't get it, I know the hotel is massive but when check in is at 11, it highlights the staff's inefficiencies when you have to wait until 4 for your room to actually be ready.

Great location- chipotle and McDonald's are across Las Vegas boulevard. That is great because sometimes you just want a quick lunch that's cheap. The McDonalds I think is open 24 hours so you drunkos keep that in mind lol.

 The pool was pretty, and VERY calm. This is a great pool for kids!

I book for 2 nights while letting the vip marketing agent know that I usually arrive in the early morning so i book the night before to make sure I have a room upon check in.  Low and behold, i arrive in the morning and the room that i book for the night before was booked out and no rooms are clean.  The front desk attendant says they missed the notes and that i had to wait appx 4 more hours to get my room ready.

We were waiting in the lobby with no room until 4:30pm) so I thought ""okay cool! I can let it slide and enjoy my weekend"" .. Lol I was wrong! 

2. What threw me over the edge most was when I went to use my credit, they told me it was ran up. So I was transferred to the front desk, where they told me I had about 12 different items from the mini bar, which added up to around $100. The credit was ran up then the rest put on my debit card. Apparently, the mini bar is censored, which they failed to tell us. 
Okay, this can be fixed easily right? WRONG. They fought me on sending up a manager to check the mini bar until the morning.  In the end, I never got my credit back. I was told that i would be refunded my money back to my debit card, so I came back home and received my receipt via email, the charges from the mini bar are still on my card. REALLY? 

3. Then, I spent $2,300 on a suite in January with floor to ceiling windows. But the pictures of the love\/Beatles show covered them!! You couldn't event see out of them!!

I called several times and they couldn't fix, speed test was .08 Mbps. Finally they moved me to a so called ""Internet Room"" which supposedly had a router in it. It worked in the new room but was still very slow, speed test was about .4 Mbps. Barely passable to do basic web browsing.

We stayed at the Mirage on a Thursday night. We opted to check in online and use the self-check in kiosk but due to our late arrival (after 10pm) the kiosks were closed. Not to worry, we were assisted at the front desk with no wait. 

Our room was located on the back of Las Vegas Boulevard so no view except the freeway and rooftop of another building. Overall, the room was very spacious and clean. It had all the conveniences of a standard 3+ star hotel room. Very comfortable bed and pillows, minibar, black out curtains and a large closet space. The cons was that my room was missing a safe. Also we were placed in an accessible room with a poorly designed bathroom. Once I took a shower the entire bathroom floor was wet. There is no partition between the shower\/toilet\/sink, which caused me to slip and I almost took a TUMBLE (thumbs down!). The drain is level to the floor and simply does not let enough water drain quick enough. Poor design. I had to lay down as many towels as possible on the floor just so that I could safely tip toe around in the bathroom. This is really silly considering that this is to accommodate someone who is disabled and could easily slip and fall. The lighting was also very dim in the bathroom. 

In terms of parking, the charge is $12 per 24 hour period. Your license plate is printed on your actual ticket. This fee is only waived if you are a high level M Life Member. If you are staying here, I highly recommend you sign up for M Life Rewards.

Overall, I wouldn't mind staying here again because of the convenience of where it is located on the strip. I would just request a non accessible room due to the slipping liability.",0,0,0

I came here on a whim for a buddies spur-of-the-moment wedding. I'm not here to discuss the legitimacy or ingenuity of a shotgun wedding, he's an idiot and we fully own that... regardless, the costumer service experience was appalling. 

We came and got two rooms. Upon coming back to the room, my keys didn't work. I will fully admit that I was way too drunk. My fault, but I wasn't here to get lectured about my addictions or poor lifestyle decisions. It's Vegas, are you kidding me?! 

So I get to my room, my key doesn't work , and I'm way too drunk to walk down. I sleep on my front door. I'm okay at this point, I assume it's a technical error and I can let that slide. Shit happens. 

Security finally stops by and let's me in. They te me I can call front desk to have keys delivered. Cool. The security was cool, and he did what he could. 

But when I call front desk, and ask for more keys... explaining I'm too drunk to walk down... you know what the lady tells me? 

""Sounds like a personal problem. ""

It's a personal problem that the keys you assigned don't work? Is it a personal problem when I pay for the room? Or only when I can't get into it?

We couldn't figure out if the lamp shade in the room was dirty or if it had a weird design on it. It kind of looked like someone spilled coffee on it. But it was a minor thing. The lobby and casino almost always seemed to be really crowded. Trying to get to your room from the self-parking garage at night was challenging at times. But what I really liked about this place was the friendliness of the employees at the table games. I am new to gambling and the dealers at the roulette table I went to were really friendly and helpful about answering my questions. The blackjack dealer I had tried to help us out and was nice to talk to. We were able to find $5 minimum tables here, though it was during the week so it would probably be different on a weekend or holiday.

Well situated on the Strip, fabulous tropical atrium, insane buffet, friendly service, spacious rooms, and a fantastic pool area.  Okay, about the pool....

The Mirage has a beautfiul, large, refreshing pool with plenty of waterfalls.  Behind that large pool is ""Bare.""  It's an adult-only pool area that was incredibly fun for two gals looking for some Vegas indulgence (that would be myself and a friend).  You don't need to be bare to enjoy it, but you can go topless if you'd like.

 Bare charges a $10 admission fee, but we got free passes after making purchases at the Mirage swim shop.  They have super comfy lounge chairs and beds with thick, thick mattresses.  They have yummy cocktails, play great music, and change your towels whenever you get up to take a dip.  Now, the Bare pool is NOT refreshing.  It's totally warm (too warm) because it's tiny.  They also have a glass-enclosed jacuzzi area.  The bathroom is fantastic....it's clean, sleek, and offers all sorts of goodies like mouthwash, lotions, etc.  We had a great day sunning ourselves here!

To wrap up, let me just say I really loved almost everything about The Mirage.  The service was really friendly and we loved eating and drinking at their newest restaurant and lounge, Japonais.  My only complaint is that the rooms are not sound-proofed at all.  Mornings were a little rough with neighbors taking showers, making calls, etc.",0,0,0

There are so many things to love about the Mirage.  The entrance alone transports you to a tropical island.  It feels like a major standalone resort.  The atrium has such a peaceful feel to it, it lets you know you're on vacation.  

Check in can take a while so time your arrival to avoid long lines.  Early afternoon is usually best.  We're Gold mLife members so we get to bypass that main line which helps.  

The casino is very fun, and if I play smartly - I can usually win!  I can't say that for other casinos.  Now I say 'play smartly' because not every slot will pay off, and it's not consistent, but I've held my own on several trips.  They tend to have great machines and keep up with the new ones.  Dealers are always friendly and helpful.  Table min's are a little high, but unfortunately, the days of $2 blackjack are over.  

The rooms are great.  The hallways can be a bit long if you're at the end, but just request a room closer to the elevators.  They have an honor fridge, but not one for your personal use, although I'm sure you could request one.  Bed and pillows are super comfy (a huge plus for me).  

For shows, you can't beat LOVE, Terry Fader, and Boys II Men.  Great line up!  

Their buffet, Cravings, has been a favorite for years (see other review).  I try to go around 10:25ish when it's still breakfast and eat slowly as lunch gets set.  Self-serve drinks is a nice touch.  

Location is great.  Walk straight across the street to Harrah's or Venetian.  Next door is Caesars.  Use the side door by BURgr (I think that's the name) and it a quick hop which is important when it's 114 outside.  

Like all casino's, you have some hit and misses with people.  Some are great, others could use a little more polish and friendliness (people in the store Essentials come to mind), but overall this casino has become our Vegas home.",11,2,2

My girlfriends and I had an annual Vegas vacation and stayed here a few times, always leaving with smiles and great memories....not this time. My hubby didn't want to stay here to begin with and now we won't be back (one of my girlfriends also came with us and also had a poor experience). 

Highlights: LOVE by Cirque du Soleil, Private Reserve Pool (sort of), security staff and housekeeping friendliness

Opportunities: Check-in, rooms, restaurant options, casino, cleanliness

I had reserved a Mirage Suite a few months ago, checked in online the day before arriving and still had a terrible check-in experience. We planned to arrive after check-in time so we could go directly to our rooms. My friend got her email that her room was ready before we even got to the hotel. The check-in line was way too long so I was glad to have done online check-in but didn't have my email so went to mobile check-in desk. The guy at the desk didn't have a great attitude and proceeded to tell me that they only had accessible suites left and it would be ready within an hour. I told him that I didn't reserve or want an accessible room but he gave me no options and said I would receive an email within an hour. We went and waited for the email in The Still. 1.3 hours later I still had no email and went back to the desk where there was now a woman. I told her how displeased I was and asked about my room (I was not rude or loud or bitchy). She found a regular Mirage Suite that was immediately available and said she put a $50 beverage credit on my account. 

Upon entering room it was warm and dark. We turned down the temp but it took about two days to cool off to a comfortable point. I couldn't tell if the bathrooms were clean. Meaning, I didn't see obvious signs of uncleanliness, but it didn't feel clean. We did like that there was a fridge in the suite for us to keep food or drinks we purchased elsewhere and The separate sitting area is nice. The shower could be larger and the furniture could be in better shape. We did love the complimentary slippers.

My friend was in a regular room. She found hair in her bathtub when she was going to take a bath the first night. She also said it didn't feel super clean. She didn't have complimentary slippers.

Room Service is much more limited than it was last time we were here. A very limited portion of the Pantry menu is available. Some other restaurants offer takeout but you have to go down to order and take it. The restaurant options are very limited and pretty disappointing. Go take a look at my reviews of Stack, The Pantry, The Still, LVB and Carnegie Deli. The nicer restaurants are hidden away and not really advertiseso didn't entice us to try them.

The pool wasn't as clean as it used to be. But I still prefer the Private Reserve for the comfy chairs and umbrellas, along with random fruit and essence water. Waitress was friendly but was surprised that ""last call"" was just after 3. 

Casino was VERY DIRTY! The video machines were covered in ashes and sticky stuff. The chairs were burned up. The ceiling looked gross. It was super dark in there, probably so you couldn't see all the dirt and dinginess. I would suggest putting rolls of paper towels and windex around for guests to clean their machines. Several times I just gave up on the casino bc it grossed me out. 

Overall this is not what it used to be. We will be selecting a different resort when we return.",3,1,1

A note on my hotel selection: I selected the Mirage for my first trip to Vegas because I wanted 1) to stay someplace nice and classy 2) near my conference at the Venetian, but not as expensive as the Venetian or the Pallozzo, and 3) that wouldn't be positively crawling with kids. No offense meant to anyone of any age. This is why: if you've been to Disney World much, you know there is a different atmosphere between the All Star resorts and the Beach and Yacht Club. I'd heard Vegas was similar, so I opted to stay at the Mirage. Please note that I like kids just fine and that my conference was for educators... and we generally don't want to see kids over the summer. Lol! 

I ended up with a nice-sized corner room on the 5th floor of the Mirage and I loved it! I did have a discounted rate that made my stay more affordable, but I'd spring for it in a heartbeat even without the discounted rate, and even with the $30\/day amenities fee. The Mirage isn't the only one with that fee - apparently most or all of the major hotels do it. Annoying.

This is the hotel the Griswolds stayed at in Vegas Vacation. Yes, that did factor into my choice. Remember the long directions at the beginning? Well, I received a short set of directions: walk to the phone booth and then turn and walk straight back until you see the elevators. The path isn't straight and it splits, so I walked with some uncertainty, but I got to the elevators easily enough. 

As I had a corner room, my room was all the way a t the end of the hall. It was worth the commute. My room had an exceptional view. I had an extra-large (king) bed, a TV, and a little refrigerator. Home Alone references aside, I have only good things to say about the room, from the attractive toiletries to the light-up mirror vanity mirror on the bathroom wall. 

I ordered room service the first night because I didn't feel like going out but I did feel like eating in a fancy manner. I ordered a macaroni and cheese that was about $19. It was huge. I could have eaten just that for three meals. It tasted good, but I wouldn't order it again. There was a special - order an entrée and get a glass of house wine for $4. When I called to order, I planned on getting the white wine over the red, because I thought sweet wine would be difficult to get out of my MO wine country and I can tolerate dry whites better than dry reds. Imagine my surprise when I heard that the red wine was on the sweet side! It was pretty good. By the time my food and beverage came (about an hour after I ordered them), I was unwound to the point that I had to force myself to finish my meal. With the $4.50 room service fee, tax, and dip, my meal cost over $30. I was glad that they had been out of the Nutella ice cream I'd wanted to order - I wouldn't have had much appetite for it after the mac and cheese and it would have put my bill at over $40. Maybe that's not bad for Vegas, but I didn't order room service again. 

I gambled in two casinos while in Vegas, and I had better luck at the Mirage than at the MGM Grand. I thought the casinos would overwhelm me in terms of size, but the Mirage didn't. I went in a few other casinos and hotels during my 3 days and nights in Las Vegas and I have to say that the Mirage's décor is refreshing after seeing several hotels more ornately decorated and initially more impressive (Caesar's, The Venetian, the Palazzo, the Bellagio, etc.). Someone told me she thought the Mirage looked a little outdated from the outside, but she'd heard good things. The Mirage perhaps looks dated on the outside, but I wouldn't call it OUTdated at all. Photos will communicate this best. 

The pools in Las Vegas close at 6 or 7 p.m. At first I was bummed that I couldn't go for a dip my first night, but instead I just arrived at the pool shortly after its 8 a.m. opening. As I went in the morning, it wasn't super hot, so I mostly just sat by the side of the pool and tried not to get a sunburn. The pool is large and positively gorgeous, with rocks and waterfalls in a couple of places. Many chairs surround the pool. The hot tub is near the pool, but seems far away because you have to take a little walk to get there and it's surrounded by plants. The hot tub is pretty large, too. A kid did a little swimming in it. Okay, I followed suit. 

Check in and out were both easy and brief. I did check out at a kiosk. The only things that would have improved my stay were lower prices (perhaps waive the amenities fee every third night) and to have the pool open until 10 p.m. or so. But it's a different world in Vegas, and aside from loss of revenue gambling, I imagine the clientele might not be such good swimmers. Anywho, I wholeheartedly recommend the Mirage and would certainly stay there again. 

I will also be reviewing The Mirage's Pantry restaurant, Essentials store and Beatles LOVE show.

When it comes to gambling,  it's usually hard to tell if they are being fair, so you have to look at other things,  like how they treat their guests generally.   Here is an example of not just unfairness,  but downright fraud.   The Mirage has a restaurant and bar called The Still.  To draw you in,  they hand out discount cards to get you to come in but they don't honor them.  When you dispute it,  they threaten to call security.  The discount scam is a typical two for one drink card, which we took along with another couple who had them too. 

We ordered two beers and two mixed drinks.  They tried to charge us for both mixed drinks.  The so called

Months before the wedding we were given links for ""special wedding discount pricing"". We went online and we're quoted and then called and we're quoted. When calling we saved $400 dollars. 

We rented a car when we got to Vegas so we wouldn't have to take a cab with our 18 month old. We chose valet parking which was about $20 every time we pulled the car out.

Check in took about 30 minutes. We were on the 14th floor. When we got to our room the carpeted floors were filthy. They were not vacuumed at all and the bathroom was worn down and gross. We requested a crib which they brought up almost immediately. The crib was a travel size not a full size and there were no fitted crib sheets which we were told they offer. We were given a regular bed sheet to use for the crib and the bell hop walked out. 

We decided to go to Cravings buffet. It wasn't busy at all but there was a 20 minute wait to get in. It had separate sections like Asian, Latin, American, make your own omelette. Wine and beer were included in the price. The food was just ok. The best part of the buffet came about an hour after we ate. I became so sick I didn't think I would be able to leave the bathroom the whole trip. Don't go to Cravings. 

There is a place called Essentials that is a gift shop\/mini CVS where Pepto & ginger ale was able to be purchased. It also carries alcohol, snacks and other items. 

The Pantry is open 24 hours which was nice because the 3 hour time difference sucked for the kids. They were able to eat on their normal schedule, which was 4am Vegas time and our server was great. 

The casino wasn't bad, but it was super smoky. My lungs hurt after an hour of playing and drinking. One thing that irritated me was the smell of air freshener vs actually ventilating the smoke. Caesars Palace wasn't bad to walk through when we visited and it smelled fresh even though a ton of people were smoking. 

The pool was ok. It was really really cold even though it was in the 90s our entire stay. They offer towel service for free and have a shop outside so you can buy sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, bags and so on. 

The food & drink girls were nice and brought everything really fast. Please be aware that if you use a debit card to book your room you can not use it to room charge anything. All room charges must be done on a credit card. We also got a cabana for the day. Cabanas have TVs, fans, water, soda, snacks and a fruit tray in the fridge. Life jackets are available for kids at zero charge. 

Housekeeping was terrible. While they work 24\/7 and there were always 5-6 carts on the floor at any given time they never came to our room, and no, we didn't have the ""Do not disturb"" sign out. We had to either call for maid service or ask one of them directly. Pain in the ass when you have to dispose of diapers and need towels. 

Checkout process was ok. The TV checkout process was not working for anyone so we had to call which wasn't a big deal. 

Our floor was super loud and noisy. It would of been nice if family's stayed on certain floors because hearing people yelling ""Have you seen Mike Hunt"" and running up and down the halls banging on random doors made me want to kill them. This happened all 4 days & nights. It was never quiet.",3,1,1

A performer was injured at the end of the show they announced everyone would be refunded admission.  The Mirage reneged and sad it was a mistake.  They never posted on their website anything to tell you how the performer was.  While the accident happened at the end of the performance, it was a very bad way to leave the event.  Hard to watch someone carried off on a stretcher and feel good.  I wrote an email to the Mirage and they called back nearly a week later and said they would arrange for us to see the show another time.  That is rather odd since many of the people attending were probably like us and visiting Las Vegas.  Some times there are things that happen that show the true colors of a place.  The Mirage makes a mistake and then does not stand by what was announced.  For us that is a very sad statement about a place that makes a lot of money and will not honor what they say.  Sad comment on society and a reflection on a hotel and casino and in a way on Las Vegas.",0,0,0

The rooms were all the way down the hall which kind of sucked when we came stumbling back in the wee hours of the morning.  There was plenty of space, so we had lots of room to throw our stuff around.   The beds were nice and comfy with fluffy pillows.

The only complaint I have is with the a\/c unit.  It worked fine until we all went to sleep.  We think there was some motion sensor because it seemed like it shut off once everyone stopped moving.  We would wake up every now and then because it got so stuffy, and once we moved, the a\/c turned back on.

Location- great.  you're next to Caesars which has fantastic shopping and a block\/hotel away from the mall.  Across from Venetian and close to the Wynn.

Pool: nice. oh, and no more slide (definite downside).   a little hard to get seats but if you walk around you can.  The Cafe in the pool area is fantastic- service and foodwise.  They accommodated our large family (20 persians!) and were really great about getting all our orders correct.

Service: at restaurants, great.  Reception- meh.  I waited 20 minutes behind this stupid couple who asked 20 questions that should have been addressed to the concierge.  The woman didn't apologize, but she did give me a room on one of the higher up floors that was facing the pool.

Rooms: MODERN!  I love their remodeling updates.  Freakin' gorgeous and comfortable.  Downside- the doors you have to really shut (like hold the hand til you hear the click) and they're a bit thin... definitely heard some hanki panki two doors down.

Noise- overall no problems until there was a concert til 3 AM on Saturday night.  Typically no prob, but i was exhausted and needed to catch an early flight, so that was a bit annoying...

I had more fun the previous two nights at playing at Binion's and at Planet Hollywood.  Three nights of gambling and I broke even.  The problem at the Mirage appears to be burned out employees. There was a palpable level of disdain emanating from the craps table workers.  One employee bragged he'd worked there 10 years but to me, seemed to hate the customers and players.  These gentlemen should retrain and find new careers maybe?  Other tables at other casinos were joyous, the personnel helpful and positive. 
My cousins hung at the bar while we played.  My husband said the service was disdainful there.  We all tip well and have good jobs, so it isn't us.

The check in staff were ok. Not super friendly. It was memorial weekend and the line was long so I'm sure they just wanted to check people in super fast, but it made me feel like I was in a cattle drive or something. Funneling us all into the long line to quickly process us and send us to our room. Not very friendly and not the best first impression. 

The room was very old feeling. You can tell this is an older hotel with very few upgrades. Our bathroom looked like it had mold in some of the caulking around the shower (gross). And there was some of the wallpaper\/paint or something missing in the bathroom as well. There are stains on the floors in the bathroom as well. 

The windows were very dirty no don't know if they ever clean them. And it just felt like you were staying in an old best western or something. Not like a famous nice hotel in the Las Vegas strip! So that was disappointing. 

EVERYTHING costs extra! You want late check out? That costs extra. You want a refrigerator in your room? That costs extra. We were afraid to ask for extra pillows for fear they might charge us more! I guess that's just Vegas though. 

Drinks are super expensive (also just a Vegas thing I guess). Poolside pina colada with barely any booze will run you $16 a piece. The Starbucks in their lobby has definitely inflated their pricing! My usual $3.15 drink cost me $8- no joke! And it makes me mad that there aren't coffee pots in your room! Seriously! We are already spending enough you can't just give us one free cup of coffee?

We went to the concierge to ask for ideas on what to do in Vegas since we had never been. She was not friendly and not helpful. Of course she first suggested that we stay at The Mirage and hit up all the restaurants there. We said we were looking for a happy hour which she did not help us find. We found one on our own at the Bellagio (Check out Harvest! $7 drinks and bites to eat!). 
 
The nicest people at this hotel were the valet. So friendly and so fast. Always smiling and very helpful. So I liked them. 

Lastly, my friend booked her room through Hotwire and the room was on her credit card. We did not use anything from the minibar and brought a lot of our own snacks and booze. She checked out and everything looked good on her bill. The next day SHE GOT CHARGED $1200!!!! They tried to charge her for the the room AND a $126 minibar fee! Are you kidding me?! She called and finally got it all sorted out. 

TWO DAYS LATER THEY DID IT AGAIN! Ran her card for $700!! And then they even did it a freaking third time! SO WATCH OUT FOR THEM STEALING YOUR MONEY AND RUNNING YOUR CREDIT CARD WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION. 

The worst part to me is the headache she had to go through to get her money back. The Mirage was not helpful and not really apologetic for it. And she had to cancel her credit card once she finally got the money returned to it for fear that they might run her card again. CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS! MAKE SURE THIS DOESNT HAPPEN TO YOU.

The hotel has about 16 different eateries ranging from casual to fine dining, including restaurants like Heritage Steakhouse, California Pizza Kitchen, BLT Burger, Starbucks, and a buffet. But my absolute favorite part was the shows. They have the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil which has the only official Beatles store. Terry Fator as well has his own theater where he performs in, and it looks like they use that same theater for different comedian performances.

I will warn you that I'm not much of a gambler, so I can't really comment on how good the games are here, or whether they ripped me off and stole all my money. I'm one of those types who only pretends to play when the waitress comes around taking drink orders and throwing a dollar or so at her for bringing it back to me. Because to me, that's what Vegas is really about... getting wasted for free. That and walking around the sidewalk with countless number of alcoholic drinks in my hand. This town is awesome.

Our reservation for the piddly lowest suite was somehow upgraded to one of the nicer King suites for no extra charge... which might give me a slight bias in my high rating of the Mirage. This room was something else, I've got to admit - and this was before they had done all the remodeling, so I'm anxious to go back and see what the new stuff looks like. The bathroom area alone was bigger than my entire apartment in Los Angeles. And that see-thru shower with the tub facing it? Yeah... nice touch, somebody. You can actually see a video tour I did of our suite with my digicam if you're so inclined on YouTube. Scope it out at: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PV7Vkr2VT74 if you're interested.

Everything was totally on point and comfortable as hell. The only thing I would complain about would be getting lost in the casino... but that happens everywhere because all these damn places are so friggin' huge. Being drunk to the point of idiocy (just like most of the tourists my age) doesn't seem to help very much either.

So maybe the Mirage is getting an unfairly high rating from me from just having an overall awesome experience in Vegas. I didn't really interact with the staff, I didn't gamble in the casino, but the waitresses were on time with the drink delivery and quick, and the couch I ended up sleeping on was right up there with the most comfortable couches I've slept on. Way to go, Mirage!

Could there be better places to stay in Vegas? Yeah, I'm sure there are. But this wasn't a bad experience and with the free upgrade to the better suite, it was a value well worth our money (at least I think so). The Mirage has proven to me that Vegas is one hell of a kick-ass town. That's for damn sure, son.",0,1,1

I was here for 2 nights, a Sunday and Monday, with my mom and sister. We requested a non-smoking room but had concerns about the smell anyway, since smoking is still allowed in the casino. For $20\/night, we were able to upgrade to an ""executive"" room that wasn't a whole lot bigger than a standard, but definitely worth it. It was clean and smelled just fine (good in fact) and had a really nice bathroom with a walk in shower and jacuzzi bath tub.

The casino is a little meh. It seems oddly outdated and it's very, very smoky. Just walking through it, the smell of cigarette smoke is a little overpowering.

1.  This hotel smells fantastic.  I don't know what it is but wow.  Not the usual smoky stale smells.  Just a little humid near the water falls.  
2.  Beautiful hotel.  Loved the xmas décor.  Great job. 
3.  Convention center is huge.  Give yourself a good half hour to walk there from the front of the hotel. 
4.  I swear these were the cleanest nicest bathrooms I have seen so far in a public facility. 
5.  No food courts and a ton of lines with the places there were.  a lot of bars and places for adults but this is not a kids hotel. Thank god for the yogurt place that kept all the kids fed during the competition.",0,0,0

The rooms have recently been renovated and were very nice and new and comfortable.  The bathroom was a little small but the rest of the room was pretty big.  The beds were super comfortable.  I have two main complaints: the walls are very thin and you can hear a lot of noise from the hallway and everything that someone might be doing in the bathroom (note to self: always bring earplugs), and they messed up our comps so it took forever to check out and get it right.  They also charged us for something at the pool bar that we never had (we didn't even go to the pool bar) and the girl at the desk just could not figure out how to remove it and correct the bill.  It was so frustrating that we finally gave up.  But, everything else was good.  Everyone was friendly from the baggage service people to the players' club people to everyone in the restaurants.  There are a few popular lounges and clubs in the Mirage (Jet, Revolution) so expect to see lots of clubby people running around.  Also, the pool at the Mirage draws quite a crowd and it provides excellent people-watching as scantily-clad people are parading along the edges of the casino to get to the pool.

Every single time coming to and out of our hotel room was a long walk and the look of the hall make it even worse because it is all the same (visually make it seems like it was endless). Anyway, the stay here is nice. The staffs are very helpful. I like how the hotel was connected through Treasure Island with tram.

Another incident: I was waiting for my friend so I seated the branch outside of the bathroom beside the check-in area. I was tired, I closed my eyes for a bit and this lady that work there told me, ""you cannot sleep here!"" I was confused and I replied, ""huh? I was only resting my eyes."" So yes, they are not kidding, at a HOTEL, they do NOT want you to sleep, but if you drink, gamble, get all drunk and do all kind of things, that's fine. As long you don't sleep there. So I guess the staffs are nice, you just have to pick them well.

Also, at night when we get to our hotel room, the security guards there need to check your hotel room key card. Because we have other people in the room they told us we can go in to the hotel first with the key card and the other person can come back to the hotel later bypass the keycard check as long he is registered to the hotel room. We asked them twice to make sure that is the case. Later, when my friend attempted to go up, they won't let him go up!

The location of the Mirage is fantastic, they host LOVE which you can get a discount to if you stay with the hotel, which is fantastic, and the rooms are so comfortable, understated luxurious like I mentioned, and the new flat screen TVs are a great touch since everyone in Vegas seems to be getting in on that.

The Mirage, contrary to what I thought, was not old and run down at all. Perhaps it was because of the renovations they did, but either way it is way nicer than you think.

Pros:
-Resort fee includes cardio center (treadmills, elliptical machines, stair machines and bikes) and wifi
-Great location on the strip
-Good places to eat (Carnegie Delicatessen, BLT Burger, Japonais, kokomo's). Even the room service food is good and available 24-7 (Chicken Pesto Classic Casar Salad, Pizza).
-Rhumbar is a great outdoor bar to kick back at.
-Complimentary Valet Parking (don't forget to tip)
-Rooms and decor are great.

Cons:
-Room service charges $3 per person dining
-Restaurants are not cheap. Even to go orders can be about $15 per person. Maybe a food court of some sort would be great.
-Complete is gym access is $28 per day. That's a bit excessive.

I booked this hotel on MLK weekend, normally a disastrous time to do so but I was able to use a promo code to get a room, on a SATURDAY, at $69\/night.  That's pretty much otherwise impossible on the strip; all other places were around $150\/night, including Excalibur.  Resort fee was about $34 with taxes.

The resort is a little smoky.  The room itself was fine; I liked the furniture and the amenities.  Shower was a little dated.  Bathroom accessories were fine.  Bed was comfortable and had plenty of pillows.  Hotel distance wasn't horrible from the elevators (although dragging around a 30lb 4 ft cardboard box that I had to bring to a show tomorrow made it annoying).  

The casino itself I hate but that's mainly because I have never won, ever, playing at Mirage.  This trip was no different.

I'm docking a star because there's not really any good vegan options for my GF.  We ended up having to go elsewhere to get something for her.  

Would I stay here again?  It's not really the top of my list, but if I can get it at the price I paid (vs let's say other hotels being double the price), definitely.  If I had a choice between Mirage and a CityCenter hotel and the CityCenter spots were only about 25% higher, I'd still go to the CityCenter.",6,1,2

Rooms have a good layout, inexpensive due to getting 20% off on their specials on facebook.  The pool is really nice, but gets crowded on the weekends.  I hate the idea of having to pay $25 per chair to get to the other areas other than the main pool.  I should all be open, and then there would be enough chairs for most everyone to get sun.  Anyway, the beds were very comfy, rooms are nice, and we were high enough up to have a beautiful view of the strip.  Plenty of things to keep you busy here.  We also had our wedding reception here, and the staff was 5 stars all the way around.  Catering was unbelievable, reasonably priced, did everything that we asked for them.  The hotel does sneak in a $15 ""resort fee""charge, per day,  on top of your regular room price).  You have to pay this upon checkout.  The resort fee is basically a sneaky fee that you pay to use the small cardio gym, pool, and internet.  So people that think they are getting free internet because the hotel is nice, are wrong.  I guess knowing that I would be using the internet, I would rather have it like this than actually having an option to pay for it, because if I had a choice, I would not pay the $12-15 fee for it, and be p'od that I have to pay for it.  I know, it doesn't make sense, but I didn't say I was rational.  Valet parking was very quick in getting my car everytime.  The only downside that there wasn't much action in the poker room at the Mirage.

Pros:
Service, Service, Service.  Every staff member I interacted with (valet, bellman, maid, desk clerks), were friendly, courteous and seemed to enjoy their jobs.  WHAT?!  Management must treat their employees right!  (I noted that the bellman all did fist bumps as they passed one another).

Conveniently has a FedEx shop 
Had no problems with internet

The Mirage is centrally located, within walking distance to numerous properties: Caesars, Venetian\/Palazzo, Wynn\/Encore, TI, & Fashion Show Mall.

Hotel: spacious modern room with all the ammenities you could hope for. 42in LCD w\/ functional media plug ins, powered work area, fridge, & rear lit vanities. The only thing drawback I could see is there is no separate shower & tub. Although, their villas are probably the best Vegas has to offer... check them out they're unreal.

Casino: everything you need... even though Mirage is one of the first massive Vegas casinos they've stayed with the times and updated their gaming floor. Nothing seems too dated and they keep with the theme nicely.

On-site restaurants: BLT Burger - amazing sliders & shakes. Carnegie Deli - the Woody Allen is a MUST for any pastrami & corned beef fan. BB King Blues Cafe - great service, tasty food, and lively bands. CPK - it is what it is. Rhumbar - great drinks, service, and outdoor lounge. Fin - pricey but awesome Chinese food if you're too lazy to drive down Spring Mt. Road. Kokomo's - perfect for that romantic\/special ocassion. I still have yet to try Samba (Brazillian Steakhouse), Stack, & their Buffet but is on the to-do list.

Overall it's great value for all it has to offer: rooms, location, ammenities, and if you sign up to their mailing list you'll get offers almost too good to be true. When you check in be sure to ask for any available upgrades. They'll usually place you in a higher room or one with a view of the pool or volcano.",2,0,0

At the registration, we discovered that the room we were hoping to get were no longer available. We eventually got a room and once we got to the room the issues continued.

To start off the A\/C was off. Given that it was a 113 degree day, this made the room insufferable. I called to get our luggage so we could get some water to starve off the heat. However, the bell desk line was busy on multiple calls. I called he front desk to talk about these issues and was told that the AC being off was a feature and that all of their rooms had motion sensors that turned off the AC by itself if there wasn't any motion for 20 mins. She said other hotels were adopting this feature also. When I said that I stayed at the Venetian the previous night and that this feature wasn't present, the associate had no reply.

The room itself had issues. There was stains on a pillow and sheets. Given that these were white stains inside a Vegas hotel room, I'll let the reader use their imagination on what it could have been. The toilet was also a little annoying with the water splashing somewhat high when flushing.

We tried to get the car so we could make our dinner reservation, but the valet could not find the car because the valet person that parked the car did not enter a space number. The process took over 30 mins and I had to follow up with the valet multiple times to finally get the car.

We are staying here still until Tuesday and somewhat dreading what other annoyances Mirage has in store for us.",3,3,0

Every year for the past 8 or so years, my dad's company convention was held in Las Vegas and he'd take us with him.
We always stayed at the Mirage and over the years it had grown into a magnificent hotel & casino!

When I was young, I didn't pay much attention to the decorations or the things I could do as an underaged kid.
But this year, I realized a lot has changed, for the good.

We eat our breakfast every morning at the Caribe Cafe and it's always hearty.

We loved their Noodle Kitchen but apparently it closed :(

Their set-up for the Cirque Du Soleil show LOVE looks groovy and fun! It's colorful and very artsy. 

The way the new Revolution bar\/club looks really attractive however, i didn't get to go inside because I was underage :(

The other restaurants here like Craving Buffet, Fin, Japonais, BLT burger, California Pizza Kitchen, etc. are also yummy!

The Craving buffet serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
For dinner it cost us $24.95 each, i think. However, they label their sections to the types of food they have, like: Chinese, Seafood, Italian, Salads, Roast meat, Latin, etc.

If you're going to Las Vegas with underaged people, this place is great! It's also close to the major shopping places and hotels on the strip!",1,0,0

Went to Beatles Revolution\/Love show.... AMAZING!!!  Nobody can stop talking about it even 2 months after the fact!

The Revolution Lounge was also a frequent meet-up location. 

The Spa was great, too... trust me you need a daily spa treatment when you're on Vegas time!  Gym\/Sauna\/Spa.... are a must to keep up with the pace.

In general I like staying @ the Mirage because of it's location, It's in the middle of the Strip so basically it's walking distance to alot of the hotel like Caesar's, Treasure Island, Venetian, Palazzo etc. although the Mirage is a good sized hotel, you could easily navigate through it and not get lost. The gambling area is big and spacious and the sportsbook area is also big (one of the biggest... I think), the pool is one of the nicest that I've seen so far. The room rates here are reasonable compared to the other hotels on the strip and the restaurants in the hotel areok.

I am very happy I got too stay there. We had a great room on like the 20th floor. Our beds were awesome and our view was looking directly at The Venetian and Harrahs. The windows open up here but DONT drink too much and start yelling out the windows because you will have 5 huge security guards break into your room, like we did. No biggy I thought it was funny and it gave me a great story to tell.

Now we really enjoyed the pool. My daughter was pool crazy so we spent a lot of time down there and I even got in once or twice. The temp of the pool was perfect so I was very happy. The only bad thing that happen at the pool was it was very windy.

My friend and I spent a lot of time downstairs every evening on the slot machines and I even won. I was playing on a penny machine and was on my very last spin and ended up winning something like 229 dollars. I cashed out and left happy.

As a child, this was the closest I thought I was going to get to tropical vacation. Luckily, that last part hasn't been true, but Mirage still has a romantic hold on me. Like most hotels on the strip, its huge, but I think manageable. Getting to our room from the main door took less than 10 min, which was a big plus after a night on the town and aching feet. One of my favorite things about this place is the massive aquarium filled with tropical fish that they have behind the check in counter. It made standing on line (which wasn't that long) very entertaining. Keep an eye out for the eel! You don't see it often, but when you do, it's quite a treat. Our room was spacious, clean and had some of the most comfortable beds I've ever been in. We were cold our first night there and we asked them to bring us an extra blanket. I swear this blanket must have been made by blind monks on a mountain sanctuary with wool from Alpacas that are fed rainbows and happy thoughts. It was THAT comfy. The beds were memory foam, so no contest there. 

Overall, I love the laid back easy vibe of this place and the little garden in the lobby. When I came here back in the day, the white tigers were in an enclosure that was open to public view. It's sad that now, we have to pay for it. One problem I have with Mirage is that it didn't have a food court. There were no options for a quick cheap bite, so we walked over to the Venetian for many of our meals. The other problem was that the WIFI was horrendous. It was hard to spend a day in bed streaming movies if we had to pause to buffer all the time. Otherwise, I had a very pleasant stay.",3,2,3

One of the rooms had this ugly, orange, rectangular, long shaped, raggedy pillow.  Our room had burgundy purple one.  They end up on the floor and then they put it on a clean bed.  Go figure.  The room was clean.  We were told not to use the refrigerator in the room because the refrigerator's items are on weights.  That is how they charge items you take or remove to your hotel bill.  How strange to put a box of cards inside the refrigerator.  Another strange thing is that every day, the stocking of supplies weren't complete.  It's like what is missing today?  The first day, there was an empty facial tissue box.  Second day, no hand towels and no body cream and no glasses for drinking.  One wonderful thing is that they have Chinese Jade Channel.  That is very cool to cater to the Chinese crowd.  You add $10 or something like that to get the room facing the Volcano.  Whatever!  The Long corridors makes for good exercise.  The rooms were sound proof, didn't have to hear loud crazy noises.  If you like sinking beds, these would be your favorite.  Maybe it is because it's a down bed.  On the second day, I finally figured out how to adjust the temperature, which was about time.  First night was freezing!  You can actually hike it up to refrigerator temperature.  At night, they have security guards standing next to the elevators to see door passes before letting people go beyond.  I just wonder, let's say, I didn't turn in my key card, and use it to bypass security.  How do you tell who is current guests and past guests?  Yes, the other nice thing is that Mirage is centrally located.  I have to give the shout out to the wonderful valet people.  They were fast and courteous.

My first trip here was Christmas 2009 (2 Queen Volcano View) and I've had two subsequent trips back (Feb: 1 King Tower Deluxe and April: 2 Queen Strip View) and I've already got another booked for November.

The BEDS here are pure HEAVEN! The linens are soft and the mattresses just sort of hold you and make you feel relaxed and soothed. They are available for purchase in one of the stores on the ground floor, but I've never checked out their price.

The location is perfect. You're immediately across the street from Ceasar's, Harrah's Venetian\/Palazzo and connected by a tram to the TI. It is far enough up the strip that the cabbies at McCarran will most likely try and ""tunnel"" you -- they will claim it's faster but it is racking up your total fare and making their profit margin look better. Insist on being taken up Swenson. 

Inside the casino are some pretty great places to eat. My personal favorite is BLT Burger. I haven't tried any of their fancier places, but the food always looks amazing as you walk by some of the places that have seating near the casino floor. I, personally, was not a fan of their buffet, Cravings, but I seem to be the odd-man-out in the group of people I went with as I know everyone else enjoyed it, and it is often rated #1 or #2 in Vegas.

Check-in and Check-out have always been smooth. Never an issue, upgraded two out of three times without having to ask. (And keeping my fingers crossed for an amazing Suite upgrade in the future. It has to happen eventually, right?!?)

The hallways can be loud with the sounds of shutting\/opening doors and the occassional drunk, but I've found that the crowd here tends to be 30-somethings and older so the noise doesn't last all night like it does at NYNY or the Luxor. Bring some ear plugs if you're a light sleeper who likes to complain. 

Sign up for the MGM Player's Club, too. The rates you start to get after just one trip of light gambling (I think I 've lost like maybe $100 per trip) will get you some amazing offers.

Cocktail service has been very good on recent trips.

We have enjoyed visiting the dolphin habitat\/secret garden several times.  The cost is $15 to enter the exhibit, which really isn't too bad considering you're paying Vegas prices.  The dolphins are entertaining to watch, but the large cats are usually asleep and mostly out of view during the daytime.

I first saw the volcano ""explosion"" the year the Mirage opened in the early 90's.  It was exciting to watch then, and I always look forward to everytime we come to town.  It was out of operation for renovations when we were there in July and October this year.  I hear it's back in operation again, new and improved.  Looking forward to seeing the new version in 2009.  

I would like to stay in one of the remodeled rooms next year.  That may become a reality because of the very reasonable room rates offered online these days.  We'll see.",0,0,0

1) Beatriz was the hotel clerk that checked me and my party in and she was extremely sweet, reliable, and made me feel so comfortable! She is the absolutely best! Management, if you see this, please give her a raise because she is a true asset to your company!

2) The room that was given to us was right next to the elevators, and Ice Machine, which made the stay so much more convenient. On top of that, we had a beautiful view of the Las Vegas strip. 

3) Hotel room was clean upon arrival and the AC implanted on the wall is an absolutely miracle. 

4) Pool is awesome! Mind you, we went last week when Vegas hit the all time high 117 degree weather. We still went to the mirage pool, and it has so many shady spots, we didn't get burned. 

5) Location is the true amenity! Honestly, if you want higher end food go to Cesars next door, or if you're a cheapy like me cross the street and theres mc donalds, panda expressm chipotle etc. A walgreens is right across the street too, which is so convenient!

So my wife and I had just walked in from the heat (9pm) and she wanted a drink before bedtime.  We plop down and I see our waitress talking with other customers before coming over to us. The bar isn't too busy at this time.  Her name is Maryan and the first thing you notice is her incredible mane.  She has this voluminous head of dark black hair that is quite striking.  She is also wearing the standard referee uniform.  

We ordered our drinks and when she returned we start talking to her and she has this wonderful and engaging personality.  Before we know it, she is telling us about her Italian heritage (mine is as well), her grandfather and his bakery and the way she was raised in an Italian mafioso-type family in New York.  I'm basically mesmerized by her story and childhood experiences.  It's like listening to a story about the Sopranos.

We finished our drinks and before departing she gives my wife a hug and a smile.

Now this is the way to treat customers, like they are family.

Although the Muse concert (04.10.10) was at Mandalay Bay, we decided to stay at The Mirage. One of the great things about The Mirage is its central location on the LV strip. It really is within walking distance of where most folks want to go.

As the room was under my friend's name, she had to check in. Unfortunately, the $20 trick didn't work. We were told that it was a busy weekend so they weren't able to offer any upgrades. I think it's because we checked in on the later side on Saturday. It was almost 5:00pm so they may have given out everything. We probably would have had better luck if it was a Friday - who knows. I do not recall the exact room rate, but I believe it was quite competitive given that we booked the room only days before.

For a relatively older hotel, I was impressed at how nice the standard deluxe rooms were - quite spacious and modern with two queen beds and a 40"" or 42"" wall mounted LCD TV. There are several ports (USB, HDMI. S-Video, etc.) near the desk if you want to connect something to the TV. On the dresser between the beds there is also an iPod alarm clock. The bathroom is a bit on the small side and I didn't find the water pressure in the shower to be great. That said, it was manageable.

""Free"" wifi is available, in the rooms at least - you just need to enter the last name of the reservation and the room number. I tested it to about 3mbps download - not terrible. You really are paying for it in a room fee, but you also get two bottles of water each day.

The only negative was that a hotel worker came around knocking on doors at 9am on a Sunday for ""room checks"". I'm still not exactly sure what that was all about, but it woke us up. Maybe it's our fault for not putting up the DND sign.

Overall, The Mirage rooms exceeded my expectations. I'd definitely stay here again - hopefully with $20 trick success.",1,1,1

I Booked a resort king room for one night. We arrived and asked for an upgrade. Paid $100 to be upgraded from a resort king to a one bedroom penthouse suite. The room was beautiful until we started discovering that everything was broken. First the jet tub wouldn't work the water wouldn't fill up because the plug was broken. Most of the lights in the room didn't work and needed to be changed. We had a humongous crack in our window that we were scared to even touch incase it wanted to give out. The remote for the tv wasn't working so I had to use the remote for the living room tv. As soon as we came to our room we had 4 house keeping women not only knock but actually opened the door and walked in which was horrible. KEEP IN MIND WE HAD THE DO NOT DISTURB SIGN ON OUT DOOR KNOB INCLUDING THE PRIVACY BUTTON ON!!

Luckily, as soon as the dates were released for the festival, I immediately turned to the discounted room deals through Insomniac. From the price to the accommodations, and everything in between, I couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay at for our party filled weekend.
As we arrived, I loved that the awesome girl checking us in was super sweet and actually excited for guests to be going to EDC. After chatting it up with her about the weekend, she was kind enough to upgrade us to a pimp status room overlooking the volcano show right on the strip at no additional cost. 
The entire hotel was taken over by the fellow masses attending EDC, so noise complaints weren't even in existence, because every floor had some type of party music bumping until the wee hours of the morning. Also, every floor was 420 friendly and even the staff wasn't tripping, because they had their massive industrial size air fresheners going. A couple things that did take a star away from a near-perfect experience include: the hallways leading to the rooms being ridiculously cold and you have to call ahead to get your room serviced. 
Overall, this hotel is definitely a great place to call home when you're staying in Vegas. Not only would I stay here again for EDC, but definitely when I return to the City of Sin.",1,2,1

The rooms have undergone a terrific remodeling job. Like most hotels that have remodeled, they've ditched the themed rooms in favor of a basic modern motif. However, I actually liked the retro-modern redesign of the rooms, which now boast plush mattresses, a flat screen TV, and dark woods with accents of colors like pink and orange. Now to the bad news. The bathrooms, while remodeled with nice granite counters and tile accents around the mirror, are still tiny. Fine for a solo traveler, but not ideal for a couple or family. And here's the deal breaker for me, as a light sleeper. You can hear EVERYTHING from these rooms. Every door that closes, every word uttered in the hallway, the maids knocking on doors and saying ""Room keeping,"" the halls being vacuumed. It's a light sleeper's worst nightmare.

Be warned though, on top of your cost to stay, there is a daily resort ""fee"" of almost $40 a day.

But the wifi sucks, I barely was able to use it, very spotty, and every time I wanted to surf the net, I had to 'agree' to the terms and conditions, and then I got dropped several times during use.  I totally understand that they really don't want you hanging out in the room, they want you on the casino floor,  but it would have been nice to be able to check my email and such.  Also, there are no extras in the room, no coffee maker, microwave or any refrigerator access, if you want a refrigerator, there is an additional fee.  I was hoping for a small coffee maker, but again, they don't want you in your room, they want you gambling.  Also, be aware, prices for everything are outrageous.  I'm from NY, so I am used to high prices, but this was ridiculous.  A bottle of Fiji water was $5.50 for the smaller bottle, so be warned that nothing is cheap in Vegas.

I would have given it 3 and half stars too.  It is not a super luxurious hotel but it is far from being considered a roach motel.  

I went with The Mirage for a weekend getaway Vegas trip for my boyfriend's birthday because of its location.  The Mirage was a good choice just because the rooms are clean, spacious and modern.  Note: The room was great, I will get to the bathroom later.  It was also very conveniently located, right between Treasure Island, which I also have stayed at before.  I would choose Mirage over Treasure Island.  Treasure Island rooms are small and their wifi sucks.  It is also located next to Caesars Palace and across the street from Harrahs, Imperial Palace, Venetian\/Palazzo and a short walk away from Encore\/Wynn.  

Parking was fine, as with most Vegas hotels they had their own lot.  They had both a self park and valet option.  Check in was easy too, we had a little problem finding the guest elevators.  Those were a little confusing.

I did not get the chance to see the dolphin habitat.  To tell you the truth I did not spend much time inside The Mirage casino.  Nothing about it really stands out, so the only time my boyfriend and I were in the casino area was because we were usually leaving the casino to go somewhere else.  To me, there really did not seem like there was a lot to do.  It was not the most aesthetically pleasing hotel, by that I mean they did not have canals like The Venetian, the whole Parisian streets thing like Paris or the Miracle Mile like Planet Hollywood, they had a volcano that was outside and the Dolphin habitat.  

The rooms are a good value for what you pay.  They are roomy and modern looking.  They had a nice multimedia center that had a desk, a wall mounted flat screen television with good channels and a snack bar\/mini fridge.  The bed is fairly comfy, no complaints there and it was clean with no odd stains or anything like that.  See attached pictures of the room.  

Forewarning: The mini fridge and snack bar have sensors on them so if you remove anything they will charge you.  That means you cannot take things out of the fridge to put your things in there and then put the stuff back afterwards.  They will charge you if you take things from the fridge even if you do not eat it.  

I think the one thing that needed renovating in the room was the bathrooms.  The condition of the bathrooms really did not match how nice and modern looking the room was.  The bathroom looked like it had not been touched up\/remodeled since the 90's.  Very small, horrible lighting, white tub, shower curtain, white toilet, the usual hairdryer given, it was just not appealing to the eye at all.  

Despite that though, I would stay at The Mirage again.  The rooms are nice and the location is very convenient and no one was throwing wild parties in their room and disrupting my sleep.  Although according to many, it is not a proper Vegas trip if you are sleeping through most of it.",8,1,1

What was not fine was the charge on my debit card a MONTH after I left for someone else's services at the Mirage Spa.  How did they get my number?  Oh, when you go there for services they keep your debit card information on file permanently.  Does this not make sense to anyone else???Did they correct it? Yes.  Did it take five days to be placed back in my account? Yes.  Did they blame that on my bank? Yes.  Well guess what, my bank wouldn't have held your refund if you didn't have my card information on file at your spa without telling me.  

Am I the only one who thinks it's completely screwed up to keep your guests card information on file at the SPA???  You should tell your customers if you do that, and offer them an option to opt out.  What am I going to do- go crazy and trash your salon?  Why do you need to hold cards of people at a location where the majority of people visit maybe once a year?    

I stayed here my first trip to Vegas 12 years ago and have good memories, but I won't stay here again based on the fact that you do this and don't tell people, that your manager avoided my call for half the day, and that your accounting department processed then refunded my transaction instead of cancelling it like I requested when there was still time to process it as a void and cancel it.  

So yeah, maybe Vegas doesn't need customer service to get business, but if it keeps me and everyone I know from staying there, or losing a dime there, I've done something right.

They give guests discounts for the Secret Garden which was a nice bonus. We had a great view of the pools where we could watch the dolphins swimming in the mornings which is a fantastic way to wake up!

Why only three stars?   The hotel's public area\/casino feels very dated (full disclosure, we do not gamble).

They seem to use some type of air freshener to mask the cigarette smoke and whatever chemicals they use in the lobby's water features; it results in a very strange odor similar to a taxicab with one of those Little Trees car deodorizers.

There seems to be a good offering of restaurants, but the ambiance of  the casino area\/lobby just feels down market.

Also, the location is great! It's close to the Encore, Wynn, Caesars Palace, and a bunch of restaurants. There are chipotle, McDonald's, etc. across the street. 

However, parking with valet is $20 per day and $16 per day for self parking regardless if you are a suite guest or not. This was disappointing because other hotels will grant you free parking passes if you are a suite guest (e.g. MGM towers). 

I don't understand if they had electric circuit problems but the lights burned out in both of the bathrooms during our stay there! And the showers had incredibly low water pressure even turned up all the way. :( 

Although it was nice to have a bar in shared space, don't expect to cook any meals here... they don't even provide a microwave! (you get a full fridge and kitchen at the MGM towers).

Over the years (10 years as a regular visitor to the Mirage, 4-5 at the Platinum level) the rate of comp has drastically declined at MGM properties but as a long time customer I felt as if loyalty still meant something. Today I logged into my account to setup some rooms for my staff for an upcoming trip and realize that they reset my status to the basic level. Obviously loyalty and long term customers mean nothing to whoever is deciding hospitality programing for the MGM group. I called into the Help Centre and they told me the policy changed a year or two ago. I didn't receive a notice about this change and I can guarantee that I wouldn't have gambled, stayed or eaten at anyone of the MGM properties If I knew this policy was in place. I also sent an email to their ""comments"" address.... bounced back.... they obviously are not interested in feed back or addressing concerns of clients. As a customer all you have to is the right to spend your money in venues that treat you with respect and offer a good all round experience...

Tired of being nickeled and dined. A $35 resort fee basically only covers Internet service. Previously complained when they charged $15 for Internet now they rounded up to 35 And don't even offer a newspaper or a discount on the buffet as some other hotels include as benefit. 

They like the other hotels on the strip have a eliminated free parking now charged $10 a day to park the car. Makes you wonder if it's even worth renting a car now in the long run I believe Uber and taxis may wind up being cheaper when you add in the cost of parking.

""But, really, it is only for one night and then we'll move you to the room you actually reserved.""  Ugh, no.  Or maybe it was when we got to the room and realized that it was looking pretty rough and not the nice-to-luxe accommodations I was expecting for the price. But I really think they moved into never to return territory by the way they handled these issues. Which was not at all. I felt like I fell for the old bait-and-switch. We'll promise you a beautiful resort, but delivery whatever is available and quit your whining.

At no time did I feel that the staff here cared one whit about our stay. We requested that maintenance come and repair the most glaring issue (the shower faucet that became a projectile and attacked you when the water was turned on), but they never came during our 3-day visit.  No apologies and no offers to move us to a decent room, nada. There were more cosmetic issues, but in some ways I didn't want to look too closely and ponder how the room arrived in its current state of disrepair.

I chose the Mirage for its central location on The Strip and reasonably positive reviews. But after spending time walking through, eating and shopping at about ten other properties, I've realized that The Mirage just isn't for me. They also just instituted a $15\/day resort fee, so it really adds insult to injury if you don't like the property. They are going for a Polynesian\/Asian theme, but since the property is 20 years old and has been partially renovated, it is not cohesive at all.

I spent a lot of time on the web comparing suites at the different resorts. The Mirage seemed to have the nicest suite at decent rates. We dropped almost $1K on the suite alone for the weekend.

Pros: Their price is decent. They are right in the middle of the strip. All our rooms had a strip view and the penthouse suite had floor to ceiling views. Their service was good. We made requests for rollaway beds and room service type stuff and they got us everything we requested. They even have an engineering department!! We wanted a way of plugging in our iPods to their built-in speakers; they couldn't find a cable but they got us external speakers we could use!

Cons: The website made this place sound like a whole more than what it turned out to be. E.g., with a penthouse suite, we expected the service to be special. From reading reviews, if you tip the front desk staff, they leave you champagne bottles. We figured with the penthouse suite, they would do that regardless but they didn't. We asked them to make reservations at Margaritaville for us one of the nights and they called us back saying there was no wait. When we got to the restaurant there was over an hour long wait. In summary, this place is good but not special. If you're looking for that sort of treatment, you might want to try MGM or Wynn. They Wynn has really nice suites too. Btw, the Mirage tower suites are supposed to get remodeled soon so maybe it will be better after that.

-- RESORT ROOM REVIEW --
Stayed at their standard Resort Room.

You can tell it's remodeled but it's done nicely.  The unit looks nice with the new curtains, carpets, headboard, lighting, but the build of the hotel itself is not so great.  I can hear everyone walking by the room from the bed and I can hear other people's showers.  Not recommended for light sleepers.

The lights in the bathroom weren't coming on so I had to reset the circuit button.

There was some stain on the magazine in the room (pictured).  I left it out for the cleaning lady to see, but she didn't catch it.  It's not a big deal, but these small imperfections are what makes me feel the room is not clean.

The checkout process was painful.  None of the buttons on my remote worked to checkout so I had to call.  When I called, they couldn't find me in the record that I stayed so I stayed on the line for about 20 mins to eventually be sent to VIP desk to be able to checkout.

Comes with a fully stocked fridge.  There is a soda machine that gives you a bottle of Dasani water for $3.

Internet was already priced into the resort fee they charge(~$28\/day) and worked well.

Their staffs' very friendly!  I called the front desk twice and they were very patient and helpful.

Located in the middle or the end of the strip pending how you look at it (some people don't think Circus circus should be in the same league as the other hotels). With so much to do and one of the best spa's I've been to, I almost never left the Mirage that weekend. There was Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden & Dolphin Habitat (which sounds kind of dirty), which I got to see the white tiger. The Aquarium which spans the whole front desk, it kind of sucks you in, lucky for me the check in lady had a lot of patience. An Atrium, it was like a mini rainforest and with a 100ft dome ceiling the Palm trees had to be around 60ft tall, the whole thing is very peaceful. And lastly step outside to see the raging volcano which erupts every hour on the hour starting at 8pm. Rooms were nice, but you never stay too long in them anyways. 

It's my favorite place I've stayed on the strip... so far.",2,2,3

Stayed for two nights. Upon check-in, we were graciously helped by Kim. We arrived around 11 am, check-in is not until 3 pm. While we chatted with Kim, he let us know our room was not ready but would find us a room that was. Lo and behold we were upgraded to a Resort King strip view room on the 21st floor. Kim even provided us $30 in food and beverage credits for our stay! What hospitality!

The hotel is conveniently and beautifully laid out, you check in facing their  20,000 gallon saltwater tank behind the front desk, walk through the cascading waterfall in the atrium, through the noticeably, clean smelling casino, past the Pantry (their 24-hour diner-esq restaurant) and up some crisp, speedy elevators.

The room is 394 sq ft but felt larger due to the flush TV and entertainment systems. The bed was very comfortable (Posturepedic Pillow-Top Mirage Serenity Bed by Sealy® as stated per their website), as were the pillows. The shower was clean and had very good pressure, which seems like a rarity in Vegas hotels. There are mirrors on the closet doors and one hanging on the wall, great for getting dressed for a night out. 

There is a safe in the closet, free of charge. 

The bathroom amenities were nice, even had a travel kit of Q-tips and Cotton facial pads.

The blackout shades were also a nice amenities for the morning when we slept in.

There are no coffee maker in the room, but your coffee options on the property were Starbucks, the Pantry, or our preferred the Roasted Bean, near the shops, past the frozen yogurt place.

There are many dining options suited for every budget and taste ranging from casual burger and deli places, as well as more refined white table cloth establishments such as Fin. 

We wanted to go to the Rhumbar for cocktails, which stated they were open until midnight. However, by the time we strolled around to it by 11:30 pm, they had a sign for closed to entry even though there were still patrons in the lounge.

There were nice variety of table games, video poker\/roulette\/blackjack, and slots (we had the best luck the Wolf Run and Willy Wonka!). All the dealer BJ tables we've noticed had min $10 and payout of 6:5, but that's the golden standard for the hotels on the strip now.

Cocktail Service was on point. They had some super sweet CWs at the Mirage, even giving me suggestions on what cocktails to get, and not to mix super surgery cocktails too much because I'll have a tummy ache later.

Baggage drop-off was a nice feature, on the day we left, we checked out and dropped out bags off so we could still roam around the city before our flight. All the staff were very friendly and courteous at the hotel. There were always cleaning crews on the hotel and casino floors, you could tell the staff took extra care of appearances there. 

We truly enjoyed our stay, although the casino odds were against us in this hotel, we'd return again in a heartbeat! Thank you Kim! You were wonderful!!",21,9,12

As you enter you stand in front of a beautiful waterfall feature, surrounded by the rarest plants of west Africa and a bridge made of rare Mongolian oak. As I checked in I was helped by the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. She was very courteous and polite, she checked me in and said ""Mr Simba, I can see you are a man of fine and impeccable taste. When you get a chance approach the bartender in the eastern part of the casino at 11:35PM and ask for a chartreuse""
""What is a chartreuse?"" I asked.
She replied ""Enjoy your time at the Mirage, Mr Simba. I hope to see you again soon""

I found my group of friends who agreed to meet me in the main casino, each of us had been reunited after many years from all corners of the world. We proceeded to the gamble and collectively won $1.7 million. Needless to say the gambling here is top notch. We went back to our rooms. My room was clean and comfortable and I had a nap. 

We all met at the buffet ""Munchies"" we paid our $27"" and feasted like kings. World class service and food made by the gods themselves. Unlimited beer and wine made the night sweeter. With delicious food and 1.7 mil in our pockets we were at the heights of our lives. 

I split from the group at headed to the bar. It was 11:35 and I knew what I had to do. ""Chartreuse please, bartender"" he looked at me curiously and made me the drink. I took a gulp and the floral taste engulfed by mouth, my gums went numb and my tongue had tingled. That's when I saw her. She whispered in my ear and we went to my room. 

This is truly a Mirage of dreams and happiness. The best part was the buffet, that is a must go.",2,5,1

Thats the smell I experience as soon as I stepped into the hotel.  I happen to enjoy it so from the start I knew I was going to like this place.  

We had a free suite comp for the night and it was great knowing that we had our own semi-private elevator section for the suite levels.  Only minor thing was in order to get to all the elevators you had to go on a little trek through the casino.  Would have been nice to have the elevators closer to the front desk and exit to the garage.

The suite we had was fantastic.  Great sized living area with an enormous bathroom.  The bed was large and comfortable.  Sadly, we only spent one night there.  Was definitely an upgrade from other rooms at other hotels.  

The one thing I noticed about the Mirage is they really support their performing acts.  We went to see the Beatles Love and Beatles music encompassed the entire casino.  Boyz II Men were also performing and there was tons of their music and pictures around the hotel.  They proudly display their performing artists.

The old adage is true, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. After my second stay I said I likely wouldn't stay here unless the price was right. We just checked in for a three night stay and have had to move rooms once and would have moved a second time if we weren't so tired. 

Our first room had three hairs on the toilet seat which I noticed immediately upon entering the room (pics posted). I called front desk and they moved me to another room, once in the second room which had a lovely view of the roof and AC system, it appeared someone trimmed their beard on the hand towels (pics posted). We called front desk again and they offered to move us or have house keeping come and clean the bathroom again. We had the maid clean. I should also mention the head board is peeling and so is the wall paper (pics posted)

Between our room experiences and by the shape of the casino, fraying carpet and the trash can outside The Pantry restaurant catching water from the leaking roof, which was there last time we were here, the place has plummeted in quality. Perhaps MGM is planning on remodeling once Monte Carlo is complete but the sad state of this hotel\/casino is not worth even the best deal. 

Again, I should mention I'm a gold MLife member and this is my third visit to Mirage in less than 18 months and my 5th trip in the same amount of time. 

Hopefully, management reads this and will take these issues seriously.

2nd Review 

Sadly, my most recent experience pales in comparison to my previous visit to the Mirage. Perhaps I just caught the wrong room and interacted with the wrong people but this last visit did not encourage another visit. 


The pros:
- Check-in was fast and the clerk friendly. 
- Concierge was helpful and friendly
- Great Strip location

The cons:
- Room was dirty with numerous hairs in numerous spots in the bathroom, requiring room change
- Friend's room had a leaky window, resulting in large puddle on floor, requiring room change
- Cashier and hostess at Cravings Buffet were rude
- Drink service almost none existent through out stay


While staff was apologetic for room situation, nothing more than an apology was received which seems like bad service. With all the hotel options in Vegas, everyone is vying for new customers, Mirage could take a lesson in rewarding repeat customers when mistakes are made on their part.  

I should also mention I have MLife Gold status and this is my 4th trip to Vegas in less than a year. 

In the future I'll be looking at other options for my stay.",3,1,1

We were dropped off in the front and the entrance already made a nice statement. Then the check in line really made our day because we were the only ones in line and was greeted immediately. Then I noticed the huge fish tank they had behind the check in line and that was absolutely gorgeous. We were given our room and made our way upstairs. First impression off the elevators and into the hallway, ""Wow, this place is really really nice!"" The color contrast from the carpet to the hallway decors is beautiful! But when we entered our room, we couldn't be more satisfied of the huge king bed that we had and the beautiful view of the strip! It was one of the most comfortable beds we've slept in at a hotel. The room was super spacious and everything was in great condition. The hotel also had a huge buffet with a lot to choose from. We also had lunch at the Burger place located inside the Mirage and that was pretty tasty too.

We got in and got free drink ticket which was cool. The person that promised us the cabana vanished like a fart in the wind. Luckily us girls got ourselves into our own cabanas based on our exquisite personalities and intellectual stimulus. But seriously you don't have to take your top off because really no one does. Yet you aren't allowed to take any pictures. This girl had a bikini made of rabbit fur and I couldn't even get a picture of that.

It wasn't a big though. We decided to eat lunch at stacks. The front did call my cell phone when the computers were finally working. So I greatly appreciated that! So 4 stars for check in!

Room- paid for the strip view but didn't get it. Made a quick call to the front desk n they switched us to another room. Of course the key didn't work but the maid let us in. Had to get new keys later on that day. Still no biggie, it happens. Rooms were nice and decent size. Bathroom was a little small. No complaints on the room.

The pool- 0 star! I got a rash on my arms from the pool. My bf got a little rash that cleared up in 2 days on his forearm. Mine however is still there!, like wtf do you guys put in the pool? Unbalance chemicals going on. I'm am very upset still about this. It has been a week an a half n it is still there. Damn nasty!  N yes I took a shower right after the pool. So idk what happen? Never returning for sure! 

Check out- easy

Beware- taxi guy took us the long way to the airport. Cost us $35 instead of $16-19. Karma bring is all I can say. 

Overall this hotel is a great location if u wanna be in the middle of the strip, and has good options for dining. I would recommend staying here but stay the hell out of the pool! I am M life member n I will never stay here again because if that. It's kinda like if u get food poisoning would u ever eat at that restaurant again? Hell to the NAH!!

While I was there I really enjoyed the pool because it was spread out. Lots of space, just pick a side u wanna lay at. Chairs are extremely close but most people don't lay directly next to u. They will skip a chair at least. Through out the day the pool area fills out with empty bottles and cups. Nobody cleans it up! I guess they wait til the end of the day to do it.",4,1,1

Like all Vegas hotels\/casinos finding the elevators is a chore but once you find your way, you're set. The rooms are nice and big. The minibars are well stocked and when you take something out they immediately hit your bill so no taking stuff out and replacing it later. The room do seem a little lived in but comfortable. I was especially impressed by the electronics equipment and connections in the room. All the AV equipment is set up to plug into the flat panel TV. There is even a USB connection in the wall allowing you to use a USB cable to charge devices like a Blackberry or camera. You need to bring a cable but this is a very convenient feature. The beds are fluffly and comfortable. The design of the rooms is very retro 70s chic. AC is quiet. The gym is only open from 6 to 6, they need you gamble. The breakfast may seem affordable but if you order coffee they bring you a pot and its $17 per pot. The delivery is fast, especially for breakfast which is a huge plus.",0,0,0

It's kind-of a badge of honor and I'm proud of my love for Vegas. I've gone there dozens of times for work, probably a hundred times for relaxation\/vacation\/gambling\/partying\/pleasure and I love the town...the size of everything...the pulse...the fun.  Love it.

The Mirage is no different...good sized property in center-north Strip location, next to T.I. (Treasure Island) and Caesars Forum Shoppes linking to Caesars Palace. 

- TONS of restaurants.
- Huge casino floor with all games all the time.
- Great poker room (an iconic place).
- Massive sports book
- Huge pools, and in season the BARE topless euro pool.
- Dolphin Habitat, and the former Sigfreid and Roy Secret Garden
- Good, clean rooms.

Main tower is 25 stories tall (not counting VIP villas). You should ALWAYS request 24th or 25th floor rooms. Bigger, newer renovations, huge bathrooms, and elevators that are dedicated to get direct to those floors.

Mirage is a great place to stay. Pretty close to the heart of everything. Good views north and south. Good prices (unless its a special time of year).  Lots to do.  Great service. 

All-in-all it is not the newest, not the largest, not the most posh place in Vegas...but it is a good spot to stay. It's bright, festive, pretty clean (except for smokers and you cant help that), and it's got good food and clubs.

I was so happy because Palazzo is sold out, Venetian has only their deluxe suites that's gonna cost us $300+ even using Grazie, Mandalay, Aria and Vdara are sold out too...so I'm happy Mirage is adopting us for the night...:)

Checking-in was a breeze...had to pass by their clubs so aside from their giant saltwater aquarium and regal flower arrangements, the glittery girls were all a feast for the eyes...:) At the reception, they said we lucked out coz this is their last available room...I sort of believe that after I've scouted available rooms in my favorite hotels.
We had to pass by the gambling area going to the elevators...eew smokes!! (Why I love Vdara coz they have no casinos) We also passed by Revolution Lounge...gay-friendly night on Sundays there! (Gay events are just so much fun and feels safe knowing nobody will  try to hit on you) We stayed in 12056...when we stepped inside,  it smelled like cigarette, but not too strong, this is a No Smoking room, so some of the guests must have violated that rule. It was a good amount of space in the room with two queen beds. Beddings were soft and fluffy, comfy! Setbacks were, not having complimentary coffee in the room and no robes. View from our room was ok, I've had better from the higher floors. We had complimentary wifi connection and that surprised me coz normally in other hotels that's another cost. Phones had icon buttons for the services you need, but when I tried to use the Housekeeping button it connected me to another room...uh-oh. The best way to get service if you need any is to push ""0"" for the concierge. There are several restaurants that I have yet to try and I haven't been to their pool area as well...sooo many things to do, so little time..:) In our previous stays, we went to see their Dolphin and Tiger habitat and the kids really enjoyed them.

There's something about its quasi-tropicalness that makes me feel as if I've been transported to a jungle paradise with flashing lights and bells from the casino floor.  I've never won very much here, but I usually at least can play long enough to have fun and on my last visit, I discovered the new Plants Vs. Zombies slot machines which were adorable.  

Especially if you have kids, the Dolphin Exhibit is well worth a visit, and we've come here many a time over the years.  The Secret Garden is not as well designed in my opinion, but is worth a visit if you've never been.  They're currently hosting Cirque du Soleil's LOVE show, which is incredible and a must-see, and the theater is really well designed (although it reflects the Beatles' and 60s England which makes it a bit incongruous with the tropical waterfall theme of the rest of the resort).  On the outside, the (free!) volcano show is worth catching if you're in the area.",1,0,3

First off, I wanted to say that i came here having high hopes as this hotel is a staple on the Vegas strip and it came highly recommended. 

CHECK IN:
One thing to note for anyone coming here for the first time, if you arrive before 10am they do not let you check in. Other places, such as the Palazzo where I stayed the year prior, let you check in regardless of time and call you or text you when your room is ready. Mirage does not let you do this until after 10am. I did not know this and was literally waved away by the front desk clerk. Neither did she explain this to me.  She didn't seem approachable enough for me to feel comfortable to go back to and ask ANY questions.I had to call the 800 number to ask this. She was pleasant and answered all my questions.
The bell hop at the from of the hotel was unfortunately very rude to me too. I must've forgot to say thank you because he angrily and sarcastically said ""you're welcome!"" to me. I guess to point out the fact that i forgot to thank him. My bad for not thanking him but i was just waved away from the desk clerk and trying to figure out why. Im sure Im not the ONLY person who didn't thank him. Is he rude to EVERYONE?! I found myself apologizing to HIM! WTH! Keep in mind theses were my VERY first interactions with the staff. And based on their job positions, theses are the very first interactions most people have. I tried hard not to let this ruin my day. I kept on. 

HOTEL: 
One thing you'll notice as soon as you walk in is an odd odor. Im not saying its bad as I'm sure a lot of people must like it. But its not for me, It took about the entire 3 days of my trip for me to get used to it. Its very intoxicating and really hard to take at first. Its like a punch to my face. You'll know what I'm talking about if you go visit other hotels during your stay. Theirs is a bit more subtle. A little smoky too. Other than that though, the premises are kept pretty clean. Crowd is probably a little younger than my liking. With youth usually comes a lot of rowdy behavior and late night hallway shenanigans. I was awoken a few times by this during my stay. Vegas, right?! I just didn't get awoken at other places Ive stayed at on the strip that were higher end. I guess its more normal than I thought. Gym is great (check out my review of the spa\/salon)
Rooms are clean and modern. Housekeepers, sweet as pie. Always kept us fully stocked.
My clock radio in the room never worked. Never called to get this replaced or fixed as to not deal with anymore staff.
Beds were a little too soft for my taste. I like soft but these were hard to sleep in. 

POOL:
Pool is huge and fun. Very lush and beautiful waterfalls. I enjoyed my time here. You have to get here early to get seats, they fill up fast. They only have about 1 waitress servicing different sections. Greats are good. Mine looked horrendous but tasted great. CAUTION: tips IS added on. Is this legal? So unless you intend to double tip, don't fork over any extra cash if you don't have to.

OVERALL:
My overall stay here was ok. If everything during your stay goes perfectly and you don't have to deal with the staff, then you should have a very pleasant trip. If you should have the unfortunate luck that something goes wrong and you have to ask for help. GOOD LUCK!
I more than likely will not be coming back here. Would only recommend this place if you don't care about great customer service and are just looking for a place to stay. I work hard for my money and don't make much. When i finally am able to get away for a few days and decide to stay at your hotel with the many options there are, why would you want to be rude?!
I do want to give a shout out to the bell hop on the way out. Wish I knew his name. He was super nice and helpful. Too bad i couldn't have met him on day one.",4,1,1

Review #27:
happy 25th anniversary to The Mirage!; you gotta love the foliage, waterfalls, & lagoons - both outside and near the lobby; the giant aquarium behind the hotel check-in counter is also a nice touch; there are some seriously cool dining spots here - I especially like the sexy modern look of Japonais and Stack, located next to each other; there is a sprawling and classy conference room & event center area; I'm not even going to mention the outdoor volcano, since that is more for the tourists walking on The Strip; this is a classic 3.5 stars place, but I'll round up since The Mirage started all of the development of upscale Strip casinos, back in the day (1989); best craft beer bet = nothing outstanding, but BLT Burger has the best overall selection; the sports bar and Tom Colicchio's aren't bad either, but the best tip might be to buy a 22 oz. Samuel Adams bottle in the sundries store for less than $7.",2,0,0

Few minor things like maybe a dirty towel I came across last time but other than that it's been good. my major thing most of the time is having a nice clean bed and I was given that and a damn comfy one too might I add.  If you get a room with a view it's pretty good view while the non view ones are fine if you just want to go back to your room to get ready and\/or rest for a few hours.  As for the other stuff at the hotel...people there are nice and helpful, the pool I totally like since it's pretty spacious and looks nice...not that froo froo modernish minimalistic nonsense, plenty of restaurants from different ranges to choose from, and lastly...IDEAL LOCATION.

Naturally since he wanted to see Love we booked at the Mirage, which has always been a bigger name on the Strip, so we thought nothing of it.

The entire family set off and made reservations months in advance, 4 couples and my grandfather, five rooms. Day one we made it clear that we wanted rooms close by each other, at the least on the same floor and was told they'd do everything they could to accommodate us and since it was so far in advance it shouldn't be an issue. 

Fast forward to the day of arrival and we go to check in, we were a little early (1pm) and was told the rooms weren't ready and they would text us when they were. Four hours later and no text we wander back over to the desk only to discover our rooms are spread out over multiple floors with different elevator access points, after much discussion where it was clear they didn't really care about the issue we were finally able to get 2 couples and my grandfather on the same floor, success?

The rooms were decently nice, moderately updated and clean, few small issues of flickering lights and such. The mini fridge was absolutely off limits though, it has weighted trays and if you even pick an item up it gets charged to the room, wtf? No coffee maker, even Motel 6 offers that and the free wi-fi was spotty at best 

The Hotel itself wasn't as nice as expected, it seemed a little more run down then I would expect from such a prestigious establishment, I've stayed at a number of Hotels in Vegas previously and I put this one below all of them, places like Las Vegas Hilton, Rio, Mandalay Bay, Bellagio. It was more in line with a place like Stratosphere, which was surprising, the pool area was pretty nice though, with the exception that the Hot tubs closed at 4:30.... The prices of everything were definitely too high for the quality of the establishment. 

The Love show was very good and we weren't disappointed by that, even not being a Beatles fan myself I didn't feel like I had wasted my $100 for the ticket. 

We had dinner at Samba grill and the steaks were very good and everyone was pleased with the food over all. 

The huge glaring issue which made the stay much less pleasant than it could be was the staff. You could tell they knew they weren't going to see you again for a long time and didn't have the time or patience to deal with, well, anything. Everyone from the front desk to California Pizza Kitchen to the club Revolutions, and even the servers at Samba were just flat out unfriendly. No service with a smile and never felt very welcomed. The ladies at Starbucks were friendly though, which was the highlight of our staff interaction. 

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, there are so many good hotels on the Strip, find one of those and enjoy your vacation, this place will just add hassle where you really don't need it, and everything will be slightly enough below your expectations to make you want to complain, and thats a bummer, because the staff won't care when you do.",0,0,0

We choose to have Sunday brunch at Cravings. It was just ok, especially compared to Ceasars buffet. 

They did give us a Strip view room right above the volcano which was pretty cool. But the blackout curtains need to be better...I know it's the Strip but it wasn't dark in the room even with the blackout curtains pulled. There was also a lot of light coming from under the door. When I called to confirm our reservation, I mentioned that it was our 15th wedding anniversary. The really nice gentleman on the phone told me he'd have something waiting in the room for us. There wasn't. Not that big of a deal, but I'm just one of those people that promises something, I make sure it's done.

We've stayed at many hotels in Las Vegas and never got the chance until now (Presidents Day) weekend. I booked through the M Life website which saved us a bit of money. 

We've walked through this casino before but never took the time to stop and gamble. I was impressed by the overall cleanliness, attentive waitresses who come around for cocktails, and layout of the casino floor! 

There are quite a few bars and restaurants and a Starbucks. The only eatery we tried in the hotel was a nice spot called The Pantry. They're open 24 hours and serve breakfast items all day long. My wife had an omelette and I had the chicken and waffles. Was pretty good and the price was reasonable. 

Now I read some not so good reviews here on Yelp about the Mirage. I didn't experience that at all! We booked a volcano\/strip view room and it was fantastic!! The room was spotless, the bed was super comfortable, and our view was terrific! At 400sq ft. It was plenty of space for my wife and I. I'm very picky about water pressure and like hard showers. The Mirage didn't disappoint! Pressure was great and never once did the water go cold. No stains, no mold... Nothing wrong with out room! 

Last, we did check out the Boyz II Men show conveniently located in our hotel. Growing up in the 80's\/90's.... was great to see them perform there biggest hits and a couple other surprises. If you're into RnB and appreciate there music... this is a must!

1.  There is no quick place to get a bite to eat.  When the casino is busy (Thursday, Friday, Saturday) all restaurants have a line.  Sometimes I just want a hot dog, burger, steak sandwich something you can pick-up and have a seat yourself area.  It's not the money (that's flying out of my pocket anyway) and I'd gladly pay $7.00 for a ""special"" hot dog or $11.00 for a burger.  Just want it quick.  There is no traditional ""coffee shop"" either.  The only quick option is an overpriced Turkey & Cheese on dry wheat bread or similar choice with sprouts at Starbucks.  

2.  Our room door key card only worked on it's fourth to tenth try.  A helpful bellman told me you need to slide the card in ""gently"".  It eventually works but a recurring pain in the a**.  The area to replace the card always had a line.

3.  On the weekends this hotel seems to attract the cockeyed hat, pants below your a** crowd, along with 20 something girls in skirts the size of band-aids and ridiculous high heels.  Other ""better"" hotels did not attract this crowd on weekends.  It may have to do with the late night club on the premises and\/or who was appearing\/happening that particular weekend.  This ain't my crowd but I will admit the girls were interesting!

The beds were comfortable, there was warm water, and all of the appliances worked. It was modernly decorated, but very plain. The hotel was also conveniently located on the center of The Strip.

Sooo why the one star rating, you ask? Well...our experience with the front lobby was terrible. We had made reservations a few months in advance, but when we checked-in, they told us that they had made an error in our reservation and that they no longer had our rooms. I have had this happen to me once before at another hotel and in response to their mishap, they upgraded our room to a suite without any extra charges. I mean...if you're going to make a mistake, you're going to have to make it up somehow, right? Well, that's not something The Mirage is familiar with. They simply told us that they could not do anything about it, other than book us for their lower grade rooms. Had there been rooms available at other hotels, we would not have settled. We had no other choice, so we agreed. I will never even think about staying at The Mirage again.",4,2,2

The pool side was very nice and large (though it would of make it better if they have a deeper side of the pool since it is 3 1\/2 ft. all around). Our room was also nice and had a nice flat screen tv. The bathroom was ok since it feel really small (bathroom door had no lock in it).

The Room:

I thought it was close to perfect! The decor was next level and had a nice vibe. A friend who was also staying here did point out there were no bath robes in the room but I didn't find that to be a major problem. I've attached photos of the room.

I've stayed at The MGM, The Vidara, Planet Hollywood and The Monte Carlo .. hands down this hotel had the best room. 

I have a problem finding a shower with good water pressure but i have to say, the shower in The Mirage has great pressure - it's just a shame the shower head was the size of a quarter. Also, room service actually understood that a privacy sign on the door handle meant do not disturb, from experience, a concept most hotels fail to grasp!

The Hotel:

When we made the booking we were given a $50 credit to spend in the hotel, however when we check in there was no mention of it. We went back to the lobby to ask about it because we forgot when we checked in and we did in fact have $50 to spend, but i was a little bit mad that we weren't told that on arrival. 

I did a review for The Monte Carlo a couple of weeks ago. On check in there we were given a $75 credit to spend, $75 which paid for multiple meals for me and my wife. On the other hand, the restaurants in The Mirage are WAY over priced. Embarrassingly overpriced. There are close to 10 restaurants in the hotel and not one was realistic. There was even a California Pizza Kitchen which charged a minimum of $20 for a pizza. The line for a table was huge! Probably because this was the cheapest restaurant available. 

There was only one place which served breakfast and it cost $15 for eggs and bacon. Maybe i'm more 'frugal' let's say, than most but 3 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for $15 
+ Tax and Tip .. Come on! 

We also ate at 'FIN' i think it was called, an asian restaurant. I had a cup of soup which was $10 and i stress that it was a cup, not a bowl. Entrees were all around $30 and all were 'A La Carte' .. In other words, you have to pay $15 for fried rice or chow mein. The soup was amazing to be fair, but the main meal was a let down and left me hungry.

All in all, the hotel itself is great, as are the rooms. If you plan on eating outside of the hotel the entire time, i'd say give it a shot.",5,0,0

This is my second time staying at this resort.

Room is spacious & also kept clean.
Good bed & clean bathrooms. 
No idea how they clean the glasses.

This time there was a resort fees of $25\/- & I could never get into their wifi. But still I have to pay them. Maybe next time for using their elevators & doors I will have to pay a touching fees ( dont know what else they come up with)

The most interesting was their mini bar. You have 40 seconds to check any item. Basically you check it & did not keep it back within the 40th second a fee is charged according to the weight. But you wont be uncharged if u keep it back at the 41st second. wow....Mirage is testing eveyones knowledge of counting.

So BEWARE...Ding DIng Ding.....charged credit card.

As there are so many resorts I might try some others next time I go. May never go back to Mirage. Too many choices so no panic button.

Overall, The Mirage is one of the better hotels in Vegas.  It's just a step below The Venetian (my favorite hotel in Vegas), but the price is also a bit lower.  If you have the money to go all out, I recommend The Venetian.  If you have a pretty tight budget but still want to experience luxury and comfort, then The Mirage is a great choice. 

Positives: 
The price - My average rate for the three nights was $199.  This was during a crazy weekend with CES and AAE going on, so the rate isn't bad at all.  This was $100 lower than the lowest price available at the Venetian (but it was a regular room at the Mirage vs. a suite at the Venetian...). 
Rooms - The rooms are starting to show their age, but they are still quite nice.  I also love the beds, and the bathroom amenities are impressive.  
Location - It's in the heart of the strip.  Even if you can't afford to stay at one of the more luxurious hotels like The Venetian and The Bellagio, they are within walking distance.  
Casino floor - They have just about everything you need here including a nice sports book.  You won't have to go anywhere else because there is something for everyone (even high rollers...).  

Negatives: 
Service -  The employees are ok I guess, but I did have a few issues.  During check in, they only had a smoking room available the first night.    It turns out they gave my non-smoking room to someone else since I didn't arrive to the hotel until 8:30 pm, and the hotel was sold out.  They didn't even apologize for this.   Instead, they acted like this happens all the time and were doing me a favor by transferring me to a non smoking room for my second and third nights.  All I needed to do was to call to see if the room was ready, and they would automatically set the key cards to work with my new room.  I'm not usually one to complain so I went with it.   
The next day, I was rushing to get to a show on time, but I also wanted to transfer rooms before heading out for the day.  When I called, they said everything was good to go, but when I got to my room, the key cards didn't work.  It ended up taking about an hour for them to correct the issue, and I was late to my event.  Not cool...
Restaurants - Maybe it's just me, but I was not too impressed with the restaurants in The Mirage.  I tried Cravings (the buffet), Carnegie Delicate, and BLT Burger.  They were all mediocre, and I would never go back...
Bathrooms - These are pretty damn small...


I took a few nice pictures of the room, bathroom, and the exterior of the hotel, so check them out.

We were not disappointed.  It was great.  We were there before official check in time but they had a room ready for us anyway.  The people at the front desk were so nice and helpful.  When we got to our room, we were even more impressed.  The room was immaculate and the view was amazing.  It looked out over the strip and from our room, each night we could watch the volcano.   The first morning we slept in and ordered room service from The Pantry.  It was delivered in about 20 minutes instead of the 45 they estimated.  And it was yummy--the  potatoes especially.  Everyday when we returned from our adventures, the room had been tidied and after the second night, the sheets were even changed without us requesting.

As my first time to The Mirage in Vegas, having stayed at other various big-name resorts on the strip, I know what to expect when visiting this area. I reserved a penthouse suite (level A, if it makes any difference) with an attached second bedroom. Upon arrival, first thing I notice is the key I was given did not work. I struggled with the door for about 5 minutes before the lock decided to take the keycard I was given (both keycards exhibited the problem).  The room itself was nice looking, very spacious, comfortable furniture, but after settling into the room, its problems became quite evident.

Two recessed lights in the room were burnt out, the safe in the master bedroom was locked (I presume from a prior guest), and the television in the master bedroom would not rise out of its enclosure. I immediately called the front desk and was assured the problems would be taken care of within 10 minutes. Twenty minutes later, a security agent shows up to unlock the safe. He doesn't know anything about the lights or the TV, he tells me ""that's the engineering department. I'm security."" He refuses to look into something outside of his department.

Ten more minutes pass, I make another call to the front desk. They apologize and a few minutes later, someone shows up to replace the light bulbs. He tries to fix the TV, and tells me in order to use it, I will need to reach behind the unit and manually press a button to raise\/lower the TV - the remote does not work. Fabulous.

By this point, I've complained to the manager and he offered to knock $50 off my room rate (less than 10% what the room is costing me for one night), and offers a brief apology. Later that night, I noticed the shower leaks over the marble flooring in the master bathroom, and the clothing iron did not work, it simply sputtered water.

By this point, I am appalled. The next morning, I wake up around 10am and call the concierge to make a lunch reservation at The Eiffel Tower. I am immediately told they only serve dinner - even though I've dined at The Eiffel Tower for lunch several times in the past. Ok I think, maybe they have changed their hours of operation. I give them a call, and they are open for lunch. The woman at the reservation desk tells me they have never been closed for lunch. I make the reservation myself, and call The Mirage concierge back, to inform her that The Eiffel Tower *is in fact* open for lunch. ""Well they haven't been open for lunch before!"" she tells me, and I inform her otherwise. She doesn't have anything to say.

We recently stayed for 3-nights (Thur-Sun).

Here is the rundown:
--Location is perfect, mid-strip and walk-able in both directions.
--Check-in, awesome aquarium to look at while checking-in.  It was quick easy and they do their best to accommodate you.  They even found us a room next to our friends that checked in earlier in the day. - 5 stars.
--The guest elevators are all the way through the casino, read the signs to find the appropriate bank of elevators for your floor.
--Casino and rooms were clean, and not nearly as smoky as some other hotels.
--Ceilings were sooooo low in the hotel (I am 5'6"" and could nearly touch them flat footed) so it felt a tad claustrophobic.
--Rooms were a good size, our two queen room was nicely updated with a flat screen TV.
--Bathrooms are super small, but that was expected.  Our tub was a bit scary (chipped\/dirty looking) but the toilet flushed and the sink drained which I consider a win.  The fan didn't do a dang thing, so keep the door open if you want to be able to see the mirror after you shower.
--Our room looked onto the pool facing Caesars, you could see part of the strip too.
--Walls are paper thin, we could hear full conversations being had next door to us as well as music being played, doors being opened\/closed, water running and toilets flushing.  This was extremely annoying and troublesome when the neighbors were partying at all-hours while we were trying to sleep.  
--Housekeeping was awesome, they left you alone if you had your ""privacy please"" sign out, but were generous with giving extra towels and such.
--Dining, plenty of options and you can charge it to your room, much easier than waiting for your credit card to be run or change if you pay cash.  Plus if you sign up for the M-Life card you bank rewards points.
--Pantry is open 24-hours and while it is expensive and can prove to be a long wait during peak times, its pretty darn good.  
--Cravings buffet was terrible. We went for brunch on Saturday and the food was cold and bland.  The only plus was the self serve beverages, I was never thirsty.  
--Check-out, couldn't have been easier.  We received an email and clicked 'check out'.  Not sure if this would happen if you didn't book directly through the Mirage, but if you do, its way cool.  Only caveat is it doesn't allow you to check out online until 6 am.
--Terry Fator Theater, we went to the show and it was really good.  The seats in the theater are a little small and uncomfortable, but it works just fine for a 1.5 hour show.  Highly recommend going to see him.
--Secret Garden, admission is fair and the dolphins and lions\/tigers are awesome.  We watched the dolphin shows a couple times.  Definitely visit if you have the time.
--The casino itself is clean and there are plenty of gambling options.  We didn't spend a lot of time gambling, but when we did we had fun.  The cocktail servers didn't visit us frequently, perhaps because we were only having water.

The bed is AMAZINGLY comfortable. I slept like a baby all night. We were there with our 4 year old daughter, so we made a great little bed on the couch for her which gave my husband and I some privacy. 

The service has been above and beyond. The staff is very well trained, eager to assist and goes beyond just being ""helpful"" to being of genuine service. The valets were especially great to deal with, making our stay convenient and comfortable as we travelled around town. 

The pool area is gorgeous and they have a nice area that is suitable for children. The Dolphin experience is quite a delight for the family. 

The only downside is that the hotel is a bit dated and very smelly in the lobby area. Unfortunately, you have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators which means inhaling old lady perfume and tons of cigarette smoke. Once you are through it though, the restaurant and store area is clean, fresh and nice. 

I love that they have a Starbuck's in the hotel and pretty much everything else you could want or need. The location is spectacular as we are in walking distance to many of the major hotels, including Caesar's Forum shops. I would gladly stay here again.",1,0,0

This hotel did not meet my expectations.  The check in line was extremely long, about 45 minutes to make it through. Once we got to the counter, the representative who helped us was stone cold and not welcoming at all.

The decor of the lobby and hallways were nice. However, once we got into our room we were again disappointed. The room was extremely small with one king bed and no sofa bed. The bathroom was so small that if you were sitting on the toilet, you could not close the door. The bed was Extremely uncomfortable because it was sagging in the middle. They need to change out the bed for sure.  We stayed there for a week and I had severe back pain pretty much the whole time. 

We had a volcano view and the view was pretty nice because we got to see the huge Ferris wheel.  
The pool had areas of hot and cold spots of varying temperatures so swimming was a little uncomfortable. The water was extremely cloudy as well and overall I did not enjoy the experience because of those issues.

Effective recently, all MGM properties are charging $10 per day for parking even if you are a guest at the hotel. Be prepared for that.

My overall experience at The Mirage was underwhelming and I would definitely not stay there again nor recommend this hotel and casino to my friends.",4,3,0

I got a non-smoking w\/ a king size bed. The room was fairly pimp. One king size bed + 40"" flat screen TV in front of it, a desk for your laptop or whatever, two drawers on the side of the bed.

Bathroom was clean and I got new soap + shampoo every day even though I barely used the ones from the day before. Some hotels don't replace them daily (aka Imperial Palace).

The food was pretty expensive downstairs. Everything usually came out to at least $20 per person. Even for one quesadilla + ice tea. Hamburgers + fries were $20+.

I ordered room service, some strawberries to be delievered in the morning. The total came to: strawberries + room service fee + tax + tip. Aw well.

We wanted to check out at 1:00-2:00 since our flight is at 5:00 but they said $40 extra. :-( 
Also noticed a lot of workers in Mirage looks unhappy or just didnt have a happy cheerful face when we encountered them. wasnt an issue tho but just had a lil unexciting feeling. bed was too soft, not good for me. one major problem is that mirage does not have at least one decent casual dining resturants, even the upscale resturant doesnt seem popular. we didnt eat here but had to go elsewhere. :-( 
overall, dont mind to stay at Mirage just once more, maybe the suites room next time but that's all. the only restuarant I'd like to try at Mirage is the steakhouse. other then soft bed, unhappy faces, no good resturants and no freebies we didnt have any other problems here. :-P",1,2,1

It's a good location and since the Mirage doesn't have a ""mall"", being next to Caesars Forum Shops and across from the Venetian Shops is convenient for us shoppers. 

Rooms:  The rooms are fine, but was expecting a separate shower and soaking tub like many other casino hotel bathrooms. My other complaint was the room key seemed never to work and on my last visit, maintenance had to replace the battery for the door lock. Frustrating as heck. 

The wifi here is just horrible. We should get a refund from the daily resort fee. Coming here for a convention in this hotel severely limits your work efforts. 

Restaurants: Carnegie Deli. Only 24 hr place before Pantry opened late last year. Need to check it out Pantry when I am here next month. I think this location has better food than their NYC counterpart! Pastrami was just so good. Breakfast too. 

Heritage Steak: I really wanted to love this place as much as I love Craftsteak at MGM Grand. It was good and gave it 4 stars. Just didn't blew me away compare to Craftsteak. Now I did hang out a lot at their Heritage Steak lounge bar. Great bartenders. 

Cravings Buffet. Came here for dinner and all I ate was crab legs and roast beef\/ prime rib. Yum. Bonus was beer\/wine included with dinner. Negative was waiters don't refill your drinks for you. You have to go and get your own sodas, beer, wine. They only clear your plates. 

BLT Burger. Can't go wrong eating here! Glad there is a Starbucks!

Rhumbar. I must have came on an off night as I got one of the worst outdoor service. Last time I'll be there. I'll go somewhere else where it is more welcoming. Too bad too with its nice outdoor area. 

Beatles Love. Awesome show! Everyone should see it. 

Dolphin Habitat and Secret Garden. Didn't realize how close you get to see the dolphins! Pool. Decent but rather small pool compare to other pools. 

Will need to check out Terry Fator and maybe dine at Stack when I'm here next month for convention.

My only complaints:
-No outlets near the bed (this is 2014, people)
-No sound insulation between room and hallway

In a perfect world, every Vegas hotel room would have a button, à la Aria, that turns off all the lights and closes the black out curtain with one fell press. I guess I can't really fault the Mirage for not having that, though.

Unfortunately it seems most of the hotel staff didn't even know they had a special dog lawn area, because it is SO lovely, large, and dare I say ""serene"" considering the location!!!! 

Poop bag dispensers and right on the short tram line (to treasure island) on the super hot hours we would just ride the air conditioned tram for 20 minutes or so so she could get some loving and stay cool also. 

TIP; The distance from your room to a potty area is pretty far, resulting in my dog ""dropping a nugget"" in the casino once or twice. Bring a bag with you to discreetly pick it up, OR bring a baby\/doggie stroller to zoom your pooch out.

-Environment\/Pool - intimate, but space is designed to foster energy and a party atmosphere so no complaints. Their upper level whirlpool has see-through plexiglass wall is a cool visual. If you want a lounge-chair, sofa-bed, etc you should get in during the first 1-2 hours as they did fill up promptly. They filled up the cabanas at a discount as the day wore on to get people in -- all seating was filled by 3:30.
-Crowd - on our Monday, definitely a healthy mix. More sedate from 11am - 1:30 when it really picked up and we got a good mix of 20s\/30 year-golds, lots of locals, few bodybuilders (men & women), some swingers (they were polite). After the bar had been open for a few rounds, about 6-10 women in the pool were topless. Nice mix of men and women -- lots of couples and single ladies\/men... healthy mix, not too guy heavy. Everyone was either chilling or partying to the DJ, very fun crowd and will return.

Compared to Liquid, Moorea and Artisan pool? IMHO: Liquid is more expensive and crowd a smidgen more snooty at times (and no topless allowed); Moorea appeared to us more intimate, F&B was higher on the day we visited, but an equally fun crowd. Artisan was definitely local and interesting swinger mix, but definitely a specialized environment you need to be looking for.
But Bare @ the Mirage had nice mix of a good DJ, prompt\/attentive service, nice\/clean pool and facilities and fun mix of crowd. Obviously you pay more for this pool trip but figure the $100-$200\/person bar tab is equal to a nice meal on the strip -- and this lasts all afternoon and has nice visuals to boot!",6,6,4

We got a resort queen room with two queen beds.
The beds were extremely comfortable, as well as the pillows.

I like that they had a 42 inch flat screen tv mounted on the wall, and had cable to watch the news, movies and other things.

I like that there is also a music box thing where you can hook up your phone to play music and it comes with an attached auxiliary cord.

And a small table with two chairs.
Although the room does not come with a fridge, you can request for one.
They only have the fridge that is already stocked with drinks that you have to pay for if you grab something. Along with snacks stocked in the room.

No microwave either.
And the bathroom is tiny compared to other hotels I've stayed at.

The cleaning people did not come at specific times, and one of the times they came, we asked if she could come back 30minutes later, but she never came back.

And another cleaning lady didn't mind cleaning the rooms while we were still there.

Overall, it was a clean and comfortable stay.
My favorite thing about mirage is that it's central on the strip and has shopping centers, food court, and everything you will need if you don't like to walk too far.",5,1,4

The only downside is that their suites are in desperate need of renovation right now as well, and I think they are in the process of doing that, so perhaps my next visit will warrant 5 stars.  If you are looking for a great hotel to have a party (bachelor, bachelorette type thing), then Mirage suites are perfect as they are large and not too expensive.  Don't bother with the Siegrfried & Roy Gardens....for $15 it's a rip-off, however, the ""be a trainer for the day with the dolpihns"" package sounds cool (but not sure how much that is).

We arrived at the Mirage by taxi and were greeted by the doorman before getting in line to check in. the wait was standard, the line was fairly long (about 50 people) but went fast as the hotel had enough employees at check-in to accommodate everyone in a timely manner. 

Margo checked us in and was friendly, personable, and professional. She asked how my day was going and we started chatting while in the process of getting checked in. I mentioned to her that we were visiting Vegas for both of our birthdays and because my partner just turned 21. and she told us that she would send something up to the room for us for our birthdays (which we received later that afternoon)  she asked about my room reservation to confirm the type of room and then handed us our room keys and told us where to find the elevators while also mentioning that she had taken the liberty to give us a complimentary upgrade to a tower suite. She also instructed us that if there was anything the hotel could to make our trip a little better not to hesitate to ask as they wanted to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Awesome customer experience and she clearly understands top-notch customer service.

As far as the hotel goes, the amenities are on the high end of standard and the facilities are clean, the pool is nice and the nighttime volcano show is pretty cool, especially if you get to see it from your room. While this hotel is not luxury compared to some of the other much more expensive hotels on the strip, it is still very nice for a weekend getaway and the rooms are affordably priced. None the less I enjoyed my stay and will be back as I have plans to return in July

In terms of vegas hotels I would give the Mirage a 3.5 - 4 star rating however because of the high level of customer service I received and also the hotel in comparison to most non-vegas hotels, I decided to award this review 5 star.

My husband and I usually go to Vegas a couple times a year and last year the Mirage was one of two hotel we stayed at on the Strip.  We got a Tower Deluxe room with a view of the strip.  All I can say is yes, yes, yes!!!

The Tower Deluxe rooms have keyed private elevators that take you directly to the upper rooms.  This is really nice, since the hotel's regular elevators constantly have a wait.  The TD rooms boast a upgraded bathroom that includes marble double sinks, jetted tub and separate shower.  The travel shampoo\/shower gel\/lotion are all from Mirage's spa and the sink area also has a nice lighted magnifying mirror.  Additionally, there is a huge full size mirror outside the bathroom door so you can get a view of of of you :)  

The bedroom area had a King size bed with a fluffy comforter. It has nice closets on each side of the bed, complete with robes!  There are also nightstands on each side with a safe and a iPod dock (alarm clock).  Over by the window is the desk and on the opposite wall of the bed is a nice sized flat screen.  

I have to note too that the Mirage Volcano is a must see at least once when in Vegas.  It is free and happens every 15 minutes in the evening.  It is a spectacular show of fire balls dancing to drum beats and lava erupting to the music.  It was designed by the same people who did the Bellagio fountains. 

Their pool area is a series of pools and waterfalls and has a nice resort feel too it.  They also have the Secret Garden near the pool where you can see Dophins and the White Tigers (for a fee of course!).  

My only gripe with Mirage is the food on site.  While I do like to hit some nice restaurants while in Sin City, I need fast food from time to time - the Mirage just doesn't have it.  There is a deli on-site that is quite good, but my turkey sandwich set me back $15!!!!!  So if you want fast food you are out of lunch at the Mirage!  

Still, it was one of my best Vegas experiences.  No real complaints.  I give it 4.5 stars!",2,1,2

The bf and I arrived at the Mirage via the bus that waits infront of the airport. =) Check in was EASY BREEZY but the trek from the door to the elevator is sometimes a journey, especially when you're chocolate wasted. We requested for a room that was on a higher floor and was granted that wish. It had a FANTASTIC view of the volcano and the strip. The only down side was that it was a smoking room and smelled like my uncle's car. blek. But besides that it was a BEAUTIFUL ROOM. The bed was comfy and housekeeping came daily. hehe. The bathroom was a little bit of a let down because I expected something a little more swanky for Vegas. But whaatevers. Everyone that worked there was nothing but professional and the tram connected to Treasure Island was super convenient because thats where our friends were. They gave a free water bottle everyday if you came into the gift shop which was better than buying it off the strip.

Every now and then, I book her distant stepchildren The Mirage or The Signature.  Neither can live up to the elder, but stepchildren need love too.

This past trip I realized it had been a couple of years (six trips) since staying at The Mirage, so I fired up my standard One Bedroom Tower Suite.  I need the extra space for pacing when I'm drinking alone in between humiliating experiences down the casino floors.

I guess I should thank God I routinely donate a lot of money in Clark County, because the MLIFE Platinum Line saved me a little bit of aggravation.  I checked in and the young maiden at registration wrote down B27 (51) on my key packet.  Anyone who has stayed in the suites knows that they are A-E and the room number.

Logical to assume my room was B27, but it wasn't.  I dragged my baggage back downstairs to the lobby as neither key worked in B27.  Said the key worked in the elevator, but not the room.  Maiden 2 issued new keys.  Back upstairs, they didn't work again.

I called from the hallway because my bulging muscles couldn't carry 50 pounds of luggage down corridors and around slow\/obese tourists-in-the-casino-and-through-atrium again.  I was on hold for about 10 minutes before I decided to carry 50 pounds of luggage down corridors and around slow\/obese tourists-in-the-casino-and-through-atrium again.

Once I got down there, I basically realized that 'maybe' it was B51 and the 27 could be the floor, but I was down there already.  Walked back up to the desk and Non-Maiden (man) tells me, ""Oh yeah, they're not supposed to put that 27 on there, guy.""

Carry luggage make man strong!  I grunted my way back up and found my cove.

That was unfortunate, but my only unfortunate experience, here.  I'm laid back and the bell guy was going to be bringing up my 30 pounds of booze that I checked, so how could I be angry?

Well, after a very large vodka-Sprite, I opened my bag and found that TSA had opened up a bottle of agave I bubble wrapped in the suitcase (I like to mix my own cocktails, people...and I can't make simple syrup outside of the Vdara...another bonus).  (A) Good to see TSA doing their job by making sure I didn't make an explosive mixture of gun powder and perennial nectar. (B) Bad because they didn't bother to close the lid or re-wrap, so I had sugary sh_t all over my designer Guess, DKNY and Buffalo-Dave Bitton shirts.  I was steamin' mad.

The Mirage expedited laundry service was USDA approved, Grade A-Incredible.  They cleaned up those bad boys with a quickness and in time for me to look sharp when I headed north to see some of my girlfriends at the Palomino Club.  The pricing was incredibly reasonable as well, in all honesty.

The value for this 1200 square foot room is hard to beat.  The resort is in a terrific location and the bell \/ valet services are quick and friendly.  That's all a drunkard like myself asks for.

No stains anywhere inside the room or on the curtains and I think my room view was looking out from George Harrison's nostril.

Housekeeping doesn't cut corners and that room is made up almost instantaneously when you push the green button for GO.

We checked in on Thursday April 14th & the room smelled of mildew and mold. So I tried to put on the AC and open the windows but it only got worse. So I called the front desk and Jen seemed to have some communication errors. She told me to go to the new room and someone would meet me there with the room key and the comforter we requested because the rooms had only sheets on the bed. Well, what room Jen? She didn't provide one and I had to ask for her to communicate effectively so we were all on the same page. Of course, I did request to smell the room before going in it because I was weary of transferring to another room if it was going to smell. She said no and that was the last room of the night. So we asked to go ahead and do the transfer and they put us in a smoking room. That's worse than the mildew\/mold room. Shawn who came to bring the keys and blanket was very kind and offered to move our bags and had excellent customer service skills. I finally went down to the front desk and let them know my issue and requested to see a supervisor. No supervisor appeared. The woman just came back with a set of new room keys. That's interesting considering I just got the last room of the night. The third room was a charm because it smelled normal. When we finally got settled in and I opened the blanket, there were blood stains on it.  I'm sorry, but that's disgusting.  However, fast forward to Sunday Night and I must say Mirage staff showed their true colors. I would like to give a shoutout to Dillon for being such a rude jerk.

The Mirage was accessible to everything (other hotels\/casinos, bus, taxis). There is also a free monorail train to Treasure Island from right outside the Mirage.

We checked in early, at noon and were told our room wasn't ready yet, however they could upgrade us to a bigger suite for $30 extra a night. As I knew I would also have to pay the $25\/day resort fee, I was reluctant to pay extra. That would have been an extra $55 a day, which adds up quickly in Vegas. We declined the upgrade and were told to check back at the desk in 2 to 3 hours time.

We checked in our bags and wandered around the strip, arriving back at 4pm to pick up our keys. There was a massive group of people at the front desk, with no real order of line up. It was all a bit chaotic.  A guest behind us was complaining to a manager that his bathroom floor was flooded and the engineer was already up there fixing it, but he wanted to change to a different room. Finally, I got up to an attendant and got our key cards. 

I guess b\/c we had declined to pay our $30 extra, the front desk woman had put us on the 14th floor with a room the farthest away you could get from the elevators. Upon looking out the window, we had a back of the building view of the roof and the traffic congested highway. We really didn't care about the view, as we weren't there for the room. Overall, our room was quiet\/nice\/standard, however a few things stood out to me. When you walked through the front door, you could smell a musk of mould. The fan in the bathroom sounded like it was working, but boy, was it steamy every time we had a shower. With no ventilation you have to wait at least 20 minutes till you can go back in to put on makeup. The nozzle in the bathtub didn't lift up enough and every shower was like having a leg bath. 

The only other problem was at check-out. We had taken out bottles from the mini bar so we could put in our own beer we had purchased. Apparently, the fridge is computerized and can feel the weight of something being removed. There was a bunch of stuff on our bill from the mini bar.

Japonais had 7$ drinks and apps from 5-8 pm which was nice (don't miss the Kobe sliders) My only gripe is that there's not much open for late night food.
Gambling is the same, most the table mins were 10-15, but i found that on most the strip all week.
I've heard the beatles Circue du Soleil show is good, the vibe overall is great and its a pretty young crowd at the mirage. The nightclub JET really get hopping on Monday night",0,0,0

Summary:
The resort fee tops $40\/ night for use of the pool which has become a mess more so due to the patrons leaving their dirty towels and empty bottles and cups everywhere. Well, the staff could be on top of that. 
The gym closes way too early! 

We moved 3 times during out 5 day stay. That is 3 out of 4 towers. 
Second floor: garage and food thrown from upper floors right outside our 'roof' window and a wall blocked most of our view. 

No one told us we could have reserved adjoining rooms for a mere $30 and I contacted the hotel twice. 

9th floor: Ono adjoins rooms and our toilet did not flush. The engineer came to fix it but yet, we had one successful flush out of four ( hell, I'll just say it- we both had our periods so are those the odds you want to play with?) and it dripped throughout the night. the next day, it took more than 6 hours for the second engineer to come and I suspect the front desk didn't put the order in. Anyways, the tank needed to be replaced! 

Seriously, I can't even remember which floor we moved to by this point but it was adjoining but at the end of the hall. 
We were promised the second room at 3, then 5, then 6 pm. I understand you cannot physically remove patrons but when we came back from our show, the room which was supposed to be expedited at 6 pm was just getting cleaned. We did not get our room till 10pm! 

For the inconvenience with the toilet, one room was comped $75. That for 4 women sharing one toilet and the toilet was a few doors down. Nice. 

For getting our room so late, and not having a working toilet, they waived the ridiculous resort fee of close to $200 bucks and only when we checked out did they waive the other room's resort fee. We were in limbo and only used the pool once! 

Check your account. We had to tell them to remove charges through out our stay. You cannot absolutely touch the snacks and drinks on TOP of the counter. Even nudging it with my hat resulted in a charge. 

Did I mention the Essential store downstairs don't price any of their food in order to jack it up during the weekends? Go across to Walgreens and stock up on drinks and snacks, just don't remove anything from the fridge. 

At least none of the cleaning crew refused to give me toilet paper this time!",2,2,0

Another downside is their rewards system isn't with total rewards, which almost all of vegas carries now. 

The environment has improved slightly, but still seem like a scene from the 80s.  Hopefully they will do a remodeling job soon.

After a couple of minutes, an usher let me know that they had some seats in the front that were not being used and moved us for free.  We went from the discount seats in the far back to third row.

Because my friend had vouchers to use for an MGM property, we each paid next to nothing for a deluxe strip view room on the 19th floor. The view was awesome and I snapped some good pics. The room itself is a very standard hotel room and the bathroom is pretty small. We had a problem with some of the outlets in the room not charging our cell phones very well. The self park area is a bit hidden, but allows you to enter the hotel near JET. This was lucky for us because we had barely taken ten steps in the Mirage when we were approached by a JET host who put us on the guestlist and gave us wristbands for free drinks until midnight. Normally I am skeptical of such an offer, but it actually worked out really well and we had a fun night.

Check-in was quick; the concierge was very helpful in assisting us obtain dinner reservations at Japonais; and our floor was very quiet. The pool area is a nice little oasis, although the drink waitresses did not come around very often. Are there better rooms in Vegas? Yep.

I have been to Vegas about ten or so times and have stayed downtown once and the others on the strip between Ceaser's, Harrah's and The Flamingo.  My wife and I wanted to try somewhere new.  The Cons First : It is a resort which to me didn't seem any different than the other Vegas Hotels other than the $28 fee per night for basically the only differing perk from other hotels was internet  included.  The Pros: We stayed on the 26th floor with a strip view and the floors own personal elevator which was excellent.  You would go right from your floor to the Lobby and back.  This was wonderful when you have to just run up to grab something and didn't have to deal with stopping on every floor.  The pool is by far the best I have seen in Vegas and The Hotel is layed out so you get sun from sun up to sun down with the hotel never blocking and shading the pool which was great.  The staff was great and they heard it was our anniversary so sent chocolates to our room.  We saw Beetles Love by Cique De Sol and it was excellent 10\/10 for sure.

Decided to go the less expensive route this trip to vegas and I came to the realization I should've just paid more. 


Hotel: The hotel itself is MEH. Smoke is BAD. very BAD. I came home and I had to wash my clothes twice bc the smoke was crazy bad. Did a lot of slot gambling this trip. Was not offered a drink ONCE.

Rooms: BLAH! Very simple rooms. Nothing fancy. Rusty shower parts.  The window ledge every day was covered in water.  The carpet right under the window was warped. Also the doors here slam SO LOUD. I wear ear plugs to bed and I can hear someone close their door 20 rooms down.

But the cherry on top was the fight that happened on our floor and concluded right outside our room.

We were trying to take a nap and we were awoken to a man YELLING "" IM GOING TO PUNCH YOU THE F---K OUT! IM GOING TO F--K YOU UP!! IM GOING TO BEAT THE S--T OUT OF YOU!!!! F--K YOU!!!!

It's a beautiful hotel and it's in the PERFECT spot. I love the part of the strip where this hotel is located. You're right in the middle of everything.

They have lots of food options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Their club 1 Oak is SO MUCH FUN, especially on a Saturday night!!! Wow, it's what partying in Vegas looks like in movies, it's amazing!

Can't forgot my FIRST impression of the Mirage, when you walk in, you get hit with this amazing smell, I don't know what type of air freshener or whatever it is that they spray or have circulating in there but it smells SO good, it's like stepping in to heaven. Loved that.",0,0,1

We found the rooms to be comfortable and clean, but after seeing the prices of the stuff in the fridge I placed our bags in front of the fridge door so that I would not accidentally have anything from there while I was sleep walking.
OK the good points first ...Carnegie Deli and BLT Burgers were great.  We did find the table games OK and I did have an unfortunate experience at the Ultimate Poker table where I encountered a rather unfriendly croupier who admonished me for asking the gentleman next to me a question after he had folded...not a good move as that made my gambling experience at the Mirage not as much fun lol!  Overall the clientelle at the Casino were not as lively or as young as the ones at the Venetian or at Paris where we had more fun.
The Mirage did not seem to have the same quality of Restaurants as the other Casinos specially the Venetian which is a Foodies Haven, Paris was great too!  The Chinese place was closed at the Mirage (my bad luck)
The one thing that left a bit of a bad tasted was that on the day of departure we were tired and requested an extra day as our flight was not till 10.50 pm and that we would pay for that and when we asked for the discount rates as an M Life member (for a Tuesday) that we had paid for the 5 nights we stayed there, they would not give us a break and wanted to charge me the full fare of $ 100 + tax for checking out at 8.30 pm!  That really SUCKED BIG TIME!

Of course there are those weekends when you want to blow all your money on a lavish hotel room and get pampered by staying in.  But for me, when I'm in Vegas, I'm always out and about.  That's why unless I know that we are having some sort of party in the hotel, there's really no reason spend all my funds on the rooms.  

Mirage is always my go-to hotel in Vegas because for the price, it is clean, modern, and it's in a good central location. The casino is not so large where I get lost and keep walking in circles, but it has the basics.  

If you want to stay in the hotel for entertainment, they have LOVE by cirque du soleil, the dolphin habitat, BARE (adult pool), Revolution Lounge and 1OAK nightclub (previously JET).  

But get out there...It's VEGAS!  Across from the Mirage is the Venetian and Palazzo.  And next door to the mirage is Cesar's palace and the forum shops.  Down the street is Margaritaville. Great location.

Even though it was just me my husband I would go back and bring the kids.

Cons: It was tough to find a seat at the pool and the seats we did find we literally touching the seats next to us.  The buffet doesn't serve regular breakfast on Saturdays or Sundays so you have to pay $26 for the brunch.  But other than that there really are no complaints.

Its not the Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian, or any of the those ""baller"" hotels, but the Mirage can definitely hold its own when compared to those hotels as well. Not taking anything away from it, because its pretty swanky itself.

I just got back from a 3 night stay at the Mirage and would definitely come back and stay here again. The rooms were large, and very clean. The price I got was decent too, $420 for 3 nights (December 26th - December 29th), we requested a view of the Strip, and they gave it to us as well, so that was pretty nice.

As far as gaming goes, if you come down in the early morning (4am - 9am) you will find $5 black jack at multiple tables. On high volume nights, the lowest will be $10 or $15. They're really generous w\ their drinks, and they will comp you fairly often if you're playing the table games.

Went to Jet and Revolution as well, and I have nothing to complain about. Good crowds, just kind of pricey.  I consider $20 for cover a lot tho, just because I tend to bar\/club hop.
I love how the clubs and lounges are basically right downstairs from the hotel rooms. Theres just a really good feeling about getting piss drunk then only having to take a couple steps to be heading up the elevator towards your room.

Although the Mirage is not as glamorous as the Bellagio two hotels down or as luxurious as the Palazzo across the strip, for the price you pay you get your monies' worth.

I stayed here in June 2014 on a World Cup trip with my three best friends and we splurged and stayed in a two bedroom Hospitality Suite.  Highly recommend this suite if you are traveling with a group of four or more, because it costs very comparable to getting 2-3 individual rooms.  The biggest plus is the LARGE dining and living rooms and the 2 1\/2 bathrooms.  When traveling with a group of guys that extra 1\/2 bathroom comes in handy.

Although I cannot speak for the standard rooms, the rooms we had were both clean and comfortable.  Housekeeping was good and always cleaned the room up timely and nicely.

One of the biggest draws of this hotel is the location on the strip, right in the middle of the action.  The casino is not too overwhelming in size, but does offer a lot of table games and slots.  Many ""quick"" dining options are at your disposal, including a Starbucks and the Carnegie Deli, which we ate at almost daily.  Great corn beef sandwiches and the biggest BLT you'll ever see!

The sports book at the Mirage is by far my favorite in Vegas. Quick drink service, large seating area, and many TVs to watch the games you've bet on.  During the World Cup we really took advantage of this area and it was very nice. 

The pool at the Mirage is also one of the highlights.  I've stayed at Bellagio and Palazzo, in addition to Mandalay Bay and their manmade beach pool and this spot rivals all of the aforementioned pools.  Great drink service, plenty of places to lay out, and a very large pool area.  There's nothing better than drinking at the pool all day and then going to gamble at night.

Although the casino\/resort itself is a step below Bellagio or Palazzo, for the value you get I would definitely consider this a 4 star property and plan to visit again later this year.",0,0,0

The hotel employees at the front desk were extremely helpful and professional. I came back during my visit to inquire about a taxi and also the M life program and everyone I interacted with was knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. At check-in you can sign up for M life (rewards program) and then you will pay a deposit for the room on your credit card. Once you get your key cards, you will have to walk through the smoky and dark casino to get to the elevators. The elevators are divided by room number (tower for the suites and then the rest are divided by floor). The hallways are long and the signs help so you can find your way. I had a nice king bed room facing Caesars and could see the Bare pool in the distance. The room has a nice closet with lights that illuminate when you open the doors, a Shark iron, plush bedding, flat screen TV and really nice bathroom toiletries. My room was quiet and I enjoyed my stay. My only negative comment is the carpet. It looked like the carpet had not been vacuumed and could use a little sweep once in a while. 

For our meeting, we were in the convention events area and the rooms were very spacious, the catering was delicious and the service was pretty good. There were times when our bar lines were a bit long and the staff did not know how to handle and weren't the most professional.

It's $1 which is nothing, but I haven't run into that anywhere else. If you have free play, it can't be on a slot that has a progressive. If you do sports bets, most places give you free drink tickets - they do here too, but you can only use them at the sports bar and they have to be specific alcohols.  Your sports book bets don't go towards your rewards points. That's nuts. Just a lot of small things that add up to the MGM brand has some miser qualities.

I was recently in LV for a trade show that was held at The Mirage.  This is a nice looking hotel with many of the amenities you'd expect from a ""resort.""  

The layout is pleasant.  There's still smoke (for us non-smokers) but it's not as bad as we've experienced in some of the other casinos and hotels.  It is, unfortunately, too common for people to walk by or stand near the open restaurants while smoking.  Most unpleasant.

One thing that I heard OVER and OVER on the trade show floor was how bad the beds were.  And, I sure can concur with that.  Don't expect to get a good night's sleep.  In fact, it seemed to be the general consensus that they want you out on the gambling floors, bars, restaurants, etc. rather than sleeping away in your rooms.  True or not, it's easy to believe.

Rooms have wired Internet access rather than wireless.  That would tend to give you a bit more confidence that you can transact banking or other sensitive on-line transactions without the fear that you're going to have somebody picking up your computer's WIFI signal.   This may be the case.  HOWEVER...

I did conduct an on-line transaction with my eTrade account while I was there and suddenly, eTrade has put a security hold on my account.  It seems that, since then, there's been a lot of suspicious activity on my account.  I'm being forced to change my user name, my password, and begin using a digital security ID in order to access my accounts, again.  It also appears that there's some way in which they were able to tell I accessed the account from a mobile computer device and that's what was compromised.   Truly, I have NO idea how they could possibly tell it was when I access the account using a mobile device but... that's their claim.  And, the only time I did access the account with the mobile device is during the time they said things started happening.  Guess just having Norton and hard line Internet connection isn't enough when you're trying to access a secure site in this hotel.

FYI, we stayed in a penthouse, unimpressed, but it was fine with a decent view of The Strip. The website is true to the amenities except that the main swimming pool was being serviced, and the fumes killed off a few brain cells at the neighboring little dipper. Surprisingly, the penthouse does not have premium channels, and not every electronic device worked, but that's not a big deal.

Only word of caution is to go to the pool early as people get a bit territorial and save chairs for friends and then take off for hours.  The casino has about 4 roulette tables going at any given time.  This is fine during the day or late night, but can get crowded during prime hours of 8-12.

Seems the only aspect of the guest rooms that were not really renovated are the bathrooms.  The shower was like a prison shower - the water spit out with zero pressure & a haywire stream.  It's almost as though all they did was put in a new mirror & faucets. 

Housekeeping left a little to be desired in my book - they failed to restock our towels \/ wash cloths properly & took their time when I requested linens.  I actually had to call them twice.  

Join the Players Club- it's worth it!

Mac and cheese, flavorless. Literally tasted like nothing. 

Alfredo also bland and bad flavor. Stale bread. I don't think the kitchen uses salt.

This past trip was my 8th time doing so (and my 3rd time staying in a hospitality suite). I think that the Mirage has one of the best locations on the Strip, their beds are more comfortable than those at any hotel I've stayed at in Vegas, and while there have at times been minor issues, they've never been anything that would deter me from returning to this hotel (obviously).

I will admit that the bathrooms in their regular rooms aren't the most amazing (they're just very small compared to those in other hotels on the Strip), but the regular hotel rooms themselves are a decent size and again, the beds are SO. DARN. COMFORTABLE.

One of the minor issues I spoke of was that there's a real problem with the front desk employees voiding keys. As in, if you are staying in a room with a few people and someone arrives later, more than half the time they end up voiding all of the other room keys when giving out the single new key. As in, this has happened to me on at least three separate stays. It's more of an inconvenience than anything, but you'd think they would have figured out a way to keep this from happening by now.

Additionally, on my most recent stay in the hospitality suite on floor A, the half bathroom had next to no water pressure. As in we basically couldn't use the toilet all weekend, and it wasn't just the toilet - there was very little water pressure for the sink as well. The other bathrooms in the suite were fine so I'm not sure what the issue was with that one, but I hadn't had that problem with the half baths in my two previous suite stays (one on the 4th floor and one on the 22nd floor). Additionally, the TV in the master bedroom stopped working on Thursday evening and didn't work for the rest of our stay. But hey, it's Vegas, and it's not like we were watching TV in the room all that much ;)

Every time I turn around, the Mirage tries to f*** me.  Let me start off by saying some good things.  The room furnishings are not bad at all, and the hot water is very very hot.  They have a very nice aquarium by the front desk, and the pool is great.  All that being said, when it comes to taking somebody's money and and screwing them, hookers couldn't teach these guys anything.

We reserved a king size room and got double beds (they moved us the next day, but if you want to be in the hotel business, that's the kind of stuff you need to get right).  Since they botched the bed size, we were given $75 vouchers for food and beverage purchases.  Great, right?  Wrong!!!  What they somehow failed to explain was that the voucher is only good at *some* of their restaurants, but doesn't include the poolside cafe, room service, or the minibar in your room.

Speaking of the minibar, let's talk about a profit margin that would make OPEC feel ashamed.  Want a 4 ounce bag of M&Ms?  No problem, that will be $8.  A bottle of water?  Sure, that'll be $5.  How about a half sized bottle of Chandon California Champagne (375mL)?  $25 please.  Seriously, at these prices, every purchase should come with a complimentary b***job!!!  All prices here seem to be about 200% to 1,000% of their fair market value.  Drug dealers don't earn that kind of profit margin.

It is pretty ironic, because I am one of the least price-conscious consumers in the marketplace, and I generally purchase items I want without paying much attention to the price.  If these guys are shocking me with prices that strike me as extortionistic, I can only imagine how the poor folks who are struggling to make ends meet feel when they find out that the 10 ounce Coke without ice they just drank is going to run $4.  I respect the ability of the Mirage to earn high returns on their investment, but only a fool or the Department of Defense would buy this stuff at these prices.

On top of that, there is some fine print indicating that the refrigerator in the room is strictly for *their* use to keep these wares cold.  If you want to keep your own items cold, they will rent you a fridge.  Seriously???  My assistant said the fridge in her room was locked and she couldn't even open it.  I think someone broke the lock on the fridge in our room (not that I would entertain buying any of the items inside).

OK, how about the phone?  These guys want to charge you a per-minute fee *for local calls*.  The internet service?  Not worth a rat's ass!  Apparently it will ONLY work in your room, and that's after you enter your name and room number, and according to my assistant, it didn't even work.  The most joy and pleasure I got during our stay was using my own cell phone connection.  I didn't even bother to try their WiFi after losing all confidence in their ability to provide anything, but she said it was total crap.  Guys, please have the bare minimal competence to provide your guests with free high speed internet.  You should have caught on to this key concept of hotel management sometime around 1997.

I can only imagine how many other ways these guys have to hold you financially hostage, but I don't plan to find out.  I'm sure a lot of this stuff is standard here on the strip, but I suspect there has to be at least one hotel available that doesn't gouge you at every single opportunity.  I'm going to try and find such a place during my next stay, and I can only caution readers to beware of the Mirage and their constant attempts to extract every last dollar from your wallet.  

I would have given them one star based on their heavy handed attempt to tack a fee onto everything short of the air you breathe (reeks of cigarette smoke anywhere near the casino floor, natch).  The only reason they got two stars is because it is a nice hotel with some neat features, the employees I encountered were pleasant, and everything was clean.  But at this stage, I simply don't feel like I can trust the Mirage.  Buyer beware: unless you can spend with reckless abandon, call around before you book a room in Vegas and find out exactly and precisely what amenities come with your room.

EDITED 10\/23\/12

Finally, we are home from our term of imprisonment at the Mirage, and I am thoroughly relieved at having escaped their money-grubbing clutches!!!  I have downgraded them to one star, but only because negative infinity stars is not an option.  Once we arrived home, we disovered that the cost of our incarceration was ""enhanced"" by the addition of ""resort fees"" (plus the tax on those fees) that were not mentioned in the price of the rooms.  The explanation for this wouldn't fool even the most gullible cult devotee, but we were told it was in exchange for the internet use.  Which (as I mentioned above) we never used at all.

It was more geared toward people who are up till 5am and sleep until noon.  You'll love it if you are in that age range. 
The pool area: very, very crowded.  We were so jealous to tour other hotels and see people relaxing by the pool while at the Mirage you have to trapse through a mall to get to a pool where you are a sardine for the day with tons of hungover people some who are throwing up in garbage bags.

They are not very attentive at the desk or just don't care.  I asked if we could be in the room next to our friends and they said sure our room is near theirs.  When we went to our rooms, even though the numbers were next together they were down the opposite corridor at the end.  We couldn't have been further apart. At that point I gave up.  They had a great view of the volcano and we had a great view of a parking lot.

I remember going there the first year it opened and watching Siegfried and RoyBut over the past 2 decades it has definitely declined in its overall quality! 

First of all, the casino\/hotel definitely needs to remodel all the game play tables! They seem pretty worn out and the lighting in the casino is surprisingly a little too dim for me! I prefer bright lighting when I'm gambling my money whether I am winning or losing!

Second of all, when I come to Vegas I expect to be spoiling myself because Vegas in itself is a vacation getaway and it doesn't come cheap! The rooms are at a pretty cheap price and sometimes I am even offered free stay, but the interior design of the rooms are pretty old and cheap. The walls are so thin that you can hear everything happening ANYWHERE near your room  (conversations, other peoples tv sets, other guests bathroom, drunk people at 3am) . The bedding is hard and scratchy. My biggest pet peeve about the rooms are the bathrooms. I seriously do not think they have remodeled them since the 90s! The toilet system is pretty terrible in which it flushes fast but the water tank loudly continues for 5 straight minutes.  

I WARN YOU **DO NOT ORDER ROOM SERVICE UNLESS YOU'RE DRUNK TO THE POINT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO WALK** The room service is extremely overpriced (as is most room service meals in Vegas Hotels) but the quality of the food is definitely NOT WORTH THE PRICE you must pay! The restaurants and bars in the Mirage are not too great. 

The last time we stayed here back in april of 2012 we were sadly sadly let down to the point where I know I will never be staying here again even if I do continue to get free stays. We decided to stay because I got a special discount of $39 a night even on a weekend. We arrived mid afternoon to the hotel and went straight to the front desk to check-in, after a 15-20 minute wait (which is usually normal in any vegas hotel)  we finally got to check in, I guess the girl checking us in was relatively new because she had to ask her co-worker for step by step instructions on how to check us in. After 10 minutes we finally got our keys and walked up to the room, guess what? She gave us the wrong keys! They weren't psyched to our room!! We had to go back down to the front desk and get keys that actually worked. After a 2 night stay upon check out I overlooked the bill and it looked fine but when I checked my credit card statement they charged us twice for the same bill which then led me to call the Mirage and my credit card company to get it sorted out.

She told me my bill came to $238, I asked why the resort feel of $30 was on there because my host said it wasn't going to be included when I made the reservation. The $30 fee is not the main issue I have with them, it's how she tried to handle my question.

She stated ""your total comes out to $238"". 
I asked ""Why is the $30 resort fee on there"". 
She then did something and said a ""Your total now comes to $208"". 
I said that's fine, but glanced at her screen (which was hidden) and noticed that something wasn't right.
 
She then said ""do you need a receipt?""
I said ""Yes, I want to see the total""
Then she said ""do you want it in an envelope"" 
I said ""No, I want to see the total""

After the receipt was printed, she started to fold it as if she is putting it in an envelope even when she wasn't, and did it in a way where the breakdown of the total is hidden.

I said ""Why are you folding it? I need to see the total"" 

She ignored me and gave me the piece of paper, and when I checked it, sure enough, the resort fee was on there, and the total of $238 never changed, even though she told me $208. 

The resort fee isn't the main issue because that could've been the result of miscommunication. But the fact that she told me a lower total and then took extra steps to avoid giving me the receipt and letting me check the balance is really sick

I'm disabled and it was really difficult to even get into the pool because they make you climb stairs but their reasoning was that the pool was closed as of last Sunday until next march in 2018 (which I had no idea when I made these reservations that I would not be able to use the swimming pool). 

I've traveled some and this is the worst hotel I've ever had to stay in: the rooms are old broken down (the TP dispenser is 3 feet behind the commode); the delivery is very limited and very carb oriented; there is smoking everywhere so even if you don't smoke you may have to smoke; the casino doesn't have anybody even sitting at the tables playing.

 If you have to get anywhere and you're disabled forgot about it I literally had to hire a wheelchair just to get around because everything on the Strip is made far far away from each other. 

The wifi does not work half the time;  my phone is broke and even when I use it to call room service they can't hear me and I can't hear them.

My advice to you if you want a good experience in Las Vegas is stay at one of the newer hotels at least when you pay money for them you'll get what you paid for hopefully as opposed to this old Relic which is just literally broken down.

The Mirage is nice. There is a nice mod-Asian feel to the casino and rooms. Everything is nicely decorated and very clean. The check-in is painfully SLOW, but once I made it to the front of the line the staff was very kind and gracious. They even accommodated requests for the folks who wanted to be on the same floor or near each other. The beds are very comfortable, the rooms are pretty spacious and the bathrooms have what you need. My husband and I were very happy with our room and appreciated the ample drawer space and seating options. 
The pool is a good time, just get your bum outta bed early, reserve your spot and come back down when you are ready. Otherwise you will be sharing a lounge chair with your buddies. Drinks are not cheap, but you can get ice and bring your own drinks. Trust me the poolside $11 iced tea tastes the same as the one you buy at a convenience store, that said - the $32 margarita is pretty good on a hot summer day...
The dealers on Saturday night were cold as ice. During the day and at others times they were a more fun and expressed some personality. 
Jet was a scene, if you like that scene - go you'll spend a lot of money but chances are you'll have a good time.

Cons: None that I can think of

Because I've lost so much money here, I get comped rooms via the MGM Mirage Player's Club (not sure if that's a good or a bad thing).  Anyway, I remember going here as a little kid and the Mirage has come a long way.  Instead of the gaudy tropical theme they had in the past, now everything is hip, cool, and modern.

They have a pretty decent number of slots and table games.  The restaurants here are pretty good too.  If you're in the area, you should definitely, try Stack for dinner and Japonais for drinks afterwards.

I like staying here because it's pretty central to the strip (i.e. across the the street from the Venetian, right next to Caesar's Place, etc).

I made my way to the front desk and got in line to hopefully check in early. The huge fish tank behind the front desk is breathe taking. I could spend hours just watching the fish and eels. Once it was my turn, the young handsome man behind the desk greeted with a smile and offered me some bottled water. I asked him if it would be possible to check in before 3pm, he said yes and went through the normal check in protocol. Once I received my keys, I made my way to the elevators. I was pleasantly surprised with my room. It was perfect. The bathroom is a tad small but that's ok. Tons of mirrors, which as any girl would that's a bonus for getting ready for a night out in Vegas.

This review is based on a family group going to see the resident Cirque de Soleil Beatles ""LOVE"" show at the Mirage the day after Thanksgiving.

Street access to the complex from Las Vegas Boulevard is simple and straightforward.  I dropped my elderly passengers off at the front entrance of the hotel\/casino among a throng of cabs, shuttles, and limousines.  Getting back out to the street and re-entering to go to self-parking went smoothly in spite of the exceptional level of both automotive and pedestrian traffic on Black Friday.  I found the self-parking facility convenient and easy to navigate.  The walk back to the main lobby from there is surprisingly short, including an elevator ride, an open-air bridge, and an escalator ride.  Self-parking is free of charge.

The casino facility is typical, with everything from ""penny"" slots to dedicated high-stakes areas.  Beverages at the lobby bar are pricey but normal for any major venue on the Strip.

The show is a huge engineering production incorporating multimedia, a highly dynamic stage, and of course Cirque de Soleil's incomparable displays of acrobatics, dance, and special effects.  There are no animals and no clowns, just some of the finest human talent you will see anywhere with fantastic costumes and innovative props.  The interpretive show provides a powerful review of the enduring influence the music and art of The Beatles has had on our music and our culture.  I found it very moving, and was surprised at the level of familiarity with the music shown by my mom and her siblings (I' m 56, she's 80.)

I walked out of the Mirage with a big grin on my face and some of my favorite songs playing in my head.  I would definitely like to see ""LOVE"" again - There is so much going on both on stage and all around that you can't take it all in during a single viewing.  And I would certainly consider staying at the Mirage's hotel should an opportunity arise.",1,0,0

The Mirage has always been a favorite place on the Vegas Strip. I never forget my excitement to go to the Mirage and actually see the famous White Tigers of Siegfried and Roy. "" I could have been standing there for hours watching those gorgeous creatures while listening and watching Siegfried and Roy's Video: ""our family has grown to 23 tigers"". ...Another must see was the erupting Volcano, a spectacular never seen before. Then came the Rainforest, the minute you stepped into the mirage I felt like being in paradise: Gorgeous Palm trees tower way above waterfalls and pools, a forest of rich tropical flora, best of it all you could not just see Paradise but also smell it. The Mirage was the hotel that actually introduced the concept of destination resort to the Vegas Strip in 1989. Years have gone by and just recently I heard that the Mirage went under a complete overhaul. Eager like the first time when I wanted to see the tigers I wanted to see the new and improved Mirage, what an improvement it is. At the Mirage you find more hip lounges than in the entire Santa Monica area, one of them is my absolute favorite: The Beatles REVOLUTION Lounge - you cannot miss the Big Letters from R to N across the casino, the letters aren't just cool letters they also serve as cozy lounge chairs. You feel transported back to the glories of the 60's. REVOLUTION is Inspired by the spirit of The Beatles and created by Cirque du Soleil. The Rooms at the Mirage also had a remarkable face-lift. The new feather beds are a dream come true and the best of it all you can bring them home, not just the beds, the entire room: furniture, beds, pillows, linens, robes, all can be ordered and delivered to your home. You can enjoy a little Vegas-Mirage right at home, since you probably won't get enough sleep while in Vegas this comes in very handy.

The Mirage was one of the casinos that we had the least amount of time to explore. We were trying to make it on time to their Cirque Du Soliel show 'The Beatles - Love' and just didn't have as much time to look around. Our short walk through the casino didn't do anything to pull me back or interest me into coming back for a second look. 

The casino has a Polynesian style and theme but there wasn't anything crazy obvious to give the impression that was the style they were going for. The interior of the casino area seemed to be a lot older and more in need of updating than most of the others we visited. Also, the floors and walkways from the entrance to where the Beatles show is held were kind of dirty with some trash and stuff littered around. It just didn't give a good first impression. 

Like many of the other casinos, they offer an outdoor show involving a Volcano eruption, but unfortunately, we were only able to see it from quite a distance down the street. It only erupts like once an hour for a few hours in the evening, so if you really want to see it, you need to plan ahead and be in place for it.",5,1,0

They did a pretty decent job on revamping the rooms, but the bathroom was very small, and the walls were paper thin, I can hear people walking by and talking throughout the night and early in the morning. 

The next day, we called down stairs to asked for a room change, which they agreed to, but instead of saving us the hassle and offered to move the luggage from our old to the new room for us, they wanted us to checked our luggage down stairs, and wait in line to check in again later in the day, since the room wasn't ready yet.

The only downside to this place is that the sportsbook does not have very many seats. If you are coming to vegas to watch games you better get up early and reserve some seats, otherwise you are going to be standing which can get annoying if you watch college sports all day.

This is one of the older hotels in Las Vegas, and it was designed before too much public concern had grown about air quality, or lack thereof. The air quality here is so terrible that by the end of our stay I felt short of breath constantly. Like most Vegas hotels, the first floor casino is utterly polluted with cigarette and cigar smoke. If you are staying in the hotel, this area is unavoidable. The pathway to the rooms is necessarily through the casino. Also, from what I understand, this hotel as well as many others actually pump chemical scents into the air. Supposedly they are similar to synthetic pheromones. This could explain why I was so damned horny the entire time I was there, despite being barely able to breathe.

The indoor ""rainforest"" reeks of mildew. There was black mold in our bathroom. I felt like I was dying, yet somehow I still wanted to have sex with my boyfriend every day. So, I guess in a weird sort of way, what they are doing is working. That being said, I could not possibly allow myself to stay here again.

We had a two bedroom, strip-view room. Very roomy and great for a couple of girls looking to get away. They did regular turn-down service and when requested, brought us extra pillows, blankets, towels, all pretty promptly.

Each of these places really had their own twist on the Vegas theme. You'll find that each hotel along the strip have specific shows that draw patrons to their venues. The Mirage is probably one of my favorites of the hotels that I have stayed at. They create a very welcoming environment as soon as you walk in with 2 golden mermaids, a giant saltwater fishtank behind the checkin desk and a beautiful indoor garden before you get to the casino part of the hotel.

They have a number of great quick eats (probably more than other places I have been at) which was great for me. I was here attending a conference and wanted to be able to pop in and out and grab food other than what was provided by the conference itself. The Pantry, the Still, burgers, steakhouse (Tom Colicchio!), Stacks, Japonnais all are fantastic places to choose from. They vary in price range allowing for people of all budgets a decent place to dine.

The rooms are spacious and equipped with decent wifi that's free and accessible pretty much anywhere on hotel premises. They have room service from the Pantry. I would say the one thing that really dinged them was that the rooms smell stale. Turn on the AC when you get in there and it will help with the smell a lot.

We were in a Tower Suite, apparently one of their biggest\/nicest. The room itself did not disappoint. A semi-private elevator, awesome floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the strip and the volcano, a wet bar, cool\/contemporary furnishings, a massive master bath & dressing area, and a killer sound system. 

My issues come with the overall level of service. We waited awkwardly for 10 minutes in the valet area for a bellman to get around to checking our bags, which wasn't a great start. Next, even in the ""VIP"" check in line, we had a 30 minute wait (at 11 AM? Really?), and although we were early and asked to be called when the room was ready, it wasn't until I called several hours later that I was informed we could get into the room. Once we were checked in, things were much better, but we had another long wait at checkout. I guess this is the difference between a 4 & 5 star hotel.

The hotel itself was great. Pro's include a center-strip location and a huge tropical-themed pool with servers to bring you all the tropical frozen drinks your heart desires--though I'd recommend it more for the family set than young & singles. The casino was always lively, the dealers friendly, and while a little slow at times, the dining options were at least available at all price ranges. 

We also spent a full Saturday at the Bare pool\/lounge. Check out my separate review, but in a word: awesome.

I must say, the beds here are super cozy. Everything else was good, we spent quite a bit of time in the casino and at several restaurants and enjoyed everything. The pool area is good, but very busy and find to hard a seat on the weekends. After we left, however, we noticed that our SonicCare was missing! So I called to ask housekeeping lost-and-found but they said it wasn't there. Confused, I kept looking through my luggage. Never found it, so I called them back and filed a complaint.

I little musty at first, but an open wibdow for 10min cleared that up. I ate and drank on the strip..so no opinion of resturants.

The front desk graciously allowed me to switch to a pool view on the 19th floor the next day (if you want a room with a good view, arrive between 12PM and 1PM and ask for a room with a view of the volcano right away!). Also, the hotel had recently switched to a satellite television network called ""Tangerine"" but the service was awful. The satellite connection kept getting interrupted and I could not watch television in my first room. Other maintenance issues involved a cracked light switch for the left light over the bed in my first room (however, the light still turned on). In the 2nd room I stayed in, water started dripping around the overhead light over the bathroom tub in the middle of the night... as if the bathroom above me was flooded.

- valet brought out the car super fast
- nice renovated guest rooms supplied with modern tech items
- surprisingly hallways not too noisy
- gaming area fairly spacious

- plenty of eatery choices (but go elsewhere...for the $)

- guest room bathrooms a tad bit small but somewhat manageable

What it didn't notice until later that night is that he broke the toilet seat when he was there. the seat was no longer attached to the base. never got fixed in the 5 days i was there. Another issue that was not only never resolved , i don't think it was even investigated as a matter of fact was the air conditioning. The room smelled musty and never cooled. By the last night i was keeping it set at 62 degrees. I called to the desk at least 4 times regarding the air conditioning. totally disregarded. the last day i checked out via the TV and later when i checked my email from home i was getting emails asking if i wanted to extend my stay or check out.

The desk clerk was a tanned cutie (think her name was Nicole) she was so helpful. Let us check in way early, pick our floor and where the rooms were (not next door to each other). She also suggested we eat breakfast at Pantry, which was beyond tasty. She also explained the mini bar has a weight sensor, so just picking up and looking at the stuff would cost you...a lot.

The rooms were clean, with a nice tv, soft beds and prefect lay out. Will say if your tall(over 6') or chunky the bathrooms will be a bit tight for you. They kept them clean & neat the 3 days we were there.

I went down to the front desk the night before we left and asked about check out. Again got great service and was able to check out and pay a good 8 hours before I left.

Resort fee is $28 a day, but you get free wi-fi during your stay, its was pretty fast and ran smooth the entire time I was there. Lots of tables and machines to gamble at, different food choice at different price points, tons of bars to get drinks at.",3,2,1

The hotel rooms are clean...which to me is super important.  The rooms are spacy and the decor is nice...Each room has an IPOD dock and a large screen plasma mounted on the wall...
The bathrooms are a bit small...and the lighting in the rooms kinda stink (for ladies that are trying to look good before heading out.!)
The service is pretty top notch, we did get a refridgerator in the room to put our stuff in...the check out and check in process was a breeze.
The pool...the regular pool had some chairs left around 9-10 am...not many but did have a few...the music was good and there are servers that will bring you cocktails...there are kids running all over as well too..on the other hand, the Adult pool (BARE), was really a lot of fun...they have very very few chairs...and some bed\/cabana style things as well (if you want to pay the price for them)...the drinks are pricey...the girl:guy ratio is 20:1 (yes boys this is where you should be going), the music is good...but overall good times...

You had the rainforest\/jungle like atmosphere, the lions\/tigers, the volcano, and a pool w\/ waterfalls.  

Twelve years later... the rooms have definitely been upgraded to a more modern take on hotel living.  I'm counting the furnishings, the art, and probably the TV.  The bathroom however, was small.  I think the room I had this time around had a smaller bathroom than the one I had witnessed as a kid with my parents.  The door is right in front of the toilet, so if someone is sitting, it would be kind of difficult to open the door (just saying).  There is only 1 sink & our tub was clogged upon the first time of using it.  

Check-in Process = No wait in line, quick, front desk receptionist was very helpful & courteous

Walk from front desk to hotel room = a breeze - it was a pretty easy path to the elevators with much around you to look at.  Finding the room was also easy (nothing confusing about it).

The Room = I got the normal 2 queen standard room. 1 plasma TV, a desk area, 2 wireless phones, plenty of drawers & a closet with mirrored doors.  Hairdryer & Iron available inside, no need to request.  You're able to open the window to let some natural light and fresh air to flow through (a plus).  Beds were comfy & each bed comes w\/ 4 plush pillows.  There is an ipod speaker\/dock, but it only worked for ipod minis  :\/  Free wi-fi service.

The Room's View = We had a great view of the strip AND the pool (it was too bad that the pool wasn't open during the time I went, the pool was drained :(  haha

Room Service = I wasn't in the room when this was requested, but my friends said that it took a while for them to get their food & when it arrived, it tasted as though it was sitting there and had been forgotten about.  The food wasn't that great either.  This could have been due to the odd hour they ordered or it could have just been a busy night.  

Hotel Eateries = BLT Burger (highly recommend), Carnegie Deli (alright - good b\/c its 24\/7)  I would have liked to try more, but there just wasn't enough time 

Hotel Lounges\/Club\/Bars = Revolution (ladies free admission & open bar 10-12am), 1OAK (my group and I got in for free & were given 3 free drink tix each!), Rhumbar (sadly didn't get to enjoy, but walked past a few times - indoor and outdoor area w\/ TV, heat lamps, and comfy looking patio furniture

The Casino = Clean, open, and nice.  Didn't walk around much, but it seemed smaller than other casinos in LV.  Definitely not dirty.

Check-out Process = Being that our TV wasn't able to turn on on our last morning there, I had to call to check out.  I already paid my fees in full when I checked in, so we were all good to go & it was completed on the spot. 

Side Notes:  About $20-25 ride from the McCarran Airport to The Mirage (TAXI), About $70 for a limo (to anywhere you want) - for us, it was to Encore at the Wynn (yes, a 2 minute ride... but hey, when the taxi lines are long, you have to opt for other means of transportation).

Decent place, not too expensive (got a deal off Expedia - though I will say I though I booked in advance, I checked the prices the week of on the hotel's main website and prices were cheaper than what I had spent on the travel search engine - LAME, but oh well, better to be safe than sorry).  I wouldn't mind staying here again  :]",6,3,0

The check in girl was about 22 to 25 years old and didn't smile once. She seemed grumpy, but we brushed it off. We're in Vegas!!

We asked for a conjoining room and it was available. This definitely made things more fun as we kept the doors between the 2 rooms opened at all times. It felt like a huge room. The beds were extremely comfortable and the place was clean. The bathroom was a little small and I wished the mirror \/ counter areas were bigger.

We left a note and a huge tip to the housekeeping staff to change the sheets of one of our beds, but she didn't... however, she took the tip anyway.

There is also a resort fee that is on top of your charges. You don't get much. Basically, it includes a daily newspaper, which isn't even delivered to your room, business center and use of the fitness room. They used to have 2 bottles of water per day given to you as well, but they took that away. Come on, it doesn't cost much...

Now the pool was the absolute best part! It was a Polynesian themed pool with a lot of loungers and space for swimming. We didn't feel crowded and dispite all the reviews mentioning that the water was too cold, we thought it was perfect. My only regret was that we had time to relax at the pool for a measley 3 hours during our whole trip. 

The Bare Lounge, which was the dayclub \/ pool area for VIP's or people who wanted to pay extra for a party atmosphere was pretentious and filled with slimey men. We got in for free, but we didn't enjoy ourselves. If it's your thing, then go for it. Lots of alcohol, music and 50 Cent was suppose to stop by. For me, I rather have fun in the general area.

The location is excellent and located right in the middle of the strip. You will be close to everything within walking distance and if not, a cab ride won't break the bank.

Location and pool = good.
Service and taking away water bottles in resort fee = lame.

Overall we had a fantastic time.",7,2,2

I had my 5 year old with me and there is no where you can watch a baseball game and there in-room tv service did not offer the channel the playoff game was on (FS1).  Some of the staff was borderline rude for a highly rated hotel.  

The  sportsbook (when I finally went) is a joke.  Most of the seats are reserved only and alcohol prices are about that of going to a really nice bar.

If you have a kid forget it, not kid friendly even though they have the dolphins and tigers etc.  If you don't have a kid forget it, for the price there are much better out there on the strip.

Two thumbs up for the pool (where I witnessed some frighteningly tan individuals) and for the Secret Garden where adorable tiger cubs are currently on display.

The volcanoes were getting revamped and the casino area looked like it had been given a makeover with cute lounges and a nice inside garden.  Unfortunately, our rooms were still old and outdated.  (The Mirage is getting new rooms and are supposedly showing their remodeled rooms this Spring.)  The bathroom is small with the dumbest, tiniest sink I have ever seen...or maybe the faucet was just too big for the sink because it made it hard for me to wash my ace without almost hitting my head against the faucet when I bent over the sink.  The fan in the bathroom was loud and the toilet is situated right in front of the bathroom door so you feel really crowded.  The bedding was really old and the bed uncomortable.  The towels were old and worn and the ironing board had stains on them.  The rooms had paper thin walls so that you heard everything and everyone walking down the hallway.

Service-wise, this place really is not up to par like some of the hotels on the strip.  Check-in was kinda weird with no organization.  People kinda just hung around the front desk...no line...so you were not sure who was next.  Front desk was not as friendly; not mean or rude, but not great  either.   We had reserved a room with a king sized bed, but all they had were doubles.  They did offer a room change for the next day which we accepted,  but you really have to pursue this and call the front desk to remind them.  Then after our room change, my husband realized he left his shirts hanging in the old room.  We called the front desk who said they would look into it.  An hour later, we did not hear anything and called the front desk again who told my husbad they did not find anything.  He asked if anyone had been checked into that room yet and was told no so he has asked them to check again, but whoever he spoke to told him no shirts were found.  He called back, frustrated and not understanding how his shirts could have disappeared so fast, and spoke to someone else. A few moments later he had his shirts. 

The maid service was not great either...our room was barely cleaned yet we were woken at 8am by a maid trying to come in our room.  We did forget to put the privacy sign....but jeez 8am?

BTW, everything in this hotel seemed to be extremely expensive.  A small 12 oz latte is $4.50 + tax.  Starbucks across the street was tastier and cost $3.50 for a grande.  Ice cream on a cone was $6.00 + tax.  The spa had one of the most expensive prices I have ever seen.  A 50 min. massage was listed for $160.  Yikes!  That is almost $200 after tip! (In all fairness I passed on the spa b\/c of the prices so I cannot say it would have been worth the premium charge.)  A bottle of 12 oz Dasani water is $3.00+tax.  (We ended up buying some extra bottles of water from the ABC store in the Fashion Mall, where large bottles of Fiji water were $2.49.)  Internet also costs an additional $12.99 per day.  This hotel left me in sticker shock as I expect this from the Belllagio or Wynn, but the MIrage?  Maybe they are gearing their prices for when they get those new, swanky remodeled rooms which from the pics look like the Wynn rooms.

The good points, this hotel is situated nicely on the strip and will probably be fantastic in the summer...just bring extra money.",0,0,0

My father lives out there and I am a spa fanatic and you can't really beat the spas out there. I usually stay at the wynn or the encore when I'm out there. This time I decided to stay at the Mirage it seems a lot of the rooms were booked up I think there was some kind of festival going on. Wow what a huge mistake. Customer service was terrible. We had a two bedroom penthouse suite but this did not look like any suite to me. It was so outdated and I didn't even have very many amenities. Not a big deal I was only there to visit a couple of spas and my father for Father's Day. But when I try to order room service,  i'm shocked to find they don't have actual room service. You can only order from one of the restaurants and they bring it up in literally takeout containers in a bag. And they expect you to get rid of it after you are done. So you have to sleep all night in a hotel room with smelly food in your room. Our second day there, we decided to spend the day at the spa at Caesars Palace.  We were gone literally all day. And did not return to our room until about 7 PM. Guess what? Our room had not had any housekeeping service! And when my boyfriend calls housekeeping they say I'm sorry we can't clean your room we just don't have enough people. Really? That is the most absurd thing I have ever had a hotel tell me. This is a casino with big bucks and they can't even send somebody to clean our room. Not just a room but a supposed two bedroom penthouse suite. They really should be ashamed. They are very unapologetic. The one star only goes to  the personnel at the spa.they were really wonderful. As far as the hotel I would recommend staying anywhere else.

After staying 4 nights and 5 days we will definitely not be staying there ever again.  Long story short, the rooms were disgusting and our 4 nights there we were given 3 different rooms and NOT comped for how inconvenient our experience was.  Also, we were not able to talk to the manager at all about the problems we were having either.

Issue #1: check in was ok. We were given a room that didn't look over the strip, just the freeways.  We asked for a strip view so we could see the volcano show and what not, but it wasn't a big deal.  On the surface the room seemed fine until the next morning at about 6am we were woken up by a waterfall coming out of the bathroom light fixture. Not just a little water but a full on waterfall that was loud enough for two very hungover and tired people to be woken up by.  We had to call the front desk twice (in about an hour period) and then actually go downstairs to have a maintenance person come up and check out the issue.  After waiting about 2 hrs for it to be ""ok'ed"" by someone we were told that it was also completely safe to take a shower and use the lights in our bathroom. We were told it was probably a broken pipe from the room above us and that as long as they didn't take a shower that we wouldn't have an issue? cheap, but we were both on vacation and I didn't want to ruin it.  After we showered and started getting ready all of our lights short circuited (probably because water and electricity don't mix), even thought according to the Mirage everything was ""ok"".  this is when we requested our first room change. NO way did we want to wake up again at 6am or have electrical problems in a resort room.  Sorry Mirage, but if i wanted waterfalls and no electricity I wouldn't have spent my vacation in Las Vegas... BEWARE, don't let them book you in room 5066

Issue #2:  later that afternoon when we returned back to our room we had a voice mail from the front desk letting us know that we needed to change  rooms to another on the 4th floor right below us (forgot the room number). we had no help with our luggage but I was just happy that they listened to our complaints about the leak issue and relocated us. BUT the room we were relocated to had BLACK MOLD EVERYWHERE in the bathroom.  Immediately after walking into the room we noticed the very dank\/musky smell the room had... at first we thought nothing of it, maybe it just needed to be aired out... It wasn't until my boyfriend and I started having headaches and becoming nauseated that we discovered the black mold issue. Not only is that beyond disgusting, it's also dangerous! We didn't get another room until 1pm the next day.  

Our final room was 23033 and it was pretty good. the plumbing worked, and there was no black mold .  The room itself looked like it needed to be vacuumed and there was hair everywhere in the bathroom,  BUT those were doable for us.


FINAL ISSUE! Mirage never comped us for the 2 failed rooms that we had... they waived our ""convenience fee"" ($28ish i think).  Other than that we had to pay IN FULL for the waterfall room and the black mold. The front desk never let us talk to the manager directly, just worked as the middle man, so we never got to express our concerns.  DEAR MIRAGE, you lost a customer!  We would of responded differently if we were not ill treated and actually refunded for YOUR disgusting rooms.

But FYI, the employee Juan Martinez was very polite and professional.

My husband, friends and I stayed at The Mirage in February for my 30th birthday.  

I got a great package deal through Vegas.com that included Airfare, hotel room for 3 nights and 2 tickets to a premium Las Vegas show.

The room was beautifully decorated.  Big comfy king-size bed, luxurious pillows and a beautiful granite counters in the bathroom.  We didn't pay for the upgraded room, but we still got a room that looked out toward the strip.  We could see the volcano ""erupt"" every night from our room.  

Our friends had the view of the mountains and it was still a great room and view.  I would say save your money and don't pay for the upgraded view.

As for the restaurants:

Make sure you eat a meal at BLT Burger.  It's so good my mouth is watering right now.

Cravings, the buffet, is a solid quality buffet.  It's not like Golden Corral.  It has a great selection of high-quality foods.

My only complaint is that there isn't a lot of choices for late-night eating.  The late night menu at Japonais, well to be frank, sucked.  The portions are super small,  We spent $60 for like baby chicken wings.


The Spa:
There are much better ones on the strip.  My husband got a hot stone message and he described it as very mechanical.  There was a small lounge and non-coed hot tub area that also had a TV.  The worst part is that they automatically added 20% gratuity, so there was no real incentive for the masseuse to do a good job.

I am a local resident who has been to the Mirage many many times to see the shows, etc., but because last night was a Wednesday (work the next day), we had to leave soon after the show.  Big mistake doesn't even come close to describing what happened in that garage.  We sat in the Mirage parking garage (with hundreds of others) for 30 minutes and moved about 3 whole feet.  We assumed a pedestrian had been hit or there had been an accident.   There was no accident.  What happened is that two shows got out at the same time, and the Mirage felt that it was perfectly ok for patrons to inhale and walk though tailpipe fumes from the hundreds of cars stuck in this unsupervised fiasco.  The keyword is UNSUPERVISED.   People started getting angry, and that was the scary part, other then the fumes, because when some of the cars started cheating by bullying their way through going the wrong way, some vigilantes got out of THEIR cars to block them.  It was a showdown between steel and flesh, and we were petrified one of the cheaters would mow down a vigilante.  The only think missing was a hothead with a gun.  And even though we have a supposedly excellent filtration system in our car, it was no match for the fumes.  I now understand how people commit suicide by breathing in fumes.  I am sorely disappointed that Mirage Security knew full well what was going to happen, and did nothing.  There should have been someone on each the six levels, at least to stop the cheaters and subsequent anger. The only staff present was outside (breathing decent air)  at the very bottom of the ramp, using flashlights to direct people to the left (which was the ONLY WAY to go).  We all came to realize that the Mirage, represented by Security, who knew in advance what was going to happen, only cares about your money, not your safety.

Now, the only reason I'm upset is because the lady I spoke to on the phone said all I needed was the original tickets purchased which I did bring in.  I made sure that was all I needed and she said yes. I arrived to the show ready to pick up the new tickets and upon arrival they said they didn't have any tickets and that I needed to speak to the person who bought the tickets. If I would've know this before hand I would had all of the paper work update by since I was lied to all I brought was what exactly they asked for. The only thing they said they could do was was give me 50% off a new purchase of tickets. 

I wouldn't need 50% off a purchase if they didn't lie to me.

I'm a frequent traveler to Las Vegas but I had a new host at the Mirage, Spencer Acma, and he set me up with rooms for myself and my family\/friends there. He went above and beyond to make sure our stay was top notch! Starting with a stretch limo from the airport, we arrived in style! 
We had some trouble having the types of rooms we needed available upon arrival (we arrived at midnight and they were sold out) so they gave us roll away beds. We were able to switch rooms later in our stay with no issue. 
We enjoyed the gambling at the Mirage and especially the Carnegie Deli for lunch and breakfast. 
The pool was also a fun place to hang out until it got too hot. 

Pluses: Casino host, Carnegie Deli, Race book bar, Race book, Center bar bartenters, North Valet attendant, Tram to Treasure Island, Bellhops, good selection of slots and table games. 

Minuses: Mlife Booth Reps (not so polite), Casino waitresses (non existent in some parts of the casino, like by the Love Box office)

I guess I was expecting more for something called the premium view room.

We generally enjoyed our stay and all of the people behind the desk were super helpful and nice to my daughter- which I loved.  The bad: I had a pillow which seemed to not have been clean. I wasn't sure if it was just a stain or if maybe it fell and my daughter picked it up but it had a few spots that looked like it was dirty and my tub (which my daughter wanted to bathe in) had bits of toilet paper (or paper towel?) and black dots in it but I decided against calling room service or the front desk because I didn't want the hassle of waiting for someone to clean it when it was coming close to her bed time. I ended up cleaning the bath tub myself and rinsing it out so that she could get in. Check out was easy (the information desk said I could just leave and they would check me out automatically). The garden was beautiful and my daughter loved it. We may or may not return...not sure yet (depending on the price I end up getting next time! I booked it at a discounted rate because it was mid-week and that's the only time I am able to go because of my work schedule). If we do go back, i'll make sure to check the tub and pillows before we get settled in! I'll probably try it one more time and i'll update my review when that time comes.

Since we were on the 25th floor, we had our own elevators, which was also awesome. It's in a great location, right in the middle of everything, and we were able to walk everywhere. We also were able to rent a car at the front desk for a day trip to the Grand Canyon. There are definitely better casinos in Vegas though. I thought the Mirage's casino was a bit too smoky. The restaurant selection is okay, but again, there are definitely better restaurants in Vegas. We tried BLT Burger, which was pretty good. Otherwise, there's a California Pizza Kitchen and an overpriced Carnegie Deli. I wanted to try Stack, but it was closed the whole week I was there.

Our luggage bellhop said he'd send somebody to help us but thirty minutes later we had not yet been helped. One of stayed in the room while the other went to the desk.

Before the person at the desk returned multiple maids stopped into the room and told us it was unfinished, which of course we'd already noticed. Meanwhile the one of us who was at the desk had to wait unusually long to be helped. There was no line, but there was also nobody even attending the desk. 

Finally, after almost two hours, the situation was sorted and we had to change rooms. We were both exhausted from our drive and to not be able to relax for two hours after checking in because of some error or whatever definitely didn't make us happy.

It was at the Japanese restaurant the hotel has. On our last night we had a delicious dinner at this great ""steak-house"" restaurant, also inside the hotel. One night where my mom had to attend a dinner on her own, I stayed in and got room service which was pretty good. 
The rest of the time, at least for me, was spent lounging by the massive pool which had very attentive service. You could order a drink without having to abandon your chair. But it will cost you, so keep that in mind when you order a Long Island.

November 1989 eröffnet und gehört damit zu den älteren Häusern am Las Vegas Boulevard. Es war damals der teuerste Casinobau und gehört zur MGM Resorts International.

Das Hotel verfügt über 3.044 Zimmer und hat sich dem Thema Tropen gewidmet und man fühlt sich dort wie in einem tropischen Regenwald mit vielen Palmen und Wasserfällen. An der Rezeption befindet sich ein Aquarium mit 20.000 Litern. Die lagunenartige große Poolanlage zählt zu den schönsten in Las Vegas.

Bekannt wurde das Hotel durch die legendäre Siegfried & Roy Show, die hier 5.750 mal von 1990 bis 2003 stattfand. Roy wurde am 03.10.2003 von einem der Tiger lebensgefährlich verletzt. Eine Statue vor dem Hotel erinnert an die erfolgreiche Zeit der beiden Magier. Im Secret Garden kann man noch heute die weißen Tiger und Löwen sowie die Delfine von Siegfried & Roy bewundern.

Das 9.200 m² große Casino verfügt über 118 Spieltische mit separatem Pokerraum, Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, Baccarat, Pai Gow, Pai Gow Poker, Caribbean Stud Poker, Keno, Renn- und Sportwetten und 2.245 Slots. Die reichere Kundschaft kann im Players Club, dem sogenannten ""M life Players Club"" sein Glück versuchen.

Ein Highlight ist sicherlich ein künstlicher Vulkanausbruch, der mehrmals in den Abendstunden stattfindet. Leider haben wir die Show nur vom Stratosphere Tower aus gesehen. Abgerundet wird das Angebot des Hotels durch zahlreiche Restaurants und der Shoppingarkade mit einigen Shops.

A friend was able to get a suite and an adjoining room. He stayed in the suite with his girl (room 9046) and the boys, a girlfriend, and I stayed in the adjoining double (room 9001). We checked in on Thursday, May 11th around 3:30pm.

Our room was the standard double with two queen beds and a bathroom. Since we had an adjoining room to the suite, we basically shared the common living areas. The suite was awesome. Huge kitchen, couch, a dining room table, extra bathroom, etc. Though the fridge wasn't the best as it didn't get or keep anything cold. I did love the couch since it was huge and three people could comfortably lay down on it while chilling and watching TV.

Service here was kind of a miss. We called several times for more toiletries and towels, but no one ever showed up. With four people in our room, I needed more shampoo, conditioner, and soap. Luckily, our friends had extra, so I just took theirs as we needed to get our day started. The Mirage provided the standard bar cleansing soap, hair shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. All were the Kuer brand by MGM Resorts.

We left on Saturday, May 13th around 12 noon, but they kept the adjoining room as they stayed a little longer. Also, three other friends joined us on Friday and they had another room on the twenty something floor. (Note: It was kind of a pain to get to their floor as you would have to go back down to the main floor to catch another elevator to the twenty something floor.)

I loved our rooms, but the service left something to be desired. Any time we called for more of anything, to get our adjoining door open, etc, it really did take them forever to show up.

There are tons of choices for dining...fine & casual dining...and the prices were pretty reasonable.  Their fine dining offered prix-fixe menus at $39.95\/person.  They also had a special for their restaurant Japonais...a special couple's lounge dinner from 5-8pm,  for $45\/couple. Pretty cheap for Vegas! Some great casual dining choices included Carnegie's Deli, BLT and California Pizza Kitchen.

When I checked in, they had it noted on the reservation already and it only took us 5 minutes to get our keys. We rang for the bellman and got our things right away!

If you like blackjack and seriously try to win with your head instead of your ego, read on.
Man what a double deck game. hands down the BEST on the strip. I only won $700 ( for playing $50-150\/hand that aint much) but the rules make it so good. They are the ONLY casino on the strip offering $25 DD blackjack THAT DEALERS STANDS ON THAT SHITTY SOFT 17.
All casinos have changed to hit S17, which benefit the casino.  
Lets see:
stand on S17 ---check
double after split---check (PH u cant do it there jerk-offs!!!)
play 2 hands for the minumum----check
mutiple $25 double-deck tables on 4th of July Sat Night---check
good penetration (# of cards dealt)----check
friendly dealers----ok got me there THEY SUCK MY HAIRY NUTSACK

I bet 2 hands and remember getting a 17, and 18, dealer had 17. She slid my 17-hand bet to my 18, and it hit me 5 seconds later. She shouldve knocked on my 17 (push) and given me $30 from their infinite chip rack. I had to call instant replay pit-boss booth, and they confirmed (overturned bitch!) so I got my $30 but bitch didnt even offer an apology. If the rules werent so good and limits werent $100 everywhere else that night I would be long gone.
Then this schmuck comes to my table, this loser came up next to me with $60 to change to chips ON A $25 TABLE. Played one hand, fucked up the deck, lost $30 and left. Another dipshit pedophile type sat to my left as I was playing alone, would take out $25-50 bucks at a time, jump in and out of the deck and play one hand every 4-5. Each time not buying in more than $25-50. I snapped and told the child-molester, ""Why dont you pick another table to jump in and out of?"" He got a bit scared and startled and fucked off. Then I got heat from the stupid blonde ugly bitch dealer saying I cant do that and that its their business I am hurting. i laughed and told her that:
A) he will find another table
B) I didnt force him to do anything I simply suggested he go fuck off
C) I am betting 2 hands of $25-100 do you want my biz or his $25 pedophile streaks?
D) Well I'll take shitty dealers who are busting rather than perky dipshits that pretend to be sad when you lose.
Man cant foget one dealer, TIM---The Mona Lisa would have dealt cards with more emotion and speed, but I jacked their ass for $700 and pounded a free cafe comp take THAT you douchbag deluxes!
FYI= For ALL people---if you see someone trying to make money at a blackjack table---you have every right to play, but please, have some FRIGGIN COMMON SENSE AND COURTESY and dont come to a table with your buffet money; better off trying a Megabucks machine. And at least ask if you can join the table or wait for next shoe as a courtesy. You are not gonna win shit with $50 bucks, go play penny slots and enjoy your $2 jackpots or something!!!!

First, the walk from the front desk to the guest elevators, like everyone else has said, is a little ridiculous. There should have been a short cut or something. But then I don't remember a Vegas casino\/hotel that didn't have a ridiculous walk from check in to the elevators, so, meh on that one. Second, check in.... I was there at 2pm. Check in is at 3, so granted I was a little early. I was told I'd receive a text message when the room was ready. The woman at the front desk said it may be as short as 20-30 minutes. No problem. She then told me they would be putting a $500 hold on my credit card. Um, excuse me?! This was never told to me over the phone. I was told how much the second two nights would be and what I owed with tax and whatnot and that's what I prepared for, so I took one of my credit cards with a tiny limit to use specifically only for the room. I explained this to her and she was fine with charging me just for the room then, but would still need $100 security deposit. Lovely. Transfer money over that is supposed to go to my car payment and there's my debit card for the security deposit (which is supposed to be refunded immediately upon check out, 3-5 days depending on bank...). She gave me my room key and I headed to concierge to get my show tickets and everything. While in line for that I realized she didn't even bother telling me my room number. Thankfully concierge was able to tell me so I wouldn't have to go back. The cool thing about the concierge was I was able to pick up all my show tickets for the weekend as they were all taking place at MGM resorts. One less worry there. So I figured since I had time to kill I would take my luggage back up to my car and pick up an item I had on hold for me at a store over at the Palazzo. Right across the street, figured the room would be done by the time I was, another thing out of the way. I killed some time, saw it was 4pm and still no text from Mirage. I called, they said about another 20-30 minutes, to call back at 4:30. We're kidding now, right? I've just driven 4 hours, I'm tired, I have a show to get ready for. Ridiculous. So I walk back over there, get back in the check in line (which by the way, was super fast both times, no long wait at all), and get this guy who has a frown on his face the entire time, then finally with a sigh says my room's ready and to have a nice stay. Yeah, you too, buddy. Ugh. Get to my room and I was pretty happy. It was on the 23rd floor, and end room so I'd only have to deal with one neighbor and the view was out of this world. Tried to open the mini fridge just to be nosy and it wouldn't open. That's fine, didn't want anything anyway. The bed was comfy, however if you like to lounge in a bath like I do, the tub is pretty uncomfortable. I didn't have any issues with hot\/cold water or water pressure like other posters have stated. The window in the room opened which was cool, had no issues with the TV either. All in all the room itself was just fine. When it came to room service I ordered dinner once, however was told that I would need to pay cash. Um, why? Oh, that little issue I had with the front desk charging me? Yeah, she didn't leave anything open for if I wanted room service though I told her she could charge out $300. Whatever, it was 10pm, I was hungry, the ATM was just outside the elevator in the lobby, fine, I'll pay cash. The food was pretty decent, no complaints, though I just ordered a pizza and that's pretty hard to screw up. As far as room noise, expect it. The first morning was okay, not too bad, however my neighbor must have had early meetings or something because every morning at about 6am I was woken up by the shower running and toilet flushing (yup, you can hear all that). The second morning I'm not sure what was going on but from about 6am-7:30 it sounded like rats were playing with marbles in the walls. Very annoying when you want to sleep in when on vacation and you can't. Cravings buffet is a little outrageously priced ($28 for ONE person!), so I had that the first morning and ended up doing Starbucks the other two. Overall, if I needed to stay here again I would, but I don't know that I would just to do it. It's not horrible like other reviewers have made it out to be, but it does leave a lot to be desired.",1,0,0

I've stayed here over 20 times and in most rooms, suites, lanais, and villas.  I will say as far as the standard rooms go, they are pretty standard (clean, quaint, and comfortable).  When it comes to suites, it's definitely a huge value.  For anybody celebrating a big event like a bachelor\/bachelorrette\/divorce party with many people, I think the Mirage has one of the best suite values around.  They have many eateries from fancy (stack, japonais, heritage steak) to somewhat casual (CPK, deli, pantry).  It has a club if you want to go, a Dolphin habitat, concert venues, and a lot more.  This hotel seems small, but it has almost everything without being too costly like the Bellagio or Aria.  Also, in your party, there are always one or two people who is cheap and want to hit up a fast food joint when in Vegas.  Not a lot of strip hotels have fast food options. The Mirage is right across the street from Panda, McDonalds, and Chipotle, and they can get their cheap fix on.",0,0,0

There is a whole star in my rating just for the location. If it were planted next to Mandalay Bay, it would be 3-stars. 

On the surface, the Mirage is nice. There are just little things that make it not quite as nice as other properties. The bathroom is small without a magical garden tub that fills with scalding water in 3 seconds, and the shower head is quite sad. The blackout curtains are terrible! I always look forward to the power of a casino hotel blackout curtain, but these didn't really blackout much of anything. Plus, I have really been spoiled because I get frustrated when the curtains are not electric. You know you are bad when walking over to the curtain and pulling on a rod seems like an ordeal. 

The decor was actually modern and fresh in a natural palette of colors. The bed was good. Everything felt clean and new with little sign of wear. 

For some reason, I had decided that I needed a volcano view. Blame it on nostalgia because my first trip to Vegas I stayed at the Mirage with my now husband, then boyfriend, and we had a volcano view. However, on this trip, I was wondering what the heck I was thinking every time the jungle drums started up and fire starting spurting. The volcano view is not the same as a fountain view at the Bellagio, trust me.  

We had no problems with service, had a fun couple of dances in the Revolution Lounge, but we didn't really have an amazing meal on property. 

If you are looking for a Vegas headquarters with the attitude of ""really how much time am I going to spend in my room"" but want a nicer place, the Mirage works quite nicely, but if you are really looking to go super posh, you may want to look elsewhere.",23,9,11

Recently we booked 6 rooms for 13 people at the Mirage for a long weekend. The price was unbelievable for a Thursday- Sunday stay and the rooms and clubs were great. The location is perfect, sandwiched in the middle of the strip, we were in walking distance to almost everywhere! 

We stayed on the 6th floor and the had a nice view of the strip and volcano. The beds were SUPER comfortable, almost as good as my bed at home. Although I am knocking off a star for not having a real bottom sheet or duvet cover for the comforter. Both the mattress and the duvet were just wrapped with regular sheets... very odd. The rooms each had different color schemes and I loved the leather headboards. 

We went in January so I wasn't expecting the main pool to be open but they had a smaller pool and the hot tub open. The hot tub was bumping on Saturday afternoon and they even had an outdoor bar that was serving up some seriously toxic (in a good way) frozen beverages. 

The casino was pretty average. I played a few rounds of craps and some slots over the weekend but the vibe just wasn't very exciting. 

I would recommend this place to anyone and would stay there again in a heartbeat in the future!!!",2,1,2

The Mirage is perfectly located in the center of the strip within walking distance to The Venetian, The Palazzo and Caesars. I visit Vegas for trade shows and the location of The Mirage is why we stay there. 

The only down side to The Mirage is the long walk from the front door to the room elevators. Yes, I understand it's all about getting their customer in the casino but it is a hassle, especially when the hotel is booked. Checking is has always been hassle free and the front desk agents are always helpful. The hotel has plenty of good food options covering all kinds of prices levels and cuisine. 

The rooms have been recently updated in the last two years and from my understanding it really needed it. The decor is contemporary and simple, large flat screen but a tiny bathroom. I like the casino because I rarely see kids running through, it's classy and I seem to win when I'm there...so what's not to like. 

Since my first visit the volcano has been renovated and it is a huge improvement. I was told that the company that did the Belagio fountain renovated the volcano. It goes off every hour in the evening until 11pm and if you've seen the old show it's worth the time to see the new show.

To start, the service on the casino level for cocktails was non existent. We had 1 good waitress in five days of gambling. They were rude when they did provide service. I would sit down at a slot and average wait time to see a server was about 45 minutes then
always at least 20 minutes to get my drink once I placed my order. The rooms are small and old. They were clean but stained carpet, water pressure was weak in the shower, and it just looked like a cheap room. We stayed in the deluxe premium view room. My expectations, being an MGM resort, were high however the experience was pretty awful. Additionally the buffet, we visited for breakfast twice, was average\/below average. We also tried the breakfast at Harrahs and Flamingo. All three left a lot of room for improvement. If you've visited Golden Corral then you've visited the Mirage buffet. The food was fresh and the drink station was neat but everything else was just OK. I'd suggest to spend a few more dollars, go to the left, and eat at the WYNN buffet.  Perhaps our expectations were way too high since the price is more than MGM and NYNY but the price suggests four star and realistically the hotel is a 2 star facility.

 A major con was that the only option for coffee was Starbucks and it had limited hours only opening at 530am. For the early risers, in order to get a drink, you have to walk across the street to the linq for a coffee.",2,2,1

I booked our room through bookings.com and got a pretty good deal (around $200 a night) for being right in the middle of the strip. I requested a room with a view and a King bed. Once we got there, there was a small line to check in which was nice and I loved the woman at the front desk. She was super sweet and noticed that we were newly engaged, so she upgraded our room for an additional 5$ a night. And we also had parking included. We ended up being on the 24th Floor with our own personal elevator for our floor. 
Once we got to the room, it was very nice and clean. We had an INCREDIBLE view of the pool and the entire Strip. Couldn't have asked for a better view really. The room was stocked with waters\/snacks\/etc but of course, it was all extremely expensive.
Mirage has one of the best pool experiences that I have ever had on the Strip. I definitely recommend it!
 Overall, we had an amazing time and spent a lot of money gambling. (It would have been nice to have some free play with the hotel stay.) We ate at the buffett the first night which wasn't as good as I had remembered and way too expensive. 
The second night we ate at the diner downstairs which was highly priced but the food was good. We also ordered room service which was some of the best pancakes I've ever eaten. (Even if they were 20$ haha)
When checking out, there was a VERY long line. Once I got to the front desk, the Gentleman at the front gave me the bill which had quite a few extra charges on it. I had to go through every extra charge with him and explain that was not what I was promised upon entry. He corrected it for me & even included our room service as a courtesy. 
I noticed there were 2 pending charges on my bank statement and he reassured me that only one would go through. Sure enough, after an 8 hour drive home and going to work the next day, I check my bank and BOTH charges went through. So then I had to email the corporate office, and call the Mirage. The woman on the phone told me that she only saw one charge not two and basically implied that I was wrong! I told her that I was looking at my bank account! The money is gone! I asked her what to do at that point and she told me she'd send me my receipt and to go file a claim at the bank. So I spent an hour+ at the bank filing a claim and then waiting almost 2 weeks for my money to be reimbursed! And as soon as the bank reimbursed me, the Mirage magically refunded my money as well. So now I have to pay the bank back for the claim. 
It definitely would have gotten 5 stars if this did not happen, but since I was double charged and they took so long to correct it, I can only give 4 stars.

In the casino, the Mirage is super organized and spacious. But, it is always worth it to visit 1Oak and Revolution. 1Oak is more a club, and Rev is a small lounge\/bar area.

It's always worth it to stay at any hotel for 1 or 2 nights, and this one had a bigger room out of most that I've stayed at..but I feel like you can definitely find a hotel that has more interesting things inside the hotel itself.

A colleague of mine received the same information, as we checked at the same time.  Early afternoon, she received a text indicating her room was ready but I did not.  I went back later to receive my room information and was given an apology for not receiving either a text or email.

My room was nice.  I thought the bathroom was kinda small considering the size of some of the competition; however, the layout was good (had two double beds).  I liked the fact that I could lower my thermostat below 60 degrees!  The refrigerator was completely stocked, so much so that there was no room for anything else!  I placed two of my own bottled waters in the refrigerator to keep them cold, but was almost charged at check-out (will explain in a bit).  The hotel did not appear to have the same flash and pizzazz  that many of the more modern properties have.   So if you don't like all of the flash, then this would be a good place for you.  If you do like that type of stuff, then you may consider elsewhere.

The volcano eruption that The Mirage is famous for, still attracts its fair share of onlookers.  As it was erupting, visitors were gathered all around to catch the action and take pictures and video of the attraction!

The casino at The Mirage did not appear to be not as well lit as some of the more modern and newer hotel casinos.  It didn't seem to stop folks from giving their money to the machines and tables though! 

As I mentioned earlier, upon check-out I was informed by the desk that I had mini bar purchases.  When I explained that I put my own bottled water in the refrigerator to keep them chilled, the customer service representative communicated to me that items in their are on a weight system.  So by adding my bottled water, they took that as I purchased items.

Very disappointed. This is obviously a step child of corporate ownership and neglect. 

Very tired furnishings in the room. 

Horrible neglect outside (trash all over the roof below - the Only view) ...

Property is in a bad state of disrepair. 

THEY CHARGE $18 a day parking PLUS $30 a day for ""resort fee"" (aka: rip off!!!)

Wifi is terrible. 

Mid level staff is very very nice.

Housekeeping: Oscar = outstanding!

LVB was very good food but 20% overpriced 

They stock the rooms with TWO (cheap flimsy) pillows!!!  TWO?!??

2 cheap (think American Registry) bath towels. 2. 

They are a ""AAA FOUR DIAMOND"" property. 

????!!!!!

No coffee in room - at all. Nothing. 

Bathroom walls had missing chunks and stained paint, chipped wood work and deferred maintenance. 

The fixtures were mid-range and like almost everything - don't come close to 4 diamond standards. 

DNA samples on the room furniture, old (original) wall paper, cheap decor, poor lighting, only ONE firesprinkler for the entire room seems grossly insufficient (even though it was a very small room, compared to newer properties on the strip)


Management is ""don't care"" ... ""Sorry""
  ""Sorry"".  ""Sorry""
Oh
And ""nothing I can do... (You guessed it ""sorry""!)...""

Smoked filled common areas.  Dates fit and finish to whole tired property.

That left me a lot of time to wander.  I paid to see the dolphins and big cats and got some outstanding pictures and really enjoyed it.  Seeing that it was built as a partnership with the National Aquarium here in Baltimore, I didn't mind spending the $20 to check it out.  It is very well done and it was too fun watching the baby dolphin play.

We'd walk through the atrium and past the white tigers and I'd fantasize about the day when I could stay there. Luckily for me, the Mirage isn't the most luxurious hotel in Vegas anymore. Because of the Bellagio, the Wynn, and others, the Mirage has become an affordable medium ground between cheesy and cheap strip hotels and fancier ones. My only complaint is that the lobby is pretty over run and crowded. But I guess they're all walking through just like I did when I was a kid. I was also really overwhelmed by how crowded the pool was. But we found a quieter spot on the far end of the pool, drank one of their $18 blended cocktails, and we were good to go. We lucked out and got a 25th floor upgrade. To me, a bathroom is almost more important than the room itself so I was stoked on the glass shower and super well lit mirror. We even went to Jet. Make sure you get there really early - like at 10:30 - so you can take advantage of the free for Mirage guests before midnight deal. Also, get yourself into the invited guest line.

As I look into hotels for an upcoming Vegas trip this winter, I considered the Mirage, then remembered our last stay with them was all too stressful and that I would have to run out of other hotel options before staying with them again. And even then, I would probably prefer to pitch a tent on a sky bridge. 

My friend, Robinson, had booked the room for a college bud reunion, and he specifically chose the Mirage because he enjoyed his previous stays. Despite better prices on comparable hotels, he chose the Mirage because he wanted to give this resort his business. The Mirage had won him over, then lost him very, very quickly. 

Our first night there, we check in and the man at the front desk is lovely. We head up to room, start getting ready for evening plans (the outfit changing, the hair curling, the sipping of champagne, you know the drill) and not even 30 minutes after settling in, we get a knock on the door from security. We were being warned that we needed to ""quiet down.""

It was about 8 pm. No later than 8:30. And here is the part where you may not believe me, but I insist, we were NOT being loud. We had music lightly playing and we were chatting as friends do when they haven't interacted in person for months. No girlish screams, no chanting of ""shots!""... I wish I had that energy. We are all in our mid-late twenties. Our black-out-drunk\/fake ID days are over. 

So, we apologize and we oblige then continue to get ready. 15 minutes later, another knock. This time, security is rude. ""One more noise complaint and you guys will be kicked out."" Excuse me? It's barely dark out thanks to that summer sun, and you're telling me that Sia crooning softly in the background is upsetting the geriatrics that are next door? 

Fine. Edna and Ralph can't find a way to turn down their hearing aids. So we call the front desk and request a room change. As bitter as I sound now, we really didn't want to ruin anyone else's vacation, so we would have happily switched rooms to save theirs and our own. Our request was denied and we were welcomed to the Mirage with an explanation of the three strike policy. One more call to security, and these neighbors of ours had the power to have us escorted from our room and off of the premises. 

We spent the rest of the night rushing around in silence, trying to ready ourselves as quickly as possible so we could escape the silent prison that was our hotel room. 

Discussing this series of events with management was pointless. We were treated like children. Post-collegiate, money-spending, rule-abiding CHILDREN. 

You guys did give us $25 worth of free drinks at any Mirage bar, but because of the way we were treated, I'm only assuming it was to get us drunk enough to actually kick us out. Jokes on you, $25 is only enough for two cocktails made with one cocktail's worth of liquor. We took our drinking business elsewhere.",8,2,0

The bed sheets had (god, please! what I hope are) Iron burns, and rips and tears. Lumpy pillows with no extra's in the room. Then, to boot the next morning when we ordered room service they said it would be up to 1 1\/2 hrs. to get coffee and pastries. We waited 2 hours, called and they had no record of our order. The rude woman offered no compensation or apology. Then we called the concierge they offered nothing to us either. Horrible customer service.  We bought into a Purchase flight and book your room, get 2 free show tickets from expedia. It took us TWO DAYS of calling around and constantly being on hold to different people until we finally were offered tickets. But they were terrible seats. No upgrades allowed on them (even though we offered to pay more)  Lastly, we went to check out BARE, their topless pool and it was $10 for me and $40 for my husband.

First, we were originally supposed to have a double queen bedroom suite, but for some reason they weren't able to accommodate. So we just went with the upgraded One bedroom penthouse suite king.

I arrived at 8 am and nobody was in the check in area to advise me on anything .   There was NOBODY in the check in lobby area to tell me whether I could check in or not.   I had to go to the Concierge Desk to ask for assistance and I also flagged someone on the Check Out counter after 20 minutes waiting only to be told Computers are down.  Ok fine.  When can I check in?  I was told - expect 11 am.  

I also had an urgent business concall that required internet access.  I tried to access the wifi network only to see that I needed a room number.  I have reservations here for FOUR nights, but I can't access wifi because I needed a room number.  I don't have a room number because I can't check in!  And nobody could help me even though I asked both the Concierge and the Lobby Counter for assistance on my situation. 

Next - I went back at 11 am, 12 pm, 1 pm to see if checkin was finally available.   A person called Kim took down my cell number and promised to call my cell immediately when checkins became available.  Finally after another 90 minutes of waiting at 2:30 pm - I went to the  Check in Counter, waited in line again, and finally got someone at the counter who said Yes - I could check in.  I asked when the room became available and they said an hour ago.  NOBODY called me when I was promised I would be notified on my cell immediately when a room became available.  By that time, I've been waiting for 6.5 hours just to get a room in this place.   

I understand systems can go down, but when your staff promises a phone call after I've been waiting for 6.5 hours to notify me of check in availability, they need to deliver on that promise.

Need I say more??? Ok, If you insist. 

First, I've stayed at the Mirage in the past and have always found it to be clean and hospitable. It's not the cheapest hotel on the strip nor is it the most expensive. Still, for what one pays you would expect some level of quality. 

The vile insect was discovered in the bathroom in the morning. It was a baby. I took pics (which I will attempt to upload). From the research I did I found that seeing babies is bad. It generally indicates an infestation, as the babies are not really the hunter\/gatherers and like to stay close to home base.

I immediately went to the lobby with camera phone in the ready to present the staff with the situation and prepare for an all out 4 alarm response. But instead of an empathetic reciprocation of disgust and concern I received this:

Front Desk person: ""ohh, I'm so sorry Sir.. Did you squash it?""

Me: ""No I didn't squash it... That's not my job""

Front Desk person: ""Well most people just squash them"". 

I then asked for the manager. He wasn't much better, offering a discount on a future stay. He actually tried to argue with me about it - surreptitiously diverting fault by claiming ""it's a large hotel with lots of people... These things are bound to happen"".  He (Mr. English) continued by adding that all hotels have this problem - even the Wynn!  I wonder if Mr. Wynn knows that. I took his card and left. 

Since then I've contacted the hospitality dept and received very similar and underwhelming responses. So, I feel it is my duty to inform the weary and unsuspecting travel goer about what might be crawling on you at night. In a town like Vegas that statement could have several connotations...

I've stayed at the Luxor, MGM Grand and (I can't think right now what it was - some suites a bit off strip).  The Mirage will be my ""go to"" from now on.  Great sized room for a general suite.  Lots of room to move around, lots of drawers and dressers.  A nice big chair to lounge in.  Flat screen.  A desk with two chairs.  Big comfy king-sized bed.  

The location was much better than down at the South End of the strip (Luxor) and the mid (MGM).  With the Venetian directly across, Ceasar's and Bellagio nearby.  For cheap gambling O'Shea's was just in reach too.  

I play poker and really feel comfortable in this poker room compared to some others around town.  We ate at Cravings, Japanais and BLT burger and had great food at each one.  

From the bag handlers to check in\/out to MLife desk support to the concierge, everyone was very helpful and nice.  

Great experience all together.

Originally we weren't going to go on a trip this summer but as soon as we saw some good deals (namely, the prices at the Mirage) we booked our trip as soon as we could. We do not regret it at all! We had a great room for the price we paid, with a nice view of the pool and the rest of the strip, as well as the Rio and Orleans off strip. The room was comfortable, and the bed was amazing! There were, however, two things I did not like about the room. First off, the shower was odd. I don't know if it was the water pressure or the amount of space it had, but shaving in it was very hard - it felt like I could not get enough water on my legs no matter whether I was facing it or facing away from it. No bueno. Secondly, they did not provide a ""do not disturb"" door sign or other equivalent sign. Not a big deal, but seems weird given that it's a very basic hotel amenity. The rest of the hotel was beautiful. Personally, the atrium in the lobby was my favorite, especially during the daytime. I regret not getting a picture of it. Overall, it was a great hotel, easy to navigate, easy to check in, easy to check out, etc. The staff we encountered were all pleasant and so were most of the guests (watch out for those who will press the buttons for every floor in the elevator, leave the elevator, and leave you and other guests to find out that you get to stop every floor for 16 floors!).

I like this hotel because it's not as huge as some of the others. Last time we had a nicer room with a huge bathroom, but our room this time was still nice.
One thing is the shape of the building- it gives 1 side a Strip view, 1 side gets the pool, and 1 side is called the ""Sunset View."" Don't take the Sunset View, it's no view at all!

The pool is amazing, one of the best in Vegas I'd say. Huge pool, tons of chairs, plenty of palm trees if you like shade.

Drinks at the pool are about $20 for the big frozen one, which was a lot but it's huge and we'd always split them so we could drink them down before they melted in the 110 degree sun. 

House keeping came around at 9am, super annoying, so put your ""Do not disturb"" sign up before bed!

A real hair dryer that works well is supplied. The bathroom has a loud fan but it didn't take the steam out of the room.

First of all. The upgrade was worth it. I had a great view of the strip and the pool. The bathroom with dual sinks was nice, as was the private elevator, that saved a lot of time. 

The more I travel, the more I appreciate a clean hotel room. Housekeeping did a great job during my stay. I would like more towels though. They provide you with three fresh bath towels when they clean the room, but between business meetings, trips to the pool, and going out at night I burn though some towels. 

Like all hotels, the toilet paper is disappointing. There's a Walgreens and a CVS nearby. Get some Gatorade while you're at it. It's dry in Vegas.

Room service was great! They bring your food all packaged up in a big carryout bag and they don't add a gratuity, so be sure to tip your delivery person. I like the rolling cart\/table thing that you get when you order room service in nice hotels, but the carryout bag setup makes a lot of sense and I liked it. The regular American breakfast was enough food for my companion and me. I thought the breakfast potatoes and the hot wings were especially good. This room service kitchen knows their audience. 

I got carryout from the California Pizza Kitchen a couple times and the crew there is terrific. They make great salads. I always try to get my veggies when I'm out west because they're so fresh and delicious.

I don't gamble so I can't comment on the casino, but I did ask a blackjack dealer directions one time and she was very friendly and helpful.

The convention facilities were very convenient to the guest elevators with a coffee shop in between. The Mirage knows their audience.

They allow smoking in the casino which taints everything it touches and prevents me from giving five stars.

The Mirage greets you with a strange Pina Colada scent that seems to carry from the taxi stop throughout the first floor. It threw me off at first, but I found that I kind of liked it after a while. If you're sensitive to perfumes and air fresheners, you want nothing to do with this place. 

From the taxi inside, I got to wait for an eternity in line. At various points in line, I thought about getting out and registering myself online to use a kiosk. But then, I thought maybe -- just maybe -- if I waited in line, I could score an early upgrade. 

The guy at the front desk asked the usual questions. Had I been to Vegas before? Where did I usually stay? I thought I was sure to get a bump. But after he ""checked with a manager"" and claimed to have upgraded my room, it seemed pretty basic.

As with most casino hotels I've stayed with, they force you to traverse the gaming floor with your luggage before you can get to the room elevators. It was annoying, but not surprising.

Once I was in my room, I was pretty underwhelmed. Contrary to what the front desk guy said, I didn't get anything special. Well... unless being on the 23rd floor in the exact room I paid for (yeah, paid the $10 extra for the volcano view when I reserved) is better than the same room on a different floor. If your benchmark for business travel is a typical Courtyard room, you won't be disappointed (or very impressed) with a room here.

On first blush, it seems pretty decent. The toiletries in the bathroom look kind of fancypants, there's a decent sized TV, mini-fridge, work space, and wall-mounted safe. 

But then you notice that the toiletries are house-brand (and not that great). The TV has only a very small number of channels (bring your Fire Stick). The mini-fridge is fully stocked with ridiculously expensive (even by Vegas standards) booze and snacks, and an explicit warning not to put anything of your own inside. I was mildly concerned, since I hadn't been aware of the warning until I was in my room, and saw the warning inside the mini-fridge when I went to store my Diabetes medication. I ended up leaving a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on my door to avoid having housekeeping throw it away. Of course, that also meant not having housekeeping come for several days. Lame.

I decided to venture back downstairs to check out the amenities. And, that was pretty disappointing, too. Having come in late, The Pantry was the only thing that seemed to be open. Service was pretty underwhelming, especially in relation to the ridiculously high menu prices that were on par with Disney World. 

The gaming floor was okay, but I was very surprised by how small it was. Coming from Detroit, I was expecting it to put any of the local options to shame. Alas, it did not. About the same number of table games, with the same number of people stretching to make the minimum bet. Fewer (and older) slots. Just a big ""meh"", for the most part.

Honesty, I don't understand The Mirage. For all the things you hear about Vegas casinos trying their hardest to keep you from leaving, The Mirage was quite the opposite. Every night, I ventured out to find somewhere better to go. On the bright side, I got to visit lots of other casinos. But sadly (for The Mirage) most gave me ideas for where I'll stay the next time I'm in town.",2,0,0

Pluses:
*Nice room with a 42-inch flat screen....which was awesome for watching game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals in Hi-Def.
*Cool pool area.  We had some friends in Vegas join us, and their 2 young girls loved playing there.
*Early check in.  We arrived there in the morning, and yet they let us get in our room at around 10am.
*Easy self-parking.  Yeah, you have to walk a bit, but I think far it's worse at a place like Caesar's or the Luxor.
*Cost.  Yeah we had a back-side view on the 17th floor, but it was still a good deal.
*Business office -- cool guys that let us make an emergency fax on the house.  Normally, I think they charge $5, but they were cool about it when we said we didn't think that was a fair charge.
*Handy Starbuck inside if you need a caffeine fix!!

Minuses:
*Volcano is pretty ""blah"".  Yeah, it's free....but I'd rather walk down to the Bellagio and watch that water show 10x before watching the Mirage Volcano.
*Bed was a little soft.  I like my matresses firm.  But that could just be me.  Took me til the 3rd and 4th nights to get use to it.
*Not many cable TV selections.  Yeah they offer a few in HD, but I was expecting more.  Why can the Super 8 motels offer free HBO and not the Mirage?  Doesn't make any sense!
*Sigi and Roy's Dolphin Exhibit was pretty....um....tame!  If we didn't have so much by way of Mirage gift cards, I'd probably say it was a waste of money.  It was decent....just seemed a little pricey.
*Cravings Buffet should change their name to Shavings Buffet.  Supposedly, it was one of the Top-10 buffets in Vegas.  If that's the case, then save your $25\/person and eat somewhere else.  My wife and I spent $50 at Wolfgang Puck's Lupo (Mandalay Bay), and the meal was better and just as filling as Cravings.  It's not that the buffet is *bad*....just not worth $25.  I'd probably not complain if it was $15\/person.  Our $22\/person buffet at Mandalay Bay was noticeably better.

While not as nice as some other places I've stayed, it was every bit the equal of MGM Grand and much better than Luxor.  Really booked here because of the location on the strip and the rate I was able to get and wasn't expecting much more than A-OK, which would have been A-OK with me.

Mirage exceeded expectations in most every way (except the Cravings Buffet - gross for bfast).  The room was clean and fairly spacious and the maid service was friendly and took care of things the way you would expect on a daily basis.  The casino had plenty of table games so it was easy to find a seat for Blackjack and, like any casino these days, TONS of slot choices.  The location is great in terms of walking distance to Caesars, Bellagio, Palazzo, Venetian and others which was a plus given the record 116 degree heat while we were there.

One of our favorites was the pool.  Lots of lounge chairs so we were able to find a spot both days we went, plenty of booze options including servers walking by frequently and, we wound up partying with a great group of folks from Houston all day on Saturday which made things even more fun.

Gambling at this casino was horrible. The slot machine selection is very limited and you couldn't win a hand on the tables to save your life. Lost I think 10 in a row once. The dealers were not very friendly and I couldn't understand most of them honestly.. 
It was pretty easy to get a drink while gambling unless you lose right away and have to move (happened often).

Pros:  
I gave 4 stars instead of three Bc of the customer service. Both the front desk and the concierge were so helpful!

Maybe I'm bitter because I lost all my money! But honestly, I would prefer to gamble at the other casinos. the vibe here was a little tired. I would give the casino a 3\/5. 

POOL: The pool itself was fabulous! Its large with lots of chairs and space in the sun!  Our group had a relatively easy time finding 4 chairs all together, even on the busy weekend days. The cocktail waitresses were friendly, beautiful and prompt. Drinks were typical Vegas price, $50 for 8 beers, $20 for a blended drink. I give the pool a 5\/5.

CON #1: We were charged for multiple 'snacks' in the room that we did not use. This is due to them being on a sensor and them being touched or bumped around. I understand and appreciate the convenience of the snacks, but this was a little annoying. As I was using express checkout I noticed the charges, called the front desk and the attendant took the charges off the bill, no questions asked, very helpful. I tried to express checkout again but now I was getting an error to call the front desk and verbally checkout. In the end, the staff was very friendly and everything was corrected.

CON#2: \One day as our group was sitting by the pool, one of the staff members\/promoters for BARE approached the group of 3 girls next to us to invite them to come into the lounge. The group of 3 explained they actually had a large group, 12 girls, and asked if they could all get a spot inside. The staff member\/promoter then asked the girls if there were any 'bigger girls' in their group, because he probably wouldn't be able to get them in for free, they would have to pay. He also then explained that its not uncommon for a group of good-looking girls to get turned away from 1 OAK nightclub if they had a 'bigger girl' in their party, or they would ask the 'bigger girl' to leave. I understand this may be a common practice at a lot of clubs, but I was shocked at the staff member's lack of discretion. The group of girls, along with everyone in my group, were stunned. The girls declined their invitation to BARE. My group also changed our plans to go to 1 OAK that night. Manners go a long way and maybe some of the staff members\/promoters need a refresher.",4,3,2

What a difference!

The weekend crowds were polluted with reality stars (barf) and a smattering of LA trash with 'original' gun tattoos everywhere. It was amusing. The vibe was good and the pool scene was pretty rockin' considering the mix of young and mid-west old.  There was definitely a lot to look at and it was a good time.

The stay was positive, as well. The rooms were updated and clean. Nothing overly amazing but certainly an attempt to stay modern: flat screen, glass top furniture, colorful décor. Hated the shower which looked like the only space not relatively new with rust stains underneath the water spout and an immovable shower head, but can't win 'em  all.

The weekdays were obviously more chill, more retirees, more business people, but still good crowds, fun people,  and a lot going on.

My unexpected favorites were the Siegfried and Roy Secret Garden and Revolution Lounge. Check 'em out!

I only denoted the Mirage 1 star for all  of the above because I didn't give them a chance to correct those points during my stay (bc it wasn't that big of a deal to me). I am almost positive they would've made it up to me if I had asked because their customer service is top notch.

I figured it would be just a typical overrated hotel, but they were pretty accommodating. We were a group of 6 girls packed into one hotel room. First of all, they didn't ask any questions when we requested 3 extra blankets at an ungodly hour in the morning; they sent someone up right away. 

We had planned to spend every waking moment of Saturday afternoon poolside, but we found out their pool had exploded or something and was closed down until further notice, so we called front desk and asked where we should go instead.

Now to the downstairs, many people might not be interested in the review of the convention center, but for completeness let me say that the facilities and staff did a phenomenal job with the multi-day event.

The casino is cool with a good layout including reasonable $5 blackjack tables, fun\/lively craps tables, and a cool poker room.  Restaurants are great!!  I definitely recommend Stack for a fancier\/pricier spot with great American cuisine with a cool ambience and awesome decor.  Also, BLT is a must try as they have a spectacular array of signature burgers and choice of brew.

Across the street from Venetian and not a bad walk to Caesars and City Center.

I received a good promotional rate for them, but even so, I still don't think my stay was anything above average.  This was our first time at the Mirage.  I've previously stayed at the MGM Grand, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Paris, Bellagio, Palazzo, and TI, and felt I it was about time to see what the Mirage would be like.

Honestly, compared to my previous stays at TI next door, I was pretty surprised how mediocre the rooms turned out to be at the Mirage.  Other than Mirage having a tad bit nicer lobby, casino, and pool, I believe TI has better rooms and amenities, and lower rates to boot.

There were several things to point out about our room at the Mirage.  Firstly, the room was not very spacious and the bathroom was probably the smallest I've experienced in all my hotel stays in Vegas.  The furnishings, though appearing new and remodeled, felt cheap and some drawers were falling apart.  The flat panel TV was on the nicer side, but still fairly typical for the average room on the Vegas strip.  The beds were extremely soft (my back hurt the next morning from the weak support) and the sheets were stiff and kind of abrasive.  The pillows were pretty flat too.  I may sound picky in terms of bedding, but the beds at TI, MGM Grand, and Palazzo were superb and I expect nothing less from Mirage since it's a 4 star hotel.  Also, the shower head was leaky (half of the water dripped down) and the spray was not adjustable and it basically sent out a non-uniform blast.  There was a water leak onto the floor coming from the toilet too.  And finally, the curtains were not able to keep out the sunlight in the morning -- there was a lot of space at the end that I was unable to cover.

Overall, Mirage is a pretty average hotel for its price range.  Sure, the location is great and the staff was friendly, but I'd personally recommend TI over Mirage if you want a more comfortable stay at about the same location on the strip but with lower rates (sometimes significantly so).",0,0,0

The pricing is definitely not as expensive as Venetian, just a bit more than Bally's. But the rooms are very nice (I believe all of them newly renovated) , the hotel itself is also nice. The casino minimums sadly stay relatively high, but the place rocks. Probably one of the best hotels on the strip, and the location is pretty damn central.  

The upgrade to the volcano show as well was a nice touch. I also like how it's very easy to get to the casino from the strip and back out for the Mirage while other hotels require you to literally walk like a quarter mile just to get to the front doors (IE. Bellagio, The Wynn). That can get tiring real fast.  

If you're planning to hit up Vegas, looking for the medium-high end experience. Mirage is probably your best bet. Oh yeah and their buffet is also probably my favorite buffet on the strip (yes better than Bellagio, better than PH, and probably on par but a much better value that the Wynn).

They didn't have the requested room ready, so we waited a bit in the casino, and went to our new room about 7. The key did not work, TWICE, and every person we came into contact with was rude and acted as if we were idiots who couldn't open a door. An hour after our initial try the security guard responded to my husband's irritation with rudeness. She wouldn't allow him to finish a sentence and continually contradicted my husband and was condescending. The head of security was more of the same. They were uneducated and crude, and we only wanted to get into a room, that, may I remind you? WE WERE PAYING FOR. The lock on the door was broken, and it wasn't until 10:00 and four different attempts that we got into a room, causing us to miss our show. 

While the hospitality staff was pleasant, and our cabana experience was nice,  the experience with security left a bad taste and ruined it. Paying customers deserve to be treated well. I'm sure that the Mirage is fine as long as there are no snafus, but we were assigned a room with a faulty door lock and treated as if we were criminals who were trying to ruin their day instead of vice-versa. With all of the hotels vying for customers and falling over each other to provide the best customer service, this came as a shock.

The Mirage is def one of the older hotels on the strip, with that said, it seems as though they do their best to keep the hotel from showing its age.

Check in: very smooth, although a little odd, they didn't have a formal ""line"", people just walk up.

Room: 21st floor, no view, clean, modern.  Initially the room was missing a bath mat, no big deal for us.  Showers are a little smaller than the newer hotels.  Bathrooms in general are smaller, but the room was def a comfortable size for three people.  Air circulation worked well, hallways are FREEZING but I think thats just Vegas.  Quick elevators.  VERY comfortable beds.  Doors slamming is pretty loud.

Pool: this is where the hotel shows the most age I think.  Smaller than most vegas hotels, uncomfortable chairs, and old towels.  and the pool was COLD... for vegas at the end of summer, very strange.  Pool area was full for midweek, good thing we got out there around 10:30 to get 4 chairs

Restaurants:  Ate at Carnegie Deli, Poolside Cafe, Fin, and had coffee at Starbucks.   Carnegie deli = HUGE portions, decent food, big enough to split.  PoolSide cafe for breakfast and the food was also good.  Fin was above average chinese food.  Starbucks, normaly starbucks, occassional line.

Gaming - didn't do much but I noticed an abnormal amount of penny slots

Show - saw Cirque\/Beatles\/Love show.  I am a HUGE cirque fan but this was probably my least fave in vegas.  I would suggest going if you are a big Beatles fan.

Spa:  I LOVED the spa.  I didn't have treatments but did use steam room\/sauna\/jacuzzi.  $17 per day (including gym)  The service was outstanding, attendants coming by asking if you need something to drink, it was clean, and modern. I loved it.

Attraction:  Def do NOT do the tiger exhibit.  It is crazy sad, with the small enclosures, pacing animals, it is not natural in the slightest.  I predict a short amount of time before something unfortunate happens.

Internet: worked well, no issues

Insider Tip:  You do pay a resort fee however, you can go to the gift shop and get a paper and bottled water per guest, per day.  This is not well known and isn't publicized
Check out: easy

Overall I liked the lay out of the hotel, I have stayed at other hotels where you have to walk, and walk, and walk, just to get anywhere IN the hotel.  I like the smaller size, easy lay out, and easy to find restaurants pool. etc.",1,0,0

- Resort tower king room was OK
- The room comes with no benefits\/discounts to any of the MGM attractions
- By what was hopefully just an honest mistake we almost overpaid $150.  Because of this we left with a sour feeling.

REVIEW:
Check-in: There was a queue to check-in when we arrived around noon but we didn't have to wait too long.  We did not get much information, I noticed the receptionist checking in the person next to us was much more informative and shared information about the mini-bar and restaurants we never got. (more on the mini-bar later)

The room: I had booked a resort tower king room.  This is a room on floor 24 or 25.  The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was really spacious as well and offered every comfort to prepare for a night out. Despite being a relatively old hotel the room did not show wear and tear.  What I missed were bathrobes, they used to be included in the resort-fee but not anymore.  A notice about the mini-bar:  Be aware that just lifting any of the bottles or snacks situated on the tray on top of the mini-bar will charge this to your room.  (Even when you put them back a minute later)  I had this happen when I took a closer look at one of the bottles of water that was on the tray.  They didn't make a point about removing this from my bill but it makes the difference between using express-checkout on your TV (and skipping the line) or queueing once more for checking out.

Internet: Stable and fast connection.  Internet is free (included in the resort fee)

Service: When calling room service or the front desk I always got a relative fast response and my issues were resolved quite fast.  Check-out is at 11am.  I did not find this information anywhere in the room so I did have to look this up on the internet.  A suggestion would be to make this information available somewhere in the room as most hotels do. 

Benefits: We got no coupons, discounts or any other benefits when checking-in.  When I stayed in Stratosphere last time I did get free access to the tower so I was hoping staying in Mirage would give me some benefits for any of the MGM attractions (at least a discount) but it didn't.  Too bad.  

Volcano: You should know that the volcano normally erupts twice a night (8PM and 9PM) on weekdays and Friday and Saturday additionally at 10PM. I say normally because if the red lights are flashing there will be no eruption.  This isn't posted anywhere and every night during our stay many people have clueless been waiting for nothing as the volcano did not erupt.  It was a waiter from the outback restaurant across the street that has told us the red flashing lights mean there will be no eruption.  

Restaurants: I found most restaurants to be extremely overpriced.  Probably the reason you saw almost no people in the restaurants.  We had breakfast and dinner once in ""The Pantry"".  Food was OK, portions were OK and the prices here are reasonable.  For a good steak, go across the street to the Outback restaurant!

Check-out: As mentioned earlier they made no issue to remove the incorrectly added item from the mini-bar from our bill.  However, when I made my booking there was a special offer for RCCL Crown and Anchor members giving a $150 resort credit.  Strangely enough the $150 credit we were entitled to was not deducted from our bill.  When we did mention this the receptionist transferred the credit to our guest account and gave us a new bill, I just don't understand this isn't done automatically.  Probably an honest mistake but it gave me a sour feeling. I only taught about it myself in the last minute and things like this shouldn't happen in professional hotels. 

Would I stay in Mirage again?
Maybe, maybe not.  As I mentioned earlier this hotel is not any different from all the other hotels on the strip.  So I probably would just pick another next time I'm staying in Vegas.  Stratosphere rooms are more basic and its location is not as good (but rooms are cheaper). Venetian's location is just as good and I found my stay there to be equally good.

TIP : MGM Mlife has a relationship with RCCL (Royal Caribbean) so if you have cruised with RCCL before make sure to check there're no current offers for Crown & Anchor members.

TIP2: MGM Mlife also has a relationship with Hyatt so you can earn Hyatt credits for your stays in MGM hotels.",0,0,0

After you arrive you are greeted with a warm welcome and a nice smile. After checking into the VIP Check Lounge I was in and out in no time. So, I went off to my room. 

What stands out about the Mirage, the single level casino.  If you are a person who is looking for a casino where you have easy access to all your restaurants needs. Then the Mirage is for you. I love the new restaurants that where added to the Mirage. 

If you are a person who is looking for a casino that does not play loud music then the Mirage is for you. I enjoy the great shops that Mirage has. No questions the plus about the Mirage is located in the heart of Las Vegas Strip. 

No matter what your occasion are you will love your stay at the Mirage. I like to thank Beverly and Rex for all the warm hospitality. By making all my transportation from the airport to the hotel. Also, all the dinner reservation. I like to thank all the hardworking people from housekeeping to the bellman. All the employees where always smiling and say hello.

I don't gamble,  and I don't smoke (that's why I can't gamble - staying on the casino floor too long is like voluntarily being in a polluted city with bad air). And although not as many people smoke anymore (or at least in California) apparently some still do and they can. The casinos allegedly pump in oxygen by that's just lore - plenty of people would still gamble if they took air out! The Mirage has one nice restaurant (which Vegas speak means your own famous chef or chef-inspired menu) and that's Portofino (read that review), and a number of smaller more casual restaurants (CPK, LVB burgers, Pantry), all of which always had lines (it always seemed like peak times). Some restaurants have you VIP treatment if you have a gold or platinum MLife casino card like the pantry. All waits were always under 30' for us. Mirage lowest tables starts $15 - they even had a $500 slot machine! The wait staff at the tables were quick to get your drinks. Our room key card for the tower floor rooms didn't work well and we had to have replacements brought up. The sunken bath tub is deep but not big- cannot share a bath- no jacuzzi. Also there is no free bottle of water or coffee - they want you to spend spend spend. The service was good but WATCH OUT because most of the hotels charge a resort fee (not negotiable) in addition to the tax! The Mirage was $32 plus a 12% tax. And you can't escape it even if you book online. All the major hotel casinos on the strip charge a resort fee - regardless if you don't use their wifi, gym, business center. So don't be fooled by the low rates because you'll need to add an additional $65-75\/night! Ouch!",3,1,0

However, my favorite thing about the Mirage is its location. It is right in the middle of the strip. It's easy to get to many casinos in the area, and less of a walk if you want to go to one end or the other. We recently stayed at Mandalay Bay which was nice, but it was very far from everything else. As far as the casino games, it would be nice to see more $5-10 Blackjack tables, but that seems to be the case everywhere on the strip.

FOUR hours later we return, they say oh sorry, we forgot to call, and give us keys to a new room.  Girlfriend goes up to room to get the bell boy to bring our bags up, and I go to pick up the Love tickets now that I have an actual room and they can process it.

Stand at the Love counter for no less than 45 minutes while the guy seems to be on the phone processing our tickets, then talking to his manager.. and they inform me that the room number I gave is not my room.

We arrived well after the 3pm check in time. My friend had requested an upgrade for me but the gal who checked me in didn't mention it at all, nor did she say 'sorry we can't offer it to you' or anything to that effect. Just no mention. She did however mention the fact that it was our 10 yr anniversary and said she was giving us a bottle of complimentary champagne. Oh well, better than nothing right?

So we go up to the room and guess what? Housekeeping was IN the room cleaning up. I was super pissed now. I was exhausted and really just wanted to relax, but instead, I went back downstairs and had the gal give me another room. 

OK, so back up again and I called my friend who requested an upgrade for us and he informed me that he had arranged for the upgrade to a suite and for me to call back down to the front desk. So I called and found out that the suites only had one bed and we needed two, so we decided to just decline the offer and stay where we were.

About an hour in the room, we get a call from the front desk asking us if we were going to upgrade. Hubby was like ""WTF? Don't they communicate amongst each other?"". We had to tell them NO. Believe it or not, after a few more hours, some housekeeping manager comes to our room, knocks and then opens our door. When she saw us inside she was taken aback and then asked us ""you're leaving tonight right?"" I was like ""NO, we JUST checked in today"".

So I was really annoyed with this whole check-in process and even more so by the fact that they were all clueless. We did eventually get our complimentary champagne, but we weren't in the room and it was left outside when we returned later that night. Wasn't anything special -- something we'd never heard of .... we never drank it, brought it home still unopen.

Now to the room itself. I liked the large plasma tv in the room which accommodated our Wii. There is a mount for your iPod which is nice if you brought your's along. Bathrooms were much smaller than other hotels, but it was alright.... I don't spend a lot of time in there so it doesn't really matter to me. The beds were very comfortable and they had the nice quilt blankets which I like. I hate those polyester blankets with a passion and I don't stay in hotels which have those if I can help it.

There is a mini bar in the room but don't touch it at all costs. The gal told me at check in that it's weight sensored and if you touch it you'll be charged. Hubby looked at the menu -- $4 for a can of diet coke, $71 for the Hennessey and mind you, it's the little teenie bottle -- SHUDDUP! RIGHT?

The hotel itself shows its age. The young man said it felt ""Hawaiian-ish"" in the lobby which I guess is true. The casino was really boring. I spent 2 nights in there on the slots but since this is an older hotel, the casino itself isn't very big so everything is jam packed into this small space. I got bored pretty quickly, and even though I spent  2 nights there, it was only for a few hours

On our last night I called down to see if they could offer us an extra night at the same rate. The woman who picked up the phone was very curt and sounded impatient. She said ""this is our rate"" and that's that. I thought it was interesting how at a time like this, when occupancy rate is down and the entire economy of the country is in such shambles, that they'd rather have an empty room than fill it, and also, the display of such bad customer service is laughable.

The only thing I liked about this hotel was the room, but then hubby thought it was smaller than the other hotels we've stayed at on the strip but gives off the illusion that it was larger due to furniture placement. For me, I was more appalled at the customer service from check in to check out (which thankfully we did over the tv so I didn't have to deal with another moronic staff member) rather than the room itself. 

For the same price, you can get better service and better all around on the strip than the Mirage.",8,4,7

Instead of watching the lions scratch themselves and devour raw meat, there's a new, ""hip"" burger restaurant with a modest looking yet bored, snooty hostess. So that's the direction Vegas is going but c'mon, nothing beats white lions.

Years ago, the Mirage was the best place in Vegas. But now I see how the place has taken a step back. It still has great restaurant, one of the best sportsbooks in town, but you can see that it's still a little small and a little outdated. Overall, it's still a great place to stay and have a little fun. It's still in the middle of the Strip and that's always good. So there's probably more changes to happen at the Mirage for it to reclaim its former glory. A high, high recommendation.",0,0,1

Checking in- We got in about 3am, only one other person was in line. We waited a good long while before someone else came to help us because the person checking people in was taking forever. I understand waiting a few minutes or so, but at 3am when all you want to do is go get settled, it was a little frustrating. 

Gaming- We all found the machines to be extremely tight. It made us not want to play at all. When you're playing the slots, and you get the bonus mini game and only win $4-$6 while you're on max bet... it kind of sets the tone for the rest of the games. This happened so many times it was not worth playing. There was not even a feeling of winning at all, not the slightest bit.  $8 ATM FEES! This made us not get more money out as well.. If we felt like we had the chance to win even a little bit, we might have. 

The room- Was clean, and bed bug free (thank you!). The maid service was very good. Actually organized the bathroom counter for us which we thought was thoughtful and a nice gesture. We could not hear the neighboring rooms which is always a plus, and we were not interrupted when we chose to sleep in. 

The food- Lots of restaurants available. We ate at a couple. 
 CPK- was good. The wait staff was friendly. Typical for this restaurant. I recommend the Tomato Soup-Amazing.
The Buffet- I was not impressed.. I wanted to be... but a lot of the food lacked flavor, the sushi was too dry, and the desert bar was lacking...There was nothing I tried that I wanted to eat a second time.
The cafe- Absolutely the worst service in the entire hotel\/casino. We stood outside waiting for a table while 3 people who worked there looked at us and just continued to walk around. I understand that it was 2am or so, but if you are open, then act like it. We then got seated and sat there for 10 minutes while again, waitresses made eye contact with us while we sat, yet no one came to help us. We got up and left.. without a single word from anyone that worked there. It was rude and not the way you should treat any customers.  

Aside from that, I might stay here again based solely on the rooms however I think I would try my luck at another Casino and not choose to eat at the Cafe at all.",1,1,1

So I called the front desk asking for someone to come up to open the door for me coz my bf was at a birthday party couldnt come back right away. I waited for freaking 20 mins still no one came. I called again and waited again another 15 mins still no answer for my quest. So i walked down to the front desk to get another key.

Location is perfect as you are across from the Venetian\/Palazzo, and still easily walkable if you want to Wynn, Caesers, Bellagio, and City Center if you really want to.

The restaurants are great - particularly Japonais, but there could be a few more lunch options.

I really really really like the pool. While they don't have a ""party pool"" (Wet Republic, Marquee Dayclub, etc) it definitely has a fun atmosphere and lots of chairs for relaxing.

November of last year on the weekend of the 19th, I went with my boyfriend and his parents to Las Vegas for his mom's birthday celebration. We stayed in two regular rooms on the 6th floor, which had a lovely view of the strip and the rooms were very nicely organized and clean. We stayed til Tuesday and during our stay, the hotel's staff was nothing but welcoming and provided great service.

When we left on Tuesday to return home, we thoroughly enjoyed our time spent there. A day after returning home, we received an email from the hotel asking if we left anything valuable. Assuming it was I , who may have been forgetful, I rummaged through my suitcase and tried to recall if I may have left something. 

They boyfriend then proceeded to ask his parents if they left anything, and that is when we realized his mom left her Chanel diamond bracelet. The hotel's lost and found personnel responded by saying one of the maids found the item in their room and returned it to the Lost & Found office. We were amazed at how kind and professional the Mirage Staff was with the incident. 

We are very grateful that whoever the individual was that found the bracelet was kind enough to return it. This isn't always the case, as the prior year, my boyfriend and I stayed at Caesar's Palace where he left his ipod touch, and on the way to the airport we contacted Lost & Found as well as the Room Service and Cleaning Staff, they replied that nothing was found. Although it was unrealistic to have that returned, I knew that someone who was cleaning up probably swooped it up.

For the most part, my wife and I are huge fans of the mirage. This last trip, which I will base this review on, we stayed on the 26th floor, in a 1 Bedroom Suite. 

Facilities:
Huge fan of Mirage facilitates. A heck of a lot of great restaurants and decent places to drink. The casino floor is a bit smaller than other MGM Properties, but still has everything you would need. Portofino is an incredible place to eat, as is LV Burgers, Carnegie Deli and a few others. For drinks: Rumbar is AWESOME, super fun place. I use to really like Revolution last time we came, which was a retro club\/lounge playing off the Beatles Vibe. Unfortunately I don't think it was very popular - likely due to their extremely high prices and small dance floor, but was still fun. It's since been replaced by a Sports Bar. 

I find the elevators fairly convenient, and access to the pool and shops is fairly easy.

The Mirage, in my opinion, is the best located Resort on the strip. You're pretty much walking distance to everything North of Monte Carlo.  

The Mirage buffet, Cravings, is pretty awful (especially for the price) so beware of that.


Rooms:
Our suite was pretty amazing. At around 1,200 square feet with 3 televisions, a separate shower and Jacuzzi, walk-in closet, massive sectional couch and living room, huge kitchen, great view etc. we found it very worth the price. The rooms are getting a bit dated, but not enough to effect the quality of our stay. A few very minor hiccups, such as our neighbour connecting via Bluetooth to our soundbar in our room (awesome to have music blaring randomly at you first thing in the morning when it isn't yours) - simple fix, we just turned it off. Cable would randomly cut out at times, fridge was quite warm randomly, etc. But nothing major at all. Beds are always comfortable, and our suite was VERY quiet.


Service:
This is where Mirage suffers a bit, in my opinion. Our room got cleaned once, in a FOUR night stay. And the only reason it got cleaned on the last day is because I walked up to a cleaner (on two separate occasions) to ask, no... beg, her to clean our room and give us some fresh towels. When we arrived in our suite, there was the previous guests' leftover food still in the fridge and dirty glasses on the bar - yikes. Not what I expect when paying for a suite.

When checking out, we casually mentioned it to the Front Desk Manager as she checked us out. She said ""that's no good"" in a very casual (if not a... ditsy) voice, and continued on her way. We didn't want compensation, just wanted a simple apology. 

At Cravings Buffet, you are required to tip before entering. As soon as we sat down, a younger table busser walked straight up to us and said ""they don't give us any of that tip you just left, so you'll have to leave extra for me - thanks"". HUH? Sorry, you're unionized bud, I don't buy that lie for a second. 

We expect better treatment than that, especially given the cost of a large suite, and due to our MLife status. Many other service blunders that I could discuss, but I'll leave it at that! 


Pool:
Love the Mirage pool but gets overwhelmingly busy after about 10 a.m. most days. Last time we went for the private ""Oasis"" pool (~$60 per person per day). Would never do this again. The service was horrible, you're crammed right beside your neighbour, and no real value other than actually getting a dedicated lounger.

Overall, we will probably stay at the Mirage again. For a suite room, we find it's the best value and best location on the Strip.",3,1,0

I remember visiting the hotel when it first opened and staring gape-mouthed at the wonderment.  Now?  Well, the fixtures show their age, the tigers are gone, the carpet is stained and the entire building smells of LAMB (Their restaurant, BLT burger has this hideous lamb burger they make.) The rooms are VERY noisy as well. The walls might as well be made of hanging sheets.

The unforgivable part of my experience was the deplorable customer service. The walls are so thin that my spouse and I were woken at 5:45 a.m. with what sounded like dishes banging together for a long time . . . think carts full of dishes being stacked outside the door or mini-bars being restocked in adjoining rooms for at least 30 minutes.

I called and complained and sent an e-mail to customer service with zero satisfaction. No one cared at all.  They must be sick of these complaints because nobody offered any apology, assistance or assurance it wouldn't happen again. In fact, everyone I spoke with seemed very put out to have to speak with me. So I just didn't gamble there or any of the other properties that MGM Resorts owns.  Let me take a moment here to say that the new casinos on the strip are amazing and really know how to treat customers (I won't name them, but you'll be happy if you spend some time in the new casinos).

This would be enough of a crap sundae for anyone's trip to Vegas, but there's more. I was exhausted, unhappy and deflated from the morning fiasco and so decided to do something unheard of in Las Vegas, go to bed early.  It was 9-ish and I closed the curtains, turned off all the lights, and started counting sheep.  That's when the volcano went off.  Bloody hell.  My room was facing the volcano! It was the weekend.  That meant the volcano would go off until midnight.

I called the front desk, explained what had happened that morning, and asked them if there were any options available so I could get some sleep.  That's when I met the night manager.  This guy acted like an insignificant peon with a super-inflated ego.  He was angry from the start.  He initially assumed I was exaggerating in order to get a comp which was not my intent. After attempting to communicate with him further without success, I told him I would be reviewing my experience on Yelp and other sites and he insisted I had just THREATENED him.  Ridiculous!

I hung up on him and he aggressively called me back and insisted I called him a NAME! Amazing! He threatened to have security come up to my room immediately and have me kicked out of the hotel into the street with no compensation for the other nights I was supposed to stay. He said he was going to give my name and story to all the other managers and security so that they would know to kick me out as well if I continued to complain. Unbelievable! He really must hate his job to be so stunningly aggressive and insulting. 

The next day I spoke with his supervisor and explained what had happened, I was offered a comped dinner and a suite (which I did not take), but really?  No apology from this angry idiot? That's what I wanted. The night manager promised I would never be welcome at any of the MGM properties again . . . . that won't be a problem. I realize it might be easy to imagine that I was yelling at him or aggressive, and in turn, that is what triggered his elephant gun response. I wasn't and it wasn't

Marble floors and a plate with a variety of delectable cheeses and fruits greeted us as we entered the spacious suite. The curtains were automatic to reveal a beautiful Las Vegas Strip with a clear view of the volcano attraction in the front of the hotel. Every night, by the hour, I had a front row seat to such a thrilling and popular attraction. The tub served as a jacuzzi as well and it was very relaxing and enjoyable. The suite was relatively large and spacious, with many TVs scattered about. 

Guests at the Mirage Penthouse suites are also allowed in a private room near the entrance of the hotel, a place for guests to enjoy cheeses, drinks, and sofas to simply just relax.

If you decide to book a room here, look up their promotional deals beforehand. They also have a 10% military discount on rooms. We were on the 9th floor in a king with a strip\/pool view. They charge extra for the strip or pool view rooms so we just went with the regular room and lucked out. Room was clean and updated. The bed was super comfy. Bathroom was nice and clean but a little small. I'm not complaining. Be careful with the mini bar, if you take something out for more then 10 seconds it will charge to your room. My wife pulled out the $30 lollipop to look at it and it got charged to the room. We realized it right away so I called the front desk and they removed the charge right away. I'm sure it happens all the time. The pool was nice but extremely cold. Drinks are pricey but that's to be expected. The hotel lobby has a big beautiful fish tank behind the check in desk and there is also a jungle style waterfall as you walk to the guest elevators. If you're lucky, you can catch the outdoor volcano show which was awesome! We were across the street walking back from the venetian and we could feel the heat of the flames! The only thing I didn't like was the long walk from the check in desk to the guest elevators. It was a hike through the casino maze. Easy to get lost when you first get there but just follow the crowd and the signs and you'll be fine. All in all we enjoyed our stay and I'd stay there again. There is also a dolphin habitat and white tigers and lions. You have to pay to see them but its worth it if you're into that kind of thing. Good for kids. This hotel seemed kid friendly for those of you with kids. For those of you without kids, like us, the kids didn't bother us. They would run into the hot tub every now and again to warm up from the cold pool but then they'd run back to the pool. Didn't bother us at all. I recommend this hotel.

Unacceptable room assignment - requested upper floor for quietness, still somehow managed to be assigned next door to room of drunk males clearly there for leisure. Co-worker experienced same issue on a separate floor, nearly a security concern.

Room furniture requires updating. In two recent visits, desk chair upholstery was peeling and other furniture visibly chipped. Conversely, bathrooms are done well, as is overall lighting.

Front desk seems under-staffed and can be rather inefficient, with lines unmanageably long due to long processing times per guest. Front desk area often appears chaotic and cluttered as a result of staff struggling to service guests efficiently.

The best quality of the resort, by far, was the location. It was close to and within walking distance of most of the attractions we wanted to see. I also found the concierge to be very helpful in helping us navigate the bus system. The biggest downfall, which had a major impact on our experience with the hotel, was the noise. We found that the walls\/door were paper thin. You can only expect people to be loud and coming back to their room late\/early in the morning while in Vegas. But we could hear EVERYTHING happening in the hallway as if there wasn't even a door there. Therefore it was very difficult to sleep, day or night. This unfortunate issue very much impacted our overall experience with the resort.

Here is a breakdown on a few other things:

The room:
The bed was very comfortable but I thought it was strange that the bed didn't really have a blanket on it? There were also no extra blankets or pillows in the room. The bed had several layers of sheets which were tucked into the bed tightly. The thing that gave off the ""age"" of the room was that there were no outlets anywhere near the bed, so I couldn't charge my phone near the bed. There was a charging station near the desk. There was also an ipod docking station. As with most Vegas hotel rooms there was no coffee maker or mini fridge. There was a very stocked mini-bar with outrageous prices and an ice bucket--that's about it. The bathroom is very small. The only + about the bathroom was that it was well lit.
Casino\/Resort
We didn't gamble, shop or use the pool at the resort at all, so I cannot comment on it. The lobby, hallways, room etc were very clean and well kept. It did not have a strong cigarette smell but you could smell the perfume being pumped into the common areas.
We ate at the buffet (because we had 2 free passes) & we found it to be poor\/average. I remember the Luxor's buffet being better quality. We did not eat at any of the other restaurants since they all have sub-par reviews and there were so many excellent restaurants within walking distance at nearby resorts. When we checked in I asked about the Spa\/Salon & the staff person gave us a free 1 days pass to enjoy.
Spa\/Salon
Very clean, tranquil environment. Our free day pass granted us access to the sauna, steam room, hot\/cold tubs, and showers. When my husband and I arrived we found out they had separate spa(s) for women & men--which I found out later was because they are clothing optional. If you stay at the Mirage, I would recommend the Spa! Very relaxing and the staff were excellent.",4,2,3

I stayed in a room that overlooked the strip and every night at 8pm we were treated to the Mirage Volcano show right from our room. We only had one issue the entire time. We noticed that whomsoever was in the room before us got into the minibar and drank a ate small amounts of stuff and placed the items back like they were never opened. I called the front desk and they said not to worry. We had a great time but we wish the food could have been better.

The Mirage is less than clean in the public areas. The pool and pool area are filthy. The sidewalk badly needs power washing and the pool vacuuming. 

The casino carpet is worn and stained and needs replacing. 

The walkways in the hotel front are gum and cigarette covered and are disgusting.

My friend and I were trying to decide between the Bellagio, Mirage and Venetian.  We chose the Mirage because the prices for the Bellagio that weekend were exceptionally high and I had stayed at the Venetian before and wanted to try something new.

I was very happy with many aspects of the hotel.  It was more beautiful than I remembered.  I love how the hotel looks from the outside.  The volcano, water and Beatles decorations are all very visually appealing.  The volcano eruptions at night are a lot of fun to watch.  The lobby and Atrium are also really cool to walk around.  The check in desk has a huge tropical fish tank all along the walls.

Beatles LOVE is performed right inside the hotel.  It is an absolutely phenomenal show and I recommend it to anybody who enjoys their music.  My friend and I ended up doing the dinner & show package at the Mirage, which got us a $55 meal at Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steakhouse and excellent seats at the show.  It was a great deal.

The hotel has dining options of all varieties.  Heritage Steakhouse is a delicious upscale restaurant.  They also have a Carnegie deli, Starbucks and a diner called The Pantry, for those looking for a quicker, less expensive meal.  They also have a BLT Burger, Cravings Buffet, a Japanese restaurant and a Brazilian steakhouse.  They also have a nightclub called 1 OAK that seemed very nice.  John Legend was hosting a party there during our stay.

The pool is gorgeous.  The setup is nice.  There are lots of comfortable chairs for suntanning that are strategically placed so that they can accommodate large crowds, without anybody getting in each other's way.  There is also a beach club called Bare attached to the pool. 

The rooms were nice and clean.  They overlooked the pool and the strip.  The beds were comfortable.  The customer service was excellent.  All of our requests were responded to promptly.

Although I loved most things about my experience at the Mirage, there were a few things that I found to be frustrating:

1.  I specifically requested an early check in.  They had told me they could accommodate it.  I arrived at 10:00 a.m.  They told me the room should be ready within 2 hours.  The room was not ready until 2:00 p.m.!  Luckily, Vegas is a fun place to walk around aimlessly.
2.  As with all Vegas hotels, patrons are allowed to smoke.  The Mirage Casino seemed to be extra clouded with smoke, compared to the other hotel casinos.  I saw a theory online that this is because the ceilings are low and the smoke tends to gather more densely.  As a non-smoker, I found this to be extremely unpleasant.
3.  The Dolphin Exhibit\/Secret Garden is very sad to walk through.  The accommodations for the animals are outdated and dingy. It is in desperate need of renovation.

Other than those three points, my stay was wonderful.  I would certainly stay at the Mirage again.  The value is excellent!",10,1,1

***PROS:
- Located in middle of the Strip, very convenient to almost everything
- Smaller than some other casino-hotels..easy to get around.  Pool is just a short walk from room elevators (unlike MGM Grand and others, where you have to walk 90 miles to the pool).
- ALL the employees we encountered-- cocktail servers, dealers, maids, check in, etc. were super friendly, nice, helpful, made us feel ""at home"".
- Great price for what we get there
- Plants\/trees on the grounds are so pretty.  Love the pool: no gimmicks like a floating river, just a nice pool, with beautiful grounds, and wonderful chilled water coming over the waterfalls, which made it so refreshing even though it was 118 degeees!!!
- Nice restaurants:  Calif. Pizza Kitchen has excellent pizza; Love the Burger joint, and also the Carnegie Deli (yum! sandwiches are HUGE!!).  
***CONS:
- Room was so very BIG, but bathroom was TINY! I wish they'd taken 3 or 4 feet off the huge, waste of space room, and made the bathroom bigger
- Hardly ever saw $5 craps.  So I didnt' play!  HATE the new automatic video craps machines.. air horn sounds, bells, yuck. Want the social interaction of playing craps at the tables.. but even at 10am on a Tuesday am-- no $5 tables.  And at night, the one $10 table had 90 people crowded around it (no space to join in), but two $25 tables were empty and quiet.  WHY? 
- Nice ""casual"" restaurants, but no really NICE, super restaurant.  But soon a new steakhouse to open, will that fill the bill?

I have booked rooms on numerous occasions across the strip and had no problem in doing so. This time around, I was helping my friend host a party at the Mirage's 2 bedroom hospitality suite (1700+ square feet). Knowing it was best to book the room early in regards to cost and availability, we reserved the room at least a month and a half prior to the arrival date which was 12\/29\/16. We already paid for the reservation, all we needed to do now was pay the remaining resort fee and taxes once we were able to check-in. 

On the day of, I get a call from a hotel representative named, JD, saying that our room will not be ready at check-in time (3 pm), but instead be able to check-in at 3:30-4pm. Honestly, that was not a big problem. Due to the inconvenience, he also offered to give us 2 standard rooms free of charge and $100 worth of food and beverage, but for this specific event we wanted to make sure the rooms were spacious enough for our guests and did not like the idea of separating our guests into two rooms. As a result, we declined that offer despite it being a generous one and settled for a later check-in time. 

Once we arrived at check-in on 12\/29\/16 around 4 p.m. everything was going as planned until the front desk representative (I believe her name was Vanna) told me that the room we reserved over a month and a half ago is no longer available. Do you understand the amount of inconvenience that was? What's the point of reserving the room in advance and being told the room is unavailable? She then offered us to downgrade from the 2 bedroom hospitality suite to a 1 bedroom penthouse suite with a reasonable discount and an additional queen bedroom, mind you the square footage on the penthouse suite was around 1200. That's a 500 square foot difference in comparison to the hospitality suite which was 1700+ square foot. Running out of time and options, we agreed to the 1 bedroom penthouse suite. Vanna then goes back there to talk to her manager about our agreement to inform us that the penthouse suite is no longer available as well. Are you serious? How unorganized can the Mirage be? Don't try to convince your guests about downgrading to find out that the downgrade was not available to even begin with. She then offered a second downgrade with 2 regular sized rooms that had a connecting door. Like I mentioned earlier, we needed a larger room to accommodate the size of our event. By this time, the square footage of the room has nearly been cut in half. My friend and I were not going to settle for 2 tiny rooms and asked for a full refund. 

Vanna briefly mentioned to us that the manager is saving the hospitality suites for those high-limit poker players (basically richer guests), I would assume it's because of the new year and they would want to bring in more money into the Mirage. Isn't that discrimination? Just because one guest has more money over another guest does not mean you treat and value them any differently. We reserved this hospitality suite in a timely manner, to have it be taken away from us because of richer guests? That's not how casinos should ever treat their guests. 

Although Vanna was very polite throughout the whole process and simply the messenger of the Mirage, the amount of inconvenience was extremely overwhelming. I understand that she is not the one to blame, but if anything blame the management for being unorganized by underestimating the amount of business they will have. Everything was so last minute, if they could have informed us that they were overbooked several days earlier it would have been more easier on us to find a different hotel room rather than scrambling around the Mirage's front desk area and furiously calling other casinos to see if they had any rooms available that same night. 

Overall, extremely dissatisfied in Mirage's ability to communicate with their guests about unexpected delays and room availability. As well as the discrimination towards accommodating guests with more money in comparison to the guests who reserved the room within a reasonable amount of time. Would not recommend to anyone wanting to reserve a room here in advance, to find out the room that you reserved will not be available to you upon arrival. Knowing that this would have happened, my friend and I could have saved a lot of money and precious time on a different hotel room.",10,3,2

Chairs seem clean due to the pleathery fabric, unlike a lot of other casinos that have cloth chairs. Ambiance is good as well, not too dark but light enough to see the slot lights glow.

However, being one of the older casinos, the ceilings are low, which mean you can really smell all the cigarette smoke, unlike newer casinos with high ceilings. Another thing is that it took awhile to receive my winnings from the cashier, but I assume that is the case for all casinos. 

Although it's a minor point, I don't like casinos that have clubs near the entrance doors. It's a hassle getting through to the casino, and I get embarrassed by how ghetto I look compared to all the dressy club-goers.

Worst part has to be getting out of the parking lot. Getting out is very confusing and you could easily miss the exit lane. Also getting out takes time. There are two lanes to get into, but one lane to get out. This leads to long exit times even if there aren't many cars leaving at the same time.",3,0,0

First of all, our room was at THE VERY END of the hallway from the elevators. It felt like a mile walk to our room. Second, the room just wasn't that great for what we paid. The room was a decent size, but what got me was how small the bathroom was. It was tiny, only about one person can fit at a time. There was also no tub. I expected a big spacious bathroom but nope. Tiny. Even our room at Planet Hollywood was better, and so was the PH bathroom, and it was cheaper too.

I chose the less expense suites on floors 24-25.  The problem with these suites are that they are situated next to the elevators.  The whirling of the elevator was tolerable but the banging of the cables made it very difficult to sleep.  The room's amenities were lovely and clean as usual.

It's nothing to write home about, but we had a good time until the last hour.  We found $10 minimum pai gow tables at 1 pm on a Saturday.  They raised the mins to $25 around 5 pm, but of course we were grandfathered in.  

The whole time, the dealer alternated between Helen and Theresa.  We liked Helen, but Theresa was a bit bristly.  Then when we started to smoke cigars, she got really bitchy, stopping all banter, constantly telling us to hold them under the table, making annoyed body language, etc.  I hate cigarette smoke, so I understand, and we were as courteous as possible, but come on--you work in a casino.  Get over it.  Her sour attitude really killed the fun atmosphere that we had going.

Three other things:  
1.  They serve Glenlivet here, one of the rare casinos where you can get single-malt scotch on the main floor.  But three of us agreed that it had a strange aftertaste.  We decided that it was probably Glenlivet based on the nose and initial taste, but perhaps they don't clean their glasses well enough?
2.  They have handy shoulder-level shelves above the urinals in the men's room--to keep your drink nice and high and out of danger.
3.  The cigars were comped without a fuss, but they were labelled with the Mirage logo, so I don't know what brand they were.  They were okay, smooth but maybe a little bland.",3,0,1

*Bare:  awesome, between a typical pool experience and a crazy encore beach club experience.  Crazy enough to be fun but chill enough at the same time.

*Regular Pool:  Solid, good size, nice foliage, drinks could be stronger.

*Casino:  Good, not great.  A little dark but does the trick.

*Shows:  All are beyond good.  Saw Love, Bill Burr, and Wayne Brady.  I'd recommend all in a heart beat.  I like that they nearly always have a great comedian performing.  

*Rooms:  I've stayed in Tower Suite and Tower Deluxe.  Tower Suite is baller and the Tower Deluxe is worth the upgrade.  Only difference in deluxe vs standard is the bathroom, but the double vanity and separate bath and shower make a huge difference, especially if you are with your lady.

*Volcano: First time up close and personal, it was quite the spectacle.  From our room we could hear the Bill Weir soundtrack and feel the explosions on the windows.

*Service:  This is where they separate themselves.  We had some major
issues on our first go round and their front desk manager Luis did everything he could to make things right.  I must say they train their management well, Luis couldn't have been more professional.  He invited my gf and I back out at a discounted rate and took great care of us.  He didn't have to but he arranged all our reservations while on our trip and even gave us a resort credit.

First the pro's, the last two times we stayed there this year we had a two bedroom suite, which was the most awesome, amazing room ever.  It will be hard for us to ever stay anywhere else, because this suite is so insanely amazing.  I wish I could of had every friend ever with me in there, the bathroom is bigger than a normal size room there.
The dealers in the casino have always been super friendly, especially at the craps table.
We finally saw LOVE when we were there in August, and it was the best show I have yet to see in Vegas, I am eager to see it again when I go back.
I am glad they finally put another breakfast spot to grab a decent breakfast, however they tend to be slow at the pantry, the last couple times we ate there it took longer than expected.  I LOVE stack, had it for the first time a couple years ago when I ran the 1\/2 and we make it is a regular spot every time we go back (the adult tator tots are yum)
The staff has always been so helpful from the a\/v guy who comes to the room, the bellhop, check in desk, m life desk, servers by the pool, and servers at each restaurant.  I also love how M Life has my vegas slots, makes playing on my ipad so much more fun.

My only con about the hotel is the pool area, yes it is gorgeous and beautiful, but I hate how they jam those chairs so close to each other, you have to climb on your neighbors chair, just to get on your chair.  I wish the special adult area (not bare) wasn't so much money, it is cheaper to go to bare then the special adult only area.   That is my only con of the entire hotel.. not to bad.

Sure, you'll smell like a chain smoker when you immediately walk in, but I smelled like a chain smoker when I walked into the brand new Aria too.  It doesn't make a damn difference.

The location is impeccable.  The Venetian (with it's offspring hotels), Caesar's, TI, Wynn, Encore, Paris Paris, and Belagio are all around you.  

The rooms are renovated.  Mine had a walk in shower, new LCD HD TV, super comfortable bed, and great strip and poolside view.  In fact, my view featured the topless pool, which wasn't so bad at all.

There are many pools besides the topless one and they serve behemoth and fruity tropical drinks ready for you to spike even more.
The Mirage has a diner open all night, tattoo parlor, a booji club and bar, and a celebrity restaurant.

Unfortunately, they don't sell a bloody t-shirt featuring a magician and a tiger.  (Ooooh...to soon?)  I would have bought that, only if the money went to a wildlife organization.

LOVES:
1) LOCATION: Located on the strip, closer to the North end. As any of you regular Vegas goers know, location is everything!  For this particular Vegas trip the majority of our plans had us at the North end of the strip which made it convenient for us to get around by foot or taxi.  

2) FRONT DESK\/LOBBY AREA:  I love love love the pretty (and huge) aquarium situated right behind the front desk. It runs the length of the front desk area, so as you're waiting in the long line to check in or check out at least you've got a lovely view of the pretty aquarium to keep you entertained.  

3) ROOM RATES: I usually book MGM or the Gold Coast for Vegas trips because of their bargain rates, but when fellow Yelper Ingrid R told me about the good rates at the Mirage I checked it out. Our room rates for our stay were as follows: 
Fri 12\/21   $72
Sat 12\/22  $72
Sun 12\/23 $56
However, keep in mind as with any other hotel in Vegas the above room rates did not include the daily $25 resort fee nor the 12% room tax.  So including all the fees and taxes the entire stay came to $309. 

4) ROOMS: Although me and my boyfriend's room was all the way at the end of the hall, we scored a corner room that was slightly larger than our other friends' rooms and had better views because of the semi wraparound windows. My favorite part about the room was the abundance of mirrors they had, aside from the mirror in the bathroom. As soon as we walked in, I noticed a full length mirror to my left (absolute must have in any Vegas hotel room); the mirrored closet; and a rather large hanging mirror on the wall next to the bathroom door.  Regardless of who was in the bathroom and how long the bathroom was in use, the mirrors came in handy for the other one to still get ready.  Enough about the mirrors lol, the rest of the room was nice: simple modern decor; comfy bed; large flat screen tv; etc. Although the bathroom was pretty small compared to other hotels I've stayed at. 

5) BLT: You'll have to read my BLT review for more details, but what a great find and soooooo convenient!!! Good food & awesome shakes!!!  The group of us ended up eating here multiple times during our Vegas trip.  

Aside for the small bathroom in our room, there really isn't anything to dislike about the Mirage.  I'm not sure when our next trip to Vegas will be but I'm keeping the Mirage in my list of go-to hotels to stay at.",2,0,1

I stayed here recently for my company's convention that was held at the convention center here and being that everything was paid for through by our company, I guess I really can't do as much complaining as I'd like....though I am.

The Mirage Hotels seem to be more darker and dingy (casino wise) compared to the majority of the nicer hotels\/ casinos. 

I had visited this casino many times before however, this was my first time actually staying at the hotel.

The rooms are newly updated to a modern\/contemporary decor. The carpet in the hall ways however were horrendous and looked like something straight out of the 70s ugh...

The actual room I stayed in was ok, though there were more down falls then good. No little coffee maker (I love those things) there was a minimal amount of towels and worst off, I stayed there two nights and NOT ONCE did a maid come in and make our beds and refresh the room ...major downfall and to make it even worse THE WALLS WERE THIN....lets just say you can here EVERYTHING...which meant less sleep...ughh...

As for the convention center and rest of the shops? They seem to have a nice selection of shops..Blizz yogurt is a great little place to satisfy your sweet tooth as well as another popular candy shop close by and the rum bar is a chic, beautiful hip bar that's perfect for the night life. The actual shopping areas are cheerful, bright and appear to be well kept too.

The convention center that our event was taking place at was gorgeous I must say, the bathrooms were beautiful and extremely clean. The food that was catered to both our lunch in and dinner party that night were certainly nothing to write home about though.

We checked in on Thursday at 1:00pm and the check in was a breeze.  We walked from the Hotel Front Desk through a mini tropical garden to the elevators.  It was just breathtaking.  The garden was so beautiful and serene.  I was hoping by now that when I reached my room I would be happy with that as well.   I got to the elevator and got to the floor... The front desk girl gave me a room that was so far from the elevator I thought I needed a day just to hike to it.  In any case when I finally stepped in I was pleasantly surprise because:

1.  The room had a comtemporary chic look to it.  It was just so nice. 
2.  I quickly realized why she put me in that room, she gave me a view of the pool!

The room is a little bigger than other hotels and the mattress was so comfy I can't complain.  After settling in I went to the pool.  It was so nice.  It was a tropical paradise right in the desert.

the buffet I'll save for it's own review, but to summarize: jawesome.

The Sports Bar (yes, that's the name of it) has a sick deal, $10 for 32 ounces of beer. signed me the fuck up for that one.

Their banquet was here and so we all stayed here. All the rooms we stayed in look about the same 2 queen sized beds and a relatively small bathroom imo.  BUT! huge flat screens and iHomes yay! 

My friend and I ended up getting our own room - quite a last minute decision at 2 a.m. I called the front desk from the room we were staying in and they picked up remarkably fast and were extremely helpful and courteous. I was informed that it would be $99 for the night. 
So we packed our stuff and headed down to the lobby. By the time I got down there, the price apparently went up to $209? But, the front desk attendant said that since I was told it would be $99 then it would be that price. Thank goodness! 

And there was also only smoking rooms left but she made a couple of phone calls and the room we got was AWESOME. So much bigger than the other room we were in AND there was strip view. We could only stay for one night though (and they sold out the next day apparently as well!) 

When we checked out, I ended up forgetting two things. First, my towel - but I realized I forgot this right away and I saw one of the housekeeping ladies who promptly helped me call security to get back into the room. HOWEVER, I realized when I checked into my next hotel, that I forgot two dresses in the closet. One of them I REALLY needed for that night. I was put in contact with housekeeping lost and found. 

And here is why they only get 4 stars - 
I called and I left my contact information and she said she would get someone to go up to the room to check for me. I know that there are many many rooms in the Mirage and I'm sure they're very busy. However, after an hour, I decided that I would call back because in the event that my dresses got stolen (hey sorry thinking worst scenario) I would need to be shopping PRONTO for a new one. Unfortunately, I kept getting the voicemail for the next 30 minutes. I was eventually transferred to the assistant manager, who was THE MOST UNHELPFUL PERSON in this ordeal. All he did was transfer me to house keeping lost and found which in turn led me BACK to the voicemail. I was pretty frustrated at this point but there was nothing I could do. 30 minutes later (and technically 3 hours later), I was finally called back. Then I went to the bell desk and picked up my dresses no problem.

Do you know how difficult it is to sit, walk, do anything with an abscess on your hoo ha filled with staph pus? Well my gyn found out because that's where I had to go to get it fixed.

Day one---she just says ""meh, it's an abscess. Soak and take antibiotics--cephlasporin. Ok so I do. Next day? It was the size of a walnut. I had to hobble my way back to the gyn where she looked at it and gasped ""holy..... yea we need to lance that. That's not good.""

Well this lancing at the hoo ha involved:

1. topical lidocane cream---did nothing. Pointless.
2. two huge injections all the way to the nerve where I proceeded to scream? Ever get jabbed in the hoo ha with a long needle? I don't recommend it.

So the lidocaine injection kicks in. Thank god I'm not in pain anymore. And she lances it and starts to squeeze for 10 FULL MINUTES STRAIGHT.

I see look of horror on her face and ask if it was ""gross and a lot of stuff"". She goes ""well...there's a lot. Like A LOT, LOT AND GREEN.""

Nothing like green pus near your hoo ha.

So I advise the pool manager to look up staph infections, which can be MRSA and can lead to sepsis and death. Do you think I wanted staph near my privates? Do you think I want MRSA infections near my privates? Do you think I wanted to DIE all because I went into your pool?

Like I said, I love the Mirage. But seriously, you need to re-look at your bather load vs chloriene and other chemicals ratio. I know it's difficult to keep up with the heat, bather load, and whatever is floating in that pool because the general rule is anyone in Vegas has everything and anything and they do NOT care what they're bringing into that pool.

Seriously, this review might be funny and all but a staph infection was not funny, amusing, nor safe to have. I'm not asking for a free ride or anything but you don't want bad press of a MRSA staph infection from YOUR establishment because you can't keep things clean.

So just letting you know, I went in July---you might want to drain and disinfect that pool because there are a couple hundreds of people running around with the same staph infection I got from there.

UPDATE: Guess what came back? And guess who has MRSA????",1,4,0

Our room was missing some amenities (soap and hand towels)...no big deal, the furniture in our room was worn and chipped in some spots....whatever, I couldn't open our room door (it kept getting stuck and we had to push hard to get it open) but the worse was in the bathroom...the shower head sprayed horribly (hard water build up I assume) and I found black mold along the grout in the shower. 

The hotel has nice amenities but cleanliness is what I ultimately care about. I think the rooms can use a little more tender loving care and then they'll be perfect to charge almost $200 a night for.

I'd say I've stayed here for at least 20 nights this year to date and have never had any major issues....until today. 

Today was different. 
Today housekeeping completely disregarded the ""Please do not disturb, Privacy"" sign on the door and came in to my room while my fiancé and I were out. To some this might seem silly, but the fact is, we're paying quite a lot for the room and expect privacy to be honored. If a landlord came into a rental house unannounced, that would be a breach of contract. To us, this is just as bad. My personal belongings were all out in the open(since we didn't expect to have anyone come in) and I now have clothes thrown into chairs and on my suitcase that were purposefully placed on the once unmade bed. By the way, they didn't change the sheets, the same stains that were here upon arrival are there. Including the lipstick markings from what I can only hope was another couples fun. But it's Vegas, so ya know. It's all gross. 

Bottom line, the mirage doesn't honor privacy and to the manager, Nick, you need to work on your customer service. While you sit there thinking privacy is subjective and unimportant you are losing loyal guests. Had you thrown us a dinner at one of your restaurants or ANYTHING as an apology you would have made us feel like important guests. Sadly, this was not the case.",8,3,1

Compared to some of the other newer hotels, it's looking a little tired. Everyone is friendly and helpful, the concierge definitely got used. I'm sure they were a little tired of us by the time we left, but they were so helpful in finding exactly what we were looking for, even if it was in other hotels.

The rooms were huge with great views. Be careful when you go near the mini fridge! Everything on there has a sensor and the maids check the sensors daily. If anything has been moved, you get charged. Unfortunately, that makes using the mini fridge as an actual fridge impossible. The maid told us we could call the front desk and get a real fridge brought up, but in the end it wasn't worth it.

The pool is very nice. Surprisingly, the pool wasn't that crowded. Everyone was tanning, with very few people swimming, which made playing in the waterfall pretty awesome. There are also several hot tubs hidden around the main pool. They are huge and claim to have a capacity of 15 people, but you could easily fit double that amount. I thought about going to their new topless pool Bare. I stopped by the tent, but they were playing ""Big Pimpin'"" loudly and there was a skeezy guy standing in front, so I decided to pass.

My only complaint with the actual hotel is the distance from my room to the elevator. There are 45 rooms on each wing on each floor. And of course I was the one who had to walk past all 44 rooms to get to the end. Generally I wouldn't have cared so much, except I was in tourist mode, walking everywhere and trying to fit everything in. By the end of the day I was exhausted and the hallway was so long. When you check in, ask for something close to the elevators.

One of my go-to hotel to stay when I am in Vegas. It is located in the center of the strip and walking distance to its neighboring hotels.   Although it is a little of age and history, the hotel still manages to keep it comfortable and clean.  

My husband and I are always greeted with friendly staff at the check in desk.  Sometimes, they will give us upgrades which is always a plus.  Rooms are spacious and never had a problem. 

Casino floor is relatively smaller than other resorts and there are limited selections in slots and tables.  However, they still have the new slot games and are constantly upgrading their machines.  The table games are also limited but I love playing Pai Gow poker here.  My favorite dealer is John who always filled with great conversations and laughs.  This makes the game so much fun and time goes by really fast.

Carnegie and BLT is located near the exit toward the forum shop is a definite favorite.  Our tradition is to alway eat at BLT at least once.They have a milkshake called ""nut job"" which is nutella flavor with whipped cream and almonds on top. It is HEAVEN.

Location: Excellent. In either direction you can get to great attractions across the strip including the forum shops. In The Mirage you have good dining options for almost everybody's price range. Although there is not a big chain coffee shop there is a Roasted Bean that will suit most peoples needs. The Carnigie Deli is worth a try and the burger joint right before leaving the hotel is a good bet for some good American grub.

Room: For the double queen room we shared the digs were pretty nice. The accommodations were clean and modern. The bathroom and tub were good sized and the furniture was comfortable. For the $$ I was very pleased.

The only knock I have with The Mirage was the pool scene. It didn't really impress and seemed to be lacking energy. Maybe we happen to be there on an off day but I was pretty bored.

She claimed she tried to get us our drinks but we weren't there. After a half hour we finally moved a few machines down but we were pretty much there the entire time. She offered to get us a drink again but I declined. I didn't want to sit there forever again. Then we couldn't find any other waitresses anywhere in the casino. You do want me to get drunk and spend too much money right? As if I wasn't irritated enough I caught her talking shit about us a few minutes later. I stuck my nose in and pointed out I was still standing right there. I am so pissed. What horrible customer service. I love the hotel and the spa but forget about gambling here again. What a shitty experience. 

In addition they never linked our parking to our room and we had no idea that we could use our room key with in an our privileges. They fixed it and gave us a credit but if I had known we could have gone in and out a bunch I would have used our car way more often. Annoying but I was going to let it go until stupid cocktail waitress pissed me off. Ugh. Not happy
----------------------


We have been really happy with our stay. Last time we stayed at New York New York and it was fun but this is definitely a step up. The rooms are very clean and modern and the whole hotel has a nice, classy vibe without feeling McMansiony. The buffet is ok but Cravings restaurant was really pretty good. It's open 24 hr. The gym is the best hotel gym I have ever experienced. They have almost everything my gym at home has plus they have filtered water and gym towels. This is definitely where I want to stay again next time we come.

the newly renovated rooms are awesome. they definitely modernized the mirage and did a great job updating all the furniture, decor, and quality of the rooms. the service was great and theyre pretty good about letting you check-in early as long as you ask nicely =)

the pool here is awesome too. its huge and we didnt have to get out there too early to find a good spot.  the waterfall is a lot of fun and definitely adds to the wow-factor of the pool.

ate at kokomo's for my birthday dinner, see my review on that, and also did quite a bit of gambling. they have a lott of roulette tables so if youre into that this is a good place to play since there's so many tables.  definitely one of my favorite hotels, but the rates have gone up a lot since my 21st birthday... you can pay like $30 more and get a room at the encore...but i still love the mirage because it does have a great location!",1,1,1

I was threatened with security when I addressed the issue and had to run through the hotel back to my room on the 25th floor to warn my wife. When that situation was resolved we had to move rooms for a third time and I was left with a total of $300 in comps. When i checked later that night how much was left, it was discovered hat the manager never put in the credit and i was left with a large bill. I calmly stated that there was a mistake and I was again threatened with security. I will never spend money at any of the world wide MGM resorts again. The main reason, beyond the hastle, is because the manager at the Mirage, Emanuel, flat out told me he doesn't care about me. He just didn't want a scene in the lobby, which I wasn't going to cause.

Cost - way to much for the oldest newest hotel on the strip - the room was small and they have motion sensored AC so at night the AC will shut off. Two of the lights did not work and the drawer in the dresser was stuck shut and it took them three days to come fix it. The safe never worked, even though I asked to have it opened, repaired. 

Room service left one, yes one, wash cloth for the both of us to use - I had to keep requesting wash cloths and towels. To top it off they never once wiped off the counter in the bath rooms. I purposefully drew a smiley face on the counter with my finger..it was there five days later, along with all the glass rings, etc. 

They let everyone in for free into the clubs, give free drinks to the ladies to get them in, then it is ghetto look out. The two times I left to go to the rest room my wife was groped by some ass hat who would cop a feel then run off. 

Oh, and the topless pool..what a rip off. $250 on Saturday just to sit on a lounge chair. Then by noon the pool is full of 100 dudes staring at the only 5 women who should be topless in the first place. Then you have all the scammers who come in, then slip on a chair with paying, after you have dropped money to have your own chair. Then you have their staff running around ""texting"" on their phones...riiiigghhttt...

It is easy to get through the Mirage and out to the strip quickly as well.  Harrah's, Casino Royale, TI, and the Caesar's Forum shops can be accessed in a short amount of time.

We rented the Hospitality Suite to treat ourselves for my bachelorette party. When we got to the room, it was dark, dingy, outdated, the safe and TV were broken and there was a leak in the ceiling of one of the bathrooms. We called to let the front desk know so they could fix it while we were out at the spa - we came back about 4 hours later and none of it was fixed. We called again to have these fixed, and dealt with the engineering staff (who were friendly at least). They could not fix the tv and said we had no leak, we asked them to please come back and fix it while we were out at dinner, that we'd be gone at 8:30. When we got back to our room ready for bed at 11:30p, they were still there! And the TV still wasn't fixed! It's not about the TV, because quite frankly we wouldn't use it much anyway, its the fact that we were paying premium for a suite and spent all day (3 separate in-room visits) dealing with their maintenance staff. I called the front desk to insist that we not be charged the night for the suite, and I was put through to a 'manager' Diana who was absolutely repulsive to me on the phone. She had NONE of the facts correct about our experience (literally horrible communication over there), and instead of listening to me and believing me... she brazenly accused us of having ""gentlemen in and out of the room"" and that we should be charged for them. FIRST OF ALL the only gentlemen in our room were the mirage maintenance staff coming in and out all day dealing with this broken room. Secondly, even if we did have men in the room... it's absolutely none of this woman's business!!! I felt disgusted at this accusation and quite frankly unsafe - who were the 'gentlemen' coming in and out of our room??? They offered me $100 in food credit and said that was ample compensation for ""a tv not working.""

After this experience we were so distraught but decided to deal with it in the morning... but discovered that our bathroom was flooding from a leaking ceiling again!  Now it's 1:30a.. we called downstairs... again.. and said please just put us in a different room. Another manager came to our room with security and again, instead of listening to anything I had to say, sat me down on the bed like a child and waved his finger at me and said I cannot 'speak to his staff like that.' We were literally just 2 girls paying for a 'fancy' hotel room, trying to go to sleep! There wasn't anything illicit happening of any kind... and I was being treated like some kind of misbehaving child! I could not believe the way these people were talking to me. Luckily this manager (Adam I believe) saw that we were harmless and simply wanted to go to bed. Finally, the next morning, we were given a different room.

The only place resembling a cafe isnt. Also, they should have more late night food open. Next, the casino floor is ok but I found most machines to be tighter than any other casino on the strip.

We were lucky to get some pretty decent-priced rooms, $104\/night, and the rooms were great! Newly-renovated, and nicely-decorated, the rooms were spacious and comfortable.

And the location on the strip - you just can't beat it! With the Venetian for Tao right across the street, and Casino Royale for some cheap craps, in between Caesar's Palace and Treasure Island, near the Bellagio, Wynn, and the mall, everything is nearby.

The buffet, Cravings, is pretty decent, too. They definitely have a vast selection, and quality is fair.

The club inside the Mirage, JET, is not so great according to my friends. Although the promoter hooked it up with wristbands and comp passes, my friends went there Both nights (Friday and Saturday) and they were not impressed, And they got in for free.

My fiancee and I were able to go to the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat. That was TOTALLY great! We got to see the dolphins (including the new baby), tigers (new baby, also!), and lions!

I was greatly disappointed with the way I was treated on a recent stay at your hotel. My
wife planned my 60th birthday celebration for me at the Mirage Hotel six months in
advance. We made specific request and were assured that you could accommodate
us.
We requested: Penthouse Suite, Best view of the Strip, No Smoking and close to
elevators.
Upon check-in, the Penthouse had a poor view of the strip (mostly highway) and was far
from elevator. We returned to the registration counter and requested another room with
the same criteria we were promised. We were assigned another Penthouse, however
upon entering the suite we were overpowered by the stench of cigarette smoke, clearly
not what we wanted. We once again returned to the registration and explained our
disappointment. We were assigned our third penthouse suite which had a view of the
strip but not a good one. (E-061) The suite could not have been further from the
elevators.
Buy this time I was very upset and quite frankly, tired of dealing with your staff. I
accepted the accommodations with contempt. I knew you were no where near full
occupancy, you could have done better.
I brought with me 40 other people all staying at the Mirage Hotel because of me. I
would have thought you would have treated me with more class and respect.
We have stayed at the Mirage in the past, however, I seriously doubt that you or any of
your sister hotels will be a part of my future.

I booked online and did a package deal which involved a $50 credit at the Cravings Buffet (highly recommended) and a $60 credit at the Secret Garden (didn't use it).  This package was cheaper than booking the room on its own, so I was stoked.  

All of the restaurants at the Mirage are reasonably priced, which was a huge relief.  Cravings is well worth it for either breakfast or brunch. We also enjoyed BLT and the Patio Bar.   If you want up scale dining, you'll probably need to go somewhere else.

The rooms are nice.  They've recently been redone with a very modern look.  It came complete with an iHome which I thought that was awesome.  The bathroom was small.  Very small.  So small that you had to close the door to get in the shower.  All and all they did a good job with the update but a bigger bathroom would have made the complete package.  Loved the TV express check-out option as well.

I don't know if it was just our room but there was an awful odor.  I think it might have been some sort of vicious cleaning product.  It was the type of smell you get used to but totally uninviting none-the-less.

The pool was beautiful but the loungers are so crammed together, its ridiculous.  They literally couldn't fit another in there.  And totally BYOB.  I paid $9 for a water.

Even if you don't get the strip view the other side has a great view of the pool and dolphins and you can still see the strip. If you get the volcano view its pretty cool because you get to see the volcano erupt from your room. The rooms are fantastic. We have stayed in the tower rooms and in the regular rooms and both are great. The only difference is the tower room you get to stay on the 24 or 25 floor and there are private elevators for the tower rooms. The other difference is the bathroom. The regular room has a bath\/shower combination and one sink. The tower room has double sinks and the bathroom is bigger. It also has a HUGE bathtub and separate stand alone shower. The room size is about the same though. The tower room has two smaller closets one on each side of the bed. The regular room has a regular size closet. So if you have the extra money I recommend the tower room, but the regular room is just as fun. The rooms have a huge TV and desk area with all the outlets and usb's you could ask for. There is a separate chair and the bed is so amazingly comfy. The staff is wonderful. From check in to bell service to everyone at the restaurants everything is just fantastic. They really treat their guests like valued customers. The hotel is just gorgeous. There is so much to do there. From the Cirque show LOVE which is all Beatles music and amazing, we have seen it twice. Terry Fator is incredible as well, we have seen him twice and I can't recommend him enough. They also have touring music groups and comedy as well. They also have the dolphin habitat and white lions which is so much fun. It's inexpensive to visit and so cool to see them feed and care for the dolphins and the white lions are such magnificent animals. They also have experiences you can pay extra for and swim with the dolphins or have them paint you a picture. The restaurants are out of this world. I highly recommend the Pantry. It is the best restaurant ever. It's open 24 hours and has breakfast all day. Their dinner is great too. We usually eat almost all of our meals there when we stay. You can also order take out and pick it up and take it back to the room. The service there is lovely as well and the breakfast is out of this world. Highly recommend the omelettes and the berry french toast. We also love the Carnegie Deli amazing cheesecake and sandwiches, and dessert at Heritage Steak House is fabulous. I also love the parlor lounge. They always have live entertainment. The grounds are luscious with all of the greenery and plants and flowers. It's an easy hotel to get around too. I don't love that they keep raising the resort fee. It was $32 when we stayed in Feb and now it is $35. They also charge for parking now. It is $10 a day for self parking and I think around $20 for valet. It is still way cheaper than most areas you vacation but it was really nice that Vegas didn't charge for parking. I am also not in love with the pool setting. It is huge and the chairs are so close together at busy times you are packed in like sardines.

Check in line was loooong but Brittany at the front desk was the sweetest and most helpful person I've ever dealt with at a hotel. Rooms were very clean and comfortable and supplied us with soap and lotion. 
I hate how they display tempting overpriced snacks on your counter ($14 bag of nuts, $10 water..yeah) hoping you will consume them in a drunken stupor. If you'd like a fridge it'll cost you $25 day. Mandatory $40\/day 'resort fee' on top of advertised room price is BS. And don't even open the mini bar!
Everything is extremely expensive. At the conveneience store located in the lobby we bought 2 single serve juices, travel toothpaste and gum... $28.  :0 The Pantry was our favorite place to eat...delicious pancakes and breakfast potatoes and the chicken alfredo pasta was perfect. Carnegie deli is a must: pastrami on rye was the best we've ever had....just like being in NYC.

Our least favorite place to eat within The Mirage was Heritage Steak. After dropping $380 we left disappointed. The steaks were mediocre but cost no less than $50 each. The seafood tower for 2 ($70) was pretty bad. The mussels in a weird sauce, lobster scooped out, mixed with a another strange sauce and pressed back into the shell... just make it straight up seafood! I would rather have had more shrimp,  crab leg and shellfish in its original shell. It should speak for itself. They didn't even give us drawn butter, just more odd spicy sauces. We couldn't ask for butter because our server never came back until she gave us the check.

I've seen many a times of the Griswolds in Vegas, and it was interesting to see everything in person.  The aquarium behind the front desk was so cool!  I was mesmerized for a good while. 

The carpeting in the halls looked new, impressive.  It seemed like they were going for an asian-esque feel to the hotel. We had two adjoining rooms.  The rooms were tiny!  They each had 2 queen beds, with little walking room.  I loved the decor though.  It was very modern and chic. Each room had it's own plasma and a small table crushed up against the side.  The bathrooms were bleh.  The showers had curtains instead of the usual doors you see at most other hotels.  I can't really complain, we didn't spend much time in our room.

We had a crappy view since our room was at the back end of the hotel.  No cool volcano view.

Their white tigers are so beautiful. And HUGE.  They draw huge crowds, but I managed to snag a spot by the window to look at one of the tiger's face up close.  

I hate gambling, so I very very rarely gamble.  I was walking through the casino and decided to spend a few bucks on their dollar slots.  Yeah, lost that in under a minute.  Never again!

Anyone watch E!? Kim Vo has his own salon here!  I actually saw him walking around during the day.  It was the same weekend Britney was staying here.  

Their valet area is cool.  On hot days, they have water misting from the top to keep the waiting crowds from dehydrating. I thought that was a nice touch.  This hotel is cool, but I don't think it would be one of my top choices if I were to ever plan a trip to Vegas.",2,1,1

With so many places to stay in Las Vegas Why would anyone stay at the Mirage? My wife had a conference at the Mirage so we were stuck there.

As my daughter and I were walking through the casino (the only way to get to the elevators fron the front) one of the casino bosses rather rudely informed me that kids aren't allowed in the casino.

Our daughter was looking forward to swimming in the pool unfortunately there wasn't any water in it. The Jacuzzi was cold with cigar butts and ashes around the edge. Great for a kid.  

When we got out vehicle from the Valet we found that they broke part of the door handle. Now every time I go to open the drivers side door the trim falls off and we're reminded the lousy care we received.

Alle 6 di sera ormai spazientito torno al bell desk e, dopo una furiosa chiacchierata mi danno finalmente la stanza.

Oh, The Mirage.

You comp'd me a three night stay. Upgraded me to a strip-view room gratis. Lured me here with your 50K slot tournament, and even threw in some FreePlay.

But I had to dock a star...I just had to.

Don't get me wrong. For a mid-tier, 20 year old hotel-resort, you're still alright.

But I don't know. Some things about the last visit just weren't right.

Being a bit of a light sleeper, I couldn't help but lie awake at the drone of strip traffic that I could hear all the way up from my 20th floor room with the window SHUT. There was the sporadic ambulance or police siren firing off in high decibels that cut through the air so loud that I may just have well been sleeping at a Motel 6 adjacent to the Las Vegas Fire Department. Double pane window glass may have been a good option prior to the recent room remodeling? Uh. YA. I was so wasted, but couldn't even pass out because of it!

Let's also get to the thinness of the walls. No, there was no moaning or pounding of the wall from the headboard from the room next to mine, but EVERY TIME someone down the hall shut their room door, I could could hear it like a shotgun going off. THAT loud. Oh, and if it happened to be the neighbors next door, I felt the room SHAKE! (I remember thinking...okay I must have imagined that).

Oh yeah, but that's not the worst.

What I finally concluded (after the 11th or so time that it happened) to be the aging plumbing and pipe system, every time someone in a room within close proximity to mine had the water running (shower or sink), a HIGH-PITCHED jack-hammering construction-type sound would growl on for a few minutes at a time. It would start up, then stop, start up then stop. At first I almost believed that there was a construction crew doing demolition in the room next to mine (""Are they still remodeling the rooms? I thought they finished doing that..."")

DAMN it! I am nauseated from binge drinking all night...the FEW hours I'm ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM and I FINALLY wanting to get some zzzz's and I have to deal with all of THIS BS???

ALSO -- the blinds and curtains do a poor job of completely shutting out the light in the morning. Beams of soleil leaked their way into my guest room during my most critical moments of attempting to rest my mind and body (more specifically, LIVER and legs). Way to go. Not.

So what did we learn today?

I don't know whose fault it is that this happened, but this is absolutely ridiculous. The manager also was entirely nonchalant and cold about the entire situation, which is not the way to treat a customer who has literally just been screwed over by whatever system\/process your company has in place. It was only when I reasoned with him that I had not gone over my credit card limit in months, challenged him to try making a test payment of $1 on my credit card, shown him the prereservation email from Mirage themselves (which I received YESTERDAY), showed him the confirmation from booking.com, and had been on hold with booking.com forever that he finally conceded to ""overriding my cancellation"", like he is doing me a favor when in fact he SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT FROM THE START.

One of the nicest things about staying at The Mirage is the location. The hotel is located in the absolute heart of the strip. Across the street are the Palazzo and Venetian, next door is Caesar's, and you aren't far at all from The Wynn. 

The rooms have all been recently upgraded to suites. The new layouts are huge step up from the dated rooms that they used to rent out. The beds are really comfortable and the rooms have a great modern feel including flat screens in every one. 

During the summer the two pools at Mirage are a great place to spend the day. Bare is the adult version of the pool and is significantly smaller and more private. It's a topless pool that caters to a 20's and 30's crowd where the alcohol is always flowing. The main pool is less party oriented, but still really fun. The pool serves the best frozen drinks on the planet, they are the ultimate hang over cure. 

The Mirage is a great place to stay in the heart of the strip if you don't want to shell out the money for Belagio or the Wynn.",9,1,3

The hotel has excellent restaurants although the service in the steakhouse between the cafe and buffet is hideous.

The rooms are pleasant and a fair size for Las Vegas. We had a strip-view room which was excellent especially since we could watch the ""volcano"" from above. The rooms are not large enough to have a business meeting with more than 2 people.

The room furnishings were comfortable, the bell hops were fabulous, the valet was good and fairly priced, in-room internet access about average cost for the area ($11 for 24 hours), rooms were quiet, water pressure in the shower a little weak.

There are plenty of interesting things to do in the hotel if you have children although Vegas is not exactly family friendly - especially if you have very young children. The lush cool interior of the lobby and casino areas is very soothing after being out on the strip during summer.

If you are looking for a mid-range hotel with reasonable prices but by no means a low-budget hotel you should be happy at the Mirage. Even during conventions when the hotel is very busy the staff tried to accommodate all of our requests, which were many since we had 8 rooms. Overall it was a very pleasant stay for a reasonable price.

    * Disliked -- Weak water pressure in shower.",0,0,0

I really liked this place. Service was friendly and professional in each and every department that we encountered.

Saw the Beatles ""Love"" Cirque Soliel show which was pretty cool.

This place is a joke. I started in a regular room with a dirty, broken shower curtain. They moved me to another room where they miscommunicated and had maintenance going on where we were then brought to a 3rd room, which was a downgrade from both of the other rooms. To try to compensate they brought us to a 4th upgrade room overbearing of cigarette smoke AND also undergoing maintenance. When we called to move to the 5th room we were not apologized to but told to ""wait patiently"". FINALLY we were greeted by a hotel manager who had little to nothing to say and no apology. Aren't you suppose to be the head of hospitality and at least pretend to be apologetic and accommodating?!

This place has potential with decor, location, pricing,(minus resort fees) and comfort. But the noise was unacceptable. We were woken up with everyone strolling in at all hours of the night and morning shouting epic things like: "" WWWOOOHOOO VEGAASSS BABY"" !!""
That's cute, the first 4 or 5 times, but seriously at 4 or 5 am, it starts to get old.

Resort fees for anyone that is interested, is what makes your deal on priceline\/internet go south. 
Vegas adds resort fees. Which they say is for 
'using the resort and getting the paper""etc. 
We never got a paper, or used the ""gym"" and had to pay. 
Mandatory fee.
 But seriously if I am getting charged $25 a day extra I better get a paper at my door or something. I never did. 
So, to me, the resort fee is a scam that you have to factor in while reserving a place in Vegas. This is apparently the ""norm"" in Vegas so be aware as your planning. I am sad, I didn't even get a deal on the new dolphin show.

If your gaming in their casino, well expect rude insensitive a-holes to neglect you. It was like a desert when it came to getting a drink while gambling. I spent quite a bit and nearly died of thirst.
When I did get a drink,  I sat at the bar and they pre-fix the pouring spout to a 2 count (vs 4 count) and say they ""can't control it"" on the comped drinks.

The best deal was the giant cocktail for $20 we got before the LOVE show, in the love amphitheater . It was strong, good, and huge! The Love show was awesome. It made up for so much disappointment in the resort.

The bottom line in pricing: We paid for 2 nights ( Wed and Thurs.) and the 9:00 show with good seats, according to the web sites 'Love package"" $358. According to their rep, that fee included taxes. Final bill in reality, was actually $448, with resort fees and other taxes that they ""apparently did not include"". Well, that is what the manager said when i questioned the price difference.",7,5,5

Upon arrival, we were not able to check into the hotel.  We were told that our reservation was not on file and that we need to call SW to clarify.  After 2hr of being on hold with SW, we were told that our reservation was sent to Mirage Whole Sale Department on the 11th of December and that Mirage failed to upload our information into their system.  We requested SW to resend our reservation and within 10min, we were able to check into our room.  
We were very disappointed and upset at the situation and requested to speak with a Manager at the front desk to see who had dropped the ball and caused such inconvenience for us.  After talking with the Manager (Nick) he told us that due to us booking through SW and that SW have not pay for the room reservation, therefore Mirage cannot hold the room for us.  The Manager basically pointed the finger at SW and stated that SW was the one to blamed.
I called SW back to clarify the situation.  The representative from SW stated that Mirage is on a direct pay with SW and that once a confirmation was sent, payment was also made at the same time.  Furthermore, a representative from Mirage Whole Sale Department stated that they had a glitch in the computer system when the confirmation was sent on the 11th of December and was not able to upload it into their system.  Basically, instead of fixing the glitch and enter our reservation, Mirage ignored the problem and therefore causing us the inconvenience of our time. 
I called the Call Center for Mirage and asked to be transfer to the Whole Sale Department.  I was told by a Supervisor at the Call Center (Kimberly) that it was lunch time and no one at the Whole Sale Center was answering the phone.  She'd assured me that she will keep trying and will get back with me within 30min.  An hour goes by, then a day... up until today, I still have not receive any call back from Kimberly or any representative from Mirage on this matter.
I've heard so much positive feedback from relatives and friends about this hotel, that's why we chose to stay here.  Unfortunately, I felt that Mirage don't really care about their customer's time or experience.  Management would say anything to dismiss the problem or a complaining customer, supervisor would make empty promises to get a customer off the phone, etc.  Being that this was my first time in Vegas and due to such bad customer service provided by one of the biggest name in Vegas, I would not suggest anyone to stay here nor any other hotel under the MGM umbrella.",5,1,0

In the past they perked you on loyalty. Now it's strictly points based on casino play and dollars spent.  The good news is they now give points for entertainment and food dollars in  all of their hotels.

Still a solid choice.  Impressive (but packed) pool.  Pretty good deals from the M Life gambling card but don't fear using hotels.com.  My son used that and got an awesome room.  They offered a special: $81 room rate WITH $75 food\/beverage credit.  Happening now. 

Concierge tended to be more personable & helpful to the older adults in the group & more rude to the younger 20 somethings.  If they are in the mood, ask for some freebies to clubs, etc.  They have several to offer.

Hope this isn't the new norm throughout the strip. I understand they did some renovation to this place but you don't have to make us pay for it through parking charges. I don't smoke but not having smoking allowed in the sports book area is dumb. This is Vegas, you can smoke almost anywhere. We were checked into a room that smelled like cigarettes and they couldn't transfer us to another room on the same floor because they were sold out. We were staying on floor 20 which used to be a smoking floor but the fact that they checked us in to a room that smelled like cigarettes without doing anything about it was uncool. Had to call front desk twice to get them to bring some spray for the smell. Baccarat is only available for high rollers. I'm staying at Caesars next time.",1,2,1

I stayed at 4 Queens the first night, Mandalay Bay the second, The MGM Grand intermittently, and at the Mirage Last. I must say that I am not impressed with this hotel AT ALL. I have so many things to yelp about that I am going to make a list. For EACH PART OF THE ROOM.

BATHROOM:
*Toilet would take two flushes to flush everything down. Gross!
*Bathroom fans did not defog mirrors after showering or get rid of unpleasant smells. What is the point in a fan then?
*Shower head was weak. It took me 3 washes to get all my conditioner out of my hair.
*The toilet lid kept slamming everytime my boyfriend tried to pee. Need I say more?

BED:
*The bedcover looked like it was made out of a 70's couch.
*The bedsheets were itchy and smelled like baby butt. (You know like that cloth diaper service?)
*I got tons of little red bumps on my skin from the sheets. Bed Bugs? I don't wanna know. All I know is that I felt super self conscious about my skin at the pool after that. 

NOISE:
*Doors on this floor slam, hardcore, even if you just let it swing shut. Get some hydraulic springs for the damn doors!
*When other people's doors near ours slam, it rattled our door. Loudly. At all hours of the night and morning. 
*Their little renovation project woke us up early every morning, and kept us up. Do you know how awful it is when someone is hammering in the room above you when you just went to bed four hours earlier and you have a  raging hangover? Not cool AT ALL.
*Someone's alarm in the bedroom next to us went off at the same hour every morning. I don't think anyone was staying there, but it would not shut off! It went off for like an hour, no exaggeration. 

I need to get one of those renovated rooms you yelpers talk about IF I decide to stay there ever again.

So what did I like about the room? Well, the only thing I liked about the room was the fact that it had marble floors in the entryway and a little vanity table and chair to get ready in. 

The room was not the only thing that bothered me, either. I understand why that the pathway from the parking garage goes through the casino before you can get to your room, but must it go through the lobby, the casino, the atrium, another casino, to the elevators and then to the room? By the time I had hauled my luggage (which is not light at all) through all the casino, the crowds of annoying people trying to take pictures where everyone else HAS to walk, and all those other places previously mentioned, I was pissed.

Oh and the pool is not that great as cool as it looks. You rarely get a lounge chair in the sun, and people hog the few there are. Its a small pool, with only one jacuzzi. And the water is cold. I got a great lounge chair next to the walkway where everyone could see my little mirage rash if they wanted. How irritating.

 Oh and the worst part? I paid more per night for this hotel than I did to stay at Mandalay Bay. Ouch.

And yeah the Volcano doesn't work. Sweet. One star for the vanity table and one star for the aquarium behind the Check-In counter.",1,1,0

Locked up a rate for 5 nights including the weekend at an average of $85 a night.  Upon entering the hotel, we see an area with tropical trees in front and the checkin area on the right.  The checkin area had a huge fish tank.  We arrived early, so our rooms werent available yet.  We dropped our bags with the bellhop and off we went to lunch.  After lunch, we received a call from the front desk telling us our rooms were ready.  We head up to our rooms and wait for our bags to be brought up to us.  The Mirage has recently gone thru renovation, and the room looked very nice. While waiting on for my bag, i decided to lay on the bed.  The bed is the most comfortable bed i had ever slept on.  I slept really well every night.  The room was nice size, but the bathrooms were a bit small but it didnt really matter to me as i wasn't in the room that much.

Seeing it over the years in film\/media and advertisement I knew I wanted to select this location. Check-In process was easy; however, I was booked in a double queen\/non-smoking - but - when she pulled the reservation I was in a king\/smoking optional room. She gave me the option for another location (lower floor and not as great a view) as she didn't know why I was assigned that room; however, she told me the room was on the suite level and had a great view of the pool and the strip and if I went to the room and if it was to ""smokey"" she would ensure I would be able to change. So I stuck with it and was happy - the room didn't smell like smoke at all - great views of both the pool and strip; however, the view is slightly obstructed because of the Beatles Love advertisement over the windows. Hotel staff were very friendly which I was impressed by as in my home location hotel staff is hit or miss. The public areas, restaurants, etc were very clean and enjoyed the smell (as some vegas hotels just smelled awful to me). I also didn't like on the morning of check-out.... we got approved for a late check out of noon vs paying for a 3PM\/6PM option; however, 11AM the housekeeping was knocking, turning the handle, keying in. I opened the door and the man just said ""just wanted to make sure you were awake"" - I didn't like that. Otherwise, I had a fantastic stay and would recommend this location to anyone.",0,0,0

If you plan on partying at XS, Lavo, Tao, Pure, etc, there is no better location for the money in Vegas. Assuming you're not paying Palazzo, Wynn or Caesars prices, this place is a killer value ! 

Rooms: The decor was AWFUL. The hallways are a serene black, red, and beige palette. You walk into the room and you're accosted with hot pink and purple. EVERYWHERE. The art, the drapes, the bed, the chair.. all neon pink and purple. Honestly I think it's a sad attempt at making sure people don't stay in their rooms and instead gamble.. Who knows. Either way the designers should be shot. The bathroom sucked. It was built in '89 so I can't really fault them for missing the huge bathroom trend, but wow.. it was tiny. Single sink, no robes, itty bitty bathtub. Definitely not a bathroom 2 people can comfortably get ready in at once! Beds are quite important to me and I actually loved the bed. I slept really well and was super comfy. It is the *cushy* bed type, so if you crave a hard bed, look elsewhere. 

The pool was actually really nice. I could almost ignore the strip in the background pretend I was in Hawaii. As a tip - buy the beers at the gift shop right by the pool for $4 and tote them in (or hell, go to Walgreens if you're feeling uber frugal). Make sure to get the Bud bottles that are aluminum, *not* the glass bottles.. you'll stick out! The same bottles go for $7 at the pool. 

Overall it's a 3.5 star, but I'm rounding up ! These guys were the first mega-resort in Vegas and I have to give the Mirage props for that. Anytime you can get this place at a significant discount to the luxury properties nearby, it's worth it! This is not a luxury property (imo), but it's great for people looking to spend most nights club hopping and days sitting by the pool. This isn't the kind of place you'd want to lounge around in your room!",12,7,9

At first glance, our room on the 21st floor seemed fine. After a long day, I was pretty tired and decided to call it a night, but my husband was going to meet up with our friend who was staying at the same hotel. I laid down on the bed and was checking my phone when I felt some itchiness on my leg. I really didn't think anything of it, but when I looked down, I saw a little bug moving across the sheets. I quickly jumped off the bed to investigate closer. I wasn't alarmed just yet and went to get a tissue to remove it, but then I noticed another bug of a darker color move in the upper right hand portion of the bed. I promptly took photos of both bugs and quickly called the front desk and used my cell to call my husband because I was completely alarmed at this point and just wanted to pack up and move.

They were able to move us to another room on the 2nd floor. I was so scared at this point as I had heard of BED BUGS, but never experienced them until this stay and I wouldn't wish this on anyone. They're very insidious and aside from skin bites and inflammation, they can easily burrow themselves into your luggage and clothes and then infect your home. I then called down to the front desk again to speak to the night manager and he said they have closed our previous room and a company would come by to inspect it at 7am the next morning. I asked if there was any way they could confirm with us if they were bed bugs so we would know how to proceed. He said most of the time, it's something else, not bed bugs, but assured he would contact us after the inspection was complete.

By 10:30 the next morning after a very sleepless night, we still hadn't heard anything, but were more than ready to check out. I called the front desk again and asked to speak to the manager regarding our previous room. She placed me on hold and then said he was on the phone with the company, but they would go ahead and comp us our night stay. In all honesty, I felt this was the least they could do and I would have gladly paid double to avoid this entire ordeal. I informed her we were ready to check out, but hadn't heard the results of the inspection and wanted to know so we would know how to proceed. She said she understood and would let us know as soon as possible. I told her we would be in Las Vegas for the rest of the day and she could call or text me anytime and then confirmed all my contact information. 

My husband and I arrived home late Sunday night and left our luggage and shoes outside to avoid any possibility of infecting our home. In the dark of night, we unpacked our belongings outside and promptly put all our clothes in a hot wash a couple of times. As we hadn't heard anything from the hotel, we weren't sure what to do, but I had spent the rest of the day in Las Vegas researching bed bugs on my iphone and how we can try to prevent bringing them into our home. Suffice it to say, it was very difficult to enjoy our last day there.  

I called to speak to the manager again the next morning and said that no one had reached out to us regarding the inspection and we just needed to know as our luggage was still outside. She said that as they waived the cost of our stay, there was nothing more their department could do, but she would immediately send an email to Risk Management. I then told her I was very concerned and scared about bringing bed bugs into our home and was there anyone who could tell us the test results so we would know how to respond further. She put me on hold and placed some calls and was able to confirm the room tested positive for bed bugs. She said normally they would offer to launder our clothing for us, but I said we were already putting our clothes through the hottest wash we could and our luggage was outside of our house, but I would be throwing them away as well as some of our fabric shoes.

The hotel offered another stay and credits, but this has been such a frustrating and traumatic experience and I told them I don't think I would ever be comfortable there again. They then offered a partial reimbursement for the luggage that we had to throw away, but it didn't cover the full cost of what we had lost. My husband and I decided just to absorb the cost of our luggage ourselves so that we could share our very difficult experience at the Mirage with others and caution them to be vigilant to avoid a situation like ours. It's a week later and we're still dealing with the bites and itchiness, working on replacing our luggage, laundering the clothes we had in them again and throwing away anything else that can spread the infestation. This was such a sad and disappointing conclusion to our Thanksgiving weekend and we hope it doesn't ever happen to anyone else.",12,3,0

The room was awesome, expensive but well worth the price. Great experience. A few things that got under my skin were I added guests names to my room at the front desk and everytime I called, they would call me by the other guests last name instead of mine. Last time I checked, the bill was in my name so it's respectful to use the right name. Also the parking situation needs to be fixed asap. I was already warned that mgm resorts charged, but I had pearl membership and wouldn't be. But the stupid machine would not read my card correctly. The first few times in and out of the parking lot, I had no problems. I even went to get a reprint twice. But the lady I dealt with the last few nights I was there was rude as hell and was telling me that I needed to fix my card asap. No no, you listen here. I have my pearl players card and did what I needed to do. Now if your machines aren't reading my card correctly, that's your problem. The other attendants just wrote down my player card number and let me through... This piece of work decides to tell me what I need to do because she Cleary had no idea what she was doing. She wouldn't let me through and kept me waiting over 5 minutes each time I got up to her because my card wasn't being read by the machine. She calls someone and they tell her to evenually let me through but I was in a hurry and stayed 5 nights and having to deal with that the last few days when I was already tired and annoyed for getting two replacement cards already and then having her tell me I need to fix it, no lady. I paid over $3k for a penthouse suite, AND I have a pearl players card, gold now after my trip... figure it out and make it easy for the  customer to do business with you. Not sit there and make them wait and make other cars wait and argue Who's right and wrong. All the other attendants let me through but this one red headed lady was just a piece of work. I wish I had gotten her name but man was she something. Other than that.... I had a magical time. I hope they get rid of her because she took away some of that magic.",0,0,0

This was for a room for 4 people. 

You can't store anything in the fridge so if you bring food\/drinks, I would recommend bringing a cooler. They stock the fridge with items for purchase to get you to spend more.

spa\/gym - unlike the bellagio, the mirage was nice enough to include free passes to the spa\/gym for us since we stayed in the suite.  the spa and gym were recently renovated and are A+ quality!  the sauna and jacuzzi area is my favorite.  this area includes a dry sauna, steam, sauna, and jacuzzi.  the jacuzzi can accommodate at least 15 people.  the dry sauna is standard.  the steam sauna is the BEST!  it is dimly lit with ""mood"" music.  the is also one of the few steam saunas that have ice cold towels available.  the steam sauna experience is totally different if you have the ice cold towel over your head to maintain your head temperature as the rest of your body is exposed to the hot steam

The location is pretty great, being adjacent to the Forum and some of the other major hotels.  However, I felt like everything was more expensive than it needed to be.  It made me feel like I needed to be a little tighter with my money when it came to gambling.

Drinks are about $10 a piece or more, which is pretty on par with everywhere else in Vegas.  I don't think you can get a meal for under $35-40 a person.  It just all adds up pretty fast.  You can't even get a decent deal on rooms any more; for what you get - a pretty standard room and very little atmosphere - they are a little on the spendy side.

Also, we asked for a non-smoking room and unfortunately, the room absolutely reeked of smoke.  We called the front desk and housekeeping attempted to take care of it, but I think it was in the bathroom fan.  As soon as we turned the fan back on the smell came right back.",1,1,0

I have stayed at tons of hotels up and down the Vegas strip, some were good, some were alright, but unless you pay a hefty amount what you get in return is questionable. Mirage has combined that high end-luxury feel to their rooms, without the insane price points. They recently renovated their rooms and hallways and everything is basically brand new.

I have paid max $360 a night and have always been delivered a clean and comfortable room. No joke, their beds make you feel like you're sleeping on a cloud all night. I appreciate that they have a lot of options for dining with all sorts of different cuisine at different price points. As a coffee addict, I love that they have a Starbucks in their lobby. They have a few nice lounges where you can grab a drink. I have always had great interactions with people working at The Mirage, the list can go on. I also highly recommend checking out their Beatles Cirque show. Not for everyone, but if you are a Beatles fan, then you will really enjoy this show.

I love the location; right in the middle of the strip near all the hustle and bustle. Everything is a quick taxi ride away. The demographic is more of an older crowd and families, but that doesn't bother me since there is plenty to do around the hotel.

The dealers were rude and curt with you. I was accused of lying when the dealer had clearly made a mistake.  She looked at me like I was a criminal rather than a guest at the hotel. The pit bosses were a little better but they didn't seem to have any power over the dealers.  The cocktail waitresses were also rude and just downright unpleasant.

I spent 5 days here for a conference. I ate, walked and drank here here's a brief breakdown:

-The Room: for the price, you're getting a decent room. Stocked mini bar, robes, above average decor, flat screen, iPod dock alarm clock, rockstar bathroom. Lovely view of the parking lot.

-Eats: In the hotel, your options for sit-down are several. Stack, Japonis, Samba, Carnegie, CPK and more. Up side, just about everything is great. Down side is, your options for take away or lighter fare (in price and quantity) are very slim. For example, while working all weekend, we wanted to grab something to take back into the convention and the simplest thing we could get was $16 sandwiches from the Carnegie. Don't get me wrong, I love them, but if I was here on a vacation with someone and planned on staying in the hotel, even lunch is an ordeal. Be prepared.

Drinks: There's at least one big cup frozen drink shack. The burger joint makes boozey milkshakes. Revolution Lounge will drain your wallet to look at girls dolled up in 60's garb. King Ink is good as a lounge area but when they flip the switch to the full on nightclub, I need to evacuate. Overall: not bad.

Everyone we encountered hat worked at the hotel was awesome. Even though it's on the higher end of the scale, you are not looked down on like in some hotels, no matter what you look like.

So, overall, really good and I liked it. Im not saying they should put a food court in here or anything, but maybe something just a little more accessible  in terms of snacking would be good..",6,0,2

We got back to the room which by now was nice and cool and we turned in for the night. During the night the room began to get really hot and muggy.. The air had shut off.. I turned it back on and went back to sleep. Needless to say it didn't last long. The next day (Saturday), our only full day, we spent time in the room as the technician worked on it.. When I asked about another room I was told they only switch if the technician can't fix it. The technician got it working and left a nice gift..

A few weeks ago I decided to stay at the Mirage after I had checked out of one of my favorite hotels on the strip, Mandalay Bay.  I've stayed in many other MGM\/ Mirage hotels and I was looking forward to staying at the Mirage for the first time. 

My stay was very disappointing. There were several inconveniences and annoyances.  Beginning with my room---  

First off,  the television did not work, so I had to call down to get it repaired.  After the runaround between housekeeping and maintenance someone got to it the following day while I was out and it did get fixed.  Secondly, housekeeping did not completely clean the bathroom as I found a used washcloth tucked under the bathroom sink area.  Thirdly, after my shower and right before I had to leave my room, I discovered that  the hairdryer did not work properly.  There was no time to call down for another dryer to be delivered because of the time crunch, so I was forced to wing it for the evening.  Lastly, housekeeping forgot to clear off the previous guest's alarm clock settings which went off and woke me at 5:30 AM.  After remedying that, about thirty minutes later  housekeeping made a lot of noise out in the hallway causing the guest next door to go out into the hall and kindly ask them to keep the noise down. 

Drink service in the casino slot area was extremely poor to non-existent. It was almost like hitting the jackpot when I finally got a waitress to take an order. Very frustrating. 

On the upside, the beds are the best! It was pure luxury sinking into all those pillows and fluff!  You can't beat the location of the hotel.

This is a solid hotel but next time I will stay elsewhere, probably the Bellagio.  The standard rooms are spacious but as others have said here, the bathrooms are TINY.  Closet is very small, too.  The bathrooms are about 5' wide (just wide enough for double sinks) and about 8-9' long.  Tub is just a standard crappy tub with a curved shower bar.  There are nicer bathrooms in low end Marriotts.  The beds were comfy and it's a plus that they had two queens in a room and not doubles.

I enjoy coming to the Mirage.  From the moment I see the fish tanks behind check in and the  atrium, I feel good to be there.

The casino is not the friendliest to navigate when you're heading to the back to the Terry Fator Theatre, but after being there many times, there are short cuts to avoid the people who are slow, gawking, tipsy or a combination of those things.

It's a short walk outside to the volcano and once you're in the back, you can visit the Secret Garden of Siegfried and Roy or you can just watch the people at the pools nearest that area.",2,1,2

Well upon check out I would have given this place 5 stars but after checking out and a day later I was charged over $1500.00 from the minibar. For one night. Yes. There is something rotten in Vegas, at the Mirage. It is not even feasible for me to comprehend this arbitrary charge. When requesting assistance with researching this, the front desk people were (and still are) very...extremely rude. They didn't care. I know I didn't touch, move or shift any items; the Mirage front desk folk argue with me. 
It's a scam. By researching the net, I found out that the folk running the minibar contents don't actually inventory the contents right after the previous person checks out or someone comes to the room wipes out the minibar then demands another room bc ""they didn't like the room"" for x, y, or z reason. 
So if you've been charged an odd awkward outrageously $$$$$$$ for a minibar, the aforementioned reasons are most likely the case.

I've stayed in Vegas every other year for the past 11 years (bc I love the energy and shows) and I've never had a thing like this happen. A history into my accounts will show I have never used a minibar in a hotel whether it's a stay in Fargo, ND or Las Vegas, NV.

I'm plainly pissed. It's irresponsible on the part of the Mirage to not investigate this. I'm insulated. If you look at my bank acct, you'll see I'm not made of $.

One reason is I like the way the casino floor is laid out and I like to stay where I like to play. I enjoy the buffet here, numerous restaurants at various price points and service levels are generally high. Room service was fast and efficient even at 2 or 3 in the morning.  I will say that their call center must be run by retarded monkeys since they managed to mess up everything about the 2 rooms I booked. However the front desk staff did a great job of correcting the problems and comping us for the inconvenience so I especially want to point out the great job Relita did in helping us.

Additionally there are two good dance clubs Jet and Revolution, an outdoor bar and a good quiet bar by the sports book. Most in the party won so that is another plus but one that can't be counted on in the future.

The hotel has a great outdoor pool, an indoor adult pool and the dolphin experience where you can swim with dolphins. You can also go through the tiger compound still there from Siegfried and Roy. The gym as mentioned needs a serious upgrade but then it is Vegas you have to check the healthy lifestyle for a few days.

I won't go into all the details of my experience of what led me to complain (but you can read Jeff G's review if you want to read the details) but it's how The Mirage responded.

There were lots of inconsistencies and lack of communication due to a charges for 'using' the minibar refrigerator.  Yes, there may have been a sign on the fridge door but if it's not clear on the on the price list, one may assume they want people to move things around and use the fridge for personal use and then be charged, which is the assumption I make.  Also they couldn't answer when I asked why my sister's fridge was locked and why ours wasn't so there seems to be some inconsistent practices.  Ok, so maybe I don't know the rules of Vegas to know ""Do not use the minibar if you aren't going to consume anything from it"" but all the other times I stayed in Vegas there's either been no minibar fridge or I stay in a resort with a kitchen so I can load up the fridge with whatever I want and move things around for FREE! Maybe it would be good to assume not everyone know this Vegas rule.

The sense of this being a large resort, and I am just one guest of thousands who has an issue is the feel of this operation.  It's not like exceptional service on cruise ships, nor am I expecting it to be but the condescending manner the Manager at the front desk spoke to me was unprofessional in a customer service position.  When I inquired with the front desk agent about the charges, she informed me it's due to a sensor and since I moved items I would be charged for consumption of them.  When I spoke with the Manager, he said he would remove the charges but I would be charged a restocking fee.  He did his eye rolling, you are annoying me, I don't get paid enough to deal with this, look and I wasn't going to argue with him anymore.  He also blamed marketing for not being clear on communicating the fridge is not for personal use.  Way to pass the buck.

When I asked who else I could communicate with, I was told they would give me an email address to send to.  After the interaction, I wasn't provided with an email address and had to ask for one.  They don't really want people to email and complain, do they? Shortly after our one night stay, I received an email survey from Mr. Kallao, VP Hotel Operations, which I'm sure is sent out to all guests.  When I didn't reply right away to the survey, I received an email reminder a few days later.  So this means, Mr. Kallao REALLY wants to hear what I have to say now and will actually do something about it? 

So I completed the survey and also looked up Mr. Kallao's email address as he took the time to email me, I thought I would take the time to email him as well.  I forwarded him the email that I sent Lori P, who seems to reply to most of the Yelp reviews, and waited for a response.  But Lori P nor Mr. Kallao responded but I received a response by someone who signed their name Guest Experience.  They tell you it's going to take 3-4 days to get an email response (mine was quicker than that) but wonder why that was as they seem to reply to online reviews in a shorter time period?!  And wow, what a name to work in guest services and be named Guest Experience! Lori, when you read this review, no need to write a response as Guest was able to help me. 

They replied they would call me and I provided my contact number and received the call.  The person on the other end of the line, I don't recall the name but it wasn't 'Guest Experience' who called (must have been Guest's day off), quickly agreed with me the situation wasn't handled well and that I would be receiving a refund on my credit card.  She must be trained to get on and off the phone in less than 2 minutes and give unhappy customers' their money back.  

At the end, I'm happy to get my money back.  But don't be fooled. all the glitz and glamour to make you feel like a valued guest are just for show, once you have an issue they will want you to disappear just like the tiger show they had.  Also, for the price some guests pay here, you can stay at another resort where you can actually use the fridge for free!

The previous room was for disabled access (didn't ask for it) and was in someone else's name (they could have walked in on my wife and I). This third room is very clean and smells great, only one problem, the toilet backs up when flushed and the shower drains very very slow. Here we go again.

It defined the tone for Las Vegas for the next 15 years. Now, it's beginning to show its age. It still wants to be a top tier property, but can't match the luxury of newer hotels.

The Mirage succeeds in many ways. I've always found service to be a strong point. Registration has been friendly, organized and, dare I say it, serene. In general, I've found employees to be pleasant and efficient.

The pool is another plus. If I were to compare it to any pool, it would the one at The Flamingo. The Mirage pool has much nicer greenery, and less of a crowded feel (although it can still be quite a zoo at times). A new European style pool - Bare - has opened recently.

The remaining facilities of the hotel struggle - unsuccessfully - to keep up with the luxury Joneses.

I've stayed at The Mirage twice: once in a standard room, and once in a Tower room. The standard room is small by today's standards, but comfortable enough. Its biggest liability is a bathroom that is very small for a luxury hotel. I thought it was fine, but two bathroom-intensive folks would get on each others nerves. The Tower room is the same size as a standard room, but part of the foyer is sacrificed in order to create a larger bathroom.

Restaurants are another weakness. The term that comes to mind is ""good enough"" - not a happy description for a top property. In the last couple of years, the hotel has tried to upgrade its restaurants, with the introduction of Stack, Fin, Japonais and Carnegie Deli, as well as a revamped buffet. However, of the restaurants I've been to, none wowed me - and the remainder don't get me excited enough to try even once.

Lastly, the casino. I don't have anything especially negative to say, but I don't have anything especially positive to say either. It's ""good enough.""

The Mirage is a solid step above such properties as The Flamingo, and a solid step below places like Wynn. As long as you're not paying luxury prices, it's worth considering.",0,0,1

First off, there was only a line of around 15 parties in front of us to check in. However, because there were people that had cut(they were not from the noir\/platinum line) in line it had added to the amount of time that we had to wait in line. The. We tried to go to the mlife desk to redeem our myvegas rewards, here we were in another line, however this time the receptionist went from 3 people down to 1 and the line of 10 people were left waiting. When we finally got to the front of the line, which was about 25 minutes later, we were given an insincere apology and minimal service. 

The Cravings buffet was good, but even here we were plagued with issues. There was another customer that had used their hands to grab both food and sauces with their bare hands and there was no one from the staff to stop him. In addition, as I was standing in line for the food and had seen that happen, I was hoping that the employee that had seen it happen would have changed the food out, but no one did. So I left the buffet because I wasn't sure what else wasn't sanitary. 

The topper for me was filling out the survey. The survey asked me if I wanted someone to contact me about my stay and I said yes, I've now waited over a week and no one has contacted me. I guess they just ask that question out of formality and in hopes that customers forget. All I have received is an email with an offer for run of house room. So much for customer service.

Rooms are reasonably comfortable and large enough for one; they'd be a squeeze for a couple unless they like to stay very close. Room rates are astonishingly cheap, but alas, so is the hotel.

The room comes with zero amenities. Zero. No free bottles of water, no little mints on my pillow, no coffeepot for an early morning jolt of caffeine. No directory of hotel services because it seems there are so few services. No welcoming cookies at the front desk. Not even a bowl of aging apples. Even the ubiquitous toiletries littering the bathroom came from China, hardly a bastion of chemical purity (and certainly not anything I'd rub on my face). If I wanted Chinese junk, I'd have stayed in the parking lot at Walmart.

Because it sells at outlandishly high prices, there is a well-stocked mini-bar. But if you're thinking of adding something of your own for a late night snack, there's a warning that anything guests add will be trashed. Of course, there's no real fridge in the room, and that means there's no options for a quick (affordable) snack.

What the Mirage does offer is a charge for everything, even local phone calls. Even a bag of potato chips costs $8. While virtually every profit is fair game for the Mirage, the ubiquitous $3 bottled water troubled me. As odd as it may seem, $3 is the price from the hotel vending machines and the price in every shop in the hotel. It's also the same price almost everywhere on the Vegas strip and ditto every hotel I found.... Three bucks a bottle. Since collusion and price fixing would be illegal, I must have just wandered onto an amazing coincidence....

There's no free breakfast, in room or otherwise, not even a daily newspaper under my door. Maneuvering the lobby halls (which weave and wind back and forth through the casino's endless sea of ca-ching machines, hint, hint) there are restaurants where $20 will buy a basic breakfast. Plus coffee and juice and a tip and, well, you get it. Presumably this is a place where everyone did well at the slots last night. 

I was curious so I wandered into the hotel's Cravings Buffet where $20 (plus tip) buys a decent, even decedent, breakfast. Worth the trip if you avoid most of the soggy deserts and end your meal with an amazingly good macaroon. Oddly, that's about the same cost as a plated meal down the hall. 

The message is clear. Breakfast will always cost twenty bucks and no one's coming out ahead here, the house always wins. Unless you really like macaroons.

Tasty nibbles aside, this paranoid place required payment in advance plus a photo ID, before I could sit down to eat. Really? Maybe it's a Vegas thing - no one trusts the House and the House has no faith in its customers.

Fortunately, there is a pretty good ""health club"", a smallish room over-stuffed with top exercise gear but neither sauna nor shower. At least the cold water here is free; a rarity in this place where ""free"" seems to be a dirty word. In keeping with the everything's-for-sale theme, the only access to the health club is through a toiletries boutique. Really...? Apparently there is nothing that doesn't warrant a price tag and a sales spiel.

The Mirage would have earned two stars because the room was decent (but without a view), the bed was fairly comfortable and the décor was fine as long as you don't mind a flashback to the '80s. But it loses one of those stars for the thin, stiff towels that seem to have been washed in sandpaper. A second star was earned by the wonderful staff that went out of its way to looks after me and all the guests here. I might have been even happier with that if I hadn't found a backroom sign admonishing employees to go out of their way to look after guests.

After comparing it with other locations though, the renovations are nice but just don't cut it for a hotel that used to be on top. The bathroom is small and dated. We did try to get into JET for free but of course, the hour wait pushed us past midnight and tried to charge us $40 both girls and boys! By 12:30p the entire line was gone for JET. For that price we could have gone to XS at the Wynn. The pool was pretty but disappointing as well. They were regular pools with a waterfall in one. It just seemed small for the amount of guests staying at the Mirage. The service at the pool was excellent though.

Our towels we requested (twice) for our room also never showed up... And there were also ""room checks""? Not sure what that was about.

The casino also feels smaller from the lower ceiling, also causing the smell of fresh smoke to sting harder than at some other casinos. If you're a little sensitive to cigarette smoke, this probably isn't the best place for you to spend long hours in.

If you're able to score a room for a really low price, this is a good option, I just wouldn't pay over $100 for a room here. Oh yeah, they also wanted to charge a resort fee.

The room was comped, so that made it even better and free wi-fi is a big plus!  Great location...walking distance to Ceasers, Harrah's, TI etc.  I think they need a better pathway to get to the guest elevators.  Each time leaving and arriving into the casino, it just seemed like there was no clear path in getting to the elevators.  

I'm not super impressed by this hotel, but I'd stay here again for sure because it is a deal when you use your comps :).",4,1,1

It has a 70-ish Polynesian theme that needs to be updated, peeling wallpaper, scuff marks, etc.  We had a King room on the 23rd floor.  It was clean, and the housekeepers did a great job tidying up while we were there.  The bathrooms are incredibly small but sufficient.  Our room had 2 towels, 2 washcloths, 2 pillows - nothing extra - but again sufficient.  Check-in lines are incredibly long at all times (think Disney ride lines).  Maybe they could do a fast pass to check in.  I had to call the front desk twice during my stay, and both times I was on hold for a long time before someone could answer the call.  The pool is awesome but crowded - but did not have a difficult time finding a chair as long as I was okay with not sitting near the pool - people go out early to put their towels down and then come back later.  Great location in the middle of the strip and good fun in the casino\/clubs, which is what it is all about.  Also, the hotel houses the Beatles Love show, which is a must see.  The Cravings breakfast buffet is very good (the only thing I ate there and can comment on), but other restaurants looked great also.  My biggest complaint is the room was hot and very difficult to adjust the air conditioning enough to cool off, and also, the $30 per day ""resort fee,"" which is basically for Internet that does not work very well.",1,1,0

However, I couldn't tell you too much about the place, because besides being in the room, we were hardly there.  The Mirage does not do as good of a job of promoting what cool things that they have within their hotel as other places in Vegas that I have stayed at.  I have felt almost overwhelmed by the self promotion of other hotels on the strip, but the Mirage didn't seem to do any of that.  For example, someone asked me the week after I returned home if I had seen the zoo at the Mirage (because they know that I am an animal lover).  I was like ""what, there is a zoo!  I didn't know!"".  I felt like the Mirage was a great place to stay at, but we went elsewhere to find things to do while we were here because we were unaware of what was at our own hotel.

The room itself was perfect.  We got a great view of the strip because one of the people that I was rooming with said it was their birthday.  They also had free WiFi in the hotel, which always comes in handy for me when I am away from home.

I did get the chance to check out a couple of the places on the main floor of the Mirage.  I noticed them both in the lobby as we were walking out of the hotel, which was pretty much all I saw of the place.

We're just back from a 4 day quick trip over Thanksgiving from Vegas.  We have been before, but it's been a while so there was a lot to see and do.  We went with a large group and stayed at the Mirage.  We liked the Mirage as they were able to guarantee us a non-smoking room while other places would not do that.  We stayed in room #22029, which had been recently renovated not too long ago.  The room was nicely appointed and the beds were very comfortable.  We found an internet price of just under $100 which we thought was very good too.  The room we had was pretty spacious and faced the North, with views of Treasure Island, The Wynn, Palazzo, The Venetian and the hourly volcano eruption.  Another benefit about the Mirage was not only are there to non smoking rooms, they have non-smoking floors.  The entire 22nd floor was non-smoking and we also noticed no-smoking signs in the elevators next to the floor numbers for several other floors like ours as well.

The downside of the room is pretty typical to Las Vegas.  There are no coffee pots in the rooms and don't even think about trying to used the loaded refrigerator in the room for personal use.  There are sensors in the fridge that automatically charge your room if items are removed \/ replaced.  The prices for the food and drink beverages inside the fridge are absolutely ridiculous as well.  But honestly, this is how almost every hotel on the strip that we've ever stayed in was equipped as well.  There was a Walgreens across the street where we found water for 99 cents, so save your money for the slots!!  We had a good time and would recommend it.",0,0,1

This wasn't the case. We were right next to the elevator which we heard all night long so much so that it kept us up most of the night. On top of that the bed was really hard which made you wake up with a stiff neck if you were able to get any sleep at all. We also didn't get a microwave in our room. We had a dining room and table but no microwave to heat up leftovers. We went with the double sweet thinking it was going to be an elegant stay but I'm sad to say we can't recommend this to any of our friends or colleagues and most likely won't stay here again.
You would think getting a more expensive room would make the stay well worth the money but obviously not here at the mirage.",1,0,1

We have a goal to stay in every place on the strip in our lifetime. Bellagio was naturally the first choice, but I didn't have any offers for the property. The Mirage offered 2 comp nights and $150 in freeplay. Sounds like a winner! Booked through VIP services with ease, and anxiously awaited our trip.

We arrived Friday night around 8:30 pm. Our room was ready, and no upgrades were available. The friendly front desk agent heeded our requested room\/bed preferences, we were given our keys, and off we went.

The room itself was a standard deluxe room, and altogether not overly impressive. It was, however, clean and comfortable. Well decorated with good lighting, an oversized lounge chair, and a desk with 2 chairs. The bathroom was tiny in comparison to most newer hotels we have visited, but this is a minor complaint. The electronics cluster above the desk was an unexpected perk. I should have done more research and noted it earlier, I would have brought an HDMI cable to watch Netflix on the 40"" (estimated) flat screen TV. A cable connection kit is offered in the mini bar, should you be so inclined to purchase one. I was not. The bed was very comfortable, although this is a subjective opinion of someone who has a modern day torture rack to sleep on at home. Your opinion may vary, but I don't think anyone could say it was bad.

On to the casino. The casino floor layout is a confusing one, and we never really got our bearings as the weekend went on. A good mix of slots and denominations. The lowest tables were at a $10 minimum for the most part. We had no problem finding our favorites, or a new machine to try out. All the dealers we encountered were very friendly. Cocktail service in the slots was hit or miss, but lay out a decent tip on your first round, and you'll get good attention from the server in your area. You're not paying for those drinks, so why not? A 5 spot for 2 drinks seemed to do the trick.

We had room service for breakfast on both Saturday and Sunday. The food arrived in under an hour hot and delicious. On Sunday, the poached eggs on my Benedict were overcooked, but I was so hungry I didn't care and powered through it. Saturday night, we tried BLT Burger. Moderately priced and decent, but really not worth elaborating beyond saying it was OK.

All in all, a good visit. Disappointed we did not get the chance to check out the pool due to the ridiculous heat this particular weekend, where temps soared to 117 degrees, but it gives us something to look forward to when we return...",6,1,1

We walked over to the Mirage to eat at the Flavors buffet. The buffet was good...but thats not what i am writing about. Halfway through the meal my stomach told me that i was having an emergency. I didnt walk, i ran to the nearest bathroom. 

As soon as i entered the bathroom my delicate nasal passages were delighted by the fragrant scents. I looked around and everything was sparkling and clean. I said to myself ""self, this is the nicest effin bathroom i have ever been in."" 

I then proceeded to unload 4 or 5 shells of the chocolate shotgun into the pristine commode. I definitely left this bathroom worse off than i found it. On a positive note though, by unloading the entire contents of my small colon, it made more room for more jumbo shrimp and crab legs :)",2,14,2

Checking in wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.  I booked the Penthouse Suite with 2 separate bedrooms.  The girl then notified me the room wasn't available I would have to be put in 2 separate suites not even next to each other.  When i said it wasn't what I booked, she excused herself to get the manager.  He basically informed me that was my only option.  Lucky for me he also credited half of the original room charge. 2 penthouse suites & half the price was a pretty nice deal.  

Walking into the room took my breath away.  Beautiful room! Bar area was with a stocked beverage refrigerator and a separate one for your own drinks. The living room area lead into the dining room and the comfy master bedroom which lead into a huge bathroom.  Not finished yet...  a hallway leading to the closet and separate toilet room.  Pretty amazing especially since my first apartment wasn't even this big.  Everything was clean and fresh. 

There are several restaurants located inside that range from casual to fancy.  You'll also find the fabulous Cirque Show Love and Terry Fator.  Various comics also travel through such as Ray Romano and Daniel Tosh as part of their Aces of Comedy showcase.

- Arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm. They didn't have the room we had booked available (Resort Tower King), they only had Resort Queen rooms available.  A little annoying since the Resort Tower King is a slight upgrade from Resort Rooms, but it's late and I understand.  They let us know they'll move us tomorrow at noon, and they'll call us to let us know what room we've been transferred to.  No need to return the keys, he says, because they can just change which room the keys open on the computer. Awesome.

- Next day at 11 am, we call to confirm the transfer.  What transfer?  After some searching, they still can't find any records of a transfer request.  Would we like to initiate one? Um, yes. To a room we originally booked.  Thanks.  Okay, they say.  Hold tight.  We'll call back in a minute.

- No word for half an hour.  We call back.  They're still working on it.  Hold tight, they say.

- No word after an hour.  We're literally just sitting by the room phone with all of our packed luggage just watching TV, since we can't go gambling or anything.

-Two hours later: congrats! The room has been transferred! Come down to the lobby for your new keys! Um.. but the guy said you could just do that on the computer. No? Okay, we'll go down.

- Get to the lobby with all of our luggage in tow.  Your keys? Oh, they've been sent up with security to meet you in front of your new room.  Didn't anyone tell you?

And even after all this, I was still charged the FULL AMOUNT for the upgraded room.  Complained to the front desk, complained to a manager... nothing.  Are you freaking kidding me?  Get your crap together, Mirage.

All in all, even though it's a decent hotel, it's honestly a little pricey for being so basic.  There are a lot of nicer hotels for similar prices and a bigger casino floor, so I'm not entirely sure what the Mirage's appeal is supposed to be. Maybe the location?  I'm not too sure, but you'd better believe that I will be enjoying my stay somewhere a bit more organized, thank you.",1,0,0

The cost is $400 and you get it from 10am-6pm.  They are randomly assigned but I was adamant that I wanted my cabana at the quiet Oasis Pool so had it approved by the pool manager, Amanda, who only allowed it because it was a weekday.  If you want to be part of the wild zoo that is the main pool, there are lots of cabanas over there, but the Oasis Pool is very peaceful and never crowded and everyone has to be over 18.  To rent a chair at the oasis pool, it's $35.

The cabanas are spacious and have a really great fan which keeps the heat at bay.  Even better, there are misters at the front of the cabana and near your lounge chairs which you can turn on or off that kept of us from dying of the 104 degree heat.  The fridge is stocked with complimentary water bottles and soda, a fruit plate, and a cheese plate with very nice selections.  You also get a basket that has crackers, candy, chips, and other snacks.  There's a flat screen tv with lots of channels, 3 really comfortable lounge chairs outside the cabana, 2 sofas inside, a table, and you also get complimentary pool floats. Bring your own sunscreen because it was $17 at the pool.

You can order from three different menus and the food is brought right to your cabana.  Late in the afternoon an attendant walked around and handed out a very tasty pineapple sorbet.  The only complaint we had was that the service was awful.  The people renting chairs at the oasis pool had constant service but we, who paid $400, only saw an attendant every 2 hours or so and every time we asked for something like more water bottles, it took forever to arrive.  Despite the terrible service, we really enjoyed our cabana.",1,0,0

We first stayed in a suite with two separate baths years ago and it was really pretty decent even though they were undergoing renovations, but man, the room we got this weekend was so noisy we left Vegas drained.  The doors have about an inch gap at the bottom and they're not even solid doors, so sounds from drunk ass people talking in the hallways transmitted into our room like they were inside.

I will admit I was shocked how we were UPGRADED for FREE to a petite Suite. I'm very grateful for myVEGAS slots (facebook & mobile game).  I earned our room and I've got a ton of loyalty points. I just wish you could redeem the room rate more than once.. If you're a couple it's not so bad. I play on the boyfriend's account to earn double the rewards. You're allowed up to 3 redeems in a rolling 30 day period.

I have to mention I'm a local & I did book this stay just to get away from the same crap different day feeling. I don't stay for more than one night. We've never had maid service. I've heard many horror stories so PLEASE FOLKS. Use the safes in the rooms! I was thoroughly pleased with our last visit May 8th 2014, our anniversary.

I booked it this time I couldn't believe the value I got. $59 plus the 12% resort fee & another 12% room tax.  Plus the 25 dollar resort fee. Our last visit was had a basic room with a king bed. I thought the room was beautiful. This time we were right at the elevator. I was amazed when we saw our room number as we excited the elevator. I was ecstatic. My eyes light up when we opened the doors, I guess I don't get out much. It had his & her's bathrooms. A super comfy bed just like the last room. The view was of the backside of the building with a mountain view. I thought it was great. You could see palace station & the stripper bars. We turned off the lights at night in the room to check out the view.

What I'm upset about is this morning our check out was LOVELY. George the bell man was so polite & happy to know we were there for a daycation. We went to the M life desk because the last time we stayed they had comped one of our meals each. One for breakfast, one for dinner. on top of the myVEGAS rewards I had loaded to our account. So the meals were basically free. We went this time & the lady at M life was miserable & could of cared less. She was complaining about how she had been up since 7 am after we mentioned we were exhausted from staying up until 4 AM hoping we had comps for breakfast. She said, ""NO, sorry. Just $4 in express comps"".  My boyfriend replied, ""That's funny, wonder WHY they comped us the last time we stayed?"", we decided it was time to check out. The Check out was not has memorable as our last. The girl hid her name tag, behind her hair. Didn't ask us how we were or how was our stay here, no concern.

Then for the bell guy down at the main valet.. We handed him the ticket. He told us to go to valet, he met us there & and soon as he dropped our stuff off he started mumbling on under his breath. So then we finally got the car, valet comes roaring up in our new car that's barely a month old, like a bat out of hell. He misses his coworker that wasn't paying attention pulls the car around the car parked in valet & stops. Boyfriend went to reach in his wallet for a tip & he says to my boyfriend, ""Don't worry about it, I don't need it"". Not sure if he was referring to the tip or the valet slip.  He could of been less of a miserable person. We didn't even bother giving him a hard time about the car. All the valets tell us they love the car. Maybe he was just having a good day & somebody tipped big. We tip fair.

I don't understand. Our anniversary was nice & we were treated so highly. Today everybody had a stick up their butts. What the heck just happened? I'm confused. Our room was great but now I'm torn between giving this place an, ""A-OK"" and a ""YAY! I'm a fan.""  I'm a fan of the rooms but the way we were treated was inexcusable. From M life desk, to check out, to bell guy to the valet.

A smile & a friendly greeting goes a long way. I always smile when I'm a guest. I don't want to be the memorable unpleasant guest.  I'll give them another try next year, since I'm so on the fence. Definitely was not, ""As good as it gets"". Not this time. Last time they waved our fees & this time we paid...... oh well. Very disappointed. The only thing I was pleased with, we managed to keep our Pearl Status by taking this trip.  Make sure you always use your player's card. You earn points at all the MGM properties. You earn more from shows than you do gambling. Sign up is free at M life desk.",2,2,0

So..the day before traveling I call to confirm that they know we're arriving late (they didn't) and I ask again about adjoining rooms.  I'm told BOTH times that it's GUARANTEED.  That's a word you don't often hear when discussing hotel rooms.  I know.  I used to book them.  I verified.  ""GUARANTEED?""  ""Yes, ma'am, guaranteed.""  ""Okaaayyyyyy.""
Get there, no adjoining rooms for the first night.  Not kidding.  Ugh.  So I speak up and let the gal checking us in know we were ""GUARANTEED"" adjoining rooms.  I explained that I even double checked about whether or not late check in would effect that.

We stayed in the newly remodeled rooms....SWEET.  
It was great...comfy...pretty....lovely.  
What more could I want?
A working volcano.  That will come.

I can walk out the doors, towards the main boulevard, and stand on the bridge where the Bellagio waters dance to music or walk a few more feet and arrive at the doors of the Caesar Shoppes where you can walk under a blue sky, indoors, discover Victoria's Secret, and watch the story of Atlantis unfold.

I also enjoy watching the volcano erupt in front of the hotel.

I'm not a gambler so I bypass the casino located in the lobby of the hotel but I do enjoy the food selection. Pricey, indeed, but the quantity you receive is even more outrageous! I swear, I ordered a deli sandwich and fries (which are charged separately) and my sandwich stood at least 12 inches in the air due to being stuffed with turkey meat. I think it was around $15-18. The fries I paid $5 for could fill a 5 lb bag of sugar. I ended up taking out the majority of the meat out of my sandwich, bagging it, putting it in my fridge in the room, and eating it for lunch for the remainder of the week.

I will continue  to stay at this hotel since I do enjoy it so much, it is conveniently located, and they are always offering specials on their room rates,  though, I do have to make it to the Luxor so I can see Criss Angel ... mmm",0,0,0

When I called the hotel they were no help. I told then I wasn't informed about this mandatory fee in advance and they said it's on our paperwork. 

Terrible service. If there's a fee that's gonna be charged tell me ahead of time. Most of the time people don't read anything. 

It's a hassle and a waste of time for me to have to call and ask what it is.

First the dealers, mostly the males seem to be bitter (only mentioning due to a previous recent review---I hear ya brotha!).  The real reason for this review was just simply a warning to all Mlife Platinum+ members.  This is NOT a Platinum friendly hotel.  I booked the room that morning and the lady on the phone put a note that I requested an upgraded room (i know the regular rooms don't have safes big enough for a laptop).  At check-in I was put in a regular room, which the reason was because they were sold out---which means that in the few hours between my reservation and arriving, they gave it away.  I was then told to come back the next day and be transferred to another room.  I did that and was told that they didn't have it available. I didn't even bother to try for the next night because it would probably be the same thing and I got tired of talking to different people and going back and forth to the front desk. I ended up having to keep the 'do not disturb' sign on the door and refuse housekeeping service the whole stay.  But be warned----I did have a very odd experience one stay a while back where something was wrong with my room so either the maintenance guy or the housekeeper entered my room with the 'do not disturb' sign on the door.

Oh and speaking of odd....I was rushing at checkout time, so I had to checkout on my TV at 10:59am.  There was one charge.  A $0.04 cent tip at one of their restaurants. What?  Well I wasn't surprised to see that because one of the mlife attendants told me about it the other night when I asked about whether or not they can upgrade me to a room with a bigger safe.  Anyways, they even admitted that it was a strange charge and probably a mistake.  I was just surprised to see it still on my bill.  OH well. I didn't feel like rushing out, running my errand that I had to do, then come back and try to clear up a 4 cent charge. 

There's been a lot of work going on in the casino.  New bars, and one about to open where the Revolution used to be, so there was lots of construction type of activity, noises, and one morning even a strong paint smell by the tables---which made me have to leave after losing half my chips (good thing maybe?) and take a nap.  

Now for some good. A while back I went to the stack restaurant.  Fantastic place for a date.  Great food for sharing.  Yes the prices are high, but then you don't look cheap, so at least a little bit of a win there.  Just try to make it up on the casino floor.",0,0,0

Comment would be that they don't refill the big drinks, which can be a bummer because we ended up with six large cups we couldn't do anything with. We also ate at the poolside eatery and it was really good! People might say something about price, but their prices are worth what you pay for.

There are so many other nice hotels in Las Vegas that I wouldn't recommend anyone book this unless they were getting a real steal and\/or were on a budget.

While everything is clearly modern and somewhat newly renovated, there are already some visible scuffs on a lot of the furniture. The rooms are much smaller than many of the other Las Vegas hotels.. though really the part of this hotel that makes me the most sad is the bathroom.

Still, when you compare it to hotels like New York-New York or the Paris, this hotel still ranks higher in terms of decor and quality of service.

Location is good if you don't mind walking 10-15mins to get to the major casinos\/attractions. While there was a time when staying at or around the Wynn\/Venetian\/Fashion Show Mall was for me, these days I prefer to stay as close to the Cosmopolitan\/Aria as possible. The Mirage is conveniently located in between the two.",7,4,5

The manager was clearly very unexperienced in handling issues. I highly recommend the McDonald's across the street due to the consistency of their food you'll know what you're getting. Will be trying out another hotel this evening to see how their food and services and I will update our review.,2,3,0

I recently stayed at MGM, Mandalay Bay, & Luxor at prior trips within the last couple of years. I was hesitant since Mirage isn't a newer one, but was sold  on location, price, & pool (I had researched). I loved everything about the hotel - the decor, tropical feel\/ waterfalls, etc. It is close to the monorail, & Promenade. 

I had a room with a great view of  the strip\/ LinQ High Roller - the volcano eruption was a fun thing to see. The room was very modern & spacious. The bed was super comfy! Bathroom was a little tight. Bummer they didn't provide a hotel map or any reference for restaurants, etc.,in the room. But they had menu for 24 Hour room service. We did order & didn't have to wait long. The only drawback was since I was using a debit card (not credit card) room service needed cash when they brought food (told me in advance when I ordered), that I couldn't charge it to the room. 

When I called to extra pillows & towels, they brought up very quickly (unlike Mandalay where I waited over 30 minutes & had to call again). 

The hotel is a good size & easy to navigate, unlike some others where there is too much, like trying to get to MGM pool, which is quite a hike from the room. Mirage was easy to get to, close to the elevators. The pool was beautiful! Plenty of chairs, nice bar to get a drink or hang out, overlooking the pool. Jacuzzi is a really good size, & secluded. The pool has waterfalls, &  nice little cove areas, & ""seats"" along the sides which is nice bonus. There were some shady areas. Overall,great hotel & I will stay again.",7,1,2

The rooms was what I expected, but my biggest complaint was that it was extremely noisy. You can hear conversations in the hallway from the inside of your room and then your neighbors's doors slam shut, it wakes you up. 

The dining selection was also quite limited. There's a deli that's way overpriced, a burger joint that was decent, and California Pizza Kitchen, which has really good service.

Everything you would need in a hotel on the Strip it has. Gambling, Dining (heritage, stack, pantry etc) nightlife (1oak, rhumbar) gaming and an updated room experience and location. 

First off location, located between treasure Island and Ceasars palace across from harrahs\/casino Royale it's right in the middle of the action and if your preference is city center your in for a short 15\/20 min walk. I prefer Arias location this is still in the middle of the action. 

Gaming is definitely a plus for me as I prefer 2 deck blackjack and the minimum is kept to a modest $25 a hand which gives me options on how I would like to gamble. They also have European roulette which is another game I love to play. Lots of slot machines and a decent poker room (I don't play poker but the room seemed kinda small compared to others I've see around) 

There are plenty of options to choose from as far as dining goes lvb formally blt had both and prefer blt. California pizza kitchen, pantry, still and Carnegie are you middle range convenience options. Heritage steak is definitely a must for anyone looking for a great steak while in Vegas. Their are other options such as fin, portifino and japonais I have not tried these but definitely will in the future to test the waters. 

The rooms are great. Clean, spacious most rooms need the bathroom updating as they look a little run down and don't match the updated fixtures and lighting in the room. But overall a great room experience.

I gambled at The Mirage a couple of years ago and won, but this was my first time staying at the hotel.  For a hotel that would probably be considered mid-range (like a Bally's), the hotel rooms were nice.  The decor was contemporary and had a very comfortable feel.  I've been to a lot of hotels where the room felt badly in need of an update, but that was not the case here.  Linens felt new.  Bathrooms were clean.  Temperature got a little uncomfortable at night, but that probably could have been easily addressed if we would have paid more attention to the thermostat.

In addition to the good rooms (especially for the price), the hotel had the advantage of being small (at least when compared to other casinos along The Strip).  It made getting around and meeting up with people very easy.  The location is convenient too with The Mirage being near both Caesars Palace and The Venetian.

While the nice rooms and the size of the casino were both big pluses, the casino was smoky (a lot smokier than the nicer casinos like Caesars and Bellagio but probably also smokier than the okay casinos like Bally's and MGM Grand).

In terms of food, a lot of the restaurants at The Mirage did not sound that good and the one we tried (Fin) was definitely not good; it was also overpriced.  There is a gourmet burger spot here (BLT Burger) that might be worth trying.  I had a mostly positive experience with BLT Steak (same owner) in West Hollywood.  There is also a CPK here.  It would probably make sense to dine there (and save some money) than try one of the many overpriced spots at The Mirage.

If I wanted to stay at a Vegas hotel and do everything within that hotel, I would definitely not stay at The Mirage.  Since I like to casino hop (whether for gaming, dining or simply getting some fresh air), The Mirage is a good option for its size, nice rooms and reasonable price.  The smokiness of this casino is definitely a negative and should be considered if you are planning to spend a lot of the time within this hotel\/casino during your Vegas stay.

For parking, there is a free structure that is also not too big, which made getting in and out of the casino\/hotel pretty easy.",18,12,16

One star is too generous for this room. I've stayed at hotels, motels, inns, in several different states. I've stayed in Vegas more times than I can count, or even rememberthis room is by far, landslide far, the dirtiest. 

Housekeeping should be ashamed of themselves! It's quite nasty. Does anyone in this department take pride in their work? 

For November 18 & 19th on the 24th  floor I can answer that's a big giant NO. And by the way the puke\/food\/fecal matter that's dried up on the ....wait for it BAR counter and the build up of mildew\/mold in the shower they haven't taken pride in their work for sometime. 

I've attached 19 pictures... yes 19.. of the most disgusting all but the hairy bathtub were taken right upon check-in. The hairy bathtub is today after housekeeping, its dirtier now than it was before I left this am. 

I put a nice(sincerely good morning, please leave extra towels, thank you nice)note this morning and a generous tip directly behind the puke-poo- god please let it be food drip hoping housekeeping would see it and clean it....no it's still there. There is no way they didn't unless they are legally blind and if that's the case I understand why my room looks and smells the way it does. 

I'm extremely hesitant to complain while I'm still staying here for fear of retaliation. 

If I can't trust that housekeeping is doing at least the bare minimum of cleaning how can I trust that they are taking the serious and life-threatening housekeeping duties seriously! STDs like gonorrhea have been found to survive in towels for up to 24 hours, and chlamydia was detected on plastic surfaces for up to 45 minutes. The virus that causes genital herpes is also transmissible via non-sexual contact, surviving for up to two hours outside the body.

Price:  Ridculously ""La Quinta priced"" deal at $60\/night

Room: Construction in elevator area caused lines to form for the elevators.  You have to wait anywhere from 5-15 minutes before catching one.  Rooms were recently renovated with modern accents light flat screen tvs, & marble baths.

Cravings Buffet:  Overpriced for selection.

Casino:  Absolutley sucks!  It takes forever to see a cocktail waittress much less to get a drink.  We actually questioned whether they had any on staff at one point.  If you think you are getting comp points....THINK AGAIN.  We played for 6 hrs playing $200 a hand at blackjack and only got comped ONE buffet after we were told by the pit boss both our buffets would by comped.  After being told we only had one comp at Cravings we went back to the pit boss only to find he had left on shift change and did not give us credit on our cards.  BOGUS.

SPA:  I got a massage, pedicure, and manicure.  The pedicure and manicure were great.  I would recommend to anyone.  The massage on the other hand.....NO.  When I first met my massure she was cold.

I went up to the bartender and asked for a long island and sat down to talk to the family. I must have been sitting for a good 10 minutes before a drink was ever brought out to begin with, and I dont know about everyone else but when I'm meeting new people I really would like a drink in hand ASAP. The drink was good, very strong and not very sweet but I didnt mind it. I had one more drink after that and then we all decided to go get something to eat at the italian resturant Portifino. When I asked the bartender if I could pay my bill she said she had added it to our tables bill, so I asked if she could please take it off their bill and I would pay for my own drinks. The bartender then replied that she couldnt do that, I'm going to be honest, I wasnt happy with that response so I rolled my eyes and told her I needed the bill split (this was my first meeting with my boyfriends out of town family, I didnt want to add another $25 on to their bill, and I had no cash just my card) the bartender then looked at me like I was an idiot and said ""Oh yeah sorry, I can't""
i have worked in the service industry for years before I settled in my career and to say ""no"" to anything in the hotel bussiness is unacceptable. ESPECIALLY because all I wanted to do was pay my bill and go. My soon to be in laws told me it was fine and they would pay for it no problem but honestly! How embarassing...!

After that embarassing moment we headed over to the Portifino resturant located not very far from the bar. When we walked in we were dazzled by the designs and how pretty everything was, the bar inside is beautiful and the wine selections on the menu is one of the best. We were seated at a round table that must have been one of those pull out tables that you can set up becuase there was a metal rod digging into my crossed legs the whole time. You would think with the way the inside ""looks"" and the prices I would be comfortable but not at all. The menu selection wasnt very big, but I ordered the steak and had some wine and it was really good. My only other complaint is the service from our waitress, she was very snobby and for me personally even though I like to fine dine, I dont like being interrupted every couple of minutes to hear about specials and wine pairings, I'm a wine drinker and I know my wines! It just wasnt was I was expecting... I wanted to spend quality time and get to know my soon to be in laws not have my server talk to us for half the experience. Also just a suggestion, every resturant especially a a fine dinning resturant in the hotel, should have a bathroom inside, being away from the table for 10  minutes to go back into the casino and find the bathroom was not pleasant. 

I really did like the actual hotel experience, I won money on a couple of machines, the room was nice, lobby was beautiful, it was just the service that needed help. Other than that just the way this hotel decor is makes it my favorite on the strip.",2,1,1

I had a long conversation with Carl the security officer and he was awesome and very helpful, a great ambassador for the Mirage. Usually when a poor review has been given it is not because of a bad experience, it's because they didn't get something for FREE and are angry.

The rooms were probably renovated a while ago but they are definitely showing wear-and-tear with scuff marks and chipped furniture here and there. After the first night the stopper in the bathtub wouldn't stay open so every time I showered I had to prop the stopper up with a tube of shower gel. The bathroom is very tiny, you can't get in the shower without closing the bathroom door. The room, however, is massive and spacious enough for a party (I had a double queen).

House keeping was fine but on the last day I left early in the morning for a conference and came back late at night to find my room not made up at all. By that time I just wanted to go to bed so I called the service desk, told them my room was unmade and I only wanted fresh towels at this point. Somebody named Rene from housekeeping came up immediately and was extremely apologetic about the situation even though I knew he was not the housekeeper for my room. He brought me a stack of fresh towels and new toiletries. He even brought me room slippers LOL!

Even though the hotel needs some freshening up it's completely liveable and the location along with the price are really good so I would stay here again.

QUICK TIP: Denny's, White Castle and Walgreens are right across the street. To get there faster use the side entrance by the Starbucks and walk down the laneway and the crosswalk is right there. Don't use the front entrance or you will have to walk down a long driveway and 3 crosswalks at the intersection.",11,0,1

The location was nice since it's kind of in the middle of everything we wanted to go to; right across the street from the Venetian, next to Caesars and the most we paid for a taxi was about $7 and that was to go to XS at Encore (we could've walked but it was really cold that night)

Check in and out was quick and the staff was really friendly. They've got some good dining options there; BLT Burger (where we ate), CPK, Cravings (buffet) and other ones I can't remember. The Atrium was pretty and the fish were cute LOL. JET nightclub is there and we were at The Beatles Revolution Lounge only for a quick minute but the music was on point. 

I didn't really gamble here (well, I won $25 on the penny slots LOL) so I'm just reviewing the room itself, which was pretty nice and spacious. The bathroom was small but it did it's job and the fixtures were clean and modern. The beds were nice but the pillows were to soft for me. Also, housekeeping tried to get in really early, like before nine, if I remember correctly, so that was kind of odd.

By the entry, there is a full length mirror and mirrors on the coat closet which, I believe, is meant to be a ""getting ready"" area; however, the lighting wasn't that great so it was kind of hard to see. The outlets were weird too. Our hair tools kept falling out of the sockets so that was kind of a pain.

CHECK-IN\/FRONT DESK - 4 Stars
I think the check-in process at The Mirage went very smoothly for such a large resort (experienced worse at other resorts in Vegas).  My flight landed in Vegas at 7:45am, so I was at the Mirage about 8:30 that morning.  As I had planned and expected, my room was not ready since check-in wasn't until 3:00 (which was understandable and fine by me).  So I checked in my bags with the bellhops and started out my day.  Upon returning to the Mirage around 2:30 to see if my room was ready, there was actually a pretty long line for check-in.  Surprisingly, this line moved swiftly and I was at the front desk talking to a front desk clerk within 10 minutes.  At this point my room was actually ready, which kind of surprised me.  I figured I'd still have to 'come back after 3'.  Definitely a great front desk staff.

HOTEL ROOM - 5 Stars
My hotel room was a standard double queen room with a great view of the Volcano and the Strip on the 18th floor.  The room itself was decorated nicely and seemed very modern.  Was also very well kept (clean).  Besides the standard two queen beds and bathroom, the room had a decent sized flat screen TV (Plasma or LCD), a safe, ironing board, mini fridge, workstation\/desk, ironing board, etc.  Again, very nice room.

CASINO - 4 Stars
In my opinion, the Casino in the Mirage has it's ups and downs.  The ups?  It's very clean and I love the theme\/decorating throughout.  Plenty of slot machines and plenty of table games, and it never seems 'overcrowded' like some casinos can get.  My only downside was the table limits themselves.  Granted it's The Mirage and not Circus Circus, but I would expect to find something lower than $25 tables across the board on a Tuesday evening.  Burt I still played anyways.

DINING - 5 Stars
I've tried the Brazilian Steakhouse, the Buffet and BLT Burger.  All three are great places to eat with friendly staff and awesome food, but if you eat at the Mirage on a daily basis without a large budget, your wallet can thin out quickly.  However, I would recommend one meal at each of the three restaurants.  You won't regret it, especially BLT Burger.

BARS - 4 Stars
I love the bars throughout the Mirage.  My top two are the Sports Book bar and the bar in the atrium by the front desk.  Revolution Lounge (not the club, but the bar itself outside) is also a cool place to grab a drink or two.

SPORTS BOOK - 5 Stars
Next to the Sports Book at Caesars Palace, this is my favorite SB in Vegas.  The staff is very friendly and the SB itself is very clean and spacious.  Unlike some sports books, it actually feels welcoming when you walk in.  Cocktail Servers are also abundant unlike some other Sports Books in Vegas.

STAFF - 5 Stars
I have yet to encounter a bad experience with a staff member at The Mirage.  Even if I was irked about something, the staff was friendly and efficient in taking care of the matter.  Staff is top notch. "" show less",2,0,0

I finally made it there after many trips to LV. As an MLife reward member, I qualified for a special room rate which was great.

Note: when you pay for parking at one MLife site, you are covered at others. Be sure to ask them to put parking on your room key.

For starters, sign up to receive emails because I booked with a promo - I want to say 20% off rates and a $25 room service credit.  I booked their Hospitality Suite for two friends and myself.  There is also AAA rates for members too.  I got a better rate doing it through the email promo.

I will mention I'm NOT a fan of resort fees though once in a while I overlook it if I really want to stay at the place.  Unlike other hotels where the fee is optional...it is not here, at least we weren't told that it was.

We arrived between 6 & 7pm and there was no wait - we walked right up and we were given excellent service right from the start...we also got bottles of water with our room keys.  Our Hospitality Suite was on the 4th floor - not the best view but a decent view and really, how much time does one admire their view while in Vegas, ok, a few minutes here and there so not at all a big deal!

The room was clean and we got all kinds of decent size shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, etc.  I got a new loofah every day as well - I wish I didn't pack that stuff because everything I needed was there in the bathroom and refilled daily.    This suite was pretty amazing too...I felt like a princess getting ready in a bathroom that big!  

The weather was in the 70s so there were people at the pool but it wasn't overcrowded where you couldn't find a chair.  The service at the pool was great, the grounds were clean, etc.

The hotel itself has a lot of great options...we ate at BLT Burger, California Pizza Kitchen, Cravings, and Stack.  I did some chocolate shopping at the Sugar Factory, grabbed breakfast from the Roasted Bean, and Frozen Yogurt at Blizz so there are plenty of food options right on site and no need to leave and go elsewhere. There is a decent size gift shop that sells everything you need souvenir wise, if you forgot something at home, or if you want a snack and drink.

It was a nice place when it first opened, but you can tell it's not too much different from when they filmed Vegas Vacation here!

I was here for the Big Smoke, the annual cigar show
I do come here to see the Cirque du Soliel show, Beatles Love, but this hotel is not a normal destination for me

I did enjoy the cigar show, but the hotel ventilation system couldn't handle that many people all lighting up at the same time, looked like fog in the room!

Went to their new Center Bar, was a bit noisy, so ended up the night drinking and smoking (Cigars people, not that funny stuff) at the also new Parlor Lounge

the casino itself is still ok, again, a bit dated, but still nice

View right on the vulcano show. There is an assortment of nuts and sweets available.. but be carefull.. you gotta pay for them.. in europe assortments in a room are mostly for free if they are there but here not.. so be aware to check the pricelist first.. in the hotel you have a beautifull casino and pool place.. there is 1 heated pool and heated jacuzzi open in the winter time which we definately used! Also we had jacuzzi drinking service.. we were the only once using the big jacuzzi and still we got a waitres taking care of us.. we felt like royalty!! Also in the hotel are alot of bars and food places.. starbucks is inside the hotel which is great for morning coffee.. also since the mirage is right in the middle of the strip its the best location you can be at... its a little more expensive than the once on the end of the strip but so worth it..

I traveled here with my best friend and 60 year old mother. My mother has a legally recognized service dog and the staff has constantly harassed her and attempted to charge her for the dog. Legally a business can not charge a person for bringing their service animal. 
We visited the spa and thoroughly enjoyed our massages\/experience but as my mother laid on a resting bed after the massage I spotted a HUGE cockroach on the bed's covers. 
We attempted to visit bare lounge and the security guard publicly insulted and harassed us at the lounge's entrance (on my birthday none the less) for having an e cig in my  bag. He claimed that we were harming children and pointed to sign with size pt 10 font that says no e cigs. He could've handled the situation in a calm non aggressive manner instead of publicly embarrassing us..

The Mirage definitely fit the bill. I purchased a basic rate non-smoking room from their website, but the sweet girl at check-in upgraded our room 18 floors up. 

Our room offered us a pretty nice view of the pool and mid strip (Caesar's Palace, Paris, etc.). Stone and marble line our bathroom; the shower was separate from the jacuzzi tub; there were two sinks; the Babyliss hair dryer alone retails for about $100; and that's just our bathroom. I found it peculiar that we had a huge bouquet of lavender roses and room service came by within 10 minutes of our arrival. It turned out the previous person that stayed in our room was a high roller, and that these extras were for her. huh! If I had realized that earlier, then I would have accepted the food. lol. 

We were on our way to a show one night, when we saw a group of security guards position themselves by the elevators at the casino level. I thought something exciting was about to happen, so I wanted to stay and watch, but we had a show to catch. Then when we returned later that evening, we realized they were there to check for room keys as a part of their security routine. heh.

I feel The Mirage is an above average Las Vegas strip casino hotel. There are a variety of restaurants: Asian buffet, breakfast, froyo, Jewish deli, burgers, coffee chain, pastry\/coffee shop, national chain pizza, upscale Japanese inspired, bars galore, etc. I saw their (Cirque du Soleil show) Love last summer, and it was simply fantastic.

I come to Vegas every 3mos or so and always book my stay at the Mirage. My last few stays have been very poor.

Most recent stay (12\/26-29)
- Placed in a room next to the ice vending machine. Turned our that there was a leak into our room from the ice vending machine. Thought I would be nice to inform front desk about it. They sent up a maintenance guy who said he would resolve the problem, which is why we didnt deem it necessary to change rooms. He said he would send housekeeping to clean up the water, which they never did. After 1.5 days in the room, I had to get new towels to soak up the water. The stench was horrible every time we entered the room. It was very musky. Finally had to call front desk and ask to switch rooms. 
- Second room was much better. No musky smell. However, the bed was not up to par. The mattress sunk in the middle, making it very uncomfortable to sleep. 
- I had also originally requested hypoallergenic sheets, which housekeeping has always been very good w. This visit, we received 4 new pillows and a blanket in a bag.... very questionable.  
- Received a comp'd night, but IMO there shouldve been more.
- Friend was placed in a room that wasnt cleaned well. There was stool in her bath tub. How did it get there?! Who knows...

July visit
- Placed in a room that was still dirty (trash on the floor, unmade bed). Made a complaint and was placed in another room.
- Second room was also not up to par (fridge was stuck and did not open, pubic hair on the bed). Made another complaint and was placed in another room.


Very disappointed in the quality of the room.

Reservation agent told me he was going to charge everything except for the  second night stay since I was making a reservation one day out.  

When I checked in found out he had it all backwards which caused confusion at check in.  The agent never told us about the m card perks which became a hassle trying to get credit for purchase made on property that could have been added to the card at the time of sale as opposed to standing in line trying to get the credit.

 The room was supposed to be a king with a view of the volcano show however it was not a king room it was a room with two queen beds.   There was a big red stain (blood?) On the side of the bed.  The table had a long blonde hair on it, not from us.  

One bed had a top sheet which appeared to have some sort of smear on it.   The showerhead was small and we would have a pool of water outside the tub after two showers.  Something that housekeeping did not take care of during the am cleaning.

Now I could have complained to management and maybe they would have moved us to a better room however I did not want to spend extra time moving from room to room.  Seems to me that the cleaners do the bare minimum when cleaning at that management does not inspect the rooms very often otherwise the nasty stain would not be on the carpet and side of the box spring of the bed.

The biggest problem I experienced, however, was that, while I was attending a conference on-site and my wife was at an off-site business event, housekeeping helped themselves to my $200 sunglasses. Not only that, but security, who took 30 minutes to arrive, did nothing more than have me fill out a form and ""Risk Management"", who I am supposed to follow-up with, never answers their phone or returns calls. Then, when they finally call back after you suggest going to someone higher up the chain, they inform you that they aren't liable for their employee's theft because there are safes in the room. I don't know about you, but I'm not a fan of hotels who handle a situation like this by making their patrons jump through hoops with not even a sincere ""I'm sorry this happened to you"". I also don't like the fact that their employees can rifle through anything in your room and take what they want and the hotel holds no responsibility.

Location is great and you can easily access both north and south strip by foot. Checkin was smooth after a rough morning, and it was appreciated that they didnt mention or charge us an early checkin fee.

This is overall an upscale venue without being too sassy, and they have a lot of different restaurants and bar selection within. They have two different pool areas, where one of them ""Bare"" is branded towards grownups with a topless option for both men and women.

The other pool is big and got a nice waterfall that sets the ambience. A great thing is that you most certainly can get a sunbed no matter which time you arrive. They have a policy for towels, so if a towel is left unattendant for more than an hour, they will remove it and open up the space for someone else.

Maid service were spotless, and even though we only stayed a night, they asked us if we wanted a cleaning during day.

Checkout was fast and convenient, and it could be done both through a express-kiosk or a regular one by the counter.

First of all, check in was a breeze, and throughout our entire stay I never saw a line. The hotel does a great job of making sure enough staff are on duty to accommodate the traffic.  

Vegas runs on a tipping culture, and when we checked in, I spilled a $20 bill to the desk clerk and asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available. She bumped us (two rooms) up to the tower with a nice view of the Volcano on the 24th floor. Nice. Rooms were beyond comfortable - lovely king size bed, walk in shower, full sized bath tub, and double sink. HEAVEN. 

As for the casino, it's just the right size. It's big without being a labyrinth. After the first day, you won't get lost. That was nice ""to come home to"" at the end of our Vegas evenings. We casino hopped on day one and while the other casinos were very nice, I was happy we chose to stay at the Mirage. I was just much more comfortable in a slightly smaller atmosphere. Speaking of casino hopping, Mirage is a great home base to see the whole strip. It's centrally located, right next to Caesars (very walkable), and across the street from Harrah's (also walkable) if you're looking for some cheaper table games. Caesars was also great for shopping. As for the food, we didn't eat a lot at Mirage, but I can speak for the buffet. That was a really great evening meal and a decent value for Vegas. 

Finally, because we went to Vegas to gamble I can tell you that we had lots of luck at the Mirage - both at the tables and the slots. Our Harrah's night was also quite productive, though we lost money at Bellagio and Tropicana . . .  Margaritaville was good to us though! Overall, we left Vegas with more money than we came with. Call it beginners luck. 

PROS: Centrally located on the strip, fantastic rooms in the Tower, loved the Volcano, not as crowded as other casinos, and great customer-centered service. 

CONS: Not as big and fancy as some of the other casinos (but that could be a plus!)

TIPS: 1. Read the Vegas tips online before you go. I learned the $20 upgrade trick by doing that! Try it at Mirage. It worked for me. 2. Even if you are not a nightclub person, get yourself over to Hyde at about 8-9pm to watch the Bellagio fountain show. Best view in Vegas for the fountains! 3. Play MyVegasSlots before you go to get points at the Mirage and then sign up for a club card when you arrive. Trust me, it's worth it even if you are not a big spender! We got two for one buffets and several free drinks. 4. Starbucks at Mirage is always crowded after 8am. . . but if you can get there at 7:45am. . . 5. Tip the dealers. It's polite. 6. Go downtown! It's worth it! 7. Put a twenty in the machines at the bars and play at least $2 a hand. They will give you a free drink. This worked at every casino except the Bellagio.",5,0,0

So I will start off how our trip started off- Valet Parking- Most of the time rather quick, as soon as we pulled up they were there and it took no more than 4 minutes to get the rental car. So Two Thumbs Up. 

Check in- Ugghh Slowww they have a lot of lines but it moved really slow. I will give them credit because I was there at 11ish and they checked me in, although check in time was 3pm. 

You have to walk through the tropical rain forest through the slot machines, through the crap tables, through more slots, past the Revolution Lounge then past some shops to FINALLY reach the elevators! To me that was dumb especially when you have to drag your luggage. Now the Mirage usually stays busy so I was hitting people with my suite case and I didn't give a fuck, I had an attitude cause I really do hate people I don't know. So after bullying my way to the elevators, we went up to our room. 

Room- 11th Floor- Facing North, North Strip View. Usually this would be nice, but our view was obstructed with bird shit. Whateva fucking bird shit on our window had a real bad case of the shits. It wasn't just one splat, it was like 10 splats, I asked my friends if they wanted another room but everyone was tired so we said fuck it and looked at Bird Shit View the entire stay. 

The Decor was actually kind of nice, weird that we had a purple room but umm it was ok, the double bed room was very spacious, they had a desk with a lot of connections, nobody had to fight to charge their cell, or lap-tap or digi cam. Nice HD TV on the Wall with HD Channels, MINI Bar that we didn't touch because 15 for a can of beer is kinda steep. They had a nice iron (which is always important) luckily this was a guys trip and we don't care about the bathroom but it was really really small! 

Overall- The room was really nice, beds super comfy, well I think I was soo tired I could have slept on a rock. But the beds did justice after nights of partying and gambling. They had a nice ipod docking station in the room. THis came in Handy because we would put on music while getting ready, we pumped it up and never had a complaint! We we're acting a fool. jumping on beds and the room held up pretty well. Haa. 

The Casino was ok- Mostly $10 mins a few $5 mins.. The only thing we ate was the buffet, it was ok for 20 bucks... Did justice. 

We spend a day at the pool- didn't get a cabana but found pool chairs easily. I was not impressed with the pool at all.. Kinda of boring if you ask me. MGM pool, MB Pool and Flamingo pool are a lot nicer. 

The sports Book was nice, comfy seats nice and spread out- Oh wait I did eat at the Carnegie Deli, Lil pr icy but it was good, it was the only thing open when i stumbled in one night at like 4am I think. I don't know what I had but it was open and I remember it hit the spot. 

So overall- The Mirage is nice, it's showing it's age and I'm not sure If I will stay here again, I like kind of a rowdy crowd and the crowd here was kind of lame!!! Even the Pool Scene Sooo Lame... NO Music at the Pool nothing.. I think I may have scene like 10 looking chicks at the pool that day . Blahhhh. 

Overall- Great Trip- Great Fight- Great seeing that English Bum Ricky Hatton getting KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT in the 2nd Round!!!

After the desk clerk confirmed our booking with extras (complimentary buffet everyday, 1 king non-smoking) and let us know about the resort fee we were all set. When we went up to our room we were surprised that they gave us a double queen bed. Hubby and I were dead tired by then and just wanted to relax but he suggested I let them know they made a mistake in assigning our room. I called and the desk clerk who picked up rectified the situation by switching our keys to a room that was higher up and was a king non-smoking and it had a great view of TI, The Venetian, Casino Royale, etc...Our room was immaculate. I heard the hotel had undergone renovations and they did a good job. The room had everything except for a refrigerator. I mean, it did have a fridge but it was stocked full of the mini-bar stuff that they want you to sample. 
Upon check out I was surprised to find they charged us for 3 drinks we did not take from the bar. After explaining to the clerk he just took them out of the bill no questions asked.

I've been to vegas 4 times now. The price i paid was decent since i got a deal from southwest, but i thought the hotel would of been better compared to when i stayed at planet hollywood. I was definitely wrong. 

Here's a few things that i liked about the hotel. I loved the aquarium, the flowers, the variety of restaurants in the hotel even thought they were pricey. i wasn't afraid to spend money. i loved the pool it was huge and gorgeous! but you have to get there early or its hard to find an empty lounge chair if you have a few ppl in your group. 

i was disappointed that the pool closed at 7. I was disappointed in the bathroom size. i had a tower king room? the bathroom was tiny! i thought it would of been nicer than PH. so i figured i should stop comparing, but this room didn't even have a coffee maker. I asked for hot water and they were about to charge me 4$! or $10 for a kettle. 

I had a 252$ spa serv for a massage, mani & pedi. Great ppl very professional. The masseuse i had wasn't that great i expected better since it was at a hotel AND gratuity was included... can't remember if it was 18\/20% the lady who did my nail was nice & great at conversing, but didn't realize she filed one of my nails too much! so my nail was slanted looking. i was pissed! but i didn't say anything because it was too late. when i checked out the i told the lady and she asked if i wanted to tell the lady about it... i was thinking no theres no point since she filed my nail already. i obv said it trying to think that they would do something for me like a discount or a small gift. couple days later the color on the edge of my nails came off! didn't even last a week, and i wasn't even doing anything but enjoying my bday weekend in vegas! ( i had a better spa experience at the WESTIN)

the carnegie: the food is pricey and it is decent but large portion. its great that it is open 24 hrs. the coffee tasted like water and the bagels were hard as brick. we were craving breakfast i should of just went to the buffet! lol but we slept in...

the blt burger was pricey, but prob the best burger i had in awhile. SO TASTY! 

it was cool that this hotel had quite a few shops like froyo, candy store, tattoo shop, sport shop, watch, and etc. 

i would not come back to stay at the mirage.

As soon as I typed in Mirage dolphins the results that came up were alarming. Various websites describing the horror that is the dolphin exhibit at The Mirage hotel. 15 dolphin deaths have occurred at this hotel since 1990 all of them premature and 10 of which didn't even make it till half of a bottlenose dolphin's expected lifetime in the wild. Many of the deaths occurred due to lung diseases (The Mirage is next to a heavily trafficked highway not to mention in the heart of a polluted city) and infections occurring from harsh temperatures. I contacted the front desk to connect me with someone that I could speak to who was in charge of the dolphin exhibit. I simply wanted to ask them how they justify it in their own mind enough to work at a facility like this in good conscience. When a girl answered the phone I asked if she was the manager and she said one of them. Then I said ""Hello, I just found online that 15 dolphin deaths have occurred at this hotel and was wondering if you could tell me more about it.""

Positives
FREE WI-FI!!  This alone bumped them really high up on my list!
Nice room with a huge bathroom and the windows opened - looked out over the volcano and the Casinos across the street.
Volcano Show (updated last year)
The Beatles Love Show (Amazing)
Secret Garden & Dolphin Habitat (animals are amazingly well kept)
Good restaurants like BLT Burger  and Japonais Lounge (separate reviews)
Decent pool area but it was cold so I didn't hang out there.

One of the better pools in Vegas- large, tropical landscaping with waterfalls 
BLT Burger has tasty burgers for reasonable prices
Those adorable white tiger cubs are still here!
The room's bed is comfortable with a soft pillow top mattress
Volcano show
Close to Caesar's Forum Shops and Fashion Show Mall

CONS
Location is pretty far North on the Strip

Seeing that what me and my friends like to do to save a few bucks is just get one room and PACK it. So for a room with 2 queen beds, we made it fit so that there was 7 of us. Coincidentally only one person slept on the bed both nights since one girl didn't come in till 9AM so I had the bed to myself, and the next night I didn't come in until 5 or 6 and the bed was taken and the other girl slept in the bathtub. (no joke).  So I give this hotel a 4 for the cleanliness of the floor and the comfort of the carpet they had.  And actually, there was plenty of room on the floor for ourselves and our luggage AND a cooler full of alcohol.  The place also had a really long table where we can put our cups and alcohol and mixers, but the place does NOT have fridge where you can store stuff (just a mini fridge full of 12 dollar M&Ms and 20 dollar bottles of water..I exaggerate).  Either way, the decor is really cute- very Ikea-esque with a bit of funky 60s going on, the concierge, room service and housekeeping were all very helpful and nice when they came by.  What I liked about the room too is that you can open the window so you can let a little bit of fresh air in.

I noticed that the casino floor had a make over.  So based on the pictures, I decided to book this over TI.  I was not very happy with the look and feel of TI when I was there 3-4 years ago.  
I have to say that I was a bit surprised with the hallway and look of the room.  Even though our view is of the freeway and rooftops, the room itself was nicely renovated.  Enough room and nice queen sized beds to top it off.  
I do have a few complaints I'd like to list here for others to take into account when deciding to stay here.  The bathroom is on the small side for a Resort of this nature.  Would have liked to have a bigger bathroom and not have to worry about touching the toilet bowl when coming out of the shower.  Don't need to have to wash myself again when I just did so.  
Others have mentioned that the wireless here sucks and they are absolutely right.  I was getting less than 1mbps and most of the time was like .10mbps.  That's pretty bad for a 4-5 star resort.  Why are we paying a $25 resort fee when most people don't use the pool, fitness center or can't use the internet.  A word of warning.  If you have AT&T and are on the side facing the freeway, you are not going to be very happy.  But I have found at times that using my cellular worked better than the wifi.  Verizon users on the other hand should be getting about 16mbps according to my speediest.  
The last complaint is the TV.  According to their channel guide, there are HD channels.  I don't know who configured these TV's but the HD channels were not HD at all.  It felt like I was in a cheap motel as most of their TV's suck.  To top it all off, I had to be careful where I stood in the room as the TV would lose signal when I stood in certain spots.  From the looks of things, it looks like the TV is running off of rabbit ears instead of cable.  I didn't make any complaints as it would have been pointless and management wouldn't have done anything to remedy the issue.  
The best thing about this hotel however, it that it's pretty centralized to Ceasar's, Venetian & Wynn.  The casino floor is pretty nice also.  There always seem to be people around, but not overly crowded.  I didn't have a hard time finding an open slot machine or finding a spot at the craps table.  I did like that the craps table was $5 during the day.  I would consider staying here next time.",0,0,0

The Secret Garden is also within this hotel's grounds....a great viewing if you love animals.....there are dolphins, wildcats etc....

The Volcano show is also spectacular! It happens after dark on the hour at the front of the hotel.

The pool is also very cool.....I regret very much that we did not have time to swim there...we did take a quick walking tour and loved the lush surrounds, bridges and endless pool lounges......

It is also convenient as it is right on the strip so nearly everything is in walking distance. There are also plenty of eateries within the hotel and a great little gift store. We did the Beatle's Love by Cirque du Soleil package and got a great little deal. The show is also a wonderful experience for any Beatles or Cirque fan.

Check in was horrible slow for a sunday. Plenty of staff working (5) yet each check in was oddly very long. All i could think about what was their process for this and obviously the person in charge of that has dropped the ball. It almost looked like they were just using pen and paper checkin for each customer.  Room keys work about 1 in 5 attempts. Hallways look like bangkok especially the doors. You have to see them. Hungry at this point so get a chicken burger at their LV Burger restaurant. Chicken came back raw in the middle returned it. $23 bucks for a burger and fry combo. Of course charged full price even they they nearly killed me - thanks for that. If you like big greasy burgers you have to eat with a fork and soggy buns then you might want to try that place.  About 4pm we hit the Carnegie Deli inside the hotel. All was just bland. Eggs, potatoes, coleslaw bland bland bland. No seasoning no idea why anyone would like this place. $22 bucks or close to that and $4.50 for a diet coke. Sounds like a pretty good markup on a .10 cent fountain soda but I'm not hear to judge. Had like 4 customers inside so maybe that should of been a sign.  We head over to watch March madness in their sports bar called stills or something like that. Place is empty about 10 people scatter at the bar. We grab a table and turns out they were all reserved. Again, No body in the place just overall bad management and poor processes. Might add we would have sat anywhere in there with a tv view but they didnt have any. The setup of the screens dont satisfy everyone which is unfortunate considering its a sports bar!!

Our bed was super comfortable, the TV was big and the size of the room overall was great. My only suggestion would be to modernize the bathroom more. They had granite counter tops but the shower and some of the detailing in there were from another era, the 80's. 

The pool area was nice although the waterfall was harsher than I expected. Since it was in the 90's, I wasn't complaining. We got out there in the mid afternoon and had no problems finding chairs.

The pool is awesome. I love the waterfalls and the big open concept bThey have multiple poolside bar and grilles, and tons of chairs. We laid out towels on front row  chairs early (around 8or 9 am?), and nobody messed with them. Tip the servers and they will not forget about you. They did not check our bags as we came in, so naturally, we brought in flasks and mixers. They have representatives from Bare (topless option adult pool) who annoy the heck out of you, but a firm NO, and they will back off. 

The casino is clean and nice, with $10 minimums on the tables during the day, with only one or two tables per game of 10 min in the evenings. We checked out Revolution (the Beatles lounge) for free and ladies got at least two free drinks. The Sports Bet is decent (per my husband), but drink servers are scarce. We got a $60 voucher to use at CPK for signing up for the M Life rewards card. Pretty sweet. 

Unfortunately, the room keys did not always work. My sister had to call the front desk at least 3 times throughout the weekend (sometimes after a long night!) and had to wait 10-20 minutes for a staff member to come open her door. Also, internet and cell  service sucks. Like really, really sucks.

They need to hire some more employees to help with the cabs out front. The cab line is consistently long and there are always 50 cabs waiting in line.

So since we were in our  swim suits we decided to go to the adult pool next to the main pool.

The beds were incredibly comfortable! And the room service fantastic! The only problem we had was dealing with the elevators. It required a key card to go up and so you had to ensure you always had a key card with you. At one point our family and wedding photographer got stuck in the elevator, but they gave us room credit and it was nice that the hotel responded so favorably.

I didn't like that it was 1050am and we were about to check out but still grabbing luggages and the room service lady was already opening the door.  Also this random guy knocked our door 5times to see if the mini bar fridge needed refill at 3pm.  He knocked until we opened the door and had the sign ""privacy please"" outside the door.

Process to check in was super quick since they have a new Mobile Check In option. I was able to check in on my phone the night before and my room was ready at 10am the next day. Which was good for me since we were moving from another hotel to the Mirage. 

We opted for the valet parking for $20 instead of the self-parking. After checking in and dropping our stuff off, we went back to the valet to get our car. When we dropped it off, we even told them we would be back in 10-15 minutes. But nope, they didn't really care and the wait for our car to come out was 40 minutes!! Yes, 40 minutes. I even went to the valet table and asked them to cancel the car because I was so annoyed and was ready to just take a freaking taxi. But the woman responded, ""they're driving it down right now."" If by driving it down, you mean another 20 minutes. That would be correct. 

The room was okay, it was exactly like their pictures upon booking. I guess that's a good thing because it was what I was expecting. Unlike other hotels who have nice and pristine pictures of their rooms and then turning out to be way worse. Mirage wasn't like that and I was glad. 

The wifi sucked so much though. I even had to resort to using my own phone's cellular data instead. 

Overall, I would stay here again. However, they definitely need to hire more valet employees or come up with a new system to improve the efficiency with bringing out vehicles.",2,1,1

Not because it has the finest restaurants in Las Vegas but because it is one of the friendliest. The people who work there, save for one Filipino woman at the M Life station, are all amazing. They genuinely care about the quality of your stay and the rooms, specifically, the beds are incredibly comfortable. 

I am a slots whore and they have an amazing and diverse selection to play. 

And you can't beat the prices for their rooms. Very reasonable. If you play their games, they comp you and they appreciate your patronage in a very old school way. Not in a contemporary, insincere way. They want your business whereas other, newer hotels make you feel like you are just lucky to be there. 

I feel at home at this hotel. I feel respected and I feel joy.

There's a Deli in the casino called the Carnegie Deli, little expensive but I was surprised at the amount of food!  jeeez!  My ham and egg sandwich was humongous... like an omelet on bread with cheese... soo good too.

The room was really nice and fresh lookin? as in modern and clean.  We were south wing, 3rd floor, single bed.  I'm reading these reviews of small bathrooms... eh it wasn't huge but my girlfriend and I fit in nicely and the shower was roomy and there was enough counter space for all her stuff so... seems good to me.

The bed was really comfy... one of those pillow-top posterpedic things I think.

The aquarium is sweet.. so want a 1\/10th of that in my house :)  We also went out back to the Tigers and lions and dolphin thing.  $15\/ea wasn't that much damage and got reeeeaaally up close to the dolphins.  There was just a baby born a couple months back too so got to see that.  Also there was Java, a 9 week old leopard that was cool to see - don't get many of those.
Out with the younger tigers there was a trainer guy inside the pen answering tons of questions and giving some really useful information about the tigers and how they care for them, where those ones came from (Florida evidentally) and he was cool to have around for inquiring minds.

Natürlich ist das Hotel inzwischen in die Jahre gekommen und einiges ist renovierungsbedürftig. Insgesamt sind die Zimmer aber immer sauber und gepflegt (wenn auch teilweise etwas abgewohnt). Die Betten sind bequem - ein Kingbett ist tatsächlich groß genug für 2 Personen, von denen jeder seinen Platz braucht. 
Im Bad finden sich die typischen Altersspuren in die Jahre gekommener Bäder - man sollte kein nigelnagelneues Bad in den normalen Zimmern erwarten. Der Spiegelbereich ist mittelmäßig ausgeleuchtet, aber es gibt tolle beleuchtete, bewegliche Kosmetikspiegel. Der Haartrocker hat eine vernünftige Größe (kein Reisefön). Insgesamt fällt das Bad recht klein aus.
Die Zimmer haben ein Bügelbrett und ein Bügeleisen. Es ist genug Platz im Schrank und es gibt viele große Schubladen zum Sachen verstauen.
Die Fenster lassen sich öffnen, also zumindest einen zwei-Hände-breiten-Spalt weit. Es kommt also Luft rein, aber man kann sich nicht hinausstürzen ;-) . Wenn es heiß ist, macht das Fensteröffnen natürlich wenig Sinn, aber wenn man nachts oder frühmorgens aufs Zimmer kommt, lohnt es sich auf jeden Fall kurz das Fenster zu öffnen. 
Ob man ein Zimmer mit Blick auf den Strip bucht, ist wohl Geschmackssache. Wenn man das erste Mal in Vegas ist, würde ich es auf jeden Fall empfehlen - so bekommt man einfach die volle Dosis. Den Vulkan vor dem Hotel hört man bei geschlossenem Fenster nur ganz leise, nicht wirklich störend und ich bin geräusch-empfindlich. 
Der Kühlschrank auf den Zimmer ist eine Minibar und hier ist höchste Vorsicht geboten. Man sollte den Kühlschrank nur öffnen, wenn man wirklich etwas (kostenpflichtig!) daraus konsumieren möchte. Jedes Öffnen der Kühlschranktüre und jede Entnahme (auch wenn man die Sachen nur bewegt) wird registriert und es wird automatisch eine bestimmte Summe auf die Zimmerrechnung aufgeschlagen. Wenn man auscheckt, kann man zwar dann sagen, dass man nichts konsumiert hat, aber dann muss man natürlich auch die Rechnung ganz genau checken. Leider ist diese Vorgehensweise inzwischen bei vielen Strip-Hotels üblich.
Wenn vorhanden, kann man sich wohl auch einen leeren Kühlschrank zusätzlich aufs Zimmer bestellen, aber dieser Service ist kostenpflichtig (ich glaube, so ab 20$ pro Nacht).

Wir hatten beim letzten Aufhenthalt in der preiswertesten Kategorie gebucht und auch genau das bekommen. Hierbei muss aber erwähnt werden, dass ich im Mirage noch keine schlechten (dreckige oder unbewohnbare) Zimmer gesehen habe. Leider hatten wir das Pech, dass auf unseren Flur viele ""laute"" Gäste (Partygruppen?) untergebracht waren, so dass an Schlafen, selbst bei großer Müdigkeit, nicht zu denken war. Wir haben dann an der Rezeption nach einem ruhigen Zimmer gefragt und auch direkt eins bekommen. 
Wir haben übrigens sehr früh eingecheckt - so gegen 12 Uhr Mittags - und bekamen sofort die Zimmerschlüssel - ohne dass wir einen Aufpreis bezahlen mussten. Das ist leider in einigen Hotels anders.

Wir haben auch schon über MyVegas* Gratis-Nächte eingelöst. Das funktionierte problemlos. 
Da man über MyVegas nur Einzelnächte buchen kann, haben wir beim Checkin gefragt, ob es möglich ist, alles so zusammenzufassen, dass wir während des Gesamtaufenhalts nicht das Zimmer wechseln müssen. Das wäre möglich gewesen, wenn wir nicht für die Nächte ohne MyVegas-Gutscheine eine höhere Zimmerkategorie gebucht hätten. (Bei MyVegas kann man für das Mirage nur Gutscheine für die normale Kategorie buchen.) Allerdings sind wir hartnäckig und haben am nächsten Tag nochmal nachgefragt und konnten so dann schon zwei Tage früher in die höhere Zimmerkategorie wechseln - ohne Aufpreis und ohne dass wir Tip gegeben haben.
Hier gilt es wohl, wie fast überall: Es kommt immer darauf an, wie nett die Person am Checkin ist.

Die Lage vom Mirage ist ideal. Direkt davor ist die Bushaltestelle für den DEUCE. Taxen sind immer schnell verfügbar. Wer mit dem Mietwagen da ist, kann entweder das Valet-Parking nutzen und selbst im Hotelparkhaus (immer den Schildern ""Self-Parking Mirage"" folgen) parken. Dort dann am besten den Level 4A wählen, dann ist man direkt auf der Etage, die den Zugang zum Hotel hat. Ansonsten benutzt man eben den Aufzug um dorthin zu kommen.

Fazit: Ich werde auf jeden Fall wieder im Mirage buchen, aber mich auch mal in anderen Hotels umsehen. Einen Punkt Abzug gibt es für den Checkin, der früher einfach deutlich freundlicher und zuvorkommender war. Und für das Bad, in dem die schwarzen Fugen nicht erneuert wurden.

I've never received such poor services from EVERY establishment within the hotel. Every single person in my group agreed with this and we will NEVER stay at this hotel again.

The worst part is no one working at the hotel seemed to care that the service wasn't good and that are rooms weren't correct. We talked to management two times and both times they didn't seem to care and nothing was done to fix the issues. 

I'm the type of person that knows things go wrong and that's fine but when the hotel doesn't seem to care about it and pretty much has a I don't give a shit attitude, that's not okay with me. 

This hotel was a lot more expensive that other hotels when the reservations were booked but are whole group decided to stay there since we thought it was a nice hotel. I hope quite a few people read this comment and decide against staying there. 

Again, issues happen but an establishment with the mentality of not caring isn't going to change unless there are major management changes. 

I highly recommend AVOIDING this hotel. No glam or excitement. High prices and terrible service.

That never happened. So beware, when you book what type of room you want it's just a ""request"" I was told. Then after a day of walking the strip,  I wanted something cold drink so I got to my minibar and it's locked. I call downstairs and asked to have it unlocked. The girls said they need a credit card on file to do that. I said ""you took a credit card from me yesterday and billed me $200"". She said that was for hotel fees but doesn't include the mini bar. I asked her to just use that same card. She said she can't cause it's a debit card. I would have to come downstairs and give a credit card.

Check in was a little crazy - there really isn't a line to stand in, you just bunch up around the desk. Luckily I didn't have to wait too long - the line was much longer at other times we walked by. The check in lady was very nice! We chatted awhile and she gave me some recommendations - and free passes to Sigfried and Roy's animal habitat. Score! When we got back from dinner later that night, she had sent up a bottle of champagne on ice for us! I was really impressed.

Our room was a 2 queen room and it was very large! We had the ""sunset view"" room, which gave us a great view of the mountains. We could also see some of the north strip, like the stratosphere. We were on the 10th floor. It's cool how they have 4 sets of elevators, and you go to the ones based on the floor you are staying on. The beds were comfy, TV was big, and they had nice toiletries offered. It was very clean and the housekeeping staff was outstanding. My one complaint about the room was that you could hear EVERYTHING from the hall. I mean, after getting up at 4am to catch my flight that morning, I took a small nap and was constantly disturbed by people walking, talking, and making noise in the hall. One person answered their cell phone and I could hear THE OTHER PERSON on the line. WTF? Luckily it was quieter at night, but every night, I was awakened at least once by someone being noisy. If I were to stay here again, I would try to request a room at the end of the hall and bring my noise machine. 

There are a lot of shops and restaurants in the hotel. The Paradise store has everything known to man, from food to alcohol, souvenirs, toiletries. It's huge. There is a Kardashian store here, which gave me a huge laugh. Nothing of much value there! There is froyo, Starbucks, several casual restaurants, and several upscale. There also is the wildlife habitat, volcano show nightly, nice pool, bars, casino and more. Lots to do!

The pool area is pretty awesome. It is HUGE and has two waterfalls. You can lounge around the side with your drinks from the Dolphin bar, which are good, and better be for $20 a pop for the bigger size. There are cocktail waitresses that will bring them to you in the pool or at your lounge chair. We went to the pool two afternoons and had no problem getting two chairs together. It is busy, but there were several empty. 

The location is great - we saw Cirque's LOVE here, and it's next door to where they have Mystere (Treasure Island), and across the street from the Venetian and Palazzo shops and a Walgreens, and a few minutes from the Wynn, where we saw the best show ever - Le Reve. We walked everywhere without a problem. It is a lot of walking but is worth it, and good for burning off the calories from drinks and food that you enjoy here! 

Overall, great experience.",3,1,2

They were so helpful in unpacking our car & delivering everything to our room.  So from the moment we pulled into their driveway it was a very good experience!

Glen at the Check-in area was friendly, informative & generally awesome.  He took the time to mention that using the refrigerator in the room for the Penta water we brought with us would likely result in a mini bar room charge. We asked if an AMEX upgrade was available & Glen took the time to check & put us on a waiting list for the upgrade, as our stay was several days during a seminar. 

One of their managers Luis did call us witRh the upgrade & it was worth packing up our clothes & changing rooms... Luis made the room change easy & was very accommodating. He sent a great bellman to help & thanks to their staff & my angel husband, the switch was smooth. 

The room was delightful. It was so worth it to inquire about an upgrade! 

Comfortable, beautiful, spacious, with a view of the city light and Bellagio Fountain. We were upgraded to a 1 Bedroom Penthouse Suite with marble counters and floors, several flat screen TV's, a living room type area with a beautiful spacious seating area suitable for 10 or more people, dining room with a table & chairs, wet bar and a Fabulous luxury bathroom complete with a bidet in the separate toilet room & a walk-in closet adjacent to a beautiful dressing table.  

Our seminar became a staycation with the help of AMEX & the amazing graciousness of the Mirage & their employees Glen & Luis! 

We ordered room service & experienced the kind delivery service of Marcos.  He was so sweet and helpful in setting the meal up in our room both days.  He told us he has worked at the Mirage since the hotel opened 26 years ago.  He was truly exceptional.  This gentleman brings a great attitude, accommodates guest requests & cheerfully noted how happy I was even at 6:30 in the morning. Obviously he is a Fabulous employee & a caring wonderful person.

Pretty much everything I wrote in my previous email pertains; even got upgraded for free to the 23rd floor and had a pretty awesome strip view since they ran out of queen rooms. Share bed with brother, get higher up in the tower with a sweet view. That sounds fair to me!

Reasons for docking a star:

- Resort fees. So lame and making it mandatory for customers to pay for amenities not used is just stupid. I know, it's standard for Vegas but that still doesn't make it right. It is only $25 a night but when you get rated for $40 base per night for two nights, you're essentially adding the cost of staying an extra night's stay. Feel me? Included wifi is pretty cool though and I was able to access it with my phone.
- Restaurants aren't that great here so you'll probably end up walking somewhere else to stuff your face. We seriously only grabbed things from Starbucks and CPK in the 2.5 days we stayed -- for all our other meals and eatery needs, we strolled over to the adjacent casinos. Pretty inconvenient and I wish management would look into upping the quality of the dining options they offer.
- I broke my cardinal rule of Mirage and played some craps here. I'm not too superstitious but I really just get a bad vibe rolling dice here; still don't know why...dealers\/stickmen aren't terribly fun or entertaining like they should be. I mean, if I'm paying $100\/hr+ for entertainment, I'm damn well not expecting the dice themselves to make me laugh or get into the game. Not asking for the dealers to be stand-up comedians or fascinate me by reproducing scenes documentaries I've seen on NatGeo, but more friendly interaction at the tables would really uprate Mirage in my book. Best craps staff I've met so far are at Caesar's and Aria. Maybe I wouldn't be complaining if I didn't always lose my figurative gambling shirt at Mirage, but for your own gambling safety, just trek it out to the Palace or somewhere else, especially if you like to roll dice.

Notable positives:

- Came here when the weather was super weird and overcast; pool was fairly empty and still pretty amazing. Deck chairs were neatly arranged and clean, not a lot of trash laying around from what I saw, pool water was for the most part clear (I'm really hoping the murkiness was from lots of chlorine and residual sunscreen), servers made their rounds to us a couple of times, staff was enforcing the ""1hr absence allowed till we pick up your shite"" rule so people can't reserve spots at the crack of dawn and keep 'em till whenever they feel like it.
- Really need to emphasize -- GREAT bang for your buck, especially if you are a rewards member and get comps. Rooms were perfect, not loud at all, overall the property is very nice for what you pay for. I also am a pretty firm believer that Mlife offers the best range of hotels within the MGM\/Mirage properties -- I'm perfectly content with spending money within the MGM\/Mirage network, especially Aria. 

Mirage, I love you...I really do. But I think next time I'll have to give Aria a whirl for a change of pace and I like the craps dealers better there. Please understand -- at least I'm cheating on you with your sister property. Wait...that sounded a lot better in my head.",2,0,0

We will never stay at the Mirage again. Walking in to the lobby for check in, the hotel looks very nice. However when we got inside of the room it was a completely different story. It looked like our room had not been touched in months. There were crumbs on the floor and thick patches of dust around the mini fridge and bed frame. My husband went downstairs to report it and we were moved to a different room. To my disbelief the second room was no better than the first. Only difference was there were no crumbs this time. 
I refuse to sleep in filth, especially when we are paying $200 a night. My husband went downstairs yet again. This time I went with him. My husband asked if would be possible to have a manager accompany us to see the filth for themselves.The smug front desk rep with a not so friendly attitude said that wouldn't be possible. I explained to him that my husband is an AGM for a major hotel franchise. This is something that would usually take place if a customer has complained about multiple rooms. He than explained to me that the Mirage is SO large of a hotel that no manager would do such a thing. He proceeded to rush us into another room. 
Room number 3 was just as dusty as the first 2 rooms. And there was a random hair on our sheets. We would have moved hotels, but it was hard to find a room at decent rate short notice. At this point my husband and I were tired from traveling and had no more energy to waste. For the duration of our time at the Mirage, I walked around with shoes on. Never setting foot an the carpet. And I slept on top of the fitted sheet, but I could not sleep under the dingy blanket. Lucky we were able to spend most of our weekend out of the room. The bathroom I must say was pretty decent compared to the rest of the room. Which is the only reason I'm giving one start. I've stayed in some very nice hotels. I expected the same quality from the Mirage. But instead received motel quality. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1,2,0

It was my first time staying here and I didn't do anything in here besides gamble.. but from the looks of the pool it's much nicer than some pools at the other hotels! It has a pretty waterfall area..

This was annoying considering I had to walk through the casino with my luggage to get back to the front desk an then back to the new room. Without even complaining they upgraded me from the Resort King to the Tower King. I asked for a room with a strip view they accommodated me. If it wasn't for that I'd give them 3 stars. 

The room wasn't as modern as some Vegas hotels but it's not ancient. The casino isn't big but it isn't small. I would've liked more restaurant choices. The only choices for breakfast were Carnegie Deli which was packed and the buffet which was expensive. Paradise Café was closed for the season and the other restaurants were only open for lunch and dinner. I wasn't impressed with the nightclub 1 Oak but I can't blame that on the hotel. 

I like the location of this hotel. It's kind at the middle\/north end of the strip. While the view from my strip view room wasn't as great as some hotels it was still very good. Although I haven't been there recently, I highly recommend going to Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat.

However, this review is more the the 1 Bedroom Penthouse Suites. Something is serious amiss here. The hotel has been completely remodel so I think these expensive floors would be the same too. Last weekend, the gang of us came to the Mirage and booked 2 Penthouse Suites and where totally excited about it. We cruised up to the Top floors, open elevator door and a draft of smoke hits you like a runaway prius. WOW! I am getting 3rd hand smoke. It's okay considering 7 of the 9 guys smoke. We looked around and the decor was dated, extremely early 90s dated. The wall paper was old and crusty. We open the double door and looked around. It was quite impressive. The room was huge. However, old decor, Jack Griswold from National Lampoons would be proud. They don't have an IPOD jack. They have a 32inch tube TV. So we preparty up watching Lakers take on the Thunder - Victory, split up the rooms and I dedicated 1 non smoking suite. Thank goodness. Then the night came, every other room on this floor had a suite party, the hallway was so loud, it sounded like a Friday night dorm room back in college. Everyone left their doors open, drinks and bottles were on full display. The walls were insulated so it was rather quiet unless you count the base traveling in every direction, but hey, everyone was prepartying. I would not recommend these suites to impress a chick, rather to party it up with a group of people. It is like 1100 sq ft of fun. It is not for the romantic. For the old decor and 2nd 3rd and 4th hand smoke, 3 stars.",0,0,0

I have been to Vegas regularly but haven't stayed at Mirage before.  Anyway, the check in process was smooth but expect to see fellow tourists cut in front of you.  I wished there were stanchions to control the crowded lines.  I booked a deluxe tower room and it was above average.  There's really nothing exciting in this room besides the tropical color scheme and partial view of the Strip.  But for the price I paid, I can't really complain.  The casino was easy to navigate around, and it offered a variety of slots and table games at different denominations.  I was quite disappointed with the dining options at this hotel.  I wished there was a food court that offered cheap eats when fine or casual dining wasn't preferred.   There's really nothing to choose from, especially if you are on a tight budget.  The only place I tried there was Cafe Caribe, but it was still on the pricey side.  My fiancee and I mostly ate the Venetian food court.  In terms of attractions, there were many to choose from.  For free, you can watch the erupting volcano or view white tigers at the Tiger Exhibit.  For a nominal fee, you can visit the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat.  

Overall, the Mirage was better than I expected.  As the first mega resort on the Strip, the Mirage is due for a makeover.  The rooms are dated and they need to add more restaurants.  We'll see what Steve Wynn has in store for the Mirage.  I do recommend staying here.  The room rates are cheap, and even if you are not a Player's Club member.

It has really made a turn for the worse on my last visit August 2010. We stayed in the 2 bedroom suite on floor A. The room was really spacious the theme of red and black was a little dark but nothing terrible. What saddened me about the room were multiple elements that overalll made my allegiance to the Mirage wane. For one was the appearance of the hallway to our room. It smelt of spoiled food, pot and there were multiple balls (that resembled hair) that littered the floor, GROSS! There was also air conditioning problems due to the size of the room. The room was always stiflingly hot when you first walked in, we ended up most of the time in the small bedroom attached to our suite just to cool down instead of enjoying the other section of our large room. The guests before us had obviously tried to open the window and ended up breaking the mold that covered it. So at night there was a terrible whistling sound that woke me up constantly. The lobby also failed to mention that the room next to ours was under construction. All through the day you could hear the banging of hammers and drilling also very loud workers. This could have been an attempt to keep us gambling but left me angered by the lack of consideration. 

With that said the Mirage does offer a nice space for the down to earth gambler. It is not as flashy or judgmental as it's older sister the Bellagio can be. The Mirage offers a sanctuary for families with children of all ages (where at most casinos they are looked at as the plague).

The lobby area is easy to get to know without getting too lost which is very nice to be able to navigate after no sleep, lots of drinks, and sensory overload from the Vegas experiences outside.

I stayed here looking for a place on the strip but not too far from the action. Also did not want to pay lots of money for those other new hotels with fancy French themes. I didn't realize that only two or three groups own all of the hotels on the main strip! But MGM has done a great job with the variations and options of hotels to stay at no matter your income\/budget choices.

This place was pretty awesome overall. The only complaint I would have is that I have stayed at many hotels and the curtain style they chose did not keep all of the outside light out. You figure that would be very important in Vegas?! I found myself trying my best to sleep during the morning but had sunlight staring at me in the face. I would function and spend more money if I had the energy to do so the next day after a nice deep dark sleep. FYI.

There were obviously a convention being held during my stay and even though this place had to cater to street traffic walk ins, convention attendees, hotel guests, and show goers.....I was happily amazed at how they pulled it all off! I did everything I wanted to do as an individual without even a thought of other mixtures of various people. Games, sure! lots to play and go around! Tables and slots. Drinks? Everywhere available!

It's at a great location, pretty much walking distance to everything. We only took cabs back to the hotel when we were hammer and couldn't remember which way it was. 

The food was a bit pricey inside the hotel, we ate at two different spots and both were expensive. But needless to say very good. Because of horrible gambling nights, had my last breakfast in Vegas at a mcdonalds across the st from the mirage. 

My favorite thing about this place would have to be the pool. It has an incredible water fall and plenty of beach chairs to lay out on. The crowd is a little more mature, which was cool. We didn't have too many douche bags walking around, only us. 

But all in all a good place to stay and enjoy vegas, would definitely come back again.",2,2,1

Long review:

Like most places, there were good and bad components.  First off, their location is excellent, pretty spot on in the middle of the strip (sorry Aria, the center of Las Vegas has NOT shifted).  Easy walk to both southern and northern strip casinos, lots of restaurant choices for each price level, lots of gambling space with a good variance of limits.

Restaurants we tried:
Carnegie Deli - very good, the food is good, as is the service, but the prices are a tad high, but not high to the point where you feel unsatisfied.

Onda - only bad part of our trip, excellent food, terrible employees (see my Onda review)

Cravings - decent buffet, nothing special, but a good variety.

Paradise Cafe - pretentious on a budget?  the menu was littered with food items that tried to have exotic or gourmet ingredients, but the prices were relatively cheap.  found out why when i got my meal, pretty unsatisfying and surprisingly heavy for a cafe that wants to be known as a light lunch place.

Blizz - my wife enjoyed it, surprisingly cheap for Las Vegas

The pool was pretty weak.  I was very excited about it going in, but it was too crowded with chairs on top of each other.  Everyone was saving spots, so if you don't find one try slipping a 10 or 20 to an attendant there who will clear towels for you.  Still though, it was pretty weak compared to other pools.

The room was standard.  I hate the new resort fees that MGM properties added recently, but was happy that it was removed for comped nights.  If I had to actually pay for this, I'd be pretty mad, as the wireless was INCREDIBLY SLOW.  Whenever I needed internet, I just used the mobile hotspot feature on my 4G thunderbolt (Droid Army!!).

I would stay there again if I got another comped deal, but the crowd was a bit old for me and the wear and tear is showing.

Overall, nothing horrible, nothing great.",1,0,0

I booked at the mirage for the first time. The biggest surprise was that both valet and self park fees are among the highest on the strip. I parked my car for about a day and half as a hotel guest in a suite and because my players card was not a gold or higher I had to pay  $24 then $20 for valet the first day then $12 the final day. I was not eager to tip bellhop or valet person. The overall prices at all the eateries and sundry shop was very high. At the pool the sound system was weak compared to what was at the Monte Carlo with a sub woofer. The cocktail service at the pool was far and few between,understaffed. I don't mind paying more money for a better product, but paying double or triple, sorta like airport prices. They have this new type of check-in with a mobile tablet they hand you and you fill out. I am not in the mood for that, I just drove all day and wish to begin my vacation, Id rather they do all the typing. The room had a space for a fridge but instead they wished to further gouge you with one of those mini bar where you pay super high $ for booze and other drinks. The wifi signal in the room was weak.

The tables are fun and entertaining and the nightlife goes on all night (unlike some other strip hotels that seem to close up around midnight or so).
The crowd here seems to be mostly young and hip and that also makes it more fun than hanging out where most of the players are old or drunks (lol - it's vegas - it does happen).
When we stay here we always eat breakfast at Carnegie's and usually eat at least once at CPK just since we want to eat at the raised up platform - hahahhaa.

Starting in June 2016, all of MGM Reorts parking structures (Bellagio, Aria, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York, Excalibur, Luxor, Vdara, Delano Las Vegas, and yes - even Circus Circus) no longer offers free parking and now the self parking rate is free for the 1st hour, $7 between 1 hour to 4 hours, $10 between 4 hours to 24 hours, and $10 for each additional day. Upon entering the parking structure, press the button and grab a parking ticket first. For all hotel guest, bring your ticket to the front desk and your daily parking fee will be charged to your room. Ultimately your room key will become your parking pass and you will have free access to all MGM Resorts parking facilities. After you check out your room, just take your room key and use that to leave the Mirage parking structure. Now if you just join the MGM membership (M Life Rewards) and move up to one tier above (Pearl member), then they will waive self parking fee off.

***

Originally I thought $50 per day (including tax) for one king-size room was a pretty good deal ... until I realized the rate is based on PER DAY and not PER NIGHT. Anyhow, I know hotel check-in is technically at 3 PM & check-out is at 11 AM, but you can always test your luck and begin to check-in approximately one hour before the official check-in time

Few other notes:

* Free Wi-Fi 
* This place is where you watch the Beatles LOVE
* Not an easy walk to guest elevators (especially for 1st timer)
* Guest elevators are separated by different floor levels - so pay attention
* If you want to get to the Mirage parking structure from guest elevators, you will need to walk to front desk and walk towards to 1 OAK Nightclub

Other than the unexpected parking fee and somewhat confusing location for guest elevators, I actually like the Mirage due to its convenient location, clean room, and my memorable crap table winning streak (started off $500, dropped down to $25, won two field bets and turned into $100, placed $100 on pass line & come bets, kept winning pass line & come bets by rolling the point number 10 at least 5 out of 6 times during the streak, and finally walked away with $700).",6,1,0

Normally Mirage would be pretty cheap but last weekend prices were up there, I don't know what was going on, but it was in between Memorial Day weekend & EDC weekend.  After taxes and resort fees we paid $600 for 3 nites here.  We wanted to stay at our beloved Encore\/Wynn or Cosmo but it was just too much money.  All the other alternatives we were thinking of were so we just decided on Mirage due to its central location & for 1 OAK being housed on the bottom floor.  

Check in was easy and I didn't have to wait long to speak to the concierge either.  The clientele at Mirage is very mixed and the hotel is one of the oldest and it shows with its dated decor.  At least the rooms looked alright due to its renovation several years ago.  In our reservation we specifically stated for a non-smoking king bed and preferably a quiet room (which is usually a corner room).  I didn't mind so much that we didn't get a corner room but they gave us double beds in a room that reeked of cigarettes AND wasn't finished being cleaned (there was a towel left on one bed and drops of water all on the nightstand).  I immediately called and they gave me options for another room; the front desk girl told me that there was another room on the same 12th floor however, since it used to be a smoking floor there may be some smoke smell in that room as well.  So why do they give it to people as an option who don't want a smoking room?  All my friends who I told about this incident asked if she upgraded us, and I said not really!  She put us in a 21st floor room with a supposed mountain view, which constituted of a view of Trump tower and a mountain view in the distance.  The bathroom didn't have a lock, and later on in our stay housekeeping didn't refill our toiletries including our hand soap which was just thrown away.  At least this room was clean though, however the walls are super thin so it's harder to get the little bit of sleep that us Vegas partiers will get while staying here.  I could totally hear my neighbors talking\/screaming and getting down with the get down.  I don't think it's Mirage management fault, but the whole disorganization with waiting to get into 1 OAK also put a huge damper on my first day\/night (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/1-oak-las-vegas-2#hrid:FVOHPSTT6Zc3wcU7b-70HQ ).  Casino floor cocktail waitress took over a half hour to get our drinks at 4:30 am, even though there weren't many gamblers in her area.      

The good things about Mirage: like I said the location on the strip is central to many of the hotels one will most likely go to, they have a decent club, & a 24-hour eatery option (Carnegie's Deli).  The good still doesn't outweigh the bad experience we had from the get-go.  We'll just be sticking to our usual Encore\/Wynn or trying out Cosmo.  Because after all, you do get what you pay for!",16,11,11

That being said, my two night stay there was well priced and decent for what it was. Good location on the strip, too, right across from Harrahs (...shudder..) where they have the Improv comedy club. 

Our room was on the 25th floor, which has it's own dedicated elevator. There was one king sized bed with a large bathroom that enclosed two sinks, toilet, a Jacuzzi style bathtub, and a separate shower. The mirror above the sinks and counter top was awesomely huge, though still lacked the appropriate lighting for applying makeup. That may sound strange, but it's something I take note of where ever I go, because I have yet to find a hotel that doesn't employ the use of odd 'energy saving' strange colored lighting in the bathrooms and rooms. As a result, sometimes it's hard to tell how dark your eye shadow really looks, or if your nose is really suddenly very pink, etc. Ladies may know what I mean  Possibly some men, too.

A complaint - the satellite TV was sketchy at best. Several channels would appear for a few seconds before going black, and we had to switch to other channels and back again to get it to reappear. As you can imagine, the routine gets old. Oh well.

On the HUGE plus side - This is the only room I've stayed at that had a fan in the bathroom!! That's valuable when sharing a room with others. You know what I'm talking about. Don't try to deny it. You know. And I know. Everybody knows. So stop denying it.

The casino portion of the hotel is pleasant, with a wide range of slots and plenty of tables to play blackjack at. Be wary of the dealers - They are the luckiest people I know. They are also, overall, quite helpful when you're stumped about what move to make and willing help you out in ""What would YOU do, Carol?"" situations. Alas, despite their helpful input, you are in no way guaranteed to keep any of the money you came to the table with. Drink responsibly.

My husband and I ate at the Cravings buffet in the casino, and we are sad to say we weren't impressed. My husband requested that I point out that the prime rib was way too well-done to be considered prime rib. It should be more red\/pink, not light brown in the center. The prime rib was more like roast beef. The mashed potatoes are alright, I guess. 

My biggest issue was with the pizza. It was nothing to be proud of, mostly bready with little sauce or cheese or toppings. The dessert selection, which is of the utmost importance to me, is severely lacking in quality diet-bustworthy deliciousness. I think the tastiest thing I ate from that section was the fresh fruit. Watermelon. Yum! The 'cheesecake' and 'mud pie' and 'creme brulee' were like imitation foods you see when touring open houses. Not the real thing, though still edible if you try hard enough. My favorite dish over all? The Hunan chicken in the Asian section of the buffet. I mean Asian food section, not people. 

We ate at BLTs our second night. We shared a milkshake and waffle fries, and each had a huge burger. It was quite tasty and our waitress was polite and to the point, getting our order quickly and food out in a timely fashion. I want more.

Two nights in a row, i ended up buying a bag full of candy at the Sugar Factory store across from BLTs. The chocolate covered potato chips are good, as are the sour ribbon things. Malted milk balls are always a favorite. The white chocolate covered gummy bears were surprisingly tasty, too. Give it a go, why don't ya?

All in all, we had a wonderful time on my birthday trip, though I'm not sure if we'll stay there again unless we get a nice offer in the mail.

Im not saying there is anything wrong necessarily with the Mirage, it is simply not my taste.

The friends got a penthouse suite for Thursday night. It was a cool layout but the decor was something I would have been disappointed in if I were paying for it myself. I thought the finishes were extremely outdated but I imagine you cannot remodel\/update a huge hotel quickly. Beyond the decor though, as I said, the layout of the room was bomb.

The decor of the second room was really cool. It had purple leather like headboards with pink and purple accessories and it was extremely cool. My taste is boringly simple and the clean lines of this room appealed to it greatly. (:

I was really disappointed that the Secret Garden closes so early because I really wanted to see the baby pets. ):

For my bachelorette party, my friends and I scoured the internet for a hotel that offered an affordable suite with ample space to have a small party and also to house about 7 girls. For the record, suites don't usually allow that many people in one room, no matter how big they are (hotel politics), but it didn't seem unreasonable to me when we found the Mirage Hospitality Suite, which is 2 bedrooms, 3 beds, 3 bathrooms and 1700 square feet. For around $700 a night, we thought it was a deal of the century. Officially, it said max 6 people, but we sneaked in a 7th. 

The actual suite was perfect for our party. Lots of room, and no one ever felt like they were infringing on someone else's territory. The room with 2 beds was a little cramped, but I think it was okay for just the weekend when we weren't spending a ton of time in the suite anyway. 

However, lots of things went wrong. First, we arrived about an hour before check in, and we were informed that the suite would not be ready for another few hours. We were pretty upset with this and it seemed like no one could do much because there are only a finite amount of Hospitality Suites on the property. So we had to go hang out by the pool and frantically take out from our luggage what we needed and what was to go with the bell boy up to the room when it was finally ready. How terribly inconvenient...definitely not a luxury experience. I actually had a plastic bag full of clothes and a phone charger and some makeup that I had to carry around until about 5pm when the room was ready. Ugh.

Next, the refrigerator\/ice machine in our suite was not working and we had repairmen in and out of the suite for several hours. So not only did we get our room late, now the room is occupied by hotel staff....no privacy at this place! 

Additionally, we were charged some extra fee, but they removed it. We were getting pretty mad at the Mirage and after all this, they were on top of it with all of our demands. 

So all in all, yes it's a great room for a bigger party. But be aware that they only have a few of these suites and things might not go as smoothly as you had hoped.",4,1,3

Came here to gamble with some friends.  We joined their players club and played on some slots.  One of the things I noticed was the crappy service from the cocktail waitresses.  They would pass you on by without even asking if you needed something.  But when you finally did flag someone down, they would take your order and never come back!!  It was really frustrating.  I waited a good 20 minutes or so and I finally realized she wasn't coming back with my drink.  I finally gave up and realized the only drink I was going to get was the one that was sitting in my hotel room.  

Slots seemed pretty tight here too.  Kept putting money in, with little to no return.  

Don't think I will be back.",7,2,3

I don't come to gamble - I come to walk.  Walk the casinos, walk the shopping plazas, walk the Strip and take in all the superficial, Vegas-y goodness that I possibly can before I need a good dose of reality and normalcy again.

So an ideal hotel for me in Las Vegas is based as much on location as anything else.  And that's why I like the Mirage.  Not only does it fully embrace the Polynesian, island-y theme with its lava spewing volcano and lush, tropical interior, but it's very centrally located on the Strip.

We stayed here on my first and third trip to Vegas and I couldn't have been happier.  The average rooms are nothing special, but that's all you need, you shouldn't be spending much time other than sleeping in the room anyway.    

I disliked having to walk all the way through the casino in order to get to the room elevators, but quickly learned that was par for the course, and our room had a great view of the main drag and volcano out from our window, which was nice.  And there's a tram that travels between the Mirage and Treasure Island, that was very convenient when we saw Mystere one evening.

Inside there's a number of restaurants and buffets (all overpriced but the Carnegie Deli's pretty good for breakfast), a dolphin habitat, a large pool area complete with cabanas (which you must stake a claim to before the crack of dawn), lots of plants and tropical trees and a large casino area on the main floor (duh) - which never seems very fully or energetic.

The people watching even from the elevators to the front desk is superb (people watching anywhere in Las Vegas is superb, honestly).  But I really enjoyed it, and stepping out into the middle of the bustling Vegas thoroughfare and crowds immediately was great.  

Really, the best thing the Mirage has going for it is it's location: close to Caesars, close the Fashion Mall just the other direction, and the luxurious Venetian and other ritzy hotels right around there.  That's the best thing going for it.  I recommend it solely based on that.

If you want to have a great starting point to see Vegas for a few days, consider making camp here.",7,2,3

I was expecting tired rooms, noise and nonsense checking in. On this occasion I was surprised when I discovered that I'd been booked into a Suite on the B floor rather than a standard room. I wasn't expecting much from a Suite at The Mirage but I was very happy with what I found. It was a 3 room suite, a large lounge and bar area, a large bedroom and a bathroom\/dressing room. Very tastefully furnished and best of all very clean.

It was a total experience upgrade - the Suite is so large that you can't hear anything from outside or the adjacent rooms.

As soon as I opened the hotel door, I was impressed because it was nicer than I had expected until I stepped into the bathroom to wash up before going out and spotted hair in the bathtub. SO GROSS! I know for certain it was not mine or my friend's because we both have longer hair than the hair found in the bathtub. I immediately called housekeeping and they said that they would send someone up immediately to clean the bathtub. One hour and 5 more phone calls later, I was fed up. Every time I called, they replied back with ""Someone will there in ten minutes"". Are they playing games with me??! 
I called the front desk and requested to speak with the manager. She empathized with me and told me that she will get back to me soon. Turns out that housekeeping also said ten more minutes and she told me to wait until 11:17pm and the minute housekeeping was late, to contact her back. I gave one star for the manager, 
They literally came the second it turned 11:17. A lady came in smiling and it seemed like she cleaned the bathtub as the hairs were gone, but the second the shower turned on, the hairs appeared. It seems like the housekeeping lady just moved the hairs into the cracks and made it just look like it was gone? -_- Are you kidding me? At this point, I just cleaned the hairs myself because I was running so late. I never want to stay here again.

I forgot to request early check-in, but we had no problem checking in at noon, which was fantastic.  The room was average sized, but beautiful -- much nicer than last year's stay at the Flamingo.  The bed was to die for.  There are few beds that compare to my childhood bed at home and this is one of them.  My one complaint about the rooms is that the lighting isn't that great.  You need to turn on every light in the room to really be able to see much.

The pool, restaurants and bars are fantastic.  The pool was large and full of people in their 20's and 30's, which was great for us.  One of the best parts of the hotel may be Blizz, which I will review separately.  We weren't a fan of Jet last year, so we skipped it this year, but we still loved King Ink for a more laid back evening.

Biggest downfall: the gym, or rather, ""Cardio Room"" is pretty small.  Well, I shouldn't say that because there were more than enough treadmills, bikes, etc., but I was a little disappointed that there were no weight machines or even free weights.  Normally this wouldn't bother me since I'm a cardio feen, but I'm actually doing weight training as a part of my marathon training so 4 days without it was a downer.

As for the casino...I don't go to Vegas to gamble, but I did lose $15 in about 7 seconds in a craps game.  Was the first and (probably) last time I'll ever play.  Also saw Ray Romano playing on that same table about 9 hours earlier.  Spent 5-10 minutes creeping and sneaking pictures of him from far away.  I truly wished I was wasted so I would've had no problem asking him for a picture.  Damn my day-soberness.

On the surface, this place is decent, but I pay attention to many details. The rooms were certainly more spacious than the Wynn, but also not a updated and swanky. The bathrooms could use a little facelift (the shower curtain, shower heads, doors and paint) and most importantly, the mattresses need to be replaced! Lopsided mattress is a deal breaker, but given that we drank too much to notice on our trip, it didn't matter so much. 

The one-star rating is due to the fact that I left a valuable bracelet behind and realized it pretty quickly, so I made all the necessary phone calls only to not have my calls returned or be transferred between different departments. No one ever wrote my information down, so every time I called, I had to start all over. I called way before anyone else could have possibly checked into the room, knowing exactly where to direct the security personnel. I gave a clear description. I was extremely thorough. By the time I was finally able to speak to someone that cared, another guest had checked in. Granted, it was my mistake to have left it behind, it was very clear that everyone I spoke to could care less.

You want to talk about the ""prime"" location, it doesnt get better than this. Right smack in the middle of the strip, easy access to anywhere.

From the moment my G.F. arrived, the staff is very friendly. We arrived around noon and our room we booked was ready (did not book a strip view because I was going to try for a room upgrade). I cant remember the guys name at the front desk that we had, but when I asked for a room upgrade, he did not hesitate at all and gladly upgraded us. We just had to wait a few hours because the room was not ready. We had no problem with that because that gave us some time to go get some lunch. By the time we were done eating, our room was ready.

The room was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and even though the tv was acting up a tad, no complaints at all with the Mirage. The hotel\/casino is very easy to navigate. 

The Mirage pool is the king of pools. Staying at the Mirage just for the pool is worth it. When you see it you completely forget you are in the middle of the desert. It is a complete relaxation atmosphere. The water is the perfect temperature. Especially when you are sitting in the Vegas sun, you just go right into the pool and lounge around. The water temperature is absolutely perfect!

The pool area fills in very quickly, so if you want a good seat in the prime real estate, make sure to get there as soon as the pool opens. Being there early is totally worth it. A lot of people save chairs for others, and a lot of chairs just sit there with towels on them with noone using them so just scope out the area and wait until you see someone get up. We got to the pool late one day and some little, friendly old lady had saved 7 seats!!! and she was there alone, but when the guy next to her left, she moved over to the end of the row. It was actually really funny to hear talk on the phone and say she had taken 7 seats. As we saw this guy leaving, we walked over and with no hesitation she gladly gave up 2 of her seats for us. 

Not to mention, there are some good food spots for quick eats in the hotel, including BLT burger, Carnegie and Blizz frozen yogurt.

Came to Vegas with one other girl so chose Mirage more for its affordability (there weren't enough girls to split a Venetian suite) and the fact that the pool seemed cool.  Came in mid-July from Thur-Sun and paid $444.

The rooms were nice and spacious.  No complaints about any of it - oh except the fan in the shower was a bit useless so it was a steamy sauna in there after each shower.  Besides that, great comfy beds, good tv, a\/c wasn't too loud - it was good.

Cardio room was good, really clean, had 8 treadmills, about 6 ellipticals, and a few stationery bikes.  Had water, magazines, towels, snacks.  There was a worker stationed in the cardio room whose sole purpose was to clean up a machine when it was done.

Did not get a chance to check out the pool, but my friend did and she really liked it.

Food choices were ok.  We went to Starbuck's in there and also tried the frozen yogurt place.  There are some other decent choices, but we just didn't get to them.

Every night there are people trying to get you to go to JET.  They gave us a card with the promise of no wait, no cover and free drinks until midnight, but when we got there the mean bouncer guys in black suits said we'd have to wait in a looooong line so we went elsewhere.

Hotel security here is lacking and they don't seem to care.

We checked out early from our reservation.  We still paid for the night.  The front desk was nice enough to waive the $100+ for phone charges because apparently it costs over $26 a call just to connect.  We had to call police and our family for help and money to be able to drive home.  But that's probably the only nice thing I can say about our stay.",5,3,1

I did take a nap in the plush little chairs they have with the hairy looking carrot pillows (I kept beating and raping my friends in the behind with this).

Even with the renovations though, some stuff they seemed to overlook in the room. I noticed that the closets were a bit old looking still, but I mean, whose staying in there, not you I hope...And some of the bathroom fixtures were slightly rusted and not really what I would have expected from a room thats suppose to be offering a new look.

The pool was nice. Very hard to find a decent spot to chill in the middle of the day. The waitress was a little too slow for my liking, but then again I was extremely hungover and incapable of even making it to a bar to get the water and ginger ale I so desperately needed. Oh! And they were pretty innovative, they bar didn't sell ginger ale, but instead did a Coke and Sprite mix, it was awesome and tasted like the real deal.

Overall, for a non paying guest, I would say this place is aesthetically pleasing and not too bad of a walking distance to and from the strip to the rooms and to other mid-strip attractions and casinos.",1,1,1

The decor, the fresh flowers, and its overall beauty--this place is stunning! The customer service is on point- everybody is so friendly, and the location, center strip, is so easy! 
There is no ""riff raff"" in front of this hotel as there is, say, near MGM Grand and that's worth mentioning. Occasionally Pikachu is waiting for you to be suckered in for a photo op, but the panhandlers and street sleepers aren't out front. 
The pool and surrounding area is stunning! The pool here will make you feel like you're at an island resort, far away from the Strip's chaos and commotion. My only pet peeve for the pool is that they allow smoking and people still feel that they can leave cigarette butts on the ground in walking areas! Shame on the resort for allowing smoking there and certainly shame on smokers for being disgusting!
Don't be a litter bug, you bums!
Rooms aren't huge, but they are clean. I'm a stickler for this, so you can believe me. The issues I have with the room are mild. First, there is no outlet beside the bed (to charge your phones). The in room fridge is solely for their own items-lift the bottle or package and get charged for it. Want your own fridge? $35 a day. And finally, more an issue with the front desk, I was offered a volcano view room, basically jumped out of my skin saying yes, and arrived at the room to find the view was of the pool. Again.

The beds are ridiculous amounts of comfy, the iHome dock is greatly appreciated and there are enough mirrors and electrical outlets for four girls to share when getting ready. ALL great. :) 
Check-in for the group of 16 of us took maybe 20 minutes, but with a bar right next to the front desk we didn't mind too much. The TV in our room wouldn't turn on and when we called for someone to come check it out, I expected it to be a couple hours... not the ten minutes it actually was. Score for quick response time (and of course, for getting the TV to turn on).
Ample number of both fancier and more lowkey restaurants along with a couple lounges and the new 1OAK meant there was something for all of us. I do have to say, my favorite place during my most recent trip... the pool! Sadly, I didn't get a chance to peek in at Bare... maybe next time.

When they first starting remodeling\/detheming, I liked the new modern look and feel to the place. The restaurants, the club, the bars were all hip and trendy. Now everything is just tired. 

There is no longer anything unique at the Mirage. You want modern decor? Aria's got that. You want a hip trendy steakhouse, the Light Group has offerings at both Bellagio (FIX) and at Aria (Union). The rooms are still nice, with comfortable beds, and a nice big screen tv. The bathrooms are a bit on the small side, but are very functional. The walk from the parking garage to the room is quite a trek, so dont forget anything!

My last trip to the Mirage had very disappointing service. You could have the nicest building in town, but without great service to match, its all for naught. We found better service across the street at Casino Royale! During check in, I was never greeted with a ""hello"" or ""welcome,"" but a ""credit card and photo ID please."" No casual conversation, or even a smile. I think i would have gotten more emotion out of a Self Check-In kiosk. Service at the Roasted Bean coffee shop inside of the hotel was also subpar. 

The Mirage is still a good value. Its location can't be beat with easy accessibility to fast-food options, and its proximity to major attractions, its a good base for your Vegas vacation. But with lagging service, and a dated interior (when compared to new places like Aria, Encore, Wynn, and Cosmopolitan), you may be better off staying elsewhere.",5,2,2

The Mirage, sandwiched between Caesar's Palace and Treasure Island on the Strip, is a 10 minute ride from the airport by taxi and 20-30 minute ride by a popular mini-bus which stops at most of the major hotels.  The bus was less than $20 round trip, so that was chosen.  When departing for the airport, call them 24 hours in advance for pick-up. It was prompt and efficient...if not exactly luxurious.

Reception -  Just inside to the right of the main entrance.  Surprised they only had 5 stations available for check in to accommodate a huge hotel, but at 1230 PM on a Thursday in February, the process took just 5 minutes.  Our reservation was for an ""elevated Strip view room"", so the attendant offered us a spot on the 24th floor ( there are 30 floors ).  Not bad.  Then she asked if we wanted an upgrade to a ""suite"" for $50 more per night. What's the difference?  A regular room is 400 square feet.  The suites were 1,200!  I quickly said ""sign us up"".  If available on your visit, grab it!

Suite - On the 26th floor ( only non-smoking of 26-30 ).  Nice and open!  We had a wet bar with a sizeable living room containing a comfortable wraparound couch, cocktail table and wall unit with a 50 inch flat screen TV.  Next was a dining room with a large oval glass table and plenty of space for entertaining.  The bedroom had a queen mattress ( quite soft.  We've got a Sleep Number bed at home.  I'm a semi-firm ""65"".  This was a ""35"" ) and a pop-up 40 inch TV in sleek furniture at the base of the bed.  The bathroom was huge and included a spa-tub, shower, counter with dual sinks, walk-in closet, separate make-up desk and a ""toilet room"" with bidet ( which we never touched.  It was cute, but strange ).  If the Mirage added a kitchen, you could move in.  And the artwork was topnotch.

Casino  - ""They"" say the air in casinos has improved.  From what?  From a dense fog of tear gas to a light haze of forest fire?  Imagine yourself in a small stall with a bad case of flatulence.  Now, instead of burnt beans you've got the taste of stale tobacco...everywhere.  Front entrance.  Reception. Restaurants.  There was no escape.  However, besides that sludge in the air, we found the casino to be surprisingly dark, grimy and sad.  Isn't it meant to be happy? Don't people spend more when they're optimistic - not squinting for light and searching for sanitary napkins as they gasp toward the exits?  But the worst part?  There's no way to reach the elevators to the rooms without taking a tortuous path through the casino.  It was hellish.

Restaurants - We ate in 3 of the restaurants.  One of our 3 dinners in Las Vegas was at Kokomo's.  The choices were varied...food good...prices reasonable and service decent, but only a partition separated us from the smoke-filled bar.  Ever try fish dipped in ashes?  Maybe they should add it to the menu.

Each of 3 breakfasts were at the Mirage.  The buffet had a wide sampling of okay food.  Good, but certainly not gourmet...though it was fine for $20.  Two sit down breakfasts were at BB King's.  I'd suggest the lox and bagel sandwich.  A quiet alternative, but the bill was higher for much less food of similar quality.  Fortunately, only a small amount of casino odor seeped past the front doors.

Theater - Cirque D'Solei had a show built around music of the Beatles.  The music, performers and sets  were great.  It wasn't cheap, but worth the price of admission.

Shops - Like all the major hotels, there are shops....but more like you'd find in a neighborhood mall rather than the unusual spaces found in similar priced hotels.  Yogurt at ""Blizz' was too heavy and gloppy and double the price at chains in California like Yogurtland.

Accident  -  My wife slipped and fell while walking over a bridge from reception toward the casino.  I filed a report and a security person took notes.  Good reaction time, but no follow-up like a flower.

Overall, my stay was disappointing.  Our group partook in the favorite exercise of visitors to Vegas...walking into different hotels...and the comparison could not be more glaring.  Each place more special than the last.  Large reception areas.  An open atmosphere.  Big, bright and bold yet warm colorsI  Glamorous shops ( even just from the windows ).  Inviting casinos! Breathable air!  The Venetian!  Palazzo!  Aria!  Mandarin Oriental!  Wynn!!!

Staff was friendly and our room was cleaned daily and restocked with towels.  The room wasn't anything too fancy at all, but we had a view of the strip and THAT was what made it that much better.  Also, we had a view of the Volcano.   It was fun watching it go off all the time while we were getting ready to head out for the night.

We did a afternoon at the pool that was really nice.  I love the pool with its waterfalls and large area.  What DID SUCK about the pool is that it's about 3 to 4 feet deep all the way around.  I'm 6'5"" and like to dive in and swim!!  Can't really do that but from what I hear all hotels pools are shallow.  That's ok, didn't cramp my day one bit.  The have waitresses that take your order for a drink while next to the pool which is really nice too.

I know it was our first time, but still the experience and time we had earned them 5 stars. We're heading back to Vegas in two days and are staying at a different hotel.  We'll see if these 5 stars stay for long.",3,0,3

Obviously most hotels wont actually let you check in until 10-11, but we couldn't check in until 10:30. So just went ahead got breakfast, took my time, played some rigged slots that lasted me only 5 min, then came back to check in. The lady  checked me in, BUT stared suspicion into me and said ""your a minor? you look like a minor"". NO I am certainly not a minor thank you very much (never said it like that, but you get the picture :] ). So in order to get to the rooms you have to walk through the casino with tempting slots trying to tell you ""give me your money, you know you want to"". 

 When we got into the rooms, in my opinion I thought this room is much better than the rooms at Excalibur. It was way spaaaaaacier!! the beds were extremely comfy that made you feel like you were laying in a bunch of ""cotton like clouds"". The pillows were a bit disappointing it was indeed soft, but soft enough to be flatten out the next day you wake up on it. 

  Nice architect on the bathroom,but the showers are sooo bad! water comes out in big clumps, and runs slow sometimes. One of the towels I used smelled like chlorine, and it wasn't a faint scent of chlorine but it smelled like someone actually had the nerve to dip it into the pool!! tsk, tsk, tsk! Overall my ""luxurious"" time in the bathroom wasn't a hot experience at all.

Kind of wish the room I stayed at wasn't located at the end of the hallway. Came back from a long night stupidly wearing heels causing my feet to hurt. After coming out the elevator I remember saying ""noooooooooooooooo why is it so far away!!!!?!?!?!"" wanted to crawl so badly, but that would've been so awkward for someone to see, and wanted to take my heels off but the thing is well........

The convention center is very nice. No florescence lights for the most part. Except the chairs they use in the rooms are extremely old and everyone complained about the cushions. The guest rooms need a full remodel in the bathroom. The beds also seemed a bit tired and so did the carpet. But the rest, the TV, the linens were pretty nice.

The pool I didn't hang out at because it was very loud. It has a pretty waterfall but very loud too. At least the rooms were very quiet so I could go back there for a rest. 

The Beatles love show is very entertaining.

The location was perfect - right on the strip, and about a 15 minute walk to the Bellagio, Cosmo, etc. We had a room with two Queen beds which was roomy and clean, nothing fancy, but perfect for what little time we were in our rooms. I had stayed at The Cosmopolitan Hotel the last time I was in Vegas, which was stunning, but Mirage was a great mid range option.

I was initially worried it would be more of an older crowd - and while there were definitely a lot of middle-aged people staying there, there were also quite a few younger groups around late 20s early 30s for Bachelor parties, birthday parties, etc. 

The service was great, and the hotel was easy to navigate - it didn't take half an hour to exit the casino or a long time to wait for elevators at all (unlike the Cosmo). 

We got an Air Canada vacation package which included flights and hotel, and this hotel is a perfect option for those who are looking for a centrally located, clean, decent hotel at a reasonable price. 

Definitely recommend this!",0,0,0

Considering we got a free room, registration felt it was necessary to give us a room on the 16th floor with a view of some buildings and part of the pool. the view was whatever to me, but you see access to certain floors are divided among 4 sets of elevators. Access to floors 9-16 were assigned on one of them. If you don't see where I'm getting at, picture this:

Our room is the last floor accessible going up and down. It doesn't help when you're going up and there's others in the elevator that are getting out on floors 9-15. It also doesn't help when going down that there's a stop on every floor going 15-9. It wasn't like that all the time, but 2 to 3 stops in each direction guaranteed. FML.

Besides that, my other annoyance with the Mirage is the volcano show. After hearing about the improvements and watching it at night, I was thoroughly disappointed. Its one of those ""That's it?!"" moments. 

Now onto the good stuff. $5 minimum craps tables for most of the day up until midnight. Jet is a fun nightclub to go to. Apparently I heard Aubrey O'Day from Danity Kane was supposed to be there on Friday night to celebrate her birthday, but I left for home that evening. They did a lot of interior remodeling for their rooms to make it look modern and stuff, almost Ikea status. Well not really, because there's a catalog in the room that tells you exactly what came from where and where to buy that stuff should you feel like copying the room. I'm pretty sure the beds were pillowtops too. 

I do enjoy their buffet Cravings, but I was kinda turned off from trying it last week because the food wasn't that great. Maybe because it was a weekday lunch menu. Whenever I see Japonais I chuckle to myself over a name like that for a restaurant. Location is key alone the strip, and the Mirage is in the middle of it all. Short walks to Wynn\/Encore, Caesar's, Venetian\/Palazzo, and the Fashion Show Mall. There's also a walkway that will lead you to a crosswalk to Harrah's, the side where McDonald's and Chipotle are. Sweet. 

Mirage has been around for a long time, and after all this time, it still doesn't disappoint. I'd stay here again.",2,1,2

The hotel was GREAT! VERY clean and everyone was very friendly.  It is in a great location on the strip.  We were able to walk EVERYWHERE from here.  They had valet which was friendly and quick.  We flew into vegas and rented a car so that we could drive to Cali a few days later so I was able to walk or drive anywhere.  The nearest big chain department store was about 15 minutes away or so.  

We went because my husband had a convention across the street.  I am so glad we stayed at the Mirage though.  It had everything we needed (EXCEPT a refrigerator).  I'm so used to normal hotels versus Vegas hotels.  Of course the outside entertainment was loud.  We stayed in a room that faced the volcano.  We could hear it go off time to time and eventually we got used to it.  It wasn't a bother.  The kids got a kick out of it.  

Because there was no refrigerator, I did not want to spend $10 (or whatever it was) on a bottle of water each time so the kids and I often took the elevators downstairs to the Starbucks.  I'd get a coffee and the kids would get milk.  We had some aluminum cups for the kids which was a life saver to keep their drinks cold through nap.  I also noticed there weren't many kid channels on the TV.  I know, I know, not a normal Vegas complaint so it's probably irrelevant to anyone reading.  

We didn't see any nighttime shows while in Vegas but we did do the Sigfried and Roy's Secret Garden exhibit.  They had 3 white tiger cubs at the time- a few months old by the time we visited- so the kids got a kick out of that.  They had lions and other animals too.  Mr. Sigfried himself walked around and greeted the guests.  I thought that was super nice.  Right next to the secret garden is a beautiful aquarium where we were able to catch 2 different dolphin shows.   You do pass a topless pool to get to the aquarium\/secret garden but it wasn't open when we visited in December so that didn't bother me.  

One night my husband and I took turns going to the casino to play a little.  Neither of us are gamblers but the many machines I tinkered around with worked and I had no issues (besides losing).  

There is a parking structure accessible to the hotel.  If you have a stroller or a wheelchair, you have to exit the structure on the main floor and walk outside to get into the lobby\/casino.  If you don't have a wheelchair\/stroller you can cross a bridge and head right into the casino.  Not too big of a deal since the weather is always gorgeous.

We walked the strip for dinner a few nights before giving the buffet a try (I'm not a buffet person).  But let me tell you, the buffet was AMAZING! I wish we did buffets every night.  They're nothing like buffets anywhere else.  And it's much MORE cost-effective when traveling with small kids.  They had every style of food I could think of at different stations- Italian, BBQ, Mexican, etc.  I'm not even a food person and writing this right now, I wish I was there again.",4,2,1

It was all a blur but I must admit that I was seduced by the hedonistic architecture of the many restaurants in the Mirage.  Of all the areas of Vegas I visited, the Mirage had the most electric atmosphere.  It was the 4th inning of Game 1 of the World Series and everybody was checking everybody out here.

It's a sexy environment to say the least.  Although I only journeyed through the Mirage on my way to the Rialto Bridge and Doge of the Venetian across the street, I was permanently seduced by this place.

The king room was adequate & superficially clean.  I had to call housekeeping to get robes.  The bathroom fan was very loud & didn't remove any steam so the entire room gets hot after a shower.  No shower cap so bring your own.  The resort fee is only to cover the internet.

Had dinner reservations for 4 at Fin in the hotel before the show.  The food was very good but our waiter was useless, pour your own water, ask to have plates & glasses removed when finished.   He didn't understand the differences between wine even though it was on their menu & needed help from other staff to finally get a bottle of wine from the adjacent steak house because everything we wanted on the Fin menu was sold out. 

There is nothing but the night club open after midnight in this hotel on a Saturday.  I wanted a cocktail & snack after the show.  The lobby bar was the only place open and could only provide a cocktail but no food. 

No idea if there is room service for breakfast because the menu pages were missing from the room binder.  There is no newspaper at the door as part of the resort fee so have to ask for one.

I was playing pai gow poker at The Mirage Las Vegas.

I banked, everybody was betting the same amount. I lost to the dealer, and she immediately put my chips into her rack. (she should have left it out on the table for the end total) Then after she placed my cards in front of her, I won one from a player, three other players are pushes. She hands me the one Bet from the player and asked for commission. I gave her the commission but then afterwards I realized that I basically did not win anything for that round. Minus one and Plus one equals zero. but the dealer charged me commission.

I told the dealer there is no commission because I did not win anything. She disagreed. She was stubborn and ignorant, slim Asian woman in her mid-20s.

So I called the floor supervisor and she was incompetent too. She was unable to comprehend what I was trying to express. She had no idea what I was talking about, I do not know how she holds the position of floor supervisor. I drew a diagram of what happened and showed it to her she still did not know anything. All she said was that if you win you have to pay commission. I said I know, but I did not win anything that round because the dealer put my loss chips into her tray, she just kept repeating herself that if you win you have to pay commission.

This floor person who does not have the mental capacity to understand the situation.

The Mirage needs some serious management training and leadership skills in customer service. I was staying there for the Digital Auto Dealer Conference in early Oct 2011. Here are the ""low lights"" of my stay:
1. Called ahead to ask for early check in. I was told no problem. When I got there, they actually laughed at me and said ""no chance.""
2. I had to stow my bags with the bellman so I went to the ""Bell Desk"" to do that and they acted like I was bothering them and then pointed that I should go outside to do that.
3. Once in my room, I called the bell desk several times to retrieve my bags, getting an automated attendant and COMMERCIALS! while I was waiting for someone to pick up. It took 4 tries to get someone on the phone and once I did, Cynthia laughed at me when I told her the substandard experience I had just received. I actually asked her, ""Are you laughing at me?"" but she didn't reply.
4. Whenever you call any dept in the hotel, they don't know your name. They ask you every time to state your name, making me feel unimportant.
5. Most every hotel these days has an in-room coffeemaker. Mine didn't so I called room service. I like to have hot water in the mornings so I asked about it and they said I would have to order hot water from room service! Really???
6. I did like they said, I ordered hot water from room service and guess what?  It tasted and smelled like coffee!
7. There was no shower cap (I know this is a small one but to those of us with long hair, it's a big deal).
8. The rooms are dirty, they need a makeover.  Appalling.
9. After I checked out I had time before my flight so I asked where in the hotel could I work for a few hours without any cigarette smoke (since I am allergic).  I was told the only place in the hotel where there is no smoking was Starbucks.  Thank you Starbucks for being the only bright spot in my stay at the Mirage.
10. I had to visit the ladies' room during my Starbucks stay and had to walk far into the casino to get there.  When I did, there was no toilet paper in ANY of the stalls.
With that, I called a taxi and left for the airport early.  DO NOT stay at the Mirage Hotel.  Run away and never come back!",1,6,0
4238261,BqBeDAMrcMXtWK8IyDG9dQ,H6r5tNKVn2SjpZRFoPsQrQ,DfgZlNgKwBvCpA_0alumXw,4,2011-09-24,"I just returned from a 5-night stay at The Mirage.  I'm only writing a review because this is my second time staying in Las Vegas (the first was last year at The Flamingo) and I now feel I have enough information to truly review and compare a Las Vegas hotel.

First, I've wanted to stay at The Mirage since last year when I first walked in to view it.  It seemed like a really nice place, gave you that ""tropical vacation"" feel and it's not too huge (like Caesars Palace) so it won't take you an hour to walk to the lobby.  When we first arrived we were allowed an early check-in at no extra cost since some rooms were available.  The dude that checked us in had ZERO personality.  I asked for a room close to the elevator and he completely ignored me.  But all in all check-in went well and painless, there was no line when we arrived.  We were given a room on the 17th floor.  The moment I walked in to that room and looked around it took less then 30 seconds and we were calling the front desk for a different room.  This room was awful!!!!  The bathroom was smaller than my bedroom closet and the view was horrendous....oh gawd, the freeway and roof, yum, exactly what I don't want to wake up to.  I know in Vegas you spend very little time in your room, but this view was godawful and definitely not what I wanted to see when I woke up.  So after a bit of complaining to the front desk we were given an upgrade (at $20 a night extra) to a room on the 24th floor overlooking the pool.  This was THE BEST $100 I spent!  The room was fabulous!!  Huge bathroom, double sink, deep jetted tub (which I used 3 nights), separate shower, 2 closets, and the view was amazing!!  We could see the strip, The Rio and Palms, the pool area including the dolphins, and the sunset, it was totally fabulous!  I highly recommend the 24th floor.  And another awesome thing was that the elevator was only used for the 24th and 25th floor, how sweet is that?  We rarely had to share it.  The only drawback, and I've read this on many reviews including those of other hotels, was that the lighting is very dim in the room.  I'm guessing they don't use anything higher than a 20-watt bulb, so be prepared for that.  However the bathroom lighting was great.  The bed was fabulous, very comfy, and the AC was OK if you put it to 50 degrees.  The windows in the room open and that was really cool, I was able to get some awesome pictures of our view.  The housekeeping is so-so, I guess it depends on who cleans it.  One day we returned and our shower and tub were obviously not touched, the next day it was spotless and the floor was vacuumed.  DO NOT touch anything in the refrigerator in your room as it is weighed and you will be charged (unless you want it).  We ended up with a Sugar Factory lollipop because we lifted it up, you own it when you remove it. 

The line for the taxi was horrendous!  And I mean it was about an hour long wait, totally ridiculous!  Take the tram to TI and use their taxi line, it's a shorter wait.  We went through the Secret Garden and that was nice, but I couldn't help but feel sad for the dolphins because some of them didn't really move around and they seemed bored which disturbed me a little bit, nobody was interacting with them.  The big cats were cool though, they just slept as cats always do.  The pool was unbelievably crowded!  We ended up paying for the private area (not the Bare Lounge) and later on after a little bit of complaining they credited us for that.  Rhumbar is fabulous, a must to visit and get a drink.  And the hotel isn't that large so it's easy to get from place to place in a short amount of time.  The buffet is OK, too many meat choices, but I loved the salad bar since they toss them for you.

Overall The Mirage is OK, I would stay here again (on the 24th or 25th floor overlooking the pool).   I gave this hotel 4-stars because the check-in was a breeze, the room change was painless, the credit they gave us for the pool area was super cool, the casino itself is nice and the dealers we met were very friendly and interactive, most of the hotel employess are super nice (except for the a-hole waiter at Carnegie Deli who obviously hated his job, but I don't think he was a ""Mirage"" empoyee so I'm letting this one slide) and the location is excellent!  But I cannot give this review 5 stars because the hotel is old and slightly dingy and needs some upgrading, our room key gave us trouble in the elevator (you need to use your room key to get to your floor in the 24-25 elevators) and it took them 2 days to fix the key problem, and that taxi line was simply unacceptable.",1,1,1

Even though you can smoke in the casino it doesn't reek of smoke which is good. There aren't many retail shops which is ok depending on what a person preference is. The thing that makes me give this casino 3 stars instead of 4 is that there are no legit food places to eat at other than the high end restaurants that start around $20 a plate. It's unfortunate to have to leave the hotel for something quick and convenient which doesn't end up being quick and convenient at all.,1,0,0

The main issue I had was the room smelled when I checked-in. The source of the smell was from the restroom- it smelled like dirty gym socks that had been placed in a juicer. I called the front desk to get this issue addressed- the phone operator seemed a bit unapologetic about this nuisance. After saying she would have someone look into the issue, an hour had passed and no one had come to the room. I called the front desk again and a different rep had an entirely different tone than the first employee- she apologized for the inconvenience and was able to waive our resort fees. Although the defogging (basically making the room smell good again) meant we had to stay out of the room for two hours, it was worth it (then again, to distract time, we ended up gambling = losing).

The response time of the TV was painfully slow. Channel surfing was at a crawl. The only other inconvenience of the weekend was the tram connecting Mirage to Treasure Island was down for a brief period and it was when we were needing it on our walk home from a long night out.

A plus of the hotel is that I got a room overlooking the pool and the dolphin exhibit. those dolphins are so smart!",5,7,4

Stayed 3 nights 4 days

Not that impressed.
Room is small, old & musty.
2nd, 3rd & 4th day they had construction going on around our room. Constant drilling, hammering & circular saw. Really? Who books a room and has construction going on all around the room? We called front desk & they wanted to comp me 2 days. Nope! Won't take it. My room is payed in full by my company. Offered us $50 credit for anything we wanted on hotel property. No dice! Tried to use that towards breakfast at The Pantry next morning. Waitress said they had no recored of that credit. SMH. Wife took breakfast bill to front desk and squared it all out. We should be able to charge up to $50 in credit to our room. 

Update: tried to charge drinks to our room from the Ruhmbar. Nope!!!!! You'll have to talk to the front desk.

House keeping timing is spotty at best. Just leave for the whole day, who knows when they'll get to turning your bed.

The Pantry has a great breakfast. BLT burger places was good for a burger & fries.

Bed was comfy.
Bathrooms are really small. The hair dryer trips the breaker and turns the light & fan off. Push red button to see the light!

The AC unit seems to have a humidifier with it. Kept room nice and cold. But notice when we slept with it on, the room was damp.

Our LCD TV kept going dark. Then light. & on the last night, cable goes out.

No fridge for your own items. 

No coffee maker (not a big deal for us).

The rooms are out dated & in need of updating.

We booked our Tower Suite back in April for our trip and when we checked in I asked for either a pool, strip or volcano view but they told me that they were all sold out, even though we checked in at 1:00PM on Thursday and I'm pretty sure there were still plenty of people that still had to check in that day, so we got stuck with what they call ,"" A beautiful mountain view,"" which is actually a freeway view. So we get to our room and there is a big crack in one of the windows, about four feet long. It made my wife very uncomfortable being in that room so I went down to the front desk to tell them that my wife doesn't feel comfortable staying in that room but they said the best they can do is change our room the next day. So Friday comes along and still no other view room available just the freeway, but we change rooms and the bubbles in the tub in our new room don't work. It took four calls and 3 1\/2 hours for someone to finally come up and fix it. All in all we still enjoy the Mirage and will continue to stay here. The pool is immaculate, very beautiful and relaxing, we enjoy the Paradise Cafe for lunch. Down side about the pool though is the new large drink cups, they use to have the nice plastic souvenir cups but they switched to these smaller cheap flimsy cups, and for $27 a drink you would think they could afford to have the nice ones still.  My opinion about them saying they had no view rooms that I wanted available is that we booked the One Bedroom Tower Suite at such an amazing price is that they figured we should have the crappy view and give the better view to the other people who paid more, because they say that rooms are not assigned until you check in, so if we checked in at 1:00 PM I'm pretty sure not all strip, volcano and pool view would have been taken. One more thing,  it is very stupid to have your view ruined by the Beatles banner that covers all the top floors which are the suites, you get nice big floor to ceiling windows and you can't see very well out the window because of it, so disappointing. The one star is solely for them not being able to accommodate our room change when I know they had other rooms available, even after they became aware of the big cracked window and we still had to wait until the next day. And the package we booked says $50 dining credit + VIEW ROOM UPGRADE. They also didn't apply the $50 credit until I looked at the bill and saw that it was not on there. It was just very disappointing, it was our Ten year wedding anniversary, we stay at the Mirage every time that we go to Vegas and they couldn't accommodate us, it really put a damper and a slow start to our celebration.",1,1,1

Since we were local, they waived the resort fee (WHAT?!?) and then sent my husband a small dessert plate with a three different pastries since it was his birthday! The pool? Clean, open until 8 (much later than other pools on the Strip), great vibe, delicious drinks and a 21+ pool which we love.

The Mirage doesn't smell like smoke all the time, has a lot of different table games and slot machines, and I loved the layout of the entire casino. The food options in The Mirage are not lacking in the yummy factor. Carnegie Deli makes every taste bud in my mouth water with their corned beef, and their pastrami omelette is happiness. I loved that omelette because it wasn't greasy at all and had the perfect amount of pastrami in it to make me feel like I was eating breakfast at their NY location. My parents split their sandwich, and I would suggest you do too because it is larger than the size of your head! STK Burger? I've never had anything at this restaurant that was mediocre.

There are 3 elevators with key access to the 26-30th floors labled A-D.  I wasn't expecting much as the Mirage is a bit older than the more modern hotels but was pleasantly surprised.  Very spacious 1 bedroom 1300 sq ft. with a 60"" Plasma, dinning area, wet bar, huge bathroom with separate shower and Jacuzzi Tub.  

The decor was modern and ample to my liking with a striking view of the strip floor to ceiling tinted windows.  If you look at the Mirage, the dark gold large window at the top of the hotel are all the suites. 

Very comfortable arrangements and much quieter as you'd expect.  As with all the suites there is a door bell and a button to push for privacy not a door hanger.  There are 3 TVs, one rising out of the foot of the bed, one in the bathroom 42"", and the 60"" in the living area.  Very large sofa with built in chase loungers and enough room for at least 6 people to hang out comfortably.

There is no comparison to the regular rooms as the suites are 1st class and worth an upgrade if offered.  I was comped but after speaking to the manager they will ""release"" a suite to VIP members for $50 and $80-120 for the Penthouse per night on top of what you're paying for the regular room.

Going to a suite from a regular room is like going from flying economy to first class.  The attention to detail was outstanding, color scheme was modern and nice, the service in the Towers was outstanding.",5,1,2

Spent enough time in the casino to get the $10 dealers to know me by name.  Even won enough money to pay for tattoo at Vince Neil Ink (see separate review). 

Location is perfect.  Right across from Venetian, TI, even a Mickey D's and Chipotle is right there.  Take a walk down to O'Sheas for some cheap craps and Beirut (""beer pong"").

We even did the corny Tiger and Dolphin tour.  Only regret is not checking out Bare on Monday, but like I said it was too damn hot.

While I understand obligations, I was not part of the contractual agreement with the convention, and this would've been a non-issue at most any other hotel I do business with. Further, with three nights notice I don't believe The Mirage would've had any issue booking this room for someone else at a higher rate! Gotta call BS on this one and their explanation.

The location of The Mirage is quite convenient on the strip, putting it in the center of all the hub-bub of the city that never sleeps. The hotel itself is teeming with activity with restaurants and shops galore so you'll never be bored no matter what time it is.

My room was beautifully designed with a large closet with mirrored doors, a bathroom with a big, lighted mirror and a magnifying mirror that swings from the wall, two Queen sized beds with plump pillows and a heavy comforter, and spacious wooden drawers. 

The bathroom is a bit on the tiny side, but there were plenty of towels of various sizes. The shower head produced a strong stream of water and the sink was incredibly spacious. Amenities were a-plenty and I liked how there was a ventilation system in the bathroom as well. The bed was comfortable enough that I could sleep through the whole night, although I wish there were more outlets closer to the bed to make for easy charging. There are, however, more outlets near the mini desk so it's not too big of a problem.

The biggest issue I had was the unreliable wifi. Sometimes, it wouldn't connect at all and when it did, the signal would pop in and out. But since I was in Las Vegas, it wasn't like I was going to stay inside my room and use the wifi a lot anyway.

Even though my stay was quite short in The Mirage, I was very pleased with the room. It had everything I needed and the employees of the hotel were more than ready to help the minute I called. Definitely a hotel I would book again!",44,30,42

With the 10% AAA discount the rooms were $160.00 per night, which seemed to us a very good deal relative to the other hotel-casinos for similar rooms. At check in we requested and got strip view rooms, and tipped the front desk agent.  The weather in Las Vegas was the best I'd experienced there- about 75 in the day time and mid 60's at night. We only ate at one food outlet, the Cravings buffet, and the food was excellent. Would highly recommend the Mirage.

I can't remember how many loyalty points it took, but it is no longer available for purchase and has been that way for 6 months or more. I doubt they have any plans on bringing it back since it was so easy to achieve, which makes them lose out on a crap ton of money since everyone was going for that free room reward.

Now, I also had a 2 night room reward for the Deluxe King at Mirage through MyVegas. Our whole plan was to try and get the tower suite for all 3 nights that we would be there. It was close to our anniversary, but we never did any $20 or $50 trick to get an upgrade for free. The guy at check-in said excuse me, but I'll have to go make a call behind closed doors once we asked if we could have it for our entire time there. After about 5+ minutes, he comes back and says we can give you the room 2 extra nights for $100 per night. I figured it would be $50 extra per night, but my husband wanted the room, so he gave in and said yes, we'll take it. Much to my surprise, the extra $200 was well worth it. This room is the nicest and biggest room I have ever stayed in period. It's 1200 sq feet, which is bigger than most apartments and some houses!! I wished my downstairs area was as big as this place was.

It was really great to have that big area since we were there with some friends. We can't very well mingle in a deluxe king room and drink booze before heading out to the strip comfortably. I didn't take pics of the separate bathroom, but it had a bidet in it. And you bet your sweet ass I used it! I had never seen or used one before, so I had to give it a whirl.

The beds were comfortable, maybe a little too plush for my husband, but he likes his beds firm.

Having a separate powder area for us girls to get ready was nice. Although, we kind of blocked the bathroom, since it's RIGHT THERE.

The bathtub was big enough for my husband and I to sit in it together. There's never big enough tubs for us both to sit comfortably. I wanted to take it home with me!!

The couch was not at all comfortable. It's not cushion-y at all and was more like sitting on boards. I guess that wasn't too much of a deal breaker because we weren't there to sit on the couch. We mainly hung out by the wet bar and when we weren't there, we were out on the strip.

The water pressure was also great. There's one thing I've noticed about Las Vegas hotels, and that seems to be weak water pressure in most hotels. Not so at the Mirage! I can actually get the soap off my body and out of my hair without staying in there for 30 minutes.

Overall, the MyVegas redemption was an easy process. And getting the tower suite for $200 all 3 nights came out to about $66.66 per night, which is one hell of a deal! This room normally goes for $400 per night. Now when I go back to Vegas, I am going to be comparing all of my future rooms to this one and I have a feeling it won't even be in the same ballpark.

Thank you to MyVegas and Mirage for making our stay pleasant!",6,2,3

My girlfriends were able to score us a room on the 22nd floor facing the volcano and we were super pleased with that. The only issue I really found with the room was the temperature. It was on the wonky side but once again still manageable. The windows open which was a big help! We didn't get to visit the pool so maybe next time but all in all the property was great.

As a resort\/casino, a place to play, eat, and see shows? 4-star, enjoyable. It's a solid place for that.

This review, however, is based on my experience while at the Mario Barth's Biggest Tattoo Show on Earth held at the Mirage over the weekend. (Ooooh, another caveat: THIS IS NOT A SHOW REVIEW.)

*****

Still with me? OK, here's the short and sweet:

So, (a) you have the Terry Fator theater close by, with some concessions, a business area, etc. Add to this that (b) the convention center is hosting a tattoo convention, a service that is -  what, 75%+ the time? - a cash transaction...

And you have no ATMs close by. Not close to the theater. Not close to the concessions. Not close to the box office. You have to go all the way out to the LOVE! theater to find an ATM. Worse yet, (c) your convention staff didn't know that. If there was anything closer, no one I know or talked to could find it or point it out. #vendingfail

I hopped on the locals' special and signed up ahead of time to get free tickets. Without pre-registration, it cost locals $10. Overall, no biggie. But then, at the door, not only did no one check my ticket until I practically forced it under her nose, she didn't give me or my friend any sort of wrist band. Why is this important? While they do offer hand stamps for exit and re-entry (see aforementioned ATM fail), I was still hassled a couple times by Mirage security about not having a wrist band and why couldn't I produce my ticket? Thankfully I had the email confirmation on my phone and ID to correspond to the email.

$6 beers and $12 cocktails? Really? Even in a casino on the strip that's a bit ludicrous, especially because I am not sitting somewhere being served and\/or offered food, etc.

Loved the show, generally like the Mirage, but the convention setup, handling, conveniences (and lack thereof)? Meh, truly disappointed; I've had better.",2,0,0

Waiting so long made it impossible to have our anniversary dinner prior to the Love show.

that the Corzo was new and has not been priced ( why in the world would it be displayed???)

had decent tequila choices yet when we chose to use the comp that was offered the manager 
attempted to refuse it. We were late for the show, I gave him what was owed beyond the 
comp and left.  After the Love show ( which was fabulous) we went to Jet. After one drink (

purchase a bottle of water......really??? We asked the other bartender and we were given water

We were first assigned to a room with a beautiful view of piles of take-out-trash on a rooftop. I kid you not - scores of people had thrown their 1\/2 eaten take out food - I saw wings, fries, slop, green stuff, half in and out of styrofoam containers. No one had cleaned it up. I just felt so revolted. 

We changed rooms and the next room had a broken toilet that they 'fixed' but didn't fix, and so it remained nonfunctional. It would only flush 1 out of every 3 or 4 times. This was starting to get on my nerves. Who can let it go on the can when it might not flush?

Then we moved again and it was okay, but there was other stuff too - slow service, this and that, bla bla bla.

Friends and I stayed on (and subsequently laid waste to) the eighth floor. Our rooms were all recently renovated and much nicer than expected, thankfully nothing like the MGM. For what we paid, we got clean linens, soft beds, and good lighting. Of course, there was an iPod dock by the nightstand.

The Mirage's casino might be dark for some, but they've got a pleasantly vegetated bar area near the front lobby. If you're hungry, there's a light selection of restaurants. Table games have reasonable minimum limits, and not-so-reasonable limits are available for those who like the thrill of gambling.

However, the lunch breaks offered very little for the people with any dietary restrictions.  Even my local sandwich shop in Austin TX can make me a sandwich with gluten free bread.....not so much in Vegas.  I ate salads for lunch and eggs\/bacon for supper mostly as I was too tired to find a good restaurant with a chef that can do gluten free\/dairy free.  Thought the gambling area smelled like smoke, so I didn't do any gambling there.  Since my only other experiences in Vegas are either at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay, the Mirage is average at best IMHO.

Update later that same year:  Girls weekend in Vegas for 4 ppl.  Reservations made all together on one credit card and one name so they are linked together.  Requested adjoining\/connecting rooms as this was a girls weekend.  When we arrived the reservations were NOT linked.  They did not have us in adjoining or connecting rooms.  They did NOT alter that fact, nor did they seem to care that this was inconvenient or a problem.  They did not address it or offer any compensation for this HUGE inconvenience.  It really affected the trip that if two of us went up and were not the two sharing the same room, then we either had to be apart or cart items between the rooms...same goes for sharing accessories, having morning coffee, etc.  It was just a drag.  The Mirage was seemingly unaware of how girls weekends operate.  Their attitude was uncaring and I will NEVER go back.  Why make a reservation for two rooms in advance if the reservation itself is not honored?  Why pay a reservation hold fee if it isn't holding what you want?  Why go out of town for a girls weekend, if you can't spend the weekend with the girls?  We did have fun, but the inconvenience was a bit dampening.

First off, I've been going to vegas since i was a kid. my mom's mom used to live out there, so we would treck from Southern Ca, all the way to Vegas a lot to see her. so i know the strip and some areas pretty well.

now older, 3 of my friends' bands were booked at the Rock room. So my best friend and i decided to trek out to vegas and support them, and now picking out a hotel was #1 on the list. should we splurge and get a nice room with a view of the strip? We think, yes. We went through so many hotels, reading reviews (thank you everyone who leaves them) prices, pools, casinos, trying to find the BEST of the best for us.

We landed on the mirage, not only was it gold and shiny (i dug that) but they had the beatles love all over it, (us both HUGE fans of the beatles) we thought it was a pretty nice hotel. We checked out the pool, loved it, prices, pretty good for a nice sized room, and we paid extra for a view of the strip & the volcano. 

We booked it.

We drove out saturday morning, arrvived in the lovely 110* weather, and drove down the strip to our hotel. Valet was a nightmare. we waited there forever waiting to get our car parked and checked in. And they do free valet, so anyone and their mother can come in and park for free and walk around. i think they should have seperate ones for hotel guests, and another lot for people who dont stay there. it would save everyone esp. the guys running around in that heat. i felt bad for them! 

Finally we check in, the lines were horrible. but understandable for check-in time. the lobby was gorgeous, huge aquarium, and a rain forest, as well as slots, buffets, and a huge REVOLUTION room that was a bar. 

walking to the elevators to go to our room was a joke. you had to follow everyone. i felt like i was in a herd. it was terrible. we get up to our floor. (they put us up on the 16th) and we go to our room. we get inside, and just collapse. 4 hours on the road, an hour for checkin- valet, my bestie and i were wiped out!

So i get up off the bed, and i say "" i gotta see this view. i want to know what we paid for!"" i swing back the curatins, to find vomit ALL OVER the outside of our window. Just streaked from top to bottom, like someone was just drunk and hurled out the window. it was DISGUSTING. we were both just utterly grossed out, and extremely pissed off. We dished big bucks for this room to stare at barf? we think not.

We called the desk. and they apologized, and moves us 10 doors down to a new room. and she said ""the keys should work, we'll switch them now"" So i walk down 10 rooms and try the key. nothing. my bestie walks back down to our old room, calls the front desk AGAIN and they finally send someone up. Meanwhile.. sitting in the hallway 10 doors down from my bestie, we see 2 girls walking up to her. and all i could hear them say ""why is our door open to our room, and who are you?"" THEY ALREADY GAVE OUR ROOM TO SOMEONE ELSE! i was like.. are you kidding me?! so my bestie told them why we moved, and how we just got here and have been sitting in the hall way for 30 minutes no waiting for new keys, and they saw the window, and flipped out. they called the front desk, and they were automatically moved up to the 23rd floor. oh my friend and i were raging pissed.

finally 45 minutes pass of sitting in the hallway ready to pass out, the front desk lady comes up with our new keys. we go in the room, and i B-line it to the window and throw back the curtains. and boom. even more vomit. worse than the last room. you could SEE chunks, mucus and the whole 9. like it literally just happened the night before. I point to it, and look at the front desk clerk, and im like "" REALLY?!""

all she did was apologize and say they have an outside company who cleans the windows, and they would be called (which i knew they wouldnt, and they didnt) and she said room service would be up to try and clean it off ( which no one was called) and my best friend snapped. she never gets mad, and she was furious. she remained calm and told the lady we dished out big money on this room, and now we have to look at barf. 

All the front desk did, was give us a $50 credit towards food. which if you stay in vegas.. you should know that only gets you like.. a bagel and yogurt. so we told her we were extremely un happy with everything, and she apologized again, and went back down to the front desk.

The only downsides were on the technical operations side.  Of 3 door keys I was issued, only 1 worked part time.  My players card which I had re-issued 4 times during my stay worked like a broken clock when inserting in slots or poker machines.  While not the end of the world.  Def annoying.

Mirage is part of the M Life group which runs the loyalty card rating system for their group of hotels.  The comp system is very complicated and stingy.  Loosen your purse strings.   4 days of playing craps a few hours a day and I didn't even get a free lunch?

The other reason I love this hotel is because of the pool. It's spacious, has some shaded areas, and beautifully landscaped. The service is okay poolside, but the menu is good.

I was surprised by the extra Resort Fees, but I guess that's standard in Vegas. We had booked a room with a King bed on Orbitz months ago, but they didn't have that available and weren't wanting to pay even more to upgrade so we ended up with two queens. We ended up on the fifth floor. It was disappointing to have a Horrible view. The rest of our stay was disappointing, as well.

Room service woke us up two out of the three mornings, once by trying the room key over and over even with the Privacy Please sign on the door. The first morning there was a power outage meaning cold showers and no AC in the whole hotel. When we went downstairs to the casino it was really warm. They were passing out bottled water, which was nice.

The people in the room next to us were so incredibly obnoxious. They weren't necessarily fighting, but they were talking so loud we had trouble sleeping. I was woken up by them multiple times. Finally on the third night it went on for about a half hour straight so we called the front desk. At first they said they needed three noise complaints until they could do anything about it, but my boyfriend said that this was the third night it had gone on so they sent security up. That shut them up...for a few minutes.

When we checked out we told them how we felt and they ended up refunding out resort fees. I know the noisy neighbors were not the hotel'\/ fault, but the other stuff was pretty annoying.

Don't get me wrong, this is not an awful hotel. The pool is wonderful and we didn't have any trouble finding chairs. The staff was all really nice, and we had a great time in the casino. The location was great...it was really close to a lot of other hotels and easy to hop on and off the bus.

Now the hotel is actually a great place to stay! The problem I have with this place is the casino and the lack of comp credits you are given! This mostly applies to table games or when you eat at any of the restaurants within the premises. Somethings I noticed is that when you sit a table and you present your players card the dealer will take your card and hold onto it instead of notifying the Pit Boss of an incoming player. The dealer also doesn't announce when you are changing in a few hundred dollars for chips unlike a lot of other casino's. In my opinion the whole M-Life comp system just seems like one big scam! I realize that all of these comps are scams only to get you to play, but when a company like MGM will purposely single out players who aren't to their standards and someone like myself is only changing a couple of hundred isn't good enough for them to get me comped, then this place can go and kiss my a@*!!! Going forward, I will just play with companies like Boyd Gaming since they are generous with their comps. While some of the rooms may not be as nice, but seriously who goes to Vegas for a room unless you are a whale and get a suite. The purpose of your visit is to gamble, eat at some of the best restaurants, hit the clubs and watch a show if anything.",3,1,3

We stayed on the 23rd floor and also had a good view of the volcano, although we did not see the entire range of it and still recommend actually going outside to see the show up close. 

Pros: 
- Our room was fairly clean.
- TV worked well, and there were more lamps and better lighting around the room than you get at most standard hotel rooms. 
- The in-room safe is a decent size- it can fit multiple tablets and smaller electronics. However, it is too small to fit a laptop like a small Macbook Air. 
- The pool is amazing and probably one of the more interesting pools from the hotels on the strip. There are multiple small waterfalls that go into the pool, and there is also an overhead ""fountain"" that pours water into the pool and is fun to swim under. The pool is also pretty large and irregularly shaped- not a rectangle. This makes it pretty easy to find a nook that isn't too crowded even during the most popular times of the day. 
- The various public restrooms located around the hotel look pretty nice and are clean.
- The Rhumbar had some fantastic cocktails and very friendly bartenders. There is an outdoor section for people who want to listen to loud music, dance, or smoke. There is also a much quieter indoor part of it for people like my boyfriend and me, who aren't into that stuff. We were barely able to hear what went on outside and always had plenty of room to ourselves. Sometimes people smoked in the indoor section as well, but usually the smokers were outside. 
- California Pizza Kitchen has some decent pasta\/pizza options.
- The coffee at the Roasted Bean is excellent! 
- The seafood at Stack is amazing! (And it is actually open past 10PM.) The waiters were super helpful and courteous, and this is definitely a place to check out for an upscale dining experience. 
- The Mirage was probably the only hotel on the strip that didn't have an endless stream of annoying timeshare sales people trying to get my boyfriend and me to talk to them. FYI for any first-time tourists: the people wearing black suits who stand all around hotel lobbies and ask you ""where are you from, are you two married, how long are you in Vegas, etc"" are NOT actual hotel staff- they want to recruit you to sign up for timeshare sales pitches that they claim will be 90 minutes, but will actually be 4-6 hours long. They were all over other hotels, but NOT at the Mirage, which was awesome for us as Mirage guests. 


Cons:
- The cleaning staff came to our room at various times between 11AM and 3PM. It was a bit inconvenient to coordinate when we could go to our room to change to go to the pool\/come back from pool, but still not a huge problem.
- The room's bathroom doesn't have a lock. 
- The water in the pool isn't heated at all and totally depends on how much sunshine there is. 
- Some people smoke cigars in the pool and walk around the pool with non-sealed beverages that can spill very easily. Not a major issue for us, but still might be something some people might want to know about. 
- Most of the hotel restaurants close at 10PM. This is pretty inconvenient, since it's Vegas and  so many people are still just starting their nights then.",5,2,3

We stayed at the Mirage right on the strip, pretty nice hotel.  I had not been to vegas in probably 13 yrs so I remember things a big differently.  I noticed that everything was totally in excess, i guess it wouldn't be vegas if they didn't go over the top and dangle their sacks (of money, duh) on our face just to show us how much money they have floating around in vegas.  I liked the way the mirage was decorated and layed out, everything was pretty straight forward, and if you got lost keep walking in one direction and you'll eventually hit a wall and just move along the wall.  Also, boo on the volcano not working.

Our room was pretty nice and comfy.  I really liked the oversize chair that was in the room, great place to catch monday night football on.  Boo on their no HD service to a HD tv set, nothing I can't stand more than standard def on a HD TV, even if the Tv can only do 720p.

The buffet was my biggest disappointment.  I wanted to do some damage there, since I lost all my money at the casino.  I realized though that is pretty tough to do some damage at a casino that charges 20 bux for the buffet.  Nothing really special, just your standard food stations, kind of boring.  Next time I'm going to check out the other casino's buffets, but i'll probably stay at the Mirage because of it's central location on the strip.",0,0,0

The Mirage in my books is about as standard as you get for a hotel on the strip.  The hotel draws a variety of different people of all ages.  The hotel has undergone many renovations, so you shouldn't experience the transitional phase.

The rooms have a bit of a cabana feel, so it really has that tropical feel.

The pool at the hotel is pretty nice and has a tropical feel to it.  However, there are now some better pools on the strip.

Checking in was pretty effortless, plus we got a $65 voucher towards food and drinks. Our voucher went towards the strong, alcoholic drinks, which were a little pricey, so the voucher was much greatly appreciated. :)

Our room was very nice, great view of the pool and the strip, and had great little touches, like an iHome dock, plenty of outlets, and an actual hairdryer -- not like the wimpy ones you usually get stuck using. Cleaning staff did a great job, too. The casino is easy to navigate, unlike a few others in Vegas. The pool is great, but you need to get up and out there early to save seats because it fills up fast. 

The city itself is expensive, so if you've been there before you're already signed up for that, if its your first time, plan accordingly...or just hope for the best at the slots. Taxis cost a small fortune depending on where you're going, but thankfully The Mirage is located on an intersection,with a traffic light, so you can get in and out quickly. At other hotels, without the lights, your fare can get to $5-10 just waiting to get on to Las Vegas Blvd.

As for the night life at Mirage, its actually pretty pretty good. Ink Bar was always packed, Rhumbar has great outdoor seating, and the bar right off the casino was really convenient and had stiff drinks. If you want to save some money on booze, there's a Walgreens across the street so stock up there for drinks before going out. 

Also, if you're looking to take in a Vegasie show, The Mirage is home to the Beatles\/Cirque LOVE show. Personally, I'm not a die hard fan of either, but this show is phenomenal. I was totally blown away by it and would recommend anyone check it out if you're interested. Absolutely worth it.",4,1,1

I had a room block of about 30 rooms for my company, and the Group Housing department for the hotel was the most unorganized and unhelpful staff I have encountered during all of our events this year.  For starters, they couldn't seperate our sub-blocks out, which is a problem I've never encountered with any other hotel. This made it incredibly difficult to find the egregious errors that they had made when I sent over my final staff list.  The person I worked with in Group Housing had left ""placeholders"" on the final reservation list, when I had told her that the staff list and reservation lists should look identical. They didn't set up a master bill, which I had requested weeks in advance; and didn't find out wasn't done until my staff began to arrive and check in. 

To top it all off, I went over to the Mirage (I was staying at The Venetian), to file a complaint with a manager, and the front desk told me that there was no one, other than the front desk manager that I could speak to.  They were most unhelpful and didn't have any additional manager contacts that they could realease. Or so I was told.

The Mirage has a little bit of everything - they have restaurants, shopping, entertainment, a casino, pool, bars, convention halls, and hotel rooms. It's almost like being at a resort! I came here for work, so unfortunately I didn't get to have a lot of fun and enjoy the pool, swim with the dolphins, or enjoy a show. I'm also not a gambler so this isn't a review to read if you're looking to see if their casino is awesome. But I did get to explore just about everything else!

Hotel: The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Every person I ran into said hello. I was surprised at the line at the font desk when we walked in, but they moved it quickly. They were also able to hold our luggage when we checked out (we had a late flight out). The hotel itself is very pretty and clean on the inside - there are signs everywhere telling you where everything is at, they also have a map. There are waterfalls when you first walk in, and it kind of smells like coconut. That smell got old after a while.

My room had a nice view and was very clean. I wouldn't say it was the best room I've ever stayed in (the Wifi didn't work well, they don't have a lot of TV channels, and my bathroom light kept flickering). But, it was nice for how long I was there. 

Restaurants\/Bars: There's a pretty decent variety in restaurants. We barely left the hotel since we were there for a convention, so we mostly ate here. There was enough of a variety that we didn't get sick of anything and were able to try something new every day. Some places are a little more upscale than others - I wouldn't say any of them are cheap.  There's a few bars inside that get crowded at night. They have Rhumbar which is an outdoor lounge - that was fun too.

Shopping: There is a little bit of shopping within the Mirage. I would say it is mostly upscale shopping. It's nothing like Caesar's - I wouldn't call it a mall by any means. There are just a few stores.

Convention Halls: A little out-of date and out of the way of everything else. They were also confusing to get around in - there aren't many signs telling you where other rooms are at, and the rooms are not marked well. It served its purpose.

Overall, I think this is a good hotel and a fun place to stay. If I came back I would probably try to explore another hotel, but that's just because I don't like seeing the same thing twice. I would also come back and enjoy some of the entertainment here!",5,1,2

Thank you for providing me with comfy shelter for three nights this past weekend.  The fact that you comp'd my room on Thursday and only charged me a measly $55 dollars a night for Friday and Saturday will have me coming back for more visits at your fine, classy establishment.

When we arrived at 12:30 in the morning after our 2 1\/2 hour flight delay, we were greeted by a friendly face at the check-in counter and they were able to accommodate our simple request of having my room be right next to my friends.

Our rooms were situated on the 4th floor with a direct view of the Strip.  My room was very clean, cozy and newly renovated.  The king size bed was calling for me, so I listened and happily obliged.  I sank in the comfort of it all and enjoyed catching up on world events on CNN on the nice, big plasma TV as I tried falling asleep at 4:00 in the morning each night I was there...

I love going to Vegas and this was my first time staying at the Mirage.  Staying here is great because it's centrally located near all the hot spots I like to check out when I'm in town:  Fashion Show Mall (one block up), Venetian & Palazzo (across the street), Cesar's (next door) and everything else is a quick cab ride away that won't dip too much into your play money.

Trust me, I'm no baller, so looking for great deals is something I spend time in researching when I travel.  I forgot I signed up for the free Players Club card years ago, so when I called two weeks beforehand to inquire about room rates, I had to ask twice if $55\/night was the correct rate for Friday & Saturday.  Sure enough, it was!

If you're planning a trip to Vegas, I'd recommend the Mirage.  It's a big resort, but not overwhelming where it'd take forever just to walk from the entrance to the guest elevators to your room (which I don't care for at the other monstrous hotels on the Strip).  I liked how I was able to walk to most of my destinations, it helped me burn off the grub I feasted on.  I wasn't able to check out any of their shows, but I'd love to watch the Cirque du Soleil Love show the next time I'm in town.

We all know the economy is still in a downward slump, but Vegas is doing what they can to attract tourism (which was obviously low based on the emptiness of the casino floors we ventured out to).  Rooms here average about $150\/night on travel websites, so the dirt-cheap rate I got was awesome.  They also have a Starbucks on the ground floor, so that helped me get a jump start on my day (even though my normal tall cup of java cost me $3 bucks instead of the usual $1.60 back home; it's all good since we gotta loosen up the purse strings sometimes!).

Thanks again for the wonderful accommodations Mr. Mirage, I hope to come back soon!

Love,

We got there around 11AM on a Thursday and went to go check in (although it technically wasn't until 3PM) and they were able to give us keys to a room right away. If we wanted a room on a higher floor or with a strip view we had to wait another 3 hours to see if anything opened up. We decided to pass on that and just headed straight to the room.

The King Deluxe room was extremely spacious and has awesome beds, very comfortable and the headboard has a cushion so that was nice for leaning back on while watching tv on the flat screen. The bathroom had a good amount of light for getting ready and the shower head was of good quality, a little bit of lighter pressure than I'm use to but nothing to complain about. You could hear the occasional group of people walking through the halls from the room but the casino noise was non-existent. 

The casino floor was where a lot of our time was spent. My boyfriend and I aren't much of gamblers so we spent more time checking out the nightlife features (restaurants, clubs, bars). They have a California Pizza Kitchen which was awesome and BLT Burger restaurant that was mediocre. 

The Beatles Revolution Lounge we didn't get to see when it ""opened"" because the guy at the door said there was no one in there and people didn't start showing up until 2 or 3 hours later. King Ink which is a tattoo shop and bar has staff passing out wristbands on the strip for reduced entry into their place but when you call their employees act as if your lying about the reduced entry  wristband and say they have no idea what you're talking about and that it's full price entry no exceptions. Rhumbar has good prices on drinks however their servers are ridiculously slow. Jet was nice to check out but wasn't anything impressive or special.

Bare pool was closed and we learned  was only seasonally opened so that was a little bit of a bummer. We also got to check out the Cardio Center which is right next to Bliss (a frozen yogurt place) and on a Friday afternoon there was only 1 other hotel guest in there which made picking your equipment easy.  

Overall The Mirage is an awesome hotel to stay at since everything is up to date and is located right in the center of the Las Vegas strip. Totally recommend staying here for anybody!",1,0,0

Located on a great spot on the Strip, the Mirage is a wonderful oasis! 
We stayed here for three days, and had an excellent time. 
The hotel has a nice pool, with plenty of deck chairs and a waterfall that is a welcome bit of cooling from the Vegas heat. 
The staff was nice, and brought was a bible in the middle of the night, and put up with our general shenanigans. 
Currently, The Mirage has a bit of a Beatles theme, with the Beatles act headlining their Vegas show.  
The hotel has plenty of dining and drinking options. They offer Cravings, their all-you-can-eat Vegas buffet, a decent place to eat. The Carnegie Deli serves heaping sandwiches, in an authentic-feeling NY atmosphere. 
The place offers an expansive casino. The lowest table minimums I saw was $10, with a lot of the tables going up to $25 minimums. They do have a European style roulette table, but I think we missed that. 
For such a nice hotel, you'd think that they'd splurge a bit on the toilet paper. Nope. We got single-ply stuff that was scratchy as sand paper. 
I knew that the mini-bar would be expensive, but $18 for a club soda!? Yeowza. 
There's a bit of shops near the rear of the hotel, but they were all pretty expensive, and didn't really carry the items I needed.",8,4,8

Here's the rub they stopped it for all except the villas and VIP's. The rest get bag cold food,  boxed coffee, wood utensils. Gone for us low life's ( by the way I am an MLIFE member Platinum) are the kind room service people. No linen, no warm food served to you. Oh and they won't bring up water to you in the bags they bring. You have to buy bottle water or not get anything.  No glass cups or ice. 
The plates are made of a hard plastic which will never disintegrate so to save money it's best to ruin the environment more. 
I am so sad this was one of the reasons we come to Vegas so much. I like being pampered. I like feeling fancy. 
We choose to come to the Mirage so we wouldn't have to suffer with the way Mandalay Bay and the Delano had changed the way they treated the ""Guests"". They are also using bag food. 
We heard MGM is going to start charging for parking. Because the investors need a better bottom line. At what cost MGM? Service to your guests. 
I could go to any cheap ass hotel to get this kind of service. 
I hope enough people complain we have to stop this or we will be bring our own food and cleaning our own rooms. 
What about all the people losing there jobs? MGM room service people who have been so kind to us all these years or Valets that have treated guests like they were special. Yes they all got tips but I don't mind tipping for great service. They let go of hundreds for the bottom line. 
I called Bellagio they still do room service (for now) we don't want to give up our Platinum status just yet. So we will go there next time. We wanted to move but no rooms were available. We are staying another day here at the Mirage. The name Mirage is ironic as it is a Mirage now it really isn't here anymore. We are in a penthouse suite I can imagine how badly the disrespect is for other folks in less expensive rooms. Which makes me sad. 
We will not be staying in Mandalay Bay, Delano, Monte Carlo or the Mirage until they change there policies. If they do. Many will follow suite I am sure. I spoke to other people in the elevators,  restrooms dining rooms. They all feel the same. I will keep talking to others here encouraging then to complain as I am now in my room here. I know one person can't make a difference but many can. 
The people that work here are embarrassed of the policy's of the company they work for. I have heard I'm so sorry by so many employees here. No matter how MGM try's to spin it you can't shine a turd.  They are all kind hard working people trying to do there jobs. I am sorry I have to hurt them by not coming back. I am not related to any workers here if you this this is why I wrote this. I am just pissed that my Vegas experience have been ruined by greedy corporations.

At 3:30 in the morning the Mirage gave someone our room key. They attempted to enter our room but the slide lock was on. The guests felt horrible and were very apologetic. The Mirage really wasn't. ""It happens, not all the time, but it happens"" was their response. 
Then when we returned to our room our key didn't work. Their response to that was, ""Just call security, they'll let you in.""

I attend a lot of Trade Shows throughout the year and a few of them are held at the Mirage.  I have a bittersweet feeling about those shows as the Mirage is both a good and bad spot for them.  Here's why:

PROS
- The meeting rooms are in great condition.

- The ventilation is just right.  The temperature is appropriate for the large crowds....whether it's AC in the Summer or Heating in the Winter, they get it right.

- The banquet and meeting staff is always professional, both in terms of appearance and manners.

-  The layout of the meeting rooms allows for good foot traffic flow between rooms.

CONS
- Parking here is a mess.  The Self Parking Garage can get full very quickly and the parking spaces are tight.  Valet is a nightmare....you can count on at least a 45 minute wait for large conventions if you Valet.

- Distance from parking to meeting rooms.....it is a very long walk from the Parking Garage to the meeting rooms.  Valet is not much closer.  It can make for a very long day, especially when you're walking around the Trade Show floor all day.

- Restaurant options are far from the meeting rooms.  Yes, there is a coffee shop nearby that sells sandwiches, but that line can get really long during large shows......your only option is to venture out into the casino floor and the restaurants are scattered throughout the property.  There aren't any good quick eats option there.

Overall, it's a good experience....not great.

Will I return?  Only because I have to.",3,2,2

Here are the pluses:
- The room looked nice, with up-to-date decor. 
- The staff was very friendly and helpful.
- The location is of course convenient to most of what you'd want to do on the Strip.
- The breakfast buffet is pretty good for the price. It's basically limited to traditional breakfast items, but it's less than $20, which is a good deal for the Strip.

And the minuses:
- The bed (king) was totally concave on one half - completely worn out. Luckily I was by myself and could use the other half. 
- The room smelled musty. I didn't see any water stains, so I'm not sure what the cause was.
- I was kept up by loud bass from 11PM-2AM on Sunday night. I'm assuming this was coming from the Mirage's club, since the volume didn't change as it would if it had been from a car passing by. And I was on the 4th floor!
- The cable TV cut out for about an hour at one point.
- The clock radio hadn't reset for daylight savings time. This required a visit from maintenance, since you need a screwdriver to adjust the time.

Basically the rooms are relatively reasonably priced compared to larger resorts on the Strip. There were no major problems, but the above items were annoyances you shouldn't encounter at the more expensive properties. I wouldn't rush back here for a stay unless the price was substantially lower than nearby resorts.",0,0,0

Still others are brand spankin' new and the most expensive places on the strip (Encore, Vdara).  

By contrast, The Mirage remains in the top tier of places to stay on the strip without being quite as pricey as the newest casinos.  The rooms are modern and sexy; the casino floor is fun and lively.  The restaurants, while pricey (there's a saying that in Vegas the meter is always running) didn't disappoint.  Also, the resident show -- Cirque du Soleil's Love -- is a blast and I recommend it (my friends and I were seated quite high and we still loved it.)  Hell, I even enjoyed the dolphin habitat.

The hotel and casino are beautiful and fairly easy to navigate (which is saying something for Vegas which has famously confusing casino floors). We had an excellent experience with the front desk staff - Luis was extremely professional and helpful for us in securing our room upgrade. Our room was amazing and the housekeeping staff did a great job. 

There is a lot to do on site at the Mirage. The Mirage volcano (which underwent a $25 million upgrade I believe) was brand new to us on this trip - the past times we had been it was under construction. Definitely do not miss this! The pool at the Mirage was awesome although nothing too different from most resort pools I have been to. The Paradise Cafe (located by the pool) had great service and food. 

It's not advertised but the Sigfried and Roy Tiger Habitat offers a $3 per ticket discount to Mirage hotel guests if you show your room key. We gladly took advantage of this and enjoyed seeing all the animals. 

The Beatles Revolution lounge (located just off the casino) has a really cool ambiance and atmosphere, but $9 for a Heineken bottle is a bit excessive. We loved the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil gift shop - sadly we could not get tickets for the show, so we spent a good amount of money in the gift shop buying souvenirs instead.

One downside to staying at the Mirage is the $20\/day resort fee and additional tax that is charged not only on the room but the resort fee as well. To their credit, they are up front about the resort fee - it was NOT hidden, we were well aware of its existence before we booked our room.",2,0,1

However, if you are a hotel guest, you can show your room key to get in for free too. So if you plan a Vegas getaway, look into the Mirage, worth the stay!",1,0,0

Our most recent Mirage overnights: Room 25-115 in December 2012, Room 11-126 in February 2013. Clean, very nicely appointed rooms, always enjoy delicious dinner buffets with friends. On both of these visits, we encountered problems at check in, i.e., discrepancies with the Mirage Email Offer reserved which included 2 buffets per day. On February overnight stay, it was remedied only after insisting to speak to a manager, Drew, who was extremely pleasant and indicated it was a computer glitch. 

The overall atmosphere in the Casino and bars is lively and fun for all ages. The younger couple we were with in February were very pleased with their Mirage slot winnings. Temperature in the Casino was unpleasantly warm for us personally, but understandably hard to regulate with unseasonably cold temps. It was the same elsewhere as we discovered when visiting nearby Casinos. The Mirage and Aria continue to be our favorite Vegas Strip Hotels, but Mirage gets our nod for best location.",0,0,0

For a busy casino, the check in and check out process was a breeze and the front desk staff was very friendly. When I got to the room, I have to say that I was impressed. It had 2 nice queen beds, a nice desk are for work, and about a 40 inch flat screen TV mounted on the wall. The room also had a nice little wet bar with plenty of drinks (they charge fairly high for this) and plenty of drawer space if staying for an extended period. 

The bathroom was nice and clean with the only drawback being that the sink, shower, and toilet were in the same room. I prefer the toilet and shower being in a different room than the sink as one person can be in the shower and the other person can be at the sink and still have some privacy. 

The bed here was comfortable. A bit soft for my tastes, but after a long night of partying, you just kind of melt right in when you go to sleep. Plenty of pillows and room service does a decent job in keeping the place clean. We also got a roll-away and have to say it was one of the nicer roll-away I've seen, but they do charge about $30 a night for it. Also on a side note, they do charge you $1 a phone call for all local calls. 

I also spent some time in the pool area and have to say that I had a good relaxing time there. The pool itself is pretty big with what I will say 4 areas you can wonder too including 1 large waterfall area that you can walk under and a ""rock"" area that the water drips down on. If you're looking for slides or wake machines, sorry, they don't have them here. For food and beverage there are plenty of waitresses bringing you drinks and the pool area has its' own Cafe and Full Service Bar. There are a ton of chairs, VIP cabanas, and chairs you can rent, but the place gets packed by 10:00AM, my best advice is if you plan on spending the day at the pool, make sure you reserve your spot first thing in the morning. 

On average spent about $175 night. Service and hotel was good and we had a good time crashing here. Would definitely stay again if the price was right and would give the Mirage a 4 Star rating.",1,0,0

Rooms - Top notch. Tastefully done. I haven't stayed in them since they've been remodeled. 

Casino - Very nice. Never feels crowded. All limits available. 

Poker Room - The original room for the high limit action. Way before the WPT brought millions of idiots into the poker rooms the Mirage was the place to play. At any given night you'd see Doyle, Chip, Puggy, or Howard playing in the high limit section. Since their sister property the Bellagio opened the high limit action has gone there. The staff and dealers at the Mirage are still some of the best in my opinion. They managed to survive the opening of the Bellagio, and with the WPT poker room the idiots migrated back into the room at great numbers again. The dealers were patient explaining the rules to all the new ""pro's"" and everything is good. 

Pool - One of the nicest in Vegas in my opinion. Very tastefully done.

The Shows - The Mirage always has some of the best shows. I saw Sigfied and Roy there. Unfortunately I missed Danny Gans when he was there, and his recent passing is sad news to many people. Catch a show there, you won't be dissappointed.

Location - Absolutely the best location to stay at. I mean access to everything from the Mirage is 5 or 10 minutes walk away. Fashion Square Mall and Forum Shops for the Women in your life. You can walk accross the street to the Venetian. If you need a cheap dive to play at you can walk accross the street to Casino Royale accross the street.

The resort fee was too high in my opinion, but I have never had to pay a resort fee before so it could have been right. Wireless internet is included with the fee which is good, but they forgot to tell me that is was very, very slow and would be near impossible to use.

It's just as entertaining and friendly as any pool party that's being advertised, plus no cover! AND they have plenty of space for large parties. 

There really is a lot more to say about this hotel, but if it isn't already obvious, I think it's worth your stay!",1,0,0

And choosing the Mirage to spend four glorious nights in was the right choice. From booking six months in advance, to check in, to check out and everything in between, I was constantly happy with the service of the hotel, the quality of the accommodations, and the overall experience. 

We snagged one of their 24-hour sales early last year for an October 2010 booking, and ended up paying less than $90 a night. 

The rooms are classy, very modern, very clean, and spacious. 

We were on the 12th floor with a Volcano view room, and were able to catch the backside of the Volcano show whenever we were in our room in between doing the Vegas thing.

My Mirage highlights include: Watching and rooting on my San Francisco Giants to win game one of the 2010 World Series in the Mirage Sports Bar, much grubbing on California Pizza Kitchen, and riding the same $100 on the roulette table for an entire hour!

We reached Vegas late the night of December 6th and found that we got a double bed even though we had asked for a king during reservation. A quick call to the Mlife counter and we were whisked away to another room with a king bed and a great view of the strip on one of the higher floors.
Gambling was fun at the Mirage and we spent almost 90 percent of our gambling time there. The dealers were friendly and people at the table were fun. This was our first time staying so far up north on the strip and we really liked it. Usually, we stay at Mandalay Bay which is on the southern tip of the strip or at the Aria, which is more centrally located.
We always make it a point to go BLT Burger regardless of where we stay on the strip and we have never been disappointed. This time was no exception either. Their burgers are awesome and I love their Knight Rider shake.

We tried out Stack for dinner one night and it was not bad at all. The ambiance is good and the food was pretty decent.

Oh, and the best part, Mlife comped off our entire stay when we checked out (except for my wife's spa bill), which was very nice of them. Probably their way of compensating us for all our gambling losses for the trip! :)",1,1,1

Let me begin by saying they really make every effort to have you walk through their casino to get to the elevators.  After the inconsiderate 15 mile obstacle to get to our room, the first thing my husband noticed was the queen size bed, although he reserved a king size room...eh, oh well.  I thought the room itself was actually decent looking.  The furnishings were not too bad despite the fluorescent orange decorative pillow which looked like it had been chewed on by a dog.


After an enjoyable Saturday night in Vegas, I awoke very early Sunday morning to noise and lots of it.  Doors shutting, housekeeping carts trotting down the hallway, and you can actually hear the guests in the next room, but the ultimate offender was the housekeeper who walked right into our room!


I called the front desk and complained to the manager, Mario.  He explained there was an error between systems and they presumed our room was empty.  He then tried to compensate by offering my husband and me breakfast.  I'm sure to him it seemed like a nice gesture, but to us it felt like a slap in the face!  ""Oops, we saw you exposed so here are some pancakes!  We hope you feel better!""  We refused his offer and tried to go about our day.


Along our way home I called The Mirage to complain once again.  This time I spoke with another manager who was even more incompetent than the previous manager.  Not only was she RUDE, but she demonstrated deplorable lack of management and customer service!  The Mirage needs to seriously rethink who they hire as ""managers.""  I couldn't help but shake my head and feel insulted by this woman's attitude and remarks.


Still feeling insulted by the rude manager and bothered by the housekeeper walking in on me, I called The Mirage once again Monday morning.  This time I spoke with Mike, another ""manager"" who seemed to express remorse and offered a voucher for a free nights stay during our next visit...or so I thought.  It has been 2 days and I have yet to receive my voucher via email as promised.  Not that it matters anyways because that was the first AND THE VERY LAST time I visit The Mirage!

I expect toilet paper, soap, a shower with a functional drain and a working iron when I check into a room at a strip resort. I didn't get that this time at the Mirage. Not only did the iron leak brown fluid all over my shirt, the ironing board was all bent up as if it had been in a fight.

Anyone can have a bad day so I called housekeeping and was assured someone would be right up to make things right. Six hours later I still had no toilet paper, no soap, a clogged drain, a leaking iron and wobbly ironing board. Riding the elevator down to the casino just to use the restrooms is not fun.

""I'm sorry we didn't meet your expectations"" isn't enough. Apologies from management are like youknowwhats; everyone has one. Why bother thanking me for bringing the issues to your attention? I shouldn't be doing your job. No discount for my troubles? No upgrade? See ya!

The two bedroom tower suite was comfortable for five people with extra space to have other people stay. The suite came with plenty of large flat-screen TVs, a bar, large seating area for up to 7-8 people, dining table for four and iPod docks. 

The hotel has tons of kid-friendly activities, including the exploding volcano, which is good to watch to stay warm while waiting for valet, and the dolphin habitat.

As for dining options, there is a big range, from the Carnegie Delicatessen to celebrity chef Laurent Tourondel's BLT Burger, and also James Beard Award Winning Chef Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak. I would recommended reservations for any restaurant in the property. It's easy and you don't have to wait for a table. 

There are a few cons to the Mirage. Check-in can be slow unless you are invited to the Mlife check-in counter (mostly gold, platinum and noir Mlife members). Needless to say, make sure to factor time to check-in. Also, as with few other hotels, the elevators for the suites are not near the check-in area, rather you have to trek through part of the casino, definitely not attractive while carrying luggage so it's best to have baggage assistance. 

The bottom line, the Mirage is an 
elder statesman among the Strip's mega resorts. It relies less on thematics and a booze-fueled party scene for its appeal, opting instead to emphasize comfortable, well-designed rooms, an enormous pool, diverse dining options, and attentive service. Attractions, from a giant volcano to Cirque du Soleil's ""Love"" to a wildlife sanctuary, are aimed at a multigenerational clientele. Best part is that the Mirage is central location to the strip.",0,0,0

We put the items we removed on top of the fridge in plain view so housekeeping could see that we didn't consume them and charge us for it. The items we took out were the things that didn't require refrigeration - mostly the hard liquor. (How ironic is that? We thought we were showing consideration to the hotel as we didn't want to spoil anything refrigerated). When we were ready to check out we put all the items back unused.

When we did the express checkout we saw that we were charged for everything we took out of the fridge. Apparently there's a sensor inside that records everything you remove and charges it to your room right away. So even if you take something out to read the label if you're only considering purchasing it - guess what? - you just bought it.

We ended up having to check out the old-fashioned way via the desk clerk so we could explain that we didn't consume anything from the fridge. She wouldn't give our money back so we escalated our concern to a manager. This manager was rude, abrupt, uncaring, unempathetic and just plain insufferable. He condescendingly explained that there is a sign in the room that says the fridge is not for personal use. (Previous reviews have mentioned this manager too or at least somebody who fits that description. Maybe they're all that way)?

If there is a sign, we didn't see it. All I saw around that fridge was a price list for the items inside. The desk clerk should tell people at check in to not store personal items inside. If there is a sign it is obviously an elusive, small print piece of paper tucked away somewhere out of sight.

They agreed to not charge us for the items we took out but they still charged us a $50 ""restocking"" fee. Restocking? WE DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING!!!!!! They didn't even have to put the things back in - we did it ourselves. Is the Mirage really that desperate for cash? At least the panhandlers in Vegas's seedier neighbourhoods don't stick their hands in my pockets and take money out.

My sister-in-law and her husband were staying in another room while we were here and the fridge in their room was locked. This inconsistency between rooms alone should have negated them from charging us $50.

It is bad enough that this happened but the rude and condescending behavior of the manager was inexcusable and unprofessional. I am not a spoiled, self-entitled tourist that wants to be catered to and pampered. It takes a lot to make me say that I will never stay at a certain hotel again. But guess what? I'm never staying here again and that includes other MGM Resorts International properties.

The Mirage obviously just considers you a number as opposed to a valued guest. They are not committed to providing a valuable customer experience that could make you want to come back. In a way it makes sense as this was the first Vegas hotel to be built by Wall Street with junk bonds. It doesn't get much more impersonal than that does it?

This is an example of a major corporate chain bullying their paying customers because ""they can."" The positive take away from this is that there is nowhere to go but up from here. It can never be this bad again.

If anything I said has resonated with any Yelpers, please share this review on your favourite social media platform. Word must get out about this petty sort of corporate thievery.

* Update - The Mirage's damage control person has posted a comment to my review below. Notice there's no attempt to reach out and make things right nor is there any comment regarding the unacceptable behavior of the manager we spoke with. This implies that the hotel condones that sort of conduct. There was no offer made to verify if there was a sign displayed in our particular room. It's simply a defensive statement regarding their policy of punishing people who fail to go over the fine print with a magnifying glass. Lori, you were not in this room and you don't know where (or if) there was a sign posted. Thanks for towing the company line and continuing to make the Mirage look like the bottom-feeding, penny-pinching scammers they are.",23,20,6

You have to break your car on a hill in order to grab a ticket (pretty scary). We stayed one night, our room was decent. The pillows were so worn out, I did expect a very stuffed pillow considering Mirage is 5 star hotel they definitely need to upgrade their pillow because it's not comfortable for our neck, I had to use 3 pillow because they were so low on cotton. 
Thank you The Mirage for teaching us this very important lesson on sensor SNACK BAR I never knew sensor snack bar existed. We got a little carry away and took the drinks out and touched the snacks, I think I had over 10 drinks placed out on the table. We didn't open. 
My brother live in vegas and told us about the sensor snacks bar. We got so worried because we touched and also used their fridge for our own bottle drinks. I called their front desk explaining what happen and we didn't open any drinks. She told me it was $350 charged on my account but she will void if i put everything back. The next day I did self check out on the tv and noticed no charges I thought the problem was solved turns out it wasn't. I checked my credit card transaction and noticed $295 charges on Mirage. Why this happen??? Was the housekeeper stole the snacks and charge us. Aren't they suppose to check the snack bar obviously they didn't do their job. When I called to ask why $295 charge on my card the person that took my call got annoyed and hang up. The second time I called everything was resolved.
Their sensor snack bar is a scam because what if the employee who clean the room ate the snacks or more vile because you left the room dirty. Btw we left the room very clean. The charge made to my account was the next day we already checked out.",1,0,0

Clean rooms.
Won over $200 playing slot machines. ^_^
Lots of restaurants, bars, lounges, shows, things to do within the hotel itself.

Cons:
Guest Elevators are a FAR walk from the check-in counter.  Even FARTHER from self-parking.  Having to wheel your luggage through the lobby and then the entire casino, on carpet, is NOT FUN.  

I stayed here on two occasions.  First time was in a suite and the room was simply amazing.  Second time I stayed in a deluxe room.  The room itself was fine, however the BIGGEST CON with this room (located on the 12th floor) was the NOISE.  You could hear every little freaking thing in the hall, which I assume means anyone passing by could hear every little thing coming from the room.  It's not so bad during the day, but having obnoxious drunk kids screaming and yelling as they walk down the halls sucks.  I think that is enough for me to never stay in this type of room again.  I don't remember the suites having this problem.  There was also a HUGE gap under the door, which also probably contributed to this problem.  If I had not stayed prior to my current stay, I probably wouldn't come back.

Hell, I still probably won't come back because the suites are not cheap.
4 stars for the suites and things to do within the hotel.

You should have seen the look on the cleaning ladies face when she opened the door to our room. She looked like she had died! (We tipped her NICELY though).

The decor is is  really nice because you feel like you are in a little zoo. Even though the whole time I was here, I was in our suite I really enjoyed this place. I wish it had a food court like the Venetian did, but since it's in the middle of the strip, food is conveniently close by.

After visiting vegas a few times, I finally decided to try out The Mirage. For the most part everything was GREAT! Checked-in with a girl behind the desk. Her name was Ashley. SUPER SWEET GIRL!! She took off our resort fee of $56 for choosing to stay at the hotel. I had asked for a room with a view when I booked this hotel and got what I asked for. Room service is great!! (overpriced but you expect that in every hotel). The staff were very prompt and friendly. LOVE the hotel's atmosphere. The pool is a good size and there is a lot of room to spread out with your group. Food and drink service around the pool as well. VERY CLEAN considering all the drunk people everywhere with their beer bottles and whatnot.

 I only really have two complaints about the hotel.
1. ROOMS- The rooms aren't as big as the pictures perceived them to be. The air conditioner was also in an awkward spot in the room, which left most of the room very warm. I wasn't expecting anything HUGE in terms of size, but I was expecting a little more space to move around. The bathroom was also a little on the small side. My biggest problem with the room was the door. IT ONLY HAD A DEAD BOLT. Most doors that I'm aware of have both a door lock and dead bolt lock. I think if they took the time to update the rooms, this hotel would be outstanding.

2. RUDE GIRL WORKING AT REVOLUTION- I didn't get her name, but she had what most girls would call a ""constant bitch face"". Didn't spend anytime in revolution but had asked her for directions, I was very unimpressed with her bitchy attitude, I reported her at check-out. SORRY YOU HATE YOUR JOB SO MUCH HONEY

My room had a lovely view of the parking structure and was at the end of the very long hallway, it was a trek to just get to the elevator from the room.  The went to the  revolution bar where i paid a pretty penny for a Jameson on the rocks but it was cheaper then losing all my playing video poker just to get a ""free drink""

With the exception of the front desk and valet staff, no.  

The updated room was nice.  It was clean.  The bed was very, very comfy and the linens were good.  Maybe I just can't get past the lack of floor-to-ceiling windows.  Maybe I like a separate tub.  Maybe the attempt at a retro-but-new style is not my brand of vodka.  Maybe I am a picky bitch, which is the most likely explanation.



The pools are beautful.  More crowded than most, wall-to-wall lounge chairs and kids all over the damn place.  Not even close to relaxing.  Never again.



Having said all that, the front desk staff WAS exceptional and accomodating.  But even that can't hold a candle to Julie the valet.  She addressed us by name the second day of our stay.  Yes, we tip well.  But imagine how many people are in and out of the Mirage in a 24 hour period.  IMAGINE.  And the smiling, friendly valet called us by name.  As we exited the car, so no ticket to refer to.  It was a rental car, nothing that would stand out.  Astonishing.  She impressed me more than ANYTHING ELSE at the Mirage.  



The location is GREAT.  And, you know, it's THE MIRAGE.  So it deserves our respect for still being beautiful and cool.  The volcano is great. The music in the casino is very good.  It's well kept.  I can't find any real fault here that isn't based on my own taste and maybe-too-high standards.  So, stay, if you get a deal.  It's clean, for sure.  It does the job.



So, the takeaway:  I still have a warm fuzzy place in my heart for the Mirage because I have won big here on occasions that stick in my mind. (See previous reviews of the casino only, if you care)  But I will not stay there again.  Also, it's not like we paid to stay there, or anywhere in LV, so cost is not any sort of a factor.

That arrangement actually worked out since we were starving and wanted to get a bite to eat.  We grabbed a late lunch at Pantry, the resort's 24 hour restaurant, and were able to relax a bit after the flight and cab ride.  It turns out the computers weren't yet fixed (at 330pm) and check-in was being administered via an ancient method:  pen and paper.  I filled out my guest info and the kind girl at the check-in desk was extremely apologetic about the downed computer system, which apparently was affecting all MGM properties that afternoon.  She was very thorough, and after answering all my questions she sent us on our way to the guest elevators.

Amenities of our ROOM included:

*Two Queen beds (which were quite comfortable btw)

*Flat screen television

*Guest room safe

*Desk area with chair

*""Free wifi and internet"" (this service is actually included in the daily resort fee)

*Snacks and drinks for purchase

Our room, which looked to be recently renovated, was kept clean and tidy throughout our stay, and overall very adequate and satisfactory for our short visit in Las Vegas.

We had the opportunity to dine at Pantry, the hotel's 24 hour restaurant, as well as having drinks at Rhumbar and Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak.  Good service at the restaurant and both bars.  Drinks were typical Vegas prices.  

SERVICE:  I'd like to commend the staff that were stationed at various points near the check-in desk, as they were extremely apologetic for the computer snafu, as well as being helpful on what to do, providing forms to fill out, and directing guests to various check-in stations.  As I've already stated, the female staff member that assisted with my check-in was polite, friendly, courteous, and answered all my questions about the hotel (as I was a first-time guest at the property).

Lastly, I found the location of the hotel to be very beneficial as it is centrally located on the Las Vegas strip.  I appreciated the convenience of being able to walk next door to the Forum Shops as well as across the street to the Venetian and Palazzo hotels.  

BOTTOM LINE:  A satisfactory two night stay at the Mirage Hotel.  Polite and helpful customer service as well as the central location are two factors I appreciated for sure.  I would definitely consider a future stay at this hotel.",15,10,11

My review is based on one night that was spent in Villa One in the year 2000.  Yes, this review is 11 years old, but worth the wait.

As you may know, there are a handful of very special villas and another handful of lanais that are reserved as special accommodations for high-rollers and special guests.  They do not advertise these room types on the site, nor do they allow guests to pay for them under most circumstances.  If you have seen 'Vegas Vacation', one of the lanais were used as the high-roller suite provided to Nick Papagorgio.  The villas at the Mirage are said to have paid for the entire construction of the Bellagio!!

So, my friend wanted to throw a big party in Las Vegas, and needed a special space that could accommodate a live band, approximately 30-40 guests, and a full bar with catered food.  The event was set to take place at The Venetian, but they backed out at the last minute after learning about the live band that was set to perform in the room.  So, the race was on and it was up to me to save the day.  Apparently, I was the only one with a Black card.

As I began calling around to find a venue, I was looking out the window of our Venetian suite at The Mirage tower across the way.  Why not call them first?  They are right across the street!  So, I called.  The nice woman who answered decided to transfer me to a casino host named Matt Sacca.  Matt is very cool, and still works as a host in Vegas at Green Valley if I am not mistaken.

Anyway, Matt said he could hook us up with a villa and that our party sounded fun.  After all, it was only one night.  The negotiated room rate was $10,000 plus catering, full bar with wait staff, PA system rental and setup, and miscellaneous taxes and fees.  The room rate ended up being a small portion of the total bill.

I could go on and on about that night.  There is too much to write here as Yelp limits the space.  Suffice it to say, I learned a few things that night.  Some key lessons include:

1.  If you want to spend all of the money you have in Las Vegas without gambling, they have made it very simple for you.  Catered food, bar service, and a private butler can easily set you back $10K+.  A PA system is about $5K a night.  I did not ask about the lion rental.

2.  If skinny dipping occurs in your private pool, the butler will fish out the bathing suits and return them to you in plastic bags the next day.  Don't worry, he wears white gloves.

3.  Nudity, extreme public intoxication, and Rascal scooter wheelie competitions are frowned upon in the casino.  However, the Rascal is a good instrument for earning quick cash.

4.  If you want a return invitation, none of the above will help you.  Spend your money at the casino tables if you want anything comped.

5.  Do something this stupid at least once in your life, given the chance.  Make your friend with the cashola really happy, and spend the airlines miles earned to take a relaxing vacation.  You will need recovery time after the Vegas madness.

I will never forget that night, and that is a good thing because I just realized I completely taped over the video footage taken.  Probably a good thing!  How long is the statute of limitations in Nevada anyway?",3,7,3

This was one of the ones that was fairly new when I moved here in 1991. The Volcano has been a popular free attraction for years- you can actually feel the heat as you drive by on Las Vegas Boulevard and it's even warmer when you're there in person. I've been to the Secret Garden- pretty neat, actually; would recommend it. Price is $15.00. There is an island feel with the registration area against a beautiful aquarium and with the large scale atrium. Years later, the property grounds are still very nice. I still have old pictures of the property from when our friends and family visited from out of town- at the atrium, the statues of Siegfried and Roy. 

As far as amenities, there are two pools- Bare & the Mirage Pool, Kim Vo Salon, the Spa, the Sports Bar, Rhumbar, Jet, Beattles Lounge, BB King's Blues Club, King Ink, fine dining: Japonais, Fin, Stack, Samba Brazilian, Onda, Kokomo's, casual dining: The Roasted Bean, California Pizza Kitchen, Carnegie Deli, BLT Burger, Paradise Cafe, Cravings, & Blizz (fro yo and desserts).

Staff
- Very friendly and informative and ready to help. I appreciated every interaction from the room cleaners, to the security staff, to the concierge and check-in, to the restaurant wait staff.

Rooms
- The bed is sooo comfy! After a hard day of pleasure, the average Vegas visitor can rejuvenate well, and even sleep through play time! 
- Being a big fresh air fan, I am so thrilled that the windows actually open to let in plenty of air! Every room has central air too, if you are into that sort of thing. 
- Three AV sockets for the split heads of left, right stereo sound, and Video, in case you want to stream from your own device and watch from the big-screen. 
- Watch out for the stocked in-room snack bar. Their trays have weight sensors so if you move them, you bought them for marked-up prices. Same goes for that fridge, in case you were thinking about taking out their snacks and storing your leftovers.

Amenities
- The pool is huge, with waterfall, heated to a comfortable temperature, not heavily chlorinated. However, it is only open from 9AM to 6PM.
- The jacuzzi is nicely nestled under shady trees and is very large too, with strong jets. Again, only open from 9AM to 6PM.
- The volcano show is over-the-top! Fire, rumbles, percussive orchestration, lights, smoldering vapors, fountains of water. 

Food options
- The full cuisine and price range and more across the street. I particularly liked the the split-pea barley soup at CPK at the Lobby level.

Location
Centralized on The Strip. Good!

Appearance
My only critique is that the interior design is a bit dated. I think they could improve on immersing the visitor into a more specific and consistent fantastical vision. It's not clear what identity they are going for, as compared to their themed hotel\/casino counterparts on The Strip. I suppose it could be a jungle and safari theme if they wanted to aim for that, in line with their trademark volcano. The theater and conference room area looks more like a hesitant Roman style. The elevator area seems contemporary minimal, as do the hotel room halls. The name, The Mirage, suggests something you'd see in a desert, which would look more like an oasis rather than anything so lush as the tropics, volcanoes, and islands. Miragers, if you could work on that, then you got the five stars!",0,0,1

We stayed at the Mirage because my wife was attending a business conference at the hotel. We decided to make it a small family vacation at the same time. The plan was that I would entertain the little ones while my wife was attending her conference - but the Mirage staff seemed dead set on making sure that that did not happen!

First, we requested that my name be added to the account so that I could charge to the room. Never happened! We also left a credit card on file for charges - but in front of dozens of guests the buffet cashier refused to charge to the room since we were showing as cash only. After a very lengthy delay while the cashier called the front desk - while a line formed behind us and people began to look at us as if we were unable to pay for a meal - we were put on the line with a front desk manager who supposedly fixed the problems so that we could charge to the room and I specifically could as well. While this was going on, my wife simply asked the cashier if we could just use our credit card to pay she rudely dismissed my wife and  continued to discuss the ""problem"" with the front desk. While my wife was on the phone with the front desk manager, some other customers waiting began to complain about the wait, to which the cashier replied, ""I am sorry, but this is not my problem, this is THEIR problem."" referring to us.

After this nightmare passed, we hoped we could have a enjoyable stay - again, the Mirage had other plans.

On the next day, our room keys ceased to work. Luckily, our eldest son was in the room and was able to let us in. I put off going back down to the front desk until the next morning. When I did go down, they refused to renew the keys because my name was no where on the account - despite the fact we had been told TWICE already that this had been corrected! The Mirage's resolution? Pull my wife out of her conference to authorize renewal of the keys!! If she could not contact them or come to the front desk, then me and my kids would not be able to leave the room because we could not get back in. Or at least, it would totally be up to security whether or not they wanted to let us in.

Additionally, in a interesting twist of logic, the front desk told me that if security let me in and saw that my children and personal items were in the room, the front desk would not even take security's word that I was authorized access to the room!

Honestly, the Mirage is the poster child for all that's gone wrong with Las Vegas over the past few years. We've been coming almost annually for conferences and seen the slow, sad drop in customer service and overall quality - at least at the MGM Resorts of which we were once loyal customers.  I don't think that's the case anymore!",0,2,0

Time to implode this thing and build a real resort.  It is over 25 years old, with shoddy maintenance at best.  

We travel to Vegas regularly at least 3 times per year.  This is the worst hotel ever we have stayed at.  For the same price, head to a real resort.  Afterall they do charge the $33 per day resort fee, for what I have no clue, as this place is not a resort by any stretch.",1,1,0

Where to start with this comedy? 
1- We had 2 for 1 buffet deal when we made the reservation but upon checking in they would not honor their own promo code which WAS valid. 
2- When we got to our room we discovered it already had been rented to a baby cockroach who was happily napping on one of the pillows. The bed sheets had holes! On that day I was suffering from a pulled knee ligament and could not walk long distances. My wife called the manager who asked us to move to another room on another floor all the while stating that our existing key will work for that room!! Should have known better because me and my bum knee found out the hard way that it would not open the door to the room she asked us to move to. Meanwhile my wife had to go to the lobby to see the manager to straighten things out.
The last insult was the in-room refrigerator. It has a sensor that tells it if you had the nerve to place a beverage or food item of your own in it and therefore it is going to charge you for that facility. Yes, you read this right.

First the good: The renovated rooms are very nice. Flat screen TV's plus all kinds of ports for computers, video games, and an Ipod dock. Lots of granite , very comfortable chairs, all around a tasteful, comfortable room.  Also the air-conditioning was quiet and very cool. The only complaints about the room were the cheap plastic toilet seat that wouldn't fucking stay up when I was urinating, and the shower\/tub combo seemed claustrophobic and I couldn't help but get the entire floor wet when bathing. 

The buffet was also very good, and laid out well, no bottlenecks of people standing holding their plates impatiently waiting for food (hear me Paris?) The asian items were my favorite along with huge cold crab legs. Japonais restaurant was excellent. Though expensive, the service was amazing and every single item was yummy.  

I did have good luck in the casino on the slots, despite Mirage's reputation for having a tight casino.  I played ALIEN slots and won like $150 in a matter of seconds when I hit a bonus round and blew the alien out of the airlock.  I screamed out loud I was so happy.  I never ever win anything. That made my fucking day!!

Now for what was bad:  Caribe Cafe--this place sucked big steaming brown loafs! The service was atrocious, the menu very limited and expensive, and the food was dog shit. All big strip casino's have a diner\/coffee shop usually open 24hrs, but this place was awful in every way, even the coffee sucked!  Downscale, older places i have stayed at such the Imperial Palace, or Tropicana had better  coffee shops.  

There also seemed to be a lot of small technical problems which were frequent.  The card keys were stubborn and had to be inserted repeatedly EVERY SINGLE TIME I entered the room.  When I contacted the front desk they talked down to me like i had in IQ of ten.  Scripted, condescending answers and questions--""Did you insert the card right? Make sure the strip is facing this way, etc. etc"" I also had problems with my MGM-Mirage players card having to get a new card TWICE within a four day visit. Each time the ignorant, inept employee gave me a totally different (wrong) explanation on why my card kept malfunctioning.  I hate it when places of business refuse to honestly answer questions and give scripted or made up bullshit answers.  The final demonstration of incompetence was on my final day in Vegas when I had a slot machine voucher I wanted to cash in.  The computers were down and it was impossible to cash in the voucher, even by going to a live teller instead of a machine.  Thankfully the voucher was only for $7.67 but still...

The only time the hotel incompetence worked in my favor was the mini bar in the room.  Me and my friends had some of the tiny liquor bottles in the mini bar and should have been been charged approximately $36.  Well, it's been over a month and no charge on my card!  Woohoo! I shoulda drank more;)

So, would I stay at the Mirage again? Probably not. Despite the reasonable rate of $77 a night and the nicely updated room and excellent location, there was just too much spotty service and general hotel incompetence to make me wanna risk it.",1,2,0

We were here the first  week of August - it was packed busy, so it took a lot longer at the valet each time we needed our car.  Typical wait was anywhere from 20-30 minutes at the front.

It is a large resort in itself - so prepare for a long walk through the casino to get back to the rooms.  That's ok because the casino is fantastic!  I echo the reviews about MLife cards - sign up right away - its good in other hotels as well and those points add up fast - leading to loads of freebies.  

Rooms were comfy and well decorated.  Not cheesy.  We were in a deluxe Queen - great views, feather pillows, they do that sheet-wrapped down filler thing now instead of a smelly comforter.  Lighting in the room is poor but contemporary - but we didn't hang out there - just slept there most of the time anyway.

We saw both the Beatles Love show and Terry Fator.  Both were a HUGE hit with the family (all adults, but the shows can work for the kiddos, with a few explanations to the Fator show).  I want to see LOVE again.  

Dined at the buffet (getting there between breakfast and lunch let us have the option of both meals) and the Brazillian experience at Samba.  Delicious!  My only meh moment there was all of the meat selections were heavier with just one chicken selection and no fish options... they served flank steak, sirloin, lamb, pork, sausage, and chicken.  Sides were amazing though.  One dinner was a set menu option at Kokomos - I wasn't impressed with the filet -or any of the meal-until the dessert.  Small, but loved the berries and cream.  Tasted some chocolate goodness my hubby ordered - very rich. 

We gambled on their machines mostly this trip.  Won big on the 25cent 7s!  Going home a winner always makes for great reviews...",0,0,0

During this past stay, the service was sparse and not so capable or friendly.

(To think of it, some of them might have been... this is Vegas after all!) The private pool was somewhat redeeming, but too much of a ""scene"" for everyday people. 

The worst part of my stay was a computer glitch, which kept charging us a different room rate than the one we had obtained.  We had to fix this three times.  At checkout, the glitch had added two nights to our stay as well.  What?! All was taken care of, but imagine if we had not been diligent in checking out!

My friend and I were there at 3:00pm (official check in time) and we were told that NO rooms were ready except for one that was a smoking room with no view.  I hate smoking rooms so that wasn't even an option for me.  I booked this room really cheap at $39.00 per night...and I think that they just advertise those prices and once you get there those rooms don't exist or you need to wait THREE additional hours for it to be cleaned.  I think NOT!!!  I just drove 5 hours to get here...I am not waiting three more hours for a 10 minute clean job plus I had tickets to the Love show for that evening and I wanted to get ready and relax before the show.

But of course for $20.00 more a night you can ""upgrade"" your room and have a view of the strip.  I was really unhappy about being backed into a coroner like that but I was tired so I did it.  But I still feel that they ripped me off.  And of course it was the VERY LAST room at the end of the hallway...which I told her I didn't want but she gave it to me anyways!  Other than that the hotel is well maintained.  The rooms are decent...the bed was really nice and comfortable...and I did have a nice view of the strip.  

The location of this hotel is great and probably the best thing about it.  They also have some nice restaurants to choose from, a free Volcano show and the Dolphin\/Tiger habitat.

No apologies, no willingness to check into it. Just a blunt no, insincere apology and acted as though 'please move along so we can check in the next customer.' We have come to expect a little higher level of customer service and kindness. Been staying here for over 25 years - as a kid with family and now as an adult with my wifey.  we  have stayed at other nicer, newer, swanky hotels on the strip. Another disappointment this trip is lack of cocktail waitresses in the casino. They are few and far between.  Also, we find the casino to be extremely smokey. Lower ceilings I'm sure account for this. The pool is very nice, lush landscape and large pool.  The reason for my three star review this trip also is the 5 AM wake up call from a very loud gurgling shower drain. Never heard anything like this before. Perhaps it's just the age of the structure showing it's age.  Not happy with the $25 poolside cocktails either, but even I have to admit that it was the best piña colada I may have ever had.

Menu came three hours later. By that point I had already looked up menu online.  Parking service should have been perfect considering I was paying $20 a day in addition to the stiff resort fee. Car always showed up after about 20 mins of waiting in extreme HEAT. Also, pool service was a JOKE! Waitress never came to take orders. One time she showed up and never brought my drink back! The one good service was the bell man who came to drop off my luggage and pick it up (same individual) was AMAZING!!! Currently trying to get his name to send him thank you card. I will never stay there again. So disappointed. I have been going to Vegas since I was a kid, I remember when this hotel opened. I could not wait to someday be able to afford to stay here on a WEEKEND! Should have stayed at my normal place. To make things worse this was for a 40th birthday celebration! Disappointing!!",0,0,0

Mirage's location cannot be beat--right in the middle of all the Strip action.
The casino seemed a little underwhelming but I won $30 at penny slots so I can't complain (I'm not a huge gambler).
I flew in later in the evening so my husband had checked us in, so I can't speak to the ease of check-in, but the lobby and all common areas of the resort are very well-appointed and well maintained. I really like the tropical oasis feeling and the kids we saw visiting sure seemed to as well.
The pool was gorgeous and well manicured, although I found the chairs were a bit too close together. The pool itself was chilly but it was welcome on a hot May day.
The rooms--very nice decor and clean. There is an iPod dock, a weird large chair\/small loveseat that seems to fit 1.5 people, and plenty of storage. Very comfortable bed. We had a nice strip view that we enjoyed, and were not close to the volcano, so we didn't have any issues with noise. The windows actually open, which is nice to let in some fresh air, but ended up being a pain when it got windy.
The closet was in the bathroom, which I found a bit inconvenient, but we made it work. The bathroom was probably my least favorite part of the stay. Only one sink, which made it tough to get ready quickly, and not a whole lot of counter space. The tub was standard sized, but the shower curtain seemed to be set up weird because it was impossible to not drench the entire bathroom when using the shower. The shower water pressure left much to be desired but I don't expect much from massive hotels.
I really enjoyed the variety of restaurants at the hotel, and even took in a LA Kings playoff game at the Sports Book and met some nice other fans who shared their free drinks from betting with us. The crowd at Mirage seems to be a little older than the party\/club crowd at some of the more happening resorts, but was still a mix of active nightlife type guests and older, relaxing-vacation\/gambling guests, with some families mixed in. Something for everyone!
Given the right price, I would stay at Mirage again. Just bring fewer toiletries!",0,0,0

ROOM SERVICE:

Some of our travel partners ordered middle-of-the-night room service every night! Ourselves, we just did it once, for a breakfast.

Mr. Rosie S. and I ordered the following:

- 1 seasonal fruit plate to share: $19
 (it ended up being a HUGE portion we couldn't finish between us with apples, pears, watermelon, canteloupe and honeydew in lovely thin slices, red and green grapes, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries.

- 1 banana to share (it didn't come on the fruit plate): $2

- For him: order of an english muffin with butter and jam: $5 
(came toasted with hand-rolled butter, and little glass jars of orange marmalade, lemon preserves, blueberry jam and strawberry jam - they were VERY DELICIOUS!)

- For him: order of grilled bacon: $7
(he said it tasted chemically so he didn't end up eating it)

- For me: sesame seed bagel & cream cheese: $7
(it came toasted with the cream cheese on a separate plate)

All arrived in about 35-40 minutes, hot and smelling divine. They included tiny bottles of ketchup as well.

Total came to $49.73 - that's pretty expensive for breakfast, but I went down to the hotel convenience store to get our water and juice to go with, so we saved there (sort of).

It was pampering at its best! Who gets breakfast delivered on a table with a white tablecloth? LOVES IT!

OUR FAVOURITE HOTEL RESTAURANTS:
- B. B. King's Blues Club (now closed) for dinner, late night and live music! LOVED the hushpuppies here!
- Carnegie Deli (late night and breakfast)
- CPK - California Pizza Kitchen. Our first time trying! Had it again in the airport on our way home we liked it so much
- Blizz Frozen Yogurt Bar

POOL:
- Will review separately, but know it is TOTALLY worth booking here if pool is on your priority list!

SHOWS:
- Cirque du Soleil's LOVE - one of the top three live performances I have seen in my life... and that comes from a theatre person.

ATMOSPHERE:
- All Beatles, all the time!",3,0,1

So when my wife got a room there for work, I thought it was going to be a bad experience. Since she decided to take me and my son too, my expectations were not that high. Once we got there, I found my expectations to be totally incorrect. 

The hotel was beautiful. When you walk in there's a mini rain forest and it's a surprise. We went to get our room with a dilemma. We needed a fridge because my wife was pumping breast milk. We explained it to the front desk person and she said that they would provide it to us for free. For free! We thanked them for their help and was taken to our room. Once I saw the room, I was blown away. It was modern and very posh yet comfortable. After being in the room for 5 minutes, our mini fridge came up. prompt and fast! We had a great view and we were so tired that my son and I passed out for 2 hours while my wife left for work. The bed was incredibly comfortable and everything in it was great.

I've been to Vegas many times in between, but hadnt really focused on the hotel interior, or just hadn't passed by this hotel at all since.

The earthy, oasis feel it has is great. Even with all the new contemporary hotels sprawling up left and right, this one still has that old-school charm and history, while still looking clean.

I come to Vegas frequently, and decided to switch it up and stay at the Mirage. (My hotel of choice is usually the Venetian, Bellagio, Signature, or Trump.) I will never ever ever stay at this hotel again or would not recommend it to anybody.

I am all about the pool area when I stay in these places, I like the music, good beds and great drinks. All these were spot on. The waterfalls, the views and the pool itself was just lovely. I felt like I was in some kind of tropical paradise especially as it wasn't too busy. I drank mimosas by the pool, which I also have to say was excellent service. Checking into the hotel was a warm welcome and the lobby area was impressive to say the least. My overall stay and experience in the casino itself, was great!

Now, the reason I rate this place a 4 and not a 5, is because there were a few issues. 

They should call me the hotel inspector!

Firstly, when we checked into the hotel at 5 pm that Thursday, I was keen to go straight to the Rhumbar for a cocktail after the 5 hour drive from LA. We were pointed in the right direction and headed towards the bar with excitement, even before checking out our room, we were keen to see this cool place we had read about online. The outside seating was full, this must have been due to the happy hour, so we asked to be placed on the list. The server said our wait would most likely be an hour, and he sent us to the Bare Pool Bar which was in fact a topless pool bar. This was fine, but he forgot to mention to us, that the bar had already closed. So we walked all over the place trying to find the Bare Bar, when it was already closed. We were basically sent on a wild goose chase which should have been a grey goose chase if you ask me.  We turned around and then headed back to the Rhumbar again. We were finally seated with 5 minutes left on happy hour. Unfortunately, you don't get a happy hour if you order or sit outside at the Rhumbar. You have to go inside, which wasn't for me after sitting in a car all day long. I was a little disappointed by the Rhumbar, which was a shame as I had looked forward to it for weeks beforehand.

My second issue and I believe my husbands also. The cleaning of our room was always late in the day. So we would go to the pool or pop out for breakfast and the room would still be uncleaned, unmade bed and no fresh towels. One of the days, we didn't get the cleaning service in our room until 5 pm, when this was the time we needed fresh towels and to get ready for a night out on the town.

We asked for extra towels, as they were not very generous with these. 2 Large towels and 2 hand towels is not enough, especially when you need to wash your hair!

We even left a letter and tip for the cleaning staff to leave us extra towels, that day, they left us face towels instead of hand towels. I was shocked.

I don't think our room was vacuumed the entire stay but these are all small issues that I believe can be improved.

The actual decor, casino, buffet and pool were all fantastic. 

One more thing, perhaps the staff could be a little more friendlier towards MLife customers instead of shooting you down before they even realize what tier you actually are.",1,0,0

Made reservations way ahead of time and got a great deal for 3 nights at 425 including tax.  This weekend didnt see as busy as I thought labor day weekend would be. But I would have to say that this hotel is pretty awesome. The rooms were pretty spacious for two couples to stay in. The beds were comfy, the bathroom was a bit small, but overall a good place stay. We tried BLT Burger, Carnegie Deli and Rhumbar. They were all good choices. Having a Starbucks inside was also very convenient, when we needed that pick me up. 

The pool area was awesome! Pretty packed so you have to go early to try to get a chair, but we were lucky that an older couple gave us their seats after we walked around the whole pool area. I dig the water fall, dunking your head underneath that is like those massage shower heads X 10!  Too bad we didnt get to check out JET on Sunday, supposedly Fabulous was performing.

When I first arrived with my girlfriend we decided to grab a drink and play some video poker. I ordered a draft bud light and she ordered a vodka tonic. The bartender served us our drinks and said ""that will be $29."" I have never paid for a drink while playing video poker before much less $29. I had a burger at one of their restaurants that was about $20 and was very average. I had a burger later on during my vacation at Gordon Ramsey's BurGR restaurant. That burger was $16 and was delicious. What angered me the the most however was when I ordered two frozen drinks at their pool bar. It was $57! I live in Chicago and don't even pay these prices at downtown bars. It's highway robbery. They also don't have fridges in the room. You can rent one though for $25 a day.

Though, the beds are really comfortable.  The pool here is one of the best in Vegas.  It does get pretty crowded though so it's best to come early if you want a lounge chair. Haven't been to Bare yet so can't comment on that.  

And, as others have pointed out, the location is great!  Quick walk to Caesars, TI, Venetian\/Palazzo and right across from the ever so fun to play at Casino Royale!  Cosmo and Wynn\/Encore are just a quick cab ride away too. The buffet here is decent, nothing to rave about. Rhumbar is a good place to hang out for a while- have some good cocktails and a cigar.  BLT Burger, not so much though, there are better places to enjoy a burger from.  I don't spend too much time playing table games here but they're usually lively and at $10 minimums. The sports book is great to catch a game too. I always consider staying here when I come on a budget because of the pools and most of the strip action is on this side, so if that's what you're looking for, consider it as well. - deserves a 3.5",2,0,0

Check In was easy and seamless. The front desk agent was friendly and knowledgeable. He gave us a run down of the hotel and inquired about our plans. He then gave us tips. 

To get to the elevators you need to walk through the casino. We were shocked that the casino didn't smell of horrible cigarette smoke like most casinos. There was a faint smell of it, but nothing overpowering. The decoration in the lobby casino area is very in line with The Mirage jungle\/tropical theme. 

Our room was on the 22nd floor with an AMAZING view. My husband works in the hotel industry and he found a myriad of things wrong with the room. To sum all of what he said up goes like this..."" This is decorated like a red roof inn room."" Having said that I as a regular guest thought the room was decent. There is nothing fabulous about it and the in room showering amenities are ok. 

We ordered room service once, they said it would take 45 minutes but it was there way before that. It was a pleasant surprise. 

The big thing about this hotel is that there is TONS to do in the hotel and it is really walking distance to anything on the strip. If you are looking for a convenient and ok priced hotel that gives you the flexibility and proximity to many things than this is it. If you are looking to be in a luxurious over the top room then you should look elsewhere.",0,1,0

In the end it never cease to amaze me with the clean and modernized rooms, variety of restaurants and nightlife. 

I stayed here for 3 nights and Caitlyn checked me in and was very friendly and professional with handling my room request and even found me a high floor with a view of the Mirage volcano.

My room 19043 was very clean, beds included pillow top mattresses and pillows and felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. My flat screen TV was great to have during these modern times when other hotels still have the 90's tube TV.  The bathroom with the tub and shower combo was a plus because I'm not really into a shower and tub side by side and the lighting in the vanity was a nice touch. 

What I also liked about the room was the abundance of drawers below the flat screen, near the bedside and next to the bathroom to store all your personal stuff. Near the entrance to the door they have a full size mirror and a  mirror above the drawer and on the closet door.

The MLife rewards desk was always great to help with any questions but I had a horrible experience from a VIP representative. When it was my turn, I walked up to him to ask a question about a point play and he just rolled his eyes on me and said, ""All you have to do was follow directions and read this Mlife brochure to help you with those directions"". He felt annoyed that I asked him a simple question and treated me like another number. That's a big No No! I understand some people have bad days or hate their lives but is no reason to take it out on the guest. =l

The pool was nice to look at and just relax during November but it was too cold take a dip with the cold breeze blowing on you. I tried the Siegfried and Roy Garden and that was a great experience and hotel guests get a $4 discount off general admission. Mirage feels like my 2nd home since I've stayed there many times and I've gotten use to eating at some of restaurants regularly and it shows on Yelp. =P

I will always come back to the Mirage because they always send me great deals and it's in a great location. It's right across from the Venetian and Forum shops at Caesar's Palace and just north is the Fashion Show Mall and Wynn \/ Encore.",8,4,7

Not to mention a safari in the back by the pools as well.  The adult pool is more of a party pool and is topless.  So if your not into that kind of thing I would not go there.

1) Great location. About a 10-15 minute walk to the Sands Convention Center, Walgreens, the Palazzo\/Venetian, etc

2) Clean rooms. I had three clean towels, a tidy bathroom, and the non-smoker room was truly a non-smoker room (which can be hard to come by in Vegas!) 

3) Awesome gym. They have - no joke - 15-20 treadmills and ellipticals, plus bikes, weights, and so on. I didn't have to wait for a machine at 7 AM or 6 PM either. This is different than Treasure Island, which has about 4 cardio machines total. 

4) Cute ambiance. I'm not a huge fan of the 'jungle' theme, but it was nice to see plants and vegetation after being in casino land all day. 

What I thought could have been better was the check-in - it was honestly a good 20minutes in line to get room keys. I'm also knocking off a star because for slightly higher rates, I think you can get much better quality and splash at other places on the Strip.

I come here for the poker room which has decent cash games and ongoing $70, $115, and $175 sit-and-go tables (sit-and-go means 10 people at a table, everyone starts w\/ same # of chips, in this one, first gets 70%, second 30% of the total pot).  These tables are a boon to anyone who plays a lot of Internet poker tourneys.  The downside is the chip allotment & blind structure all but guarantees the first 10 hands end up with several all-in confrontations.  This adds more luck to the equation which is good or bad depending on your skill level.

Sorry Mirage but you have left a bad taste in my mouth and my first impression of this hotel is bad. Even after the check in time, you shouldn't make guests wait no longer then an hour for their room to be ready.  

I normally stay at the Venetian\/Palazzo which offers excellent customer service and  never had to wait for my room to be ""ready"". In fact, of the 10+ years of my numerous Vegas visits to other hotels had I had to wait so long for a room. 

Edit: after much complaining to the front desk. they finally offered another room after two and a half hours later. Their excuse? Our room was still getting cleaned and they are going to give us another room that they were holding for one of their VIP guests. 

It was disappointing because this was my birthday weekend for my big 30! My party and I wanted to watch the Boys to Men concert, but by the time we finally got to our room we were exhausted and missed it! 

After speaking to about 5 different different people at the front desk, it was clear to see that they need to train some of their staff better with customer service. One of them was extremely rude to my sister, an Asian guy with a shaved head. I wish I took his name down. He was an ass to us.

Early check-in was readily available. I asked the girl at the front desk if the room had a fridge aside from the mini bar and she told me she could get one up to my room at no additional cost. It was to my satisfaction and I gave her a tip for being so accommodating. The staff is extremely friendly and the property itself has a very refreshing vibe.

We got to our room and it had a contemporary design and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was a bit small, but still nice. There were USB ports and high speed connections ready to use. A big plus, we had several electronic devices during the time. 

This is my third time staying at the Mirage, 2005, 2006, and 2009 were the times I have stayed at this property and they have given all their rooms a great upgrade. I can appreciate this.

Now here's one thing that bugged me a little bit. My buddies and I went down to the swimming pool and there were no chairs available. In the past when I have stayed at the Mirage property, they have had cabana boys who walked around trying to get chairs together and make some room for the late arrivals at the pool. This year, I didn't see anything of the sort. Just extra cocktail waitresses and that was it. So we ended just laying a towel out in front of the pool, but we had a good spot so it didn't bother us much. The cocktail waitress who served us, Camille was very pleasant. Great Mojitos! Give them a try.

Now for the gambling. Their dealers seem to be very friendly and I was up the first couple of days I'd say about 300 bucks on roulette but I went down about 400 the next couple of days. Had a lot of fun, but losing kinda sucked, oh well. If you're looking for a property with high ceilings and a brighter, more contemporary feel to it, I would recommend a different casino because Mirage is somewhat dark and has lower ceilings in the table area. But a lot of that stuff is not important to me. The dealers are the most important aspect in gambling for me so the environment doesn't really phase me.

The Mirage has several different places to eat, a couple different clubs (Although not my favorite clubs, Jet sucks) and is a very well-rounded property. It's not as extravagant as some of the new properties, but it's nicer than a lot of the older properties and continues to stay up to date because of the surrounding competition. I would definitely recommend staying at the Mirage to any first time Las Vegas visitor. I have stayed at this property three times now and have been satisfied every time. Great place to get your feet wet for your first time Vegas experience, but I find myself coming back to the Mirage more often than other properties. And you just can't beat the location.

I had stayed at the Mirage in April with my mom and had a great experience-- no issues, quiet and clean room-- no problems.

I stayed at the Mirage with my boyfriend on June 4th and June 5th. We redeemed free rooms from our MyVegas account, and the night under my account was the 4th and his was the 5th. They charged us separate security deposits for each night. My boyfriend was refunded his immediately; I am still trying to get my $100, 10 days later. 

I have called the Mirage on the 7th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th, trying to get my deposit back. I was given the run-around by different people each time I spoke to someone. First I was told that it takes a week to get my money back. When over a week had passed, I called again and was told that the reason I didn't get my money back yet and my boyfriend had was because different banks take different amounts of time to refund money. We have the SAME back and the SAME type of account so I knew this was not the case. When I explained this to them, they said well just wait and you should get it back. I called back the next day and was told to call back tomorrow to speak to the head cashier, who had already gone home for the day. I called back this morning and FINALLY got ahold of the head cashier who said ""We already released the money back to you. Your bank won't give it to you for some reason."" I was like, ""That doesn't make any sense. I was told to talk to you because you are the person who authorizes charges to banks."" She said, ""Well I do, but I'm not doing that for you. You need to call the bank yourself."" Thanks a lot! 

Anyway, I called my bank and was told that the Mirage NEVER issued me my $100 back, so the bitch I spoke to today was clearly lying to me. I had to open a dispute with my bank for a $100 that the Mirage is apparently refusing to give back to me.

The stay itself was disappointing as well. EVERY DAY we were woken up by screaming neighbors and the maids yelling in Spanish at each other down the halls. When you are out until 3am, do you really wanna hear people yelling in the hallways at 8am-- ESPECIALLY the people who work there?! What a joke! 

I would seriously caution against staying here. There are so many great places to stay on the strip that there's no reason to waste your trip here. It wasn't even worth it for the free room for all the headaches these idiots have given me. You would think that a hotel that has been around forever would understand how to refund an incorrect charge but apparently not! Stay at the Aria. Everyone was so nice and courteous and we got our security deposit back the next day. I will definitely not be returning to the Mirage ever.

UPDATE: After being on the phone for nearly two hours, we cleared this up.

We ordered room service twice and while the price is high (of course, it is room service), the portions were large and the food tasty. The walls in the rooms are a little thin, which is okay if the person in the next room is taking a shower but not okay at 1am when the drunk girl in the hall is yelling for her friends. 

You can tell the hotel is a bit older but you can't beat the location and the price. I didn't have much luck in the casino, but I hardly believe that was the fault of the Mirage.

The volcano show is pretty impressive. There are a lot of fire effects and water effects involved. I think it lasts for about 10 minutes - the show is pretty long compared to a lot of the other free shows on the Strip.

The rooms: Decent size, full length mirror (always a necessity for a ladies weekend), quiet bathroom, COMFY beds, and good views no matter what room you're in - either strip view or pool view. Big TV with lots of choices.

The pools: The pool is easily the BEST thing about staying at the Mirage. Get there early, because EVERYONE wants to spend time at this beautiful pool. The waterfalls are gorgeous and make for great pictures, there is a LOT of sun with not much blocking from the building or trees, and the bar by the pool has a great variety of frozen alcoholic beverages for somewhat reasonable Vegas prices. 

They also have the adult pool - BARE - aka, let your boobies get some sun. Pretty young and attractive crowd, much better music playing and definitely a wild atmosphere. We got in for free, but I definitely wouldn't pay $10 to get in here as a lady to have all the boys see my tatas. This was definitely crowded, so actual swimming wasn't an option, just standing in the pool with all the beautiful tan, drunk people.

The property: Lots to do here. Good variety of restaurants. We ate at BLT Burger (see my yelp review for that establishment), a coffee café that had good breakfast options and Starbucks. There is also STACK - a great steakhouse that I've had the pleasure of eating at before. Good variety of quality, price and food options to choose from. 

We also enjoyed the Siegfried and Roy Secret Garden, which was where they keep all of their adorable lil dolphin friends and white tiger kitty cat friends. Tip - if you're staying here make sure to tell them and show your room key, you'll get a 5 dollar discount on admission. Lots of cute animals and great picture opportunities, plus nice to have something additional to do close by during the day when your head hurts from the night before. 

JET is also here - great nightclub, fun environment. No line or cover fee for us so WIN. 

I've seen LOVE here by Cirque - great show and a fun Beatles themed lounge right outside. Great picture opps right outside the theater on the rainbow road!

Overall, I highly recommend the Mirage! Location was great - right in the middle of the strip. I give it four stars only because it's a bit older, so it doesn't have the swanky, high class décor of places like Encore, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan.",6,1,3

The pool there is AWESOME! It's breath-takingly beautiful and I just feel relaxed looking at it.  Tonight my pal was telling me about the wonderful food she had at Japonaise.  Got to go back to get some of that!

I will tell you why I liked the Mirage... We stayed in a Suite at the Luxor on the weekend and switched over here on the weekdays.  OMG! The Luxor Suites is CRAP! A RIP OFF! I was in disbelief at how much we paid for such a horridly ugly room that lacked a good AC unit.  The room was tiny and dim unlike the Mirage.  I stayed at the Venetian before the Luxor.  It seriously was falling from grace! I would rather stay at a cheap motel then spend 3x to 4x as much on a lame suite.

The Mirage was a blessing after the Luxor.  I loved the room's decor.  It was clean and refreshing.  I can't stop raving about them.  Sure it's no Venetian, but for the price... HECK YAH! I will take it any day for the price I got.  

Only thing I have to say that sucked was they are still under construction and every morning we would hear them drilling.  Of course it woke us up early, so big minus! But other than that... great! ^_^",1,1,0

We were a rowdy large group and didnt experience any issues with that. The Hospitality suite worked very well for our needs and they were really accommodating getting all our rooms on the same floor.

I dropped a star from my preemptive review because I wasn't impressed with the value or some of the service however. We booked 3 rooms and a suite and I know its a mid-level hotel...you'd think the customer service would be high for that kind of spending but I really felt like the concierge was rude over simple inquiries and that having to call for housekeeping twice was unexpected.The ice machine broke, there was hardware falling off the walls in our master bedroom, the upkeep wasnt great, the 20$ resort fee per room per night was a rip off,  I was also annoyed to find them offering free show tickets and the like on facebook but we were never offered anything of the sort despite our four night stay with several rooms. 

There was also a fiasco with the payment. I sent in a credit card authorization form ahead of time to have them charge our rooms in full before arrival.This was so they wouldn't put holds on that card during my stay.  They didn't process the card before I arrived. Upon check in I provided the same card again, explaining that the form was already completed and my concern that the card would be charged twice or the amounts due would be held twice...they assured me it wouldn't.But, of course It was. They processed the form AND then held the same amounts again on the card. Then the card was flagged for fraud as banks do. It didnt really put me in a jam but? they need better communication between departments. 

We do this trip every year and I dont think I will be booking with them. BUT we WILL go to BARE pool again for sure and the restaurants ( except the Deli, horrible service) were good. We really enjoyed BLT burger and the buffet.",3,3,3

Anyway the lady with attitude said they are out of 2 bed rooms! And this is what it is and you don't have a choice! She also said they don't have non smoking rooms available anymore, so we had to choice but to go with a smoking room, I ask for an extra bed at no charge as they were not able to provide the room reserved and she wouldn't give us and sh said she can not provide that, after about half an hour discussing and no her trying to convince me that she is HELPING me by providing 2 KING bed rooms at SMOKING SMELLY level, I asked to talk to her manager he came and provided the king bed rooms also added an extra single bed at no charge.
-Then we came upstairs, the hallway and rooms are really smelly, we all are non smokers and it's impossible to tolerate the smell, we asked the housekeeping to come and bring their air freshening machine to our room, they came but it still smells bad.

OTOH, there was much construction going on at a fabulously leisurely pace, so I was treated to the sight of 200 feet of glass fragments and mechanical guts where the moving sidewalk was for the whole time I was there.  That and randomly awful smells inside and outside, and a broken volcano.  

As a kicker, the room I had was really, really ordinary.  Like: Holiday Inn ordinary.

Let me just start out by saying the first time was way better than this time. We came with a big group, and pretty much all stayed on the same floor. 

This weekend we stayed on the 17th floor in a resort standard room. The first time we came we stayed in the tower rooms....big difference! The tower rooms were a lot nicer, and have a bigger bathroom.The standard room looked a little worn down. The bathroom was smaller and the room didn't look as upgraded. 

The front desk was very accommodating with our room. The guy at the mobile check-in went above and beyond to try to get me connecting rooms on a specific floor. The only downside was that I couldn't check in early, which was kind of a bummer. We requested housekeeping early in the morning because we were going to get ready for a wedding that afternoon and needed the rooms cleaned early. We left to get breakfast and walk around a little. By 12:45, my room was cleaned and beds were made.

The pool is beautiful, and crowded! Get there early if you want a prime location. The pool doesn't allow you to bring in outside food or drink, which to me seems a little ridiculous. Regardless, I brought in my bag of hot cheetos and water. No one said anything to me once inside.

What did we like?  First of all, the pool area was very nice. A lot of space in the water, busy chairs around the pool but that is to be expected. The hot tub by the dolphin bar and was usually wide open. Pool towels were readily available and plenty of places to put them away. The waitstaff was friendly and generally available.

MLife fit our ""like"" category. We were able to gain a lot of points by charging to our room at any of the MGM properties, which also simplified the payment process. Clearing our card with a points card we like to use allowed for a double dip. It worked well for them as well because we tended to stick to those properties.

The room -- from the size to the view and the efficiency of the elevators, this was a win all around. Our king bed room had extra space, a decent closet, and a lot of drawer space. Good size bathroom and shower as well. I stayed at the Grand a while back and the room was tiny in comparison. We had a nice view looking south at the pool and the strip, and the shape of the hotel likely affords nice views to the majority of rooms. The multiple elevator lobbies worked well also -- we rarely needed to wait and only once chose not to use a down elevator due to it being packed when arriving at our floor. 

The things I would tweak?  First off, how about a smoking section around the pool?  I get the Vegas is the one place the vilified smoker can attend and feel like they gain equal treatment, but with a beautiful tropical feel, couldn't we have the smoke symbols come up from one section only?  Let them marinate in their foul smell together while the rest of us marinate in the sun. 

Some of the pricing was tough to stomach. $15 for 16 ounce pool mixed drinks is excessive, but what really caught my eye was a $5 basic coffee in the pantry restaurant that featured breakfast. That seems almost unfair to those that require the black stuff to kickstart their day. 

The location is fairly central in a general sense but a bit separated from the other MLife properties that are nicely grouped further south. 

For the most part, the downsides were just ""part of Vegas"", and not a big deal, but a smoking section at the pool seems doable and common sense.

Bottom line, we'd stay here again no questions asked. I'd just get my coffee elsewhere and use Walgreens or CVS for some of the other drink needs (soda or water).",5,3,1

Rooms were neat and well organized, and we had plenty of complimentary toiletries for the little things we accidentally forgot to pack.

My girl checked us into our room and was given a strip view deluxe room. The lady who was checking us in was totally sweet and offered us water and directed us to where our room was on a map of the hotel. Throughout our stay the maid service employees were extremely accommodating to us when we asked for extra towels, toilet paper, and other items. The only downfall I would say was that we had to call the front desk each day when we wanted our room cleaned and serviced. They forgot about us one day, but immediately fixed the problem when we called about it. 

Overall, I would stay in this hotel again. Yes, there are better hotels on the strip to stay at, but for the price and what we got. I was satisfied.",1,0,1

The tall thin Caucasian man working at valet proceeded to tell me rudely the secret garden is closed already and I told him well I called and she said that the admissions are open at six still until 7 PM.  The valet proceeded to tell me while somebody came the other day and it was 6 PM and it was already closed but with a very rude tone. I told him want to OK I will still try. He did not give me directions either like I asked in the first place. Also the way he was talking to me and made me feel like he didn't even want me to come in the casino at all. So my two-year-old daughter and I went inside and got directions from another employee. Since I had to stop and ask somebody where it was that it took me more time to get back there by the time we got there it was 603 in the last in admissions were at 6 PM sharp. It was a little upsetting but it's OK we went to go eat some frozen yogurt. So he went back to the valet and of course it's the same rude guy and then I was telling the bus help who is right next to him about my experience and he just had his back turned to me and did not once even attempt talk to me. At the at least he could've said I'm sorry that happened to miss ot well at your local right you can come back something. I did not get his name either since his back was turned to me. And when I gave my receipt to get to the girl in the valet window her hair was so long she had covered up her name tag by the way she didn't even say hi to me once. She was actually on the phone the entire time which she seems to be like a personal call. I was just so upset with the whole entire situation. I don't understand this type of customer service. I guess this is why they are in the Mirage and not the Cosmo or any of the other high-end hotels I guess you get what you pay for. It is unfortunate the valet had to be so rude to me I would've gave him a good tip. I don't think I will be back to Moroge for a long time after this treatment. And may just be the valet but it represents the company as a whole. #badforbusiness #iwouldntstayhereifiwasatourist,1,1,0

I had three rooms I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. They should pay for people to stay at this hotel. I feel like I threw my money out at this hotel. 

The valet is horrible and rude.  This was brought to the attention of the management and they could not correct the issues. They have no interest in making it easier for me and want you to wait in line and not call ahead.  Bathroom had mold and smelled in two of the three hotels. 

There are so many choices to stay in Las Vegas and I would suggest any other hotel. The Mirage is not worth the money. I could stay at a 100 dollar a night hotel and would get superior value than what I received.  
They provided some credits but the were insulting and I would have preferred never to have stayed at this hotel and will not stay there again

Then we get in and it reeks of smoke.  Call down to the front desk, but they are sold out of new rooms, so all they do is put a ""purifier"" in and spray some air freshener.  We return a couple hours later and the place still smells like a 60's bowling alley.  I then go down to the front desk and they ask me exactly what I would like them to do....as if it is my problem and not theirs.  All they do is offer to switch rooms for us the following night.

I return the next morning and they say they will text\/call me about getting a new room that night.  No texts, no calls, and no new room.  No surpris at this point.

I return home and send an email to customer service and I get a call back saying they are very sorry and would like to offer a friends and family discount on my next visit.  Like they were not willing to rectify the issue for the weekend ruined, but would love to offer me an opportunity to spend more money at their casino and restaurants.  Yeah, not going to return there.

the pool had a nice oasis set up (very green with a waterfall and little rafts you can rent) but the chlorine tank exploded in the middle of the afternoon, forcing everyone to evacuate.  the unfortunate pool attendees that day were compensated with free entrance to the bellagio and treasure island pools, so i thought the staff handled that debacle pretty well.  the next day, we went to Bare instead of the regular pool, which was a good call and something i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a bit more of a party atmosphere.

heres the deal with the music throughout the premises...  i think that the mirage was built in the 90s and im pretty sure the soundtrack hasnt changed since.  i get the nostalgia \/ ironic value of listening to rod stewart and ""safety dance"" but after a while you feel as though you are in a time warp.  not a good one.  

the rooms are decent, kind of standard for vegas strip rooms, ie ""modern"" decor and cheesy abstract paintings from target or ikea.  on the last night of the trip we upgraded to the penthouse suite which was totally guady and off the hook.  1,600 square feet of gold glitzy decoration and totally useless and showy pieces of furniture, plus a bathroom the size of an average studio apartment.  the cost?  $400, split between 4 people... not bad.",3,0,0

But everything went so bad now a days.  I especially frustrated how the front desk deal with the situation when I had issues with the rooms.
Original when we check in, we were placed in the lowest possible floor with a shxitty bath room that is worst than my own house (and I am suppose to be there for a  vacation), we upgraded our room for $20\/nite for a higher level with a bigger bath room, the room is pretty much the same but it had the stand up shower, which is where the whole mess starts.  We played all night after checking  in until noon, went backup to the room, was going to take a shower and rest up, only to find that the shower head was stuck to an angle that water will keep shooting my face and it is not adjustable, and the whole water pipe chock and shake.  We did not feel comfortable with it and requested for someone to come up to look at it and they said they will send someone up right away. I called back since no one show up after 20 min, they told me that I will just have to wait because the tech guy maybe busy and I explained my situation and pushed her to get a ETA for about another 15min.  I then waited for another 30min and called back.  I don't know if it was just the coincidence (you be the judge), after I identify myself to the front desk and I am starting to get frustrated about the situation, I was being hung up.  I called back 4 times, every time I heard someone picked up the phone and just hung up.  At the 5th try, finally someone picked up the phone with greeting but did not give me her name (they usually would tell you their name in the greeting).  I asked to talk to a super visor and I was put on hold for another 10-15min.  The original gal that I spoke with then picked up the phone and told me she talked to the manager and there is nothing they can do about it but only waiving my upgrade fee and give me a pass down to the salon and take a shower.  I was really getting shocked at this point (partially because I didn't not have sleep the whole night),  I rejected her offer and requested to have a room change because its not convenient and odd for both my wife and I to go down to just take a shower and the salon.  I then talked to the manager and he is just repeating what the original gal said without a sign of trying to resolve the issue.  They just keep telling me nothing they can do about it, the only additional option he offered was downgrade me back to the lowest level room.  He mentioned about they had already waived my upgrade fee sounded it like I cant afford that $20,  He kept telling me that there is no room available and nothing they can do about it.  Instead of them trying to solve the problem, I have to suggest options to switch to another MGM resort on the strip if they are out of room, I then was on hold for another 15min and he came back to mentioned that everything is sold out.  Honestly, that is totally BS.  hotel always have room on reserve for situation like this and even tho it is all booked, you can still switch me out, and have someone look at the room (if no one can come up right away), and used it for the next guest.  With more than 1.5 hour wait for the whole situation, he then came back and told me they actually have a room all cleaned and available to switch me out.  
Even after I switched out to the new room, the shower head direction was still the same, at least the pipe didn't keep chocking like the original room.  (But the entrance light gets can't stay on and the shower door can't be fully shut) but I did not want to waste the time anymore to deal with them. The whole situation made my anniversary very unpleasant.

if you are just looking for a place to stay and not going to be in the room much and don't mind the water keep shooting your face then my complaint will not be your concern.  Other wise I would stay out staying here.  

** The lowest you can get the shower head to is that the water would be jetting out water to the top half of the glass of the shower stall.  I have to basically stick to the glass and wall in order to take my shower (I am 5'8).

This time I was kind of worried because it was my first time to visit Vegas with a kid, but actually we enjoyed it.  I chose Mirage.  They have small amusement places for children, and mine really loved them, entrance fee was about $40 per person though.
It's convenient to go shopping and dinner.  We enjoyed shows on Strip too.  We added buffet breakfast at Mirage without extra charge on Expedia.  You can find the deal sometimes.  There were variety of foods such as Asian, American, and Mexican and tiny desserts were also enjoyable for small children.   
They allowed us to check out at noon because my child started napping in the room. If you go to Vegas with kids because they're excited to ride on an airplane like mine, I recommend Mirage.

Perks: 
1) Great entertainment. (Jet, Revolution, Love) And we got to do it all for free since we're ladies.  I definitely recommend getting the free PINK vodka drinks.  They are tasty and give a shot of caffeine so you can hang with the Vegas crowd.
2) Well decorated room.  We stayed in a suite for a bachelorette party and it was 3 times the size of my apartment, I wish I could move in forever.  The decor was modern and clean.  Very nice.

1) It stank.  The air was not clean smelling like the Bellagio's air.  It had a mildewy stench I blamed on the construction.  It was really bad in the room area.  Seriously, I wanted to upchuck every time I went back upstairs.  And it wasn't all the PINK vodkas either.

I have stayed at the Mirage once a year for up to a week for over 20 years. They do a good job keeping up the hotel, adding modern elements, refreshing the decor.

The rooms are standard sized and the beds are soft and comfortable. Bathrooms feature marble counters and tiles but the shower\/tub is standard to any mid-level hotel (and can show their age). There is a useful desk with outlets, a nice love seat for relaxing (not at the desk) and plenty of drawers for storage.

Overall, it's a nice hotel and I enjoy staying there when I need to be mid-Strip.

There are some areas where the Mirage falls short. Lines for check in and check out can be ridiculously long and most of the clerks at the desk seem like they hate their job. Most of the restaurants are overpriced. There are virtually no options (other than leaving the hotel) if you want to eat breakfast before midday.

I took the room through my usual hotel loyalty program and feel disappointed. (Hyatt - we will be having words about this). Nothing about this place is ""luxurious"" or anything like the idea it attempts to project. It's incredibly crowded - a total barn - full of people meandering through the mazelike lobby. Like all MGM hotels, you need a map to get to the guest elevators - (through the gaming floor of course) - so unnecessarily Vegas. Like the first thing I want to experience in a $300 hotel room is the ceaseless ding of slot machines and the second hand cigar smoke of some idiot living out his high roller fantasy.

Niiiice.

I had to park in the oversize lot - (the self parking is only 6'10"" high) - took multiple trips to get a ""pass"" and then waited in 106 degree heat for a shuttle (yes it was that far away).

My first room smelt of smoke doused with deodorizer to ""mask"" the smell. (Tip for hotels - it doesn't) Its on the second floor with a view of the vast expanse of roof that apparently covers the acres of gaming tables -  and various air conditioning units. (This is a little north of three hundred bucks for the room as a reminder).

If I want a nice view of a warehouse roof I can stay in south LA.

Changed rooms - now I have a view of the mountains and a higher view of the roofs. 

I have been at The Mirage for about an hour and a half by this stage.

The rooms have very low ceilings, and while they try to look updated, they also seem tired. Like a motel room with nicer curtains (to disguise the peeling paint on the window) and sateen bolsters on the beds. I can touch the ceiling with my feet on the ground in the bedroom area - and its a good 9"" taller than the tiled area in front of the bathroom. For a Vegas hotel - tiny bathrooms and again no feeling of space or luxury - too much caulk and dirt in the grout. To be precise - I can't fit two fingers sideways between the door as it opens and the toilet - that's cramped.

I thought the pool would be nice and spacious form the website. What was I thinking? The whole area is just a disaster - a tepid waist deep blob of chlorine surrounded by sunbeds wedged together allowing a thin area on the perimeter for circulation. At 5pm it was packed with wet sloppy towels ( are those beds occupied or abandoned?) and the ceaseless thump of Ibiza dance mixes of top 40 tracks through the landscaping lends a feel of imagined glamour to the younger people there. I say imagined because this place feels more like a Walmart than a Mediterranean island.

Nothing about this place is exciting or glamorous. It's an incredibly crowded expanse of hideousness. People stand in long lines to eat buffet dinners or hamburgers. If you want a clear litmus, they dispense yard glasses of frozen cocktails INSIDE the hotel. Classy. I guess someone in food and beverage looked at the tacky action on the strip and thought ""why don't we offer that inside?"" So there you go. There will be a higher percentage of people guzzling giant frozen alcosodas than almost any other hotel you can stay at. 

This place is a relic - run by a corporation from a spreadsheet. I hate it, but there are clearly enough people who think this is a fine time. Good luck to them.

Since I am an M Life Member and they had an interesting offer, I decided to try it since we were coming out for the Journey concert at The Joint.  The location is great.  It's within walking distance of the Venetian, shops and other attractions like Linq.  You would need to take a taxi though if you are looking to go to say the Bellagio and are dressed up for the evening because it's more of a hike to those hotels.  

I was actually pleasantly surprised at the rooms at the hotel.  The rooms were clean, spacious and I thought were more than adequate for your typical Las Vegas room.  I have been in the casino and the hotel several times so I was familiar with the layout although it's irritating that you have to navigate the entire casino to get to your room elevators.  For comparison purposes, I like the Cosmopolitan better in that regard because they completely separate the two entities. 

Room service is where this hotel really shines in my opinion.  I thought the quality was excellent and there was enough food to feed a small army which anyone who has experienced the typical ""Midget-sized,"" plates at some hotels would appreciate.  They also comped some of the things we purchased due to our M-Life status which was nice.  The staff were courteous and very engaging as well.  

I would most likely stay here again.",3,0,0

Lovely Décor, lovely staff, lovely rooms.

The hotel is pretty central to the strip.


I stayed in a Tower Suite for my 21st birthday.

The bed linens were divine my boyfriend and I could hardly get out of bed.

There is an awesome whirlpool spa big enough for two and plenty of really nice bathroom amenities.

There was a great big plasma TV ( with nothing to watch, but why watch TV? You're in Vegas)

And an clock radio that you can plug your iPOD into that give pretty good sound, which was a nice touch.

The cleaning ladies are very very nice and helpful.

The concierge I got was wonderful too, she sent me up a free bottle of champagne for my birthday!

For some reason tough the check in and check out lines are horribly long, they're always at least a 20 min wait.

Oh and the pool is pretty nice with plenty of room and a pretty rock formation in the middle. the music SUCKS though, it was all Journey and Uncle Kracker. ugh. I bet it was for all the pasty jiggle Midwestern tourists.

We ended up upgrading our room for $20 per night, as it was a considerably bigger room and bathroom, with a view of the strip and the volcano, which erupts every hour.

PROS: Our check in went smoothly and the desk agent, Arthur, was great. Room was a decent size and clean. Check out was very fast

CONS:  Room was very hot and humid and remained so for our entire stay. About half of our lights worked and the wIfi wouldn't connect. After calling the front desk 3 times for help with the wifi, we finally got it working but it was awfully slow and kept disconnecting. BLT double charged my card for a meal we ate and I'm still waiting for my refund. The tram was out of service our entire stay. Our television didn't work and our hallway was littered with the same wine glasses and room service trays for 3 days even though housekeeping passed by them daily

Now, here's the absolute worst part of our stay.......the cocktail service is HORRENDOUS!! We played the big wheel for over 45 minutes one evening without receiving one beverage. Every time we saw a server and tried to ask for a drink, we were told it wasn't her section and they would send someone which never happened.

Oddly, the windows in the rooms open outwards at an angle, just a little. There's not a lot of fresh air in Vegas, and opening the window basically lets in the stink of the strip. The Mirage was one of the first 'mega resorts' in Las Vegas. Now, it's been truly overshadowed by the much larger resorts popping up all around it.

They have been loyal Mirage customers for over 20 years.  When we were kids, we would go to Vegas every other month.  Now that my parents are in their mid-to-late 60s, we travel there just once a year for Christmas.  It's a trip our entire family looks forward to.  My father suffered a stroke almost 8 years ago which has left him paralyzed on the left side of his body.  Christmas at the Mirage is an opportunity to do what my parents love to do...gamble.  But also it's not just the gambling that makes us return year after year.  It's the same dealers and pit bosses that remember my parents each and every year and make their trip such a wonderful experience.  For my father who is at home all the time, it's an opportunity for him to catch up and joke with the dealers and pit bosses he's known for years.  
What has been so disheartening in our last trip for Christmas, is the way the Mirage has treated my parents after all these years.  My father called Himler Audisho, their Casino host, in November to make our annual Christmas arrangements.  Himler agreed to comp our rooms and do RFB on one of the rooms as usual.  This is what the Mirage has done every time my parents have gone to the hotel.  Upon arrival after a 5 hour car journey on Christmas Eve, my family was informed the rating system had changed in the last few weeks and everything that had been promised by Himler and the Mirage was rescinded.  

Himler nor anyone at Mirage had the courtesy to call my parents to let them know this in advance.  This is the news we were greeted with on Christmas Eve, after a 5 hour journey which isn't easy for my father who is wheel chair bound and needs assistance.  Instead of allowing Mirage to ruin our holiday, we decided to stay. Himler had advised that my parents that they just needed to play a certain amount of time and bet a certain amount in order to get what Mirage had originally promised us in the first place.  My mother did this.  Yet upon checkout, Himler nor his boss, Luke Trusty, would honor what they had agreed to.  My sister and I went to go settle the bill and were handed a bill with a certain amount.  My sister just asked the girl checking us out, Alexandria, if she could double check what Luke had promised was correct.  Then we were handed a bill with a $200 increase and were told they had made a mistake and that we actually owed more.  All we asked, is they honor the original bill given to us.  Luke Trusty, Himler Audisho, and the Mirage would rather lose a customer of over 20 years not honoring what they originally agreed to and then hiking up our bill on a mistake they had made.  

Thank you Mirage for ruining our Christmas.  It was one of the things my parents really look forward to each year.   You'll be happy to know we're moving to the Wynn next year.

From the outside, it looks like we've got a pretty good deal. First upside? FREE PARKING for hotel guests. Who does that?!?! and in Vegas? I don't know how the other hotels are, but this made me happy. 

Check in on a Thursday around 5 was FAST. 
First downside? We were on the 21st floor, and our elevators were in the middle of the casino. We had to walk a good 10 minutes before we got to our elevator. And the signs aren't much help, especially when you've got all this luggage in hand! Biggest irritation of the weekend. I don't have a problem with walking by slot machines or smoke, but all this for 10  minutes to get to my elevator? Never again. If after reading this you agree with me, start reviewing other hotels. It doesn't get much better once you know where to go. 
Elevators were quick though, in case you do come here!
Now the rooms aren't anything amazing. 2 beds for 4 people on the 21st floor, room 51. Be warned you can't take anything out of the fridge or put anything in because they measure everything by weight! So if it's +\/-, you'll get charged. Also be warned...there is no microwave for your use anywhere in the hotel....apparently that's a ""fire hazard"" to have one for the patron's use. I call it a bluff. 

Onto the room's restroom....disappointment. It looked dirty to begin with, and that's because it's just plain old and cheap. The tub had something plastered on to it....I'm not good with names but I'm sure it's to prevent slippage. That thing gets unstuck from the tub floor when the water starts to run. Oh, and the water doesn't run down the drain smoothly and quickly. So after about 10-15 min, you're standing up to your ankles in water. GROSS. Then the toilet doesn't flush anywhere. You either need to hold it down for a long time or flush it multiple times. At some points, I thought it was going to clog up on me. Next the counter space....TINY! It's like the size of my sink in my personal bathroom. Even if 2 people were meant for that room, I don't think that sink would have been very comfortable. 
Restrooms are important for me, especially in hotels. I like them clean and comfy. 
Beds were comfy, room was never too hot or too cold. 
The biggest complaints were about the elevator location and the restroom, oh and the fridge\/microwave (we had leftovers that we wanted to eat, but they had to be tossed instead)

In the main floor you have CPK, Starbucks, and lots of other places to eat. The Mirage is close to Treasure Island, the Venetian and Ceasar's Palace. Overall, the location was convenient. But I won't be back.

When I called to dispute they wanted nothing to do with me.  I also wish they had more servers around the pool and that the tasty frozen drinks weren't $16-$20.  I paid the price, though, so I guess I'm not that thrifty.

I'll probably stay here again since all the rooms should be remodeled by the end of the summer.  I wish the volcano was working, but again, it should be the next time I visit.",3,0,0

It's not too long of a walk from rooms to convention center which was prefect for this event; they had pretty good food. The rooms were a little old with some rust in the shower but the price was right with real comfortable beds. 

Plenty of tables, mostly friendly dealers and staff.  It was everything you'd expect for a hotel at this price.",0,0,0

The staff was nice upon check in and they upgraded us to a strip view room! Woo! Everyone loves getting upgrades. Check in was quick and there was no line. We were there before check in time, so they said they would text us when our room was ready which we thought was cool. But we never got the text! Around 2\/3 we called the hotel and asked if our room was ready and they said it was and they were sorry we didn't get the text. So I'm not sure if that texting thing happens all the time or if it was just with us. But either way we weren't too happy with that. 

The rooms are nice. I love the headboard on the bed and I love the theme! The bed was super comfortable and I loved the pillows. The bathroom was your typical hotel bathroom. It wasn't huge but it was a decent size. There was only two of us staying in the room, so we didn't have too much to worry about anyway with placing things in the bathroom. 

Love the garden. It's nice to walk through and it's a nice touch to have some green in the hotel. I didn't really gamble but the casino was pretty big. It took a while to walk to the elevators for our rooms. 

I'd recommend trying this hotel out. It's nice and pretty decent priced.",4,1,0

My boyfriend and I stayed here earlier this month for a couple of days and we found the Mirage to be the best on the strip when it comes to location, food, the casino, ect. This place is beautiful. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted with beautiful plant life and fresh air as opposed to most casinos usual greeting of cigarette smoke clouding the air. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a tower room with a great view of the strip and pool. The pool was gorgeous as well and we loved the waterfall. We ate at the buffet here as well and it was delicious with unlimited beer and wine (can't beat that). We had no trouble getting drinks inside the casino but we did find it was easiest when sitting at a slot machine by the buffet. The air conditioning in the halls to the room is so so so cold but I was totally fine with it since it's so so so hot outside. I will definitely be coming back. The mirage has me as a permanent regular visitor. It was fantastic!",0,0,0
